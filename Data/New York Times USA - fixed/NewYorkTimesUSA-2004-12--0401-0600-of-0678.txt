HEADLINE: M.T.A. Raising Fares and Tolls In Early March

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Andy Newman and Janon Fisher contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a plan for fare increases and service changes yesterday that will raise the price of a monthly fare card by $6, to $76, early next year, increase suburban rail fares an average of 5 percent and close 164 station booths throughout the subway system.
 The vote, coming just 19 months after the last fare increase, is expected to raise $234 million next year, but board members glumly conceded that their action would not solve the authority's grave fiscal problems, which include rising debt service, looming operating deficits and a five-year, $17 billion capital plan that no one has agreed to pay for. Most of the changes will take effect in early March.
 Without debate or comment, the authority's board voted to raise the price of a 30-day MetroCard from $70, a 9 percent increase, and that of a weekly card to $24 from $21, a 14 percent increase. The base fare for single rides on subways and local buses, which rose to $2 from $1.50 last year, is unchanged, and riders will still be able to buy six rides for $10, which will be the most economical purchase for a commuter who uses the transit system just 10 times a week [Page B13]. 
 Fares on interborough express buses were raised to $5 from $4, a 25 percent increase. Fares on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad were raised up to 15 percent, but commuters will see a 5 percent increase on average. Tolls on the agency's bridges and tunnels were increased by 25 or 50 cents.
 The vote, at the end of the subway system's centennial year, could begin a new era of fare increases that are both more frequent and more incremental.
 From the subway's inception in 1904, the fare was tied to the price of a token, which was gradually replaced by the MetroCard starting in 1994. One result of that change has been a far more complex fare structure, with unlimited-use fare cards good for one, 7 and 30 days and discounts on regular-card purchases of $10 or more.
 The authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, said he anticipated future increases every four years beginning in 2007, with ''minor adjustments'' in selected fares and tolls every two years.
 The authority's average revenue for each subway or local bus ride, officials said, will rise only to $1.33 from $1.27 -- still lower than the average fare of $1.38 in 1996, before use of the MetroCard became prevalent. 
 Such arguments were unpersuasive to the 29 speakers -- among them a state senator, an assemblywoman and two City Council members -- who stood before a lectern in a crowded meeting room at the authority's Midtown headquarters to register their opinions before the vote. Some used props, including a train whistle and a cellphone, while others carried signs denouncing Gov. George E. Pataki, the official with the most influence over the authority. 
 ''It takes a lot of chutzpah to do what you are doing,'' said Adele Bender, an advocate for elderly Queens residents at the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged, while waving a finger at the board. A rider advocate and former board member, Beverly L. Dolinsky, told the board members that their actions were inadequate and misguided.
 ''What you are doing is trying to fill a gaping chasm with a grain of sand,'' said Ms. Dolinsky, the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the authority. ''You cannot raise fares enough or cut service enough to even begin to address future deficits or meet future capital investment needs.'' 
 She called for a restoration of state and city transit subsidies that have been sharply reduced over the last decade. ''The governor and mayor know very well that operating this system with inadequate state and local support in the past has put the M.T.A. in its current financial straits,'' she said. 
 Henry J. Stern, a former commissioner of the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, said the reduction in the unlimited-ride discounts could lead riders to conclude that they should ride less frequently and stop using the unlimited-ride cards altogether. 
 ''The fare increase will be necessary at some time, but it should be part of a package and it should be accompanied by internal savings as well to make it credible,'' Mr. Stern said. ''The way it is now, the riders are the only ones at this time being asked to assume a greater burden, and you may not get much out of them.'' 
 Over objections from the city's major transit union, the board voted to reassign clerks at 49 full-time and 115 part-time station booths to walk on the subway platforms as customer-service agents. Managers had argued that the elimination of tokens last year made the booths obsolete. The board also agreed to allow the authority to run buses less frequently during off-peak hours.
 Of the board's 17 voting members, only the four representatives of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg voted against the fare increases and service changes. One of them, Mark Page, the director of the mayor's Office of Management and Budget, said the Bloomberg administration believed the authority had not done all it could to find internal savings. 
 ''Clearly, efficiencies alone aren't going to meet the capital financing needs for mass transit in New York City,'' Mr. Page said. ''But when you're seeking a unified plan, which requires other parties to find resources, you need to demonstrate that you're doing all you can in your own operation. The mayor feels that there's more to be done at the M.T.A.''
 Other politicians criticized the board's vote. 
 The state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, called the fare increase shortsighted. ''Raising fares and cutting services is a one-year solution to the M.T.A.'s long-term budget problems,'' Mr. Hevesi said, adding that the authority must reduce waste before ''asking for larger sacrifices'' from taxpayers and commuters.
 The city's public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, noted that top executives at the authority had been given substantial raises. The board's members ''should not be raising the fare under any circumstances, particularly when you consider the fact that they have not put their own house in order,'' Ms. Gotbaum said at a news conference organized by the union. 
 Mr. Kalikow described the decision as painful but necessary. ''I don't want you to think by any stretch of the imagination that that was something pleasant for any of the board members to do,'' he said, adding, ''There is no bloated M.T.A. bureaucracy.'' 
 The authority's financial troubles are far from over. The authority is estimating a $586 million operating deficit in 2006, rising to $988 million in 2008. That projection assumes the success of cost-cutting measures as well as a $240 million fare increase in 2007.
 Fueling the looming deficits are rising energy, health care, insurance and pension costs, as well as the rapidly rising expense of providing paratransit services to disabled riders. But the greatest source of pressure on the agency's budget is debt service on a wave of construction bonds that were issued in the late 1990's, before Mr. Kalikow and the authority's executive director, Katherine N. Lapp, took office. Total debt service is expected to rise from $856 million this year to $1.6 billion in 2008. 
 The authority is projecting a net surplus of $466 million this year, however, and has set aside $240 million as a ''rainy day'' reserve. Opponents of the fare increase conceded the severity of the authority's financial problems, but seized upon the projected surplus to argue that the fare rise should be delayed as long as possible.
 Meanwhile, officials from the transit union, Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union of America, hinted at a bitter fight over wages when its contract expires in December 2005. 
 ''There is no crisis in operating costs in New York City Transit,'' the union's president, Roger Toussaint, told the board. ''We do not provide too much service, and it does not cost too much to provide it. The crisis is that one out of every seven dollars coming in at the farebox is siphoned off to service debt.'' 
 Commuters interviewed at Grand Central Terminal were not pleased by the increase. ''It's going to make life difficult, especially for students,'' said Jonas Westover, 29, a graduate student in musicology who takes the subway from Astoria, Queens. 
 ''It's too much for us poor people,'' said Doreen Crownie, 50, a nanny who lives in Jamaica, Queens, and travels to Bronxville, in Westchester County, using the subway and Metro-North. To save on her commuting, Ms. Crownie said, she has begun staying overnight with the family that employs her. ''I would say to the M.T.A. that I'd like to see my family more,'' she said.

HEADLINE: City Helped By Wall St. And Tourism

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The New York City economy is rebounding sharply, thanks in part to better times on Wall Street and a surge in spending by foreign tourists taking advantage of the weak dollar, economists said yesterday. Newly released unemployment figures for November showed the sharpest year-to-year improvement on record.
 ''The recovery of New York City is gathering strength as unemployment continues to plummet,'' said Stephen Kagann, the state's chief economist. ''All five boroughs shared in the improvement,'' he said. 
 The unemployment figures, released yesterday by the state's Department of Labor, showed a rate for the city in November of 5.4 percent, down from 6.1 percent in October and 8 percent in November 2003.
 The jobless rate for the state also improved, but less sharply. It stood at 4.9 percent in November, down from 5.2 percent in October and 6.3 percent in November 2003.
 Economists are quick to point out that the unemployment rate is an imprecise measure of economic performance, since it takes into account only those who are actively looking for work. At times of economic despair, many people simply stop looking for jobs, and are left uncounted.
 But Mr. Kagann said yesterday that the figures for November were particularly encouraging, for both the city and state, because they come after months of improvement that could only have lured frustrated job seekers back into the market.
 ''The labor force is expanding, employment is growing, and unemployment is in absolute decline,'' Mr. Kagann said. Unemployment rates for the city have been kept only since 1978, he said, and no 12-month period had shown as steep a decline as the one recorded in November.
 Michael Dolfman, the New York regional commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the city's November unemployment rate was also remarkable because, at 5.4 percent, it was the same as the rate for the nation. Historically, in good times and bad, unemployment in the city has tended to be higher, in part because of its large immigrant population and paltry supply of jobs for teenagers.
 ''We have an indigenous population that is simply unemployed,'' Mr. Dolfman said. Now, ''even though one month doesn't make a trend,'' he said, ''there is strong evidence of an economic recovery.''
 An analysis yesterday by the city comptroller, William C. Thompson, found that November unemployment was the lowest since July 2001, and that it had been 16 years since the city's rate matched that of the nation.
 Among the five bureaus, according to Mr. Thompson's report, Queens had the lowest unemployment rate -- 4.4 percent -- in November. It was followed by Staten Island, with 4.7 percent; Manhattan, 5.2 percent; Brooklyn, 6 percent; and the Bronx, 7.2 percent.
 Economists have long held that the high salaries on Wall Street are among the biggest, and the most volatile, engines of employment in the city, and Mr. Kagann said yesterday that Wall Street was playing a central role in the current surge.
 Although employment at banks and brokerage firms is not rising rapidly, he said, salaries and bonuses are. ''Wall Street spends more money than other sectors, including on temporary workers,'' he said, while the spillover is benefiting sales of luxury goods, restaurants, Broadway attendance and other parts of the economy.
 Many of the same businesses are getting a boost from foreign tourists, who are finding that the favorable exchange rates for their currencies makes New York a bargain.
 ''They are coming in large numbers, and spending a lot,'' Mr. Dolfman said.

HEADLINE: New Las Vegas Game: 2 BR's, Strip Vu

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
WHO needs a $1,000-a-night suite at the Bellagio, Carl Falcone wondered, when you can lounge in your own 3,000-square-foot penthouse on the Las Vegas Strip, complete with 24-hour concierge, a chauffeured limousine and your own custom-designed bed?
 And if that weren't enough, Dr. Falcone, a 49-year-old physician from Omaha, led a visitor to his terrace, 34 stories above the din of slot machines and strobing neon. As the sun dipped below the half-scale Eiffel Tower on a recent Tuesday night, the Strip sparkled like a gold necklace studded with gem-encrusted casinos, remote but also conveniently close. ''See this?'' he asked. ''We can go out anytime we want.''
 In the biggest trend to hit Las Vegas since the megaresort casino, a forest of high-rise condominiums is sprouting up and down the Strip, bringing Viking stovetops and Sub-Zero fridges to a boulevard once limited to all-you-can-eat buffets and room-service trolleys. And gambling is rarely the draw. ''The restaurants are excellent, and there's a very active nightlife,'' said Dr. Falcone, who is partial to Studio 54 at the MGM Grand on weekends. ''As you live here, gambling is something you don't even think about.'' 
 Some 30 condo projects have been proposed along the Strip corridor, some as tall as 73 stories, threatening to overpower the Stratosphere Tower and redraw the casino-built skyline with privately owned aeries.
 Early sales indicate that about half the condo units have been bought as vacation homes, many by snowbirds like Dr. Falcone and his wife, Lezlie, who wanted a milder climate for the winter, but found the enclaves of Florida and Arizona too anemic for their young-at-heart lifestyle.
 TO some people, owning a pricey home smack in the middle of the world's largest casino district sounds a bit bizarre. ''When I first heard about the condos going up, I scratched my head and wondered why people would want to live there,'' said Bill Eadington, an economics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno and director of its Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming. ''It's not a long-term environment. People stay here for three to four days. It's a fantasy land like Disney World, and who wants to live in Disney World?''
 Apparently, many people do want to live in Las Vegas. It has, they note, evolved far beyond gambling and showgirls, to include fine restaurants, high-end shopping and even touches of high-brow culture. Locals are calling it the Manhattanization of Las Vegas. But a more fitting term may be the South Beachification of the Strip.
 ''The Strip is our beach,'' said Andrew Sasson, 34, a former nightclub bouncer from South Beach turned entrepreneur, who is developing the Panorama Towers, a twin-tower, 33-story glass complex behind the Bellagio. ''In Miami, you want the oceanfront. In Vegas, you want access to the Strip, proximity to the Strip and, of course, a view of the Strip.''
 And like Miami, Las Vegas is attracting the affluent young -- the glitterati from Hollywood, the whiz kids from Silicon Valley, the wheeler-dealers from Wall Street -- with its night life. Sure, the MTV ''Real World'' Suite at the Palms Casino Hotel is nice, but how about your own permanent party pad? The thought seems to have occurred to Leonardo DiCaprio, who recently bought two adjacent units on the 26th floor of the Panorama for $1.5 million, and plans to combine them into a 3,300-square-foot perch. Construction of the building is expected to begin in February.
 ''This is where the action is,'' said Carlos Gutierrez, 35, a future neighbor of Mr. DiCaprio and a radio marketer from San Diego. He was having cocktails at the members-only Foundation Room at Mandalay Bay with two young women he had recently met. ''It's just a really hip vibe. Also, how cool would it be to have a place where I can invite my buddies or my girlfriends?''
 Developers on the Strip credit the start of the high-rise explosion to Turnberry Place, three nondescript 40-story condo buildings that opened in 2001 near the north end of the Strip on Paradise Road. The project was met with deep skepticism, but that evaporated when half the first tower's 184 units sold in 30 days to people like the Falcones, at prices from $400,000 to $4.5 million. An untapped jackpot had been struck.
 ''Las Vegas had nothing for second-home owners,'' said Jeffrey Soffer, the principal at Turnberry Associates, a developer based in Florida best known for transforming a swamp near Miami into the planned city of Aventura. Mr. Soffer is now building a fourth tower at Turnberry Place, bringing the total number of residences to 800. Only 20 remain to be sold. ''We're not just selling an apartment; we're selling a lifestyle,'' he said.
 That lifestyle apparently entitles you to an imposing wrought-iron security gate, Jacuzzis, Gaggenau dishwashers and floor-to-ceiling glass walls that open to balconies with panoramic views. Then there are the perks not found in your typical vacation home: a 24-hour valet and concierge who can round up last-minute dinner reservations, a business center with on-call secretaries, and an 80,000-square-foot clubhouse, styled in the image of a Mediterranean villa, with three restaurants, a swimming pool, a hair salon, gym and 14 massage rooms.
 ''It's the best thing I've ever bought in my life,'' said Danny Yerushalmi, 70, a clothing retailer from Roslyn Heights, N.Y., who has a two-bedroom apartment on the 18th floor, sparsely decorated with black leather couches and a glass dinner table. A frequent visitor to Las Vegas, he used to hop from the Bellagio to the Aladdin and back. ''Now it's just one call to the concierge,'' he said, ''and a limo picks us up at the airport.''
 Like any get-rich idea in Las Vegas, the condo formula has spread like the latest poker tip. All along the Strip, billboards promoting the newest in high-rise living seem to be going up wherever an empty parcel sits. Most are followed by million-dollar showrooms, outfitted with numbingly homogeneous displays of granite countertops, stainless-steel appliances, gold faucets and pearly marble baths.
 There are the Panorama, Metropolis, Sky Las Vegas, Aqua Blue, Krystal Sands, Vegas Grand and Liberty Towers, to name a few. Real estate agents are having a hard time keeping track. Even Donald J. Trump is getting into the act with a 64-story condominium hotel proposed for a parking lot behind the New Frontier Hotel and Gaming Hall. ''I'm doing the tallest building in Las Vegas,'' said Mr. Trump, never one to shy away from superlatives. He plans to start sales this month. ''I don't think we'll need to do any promotion. The name Trump is very hot right now.''
 To date, however, only two condominium complexes are actually up: the Turnberry and Park Towers, a pair of 20-story buildings two blocks east of the Strip on Hughes Center Drive. The Metropolis, which overlooks the old Desert Inn golf course, recently topped out at 20 stories and expects to open next summer. Ground has yet to be broken for any of the others. By one estimate, more than 20,000 condo units have been proposed, from cozy one-bedrooms at $200,000 to palatial penthouses starting at $3 million. Some observers are wondering if developers aren't betting the farm.
 ''I suspect that the majority will not pass the test for success,'' said Irvin Molasky, a longtime local developer who built Park Towers with the backing of Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas impresario. ''The market will probably support 2,000 to 3,000 units.''
 Even so, that would give rise to as many as a dozen condo towers, and more could come if the Strip continues its frenetic transformation. Sin City, after all, has outgrown its nickname and, in style and sophistication, is increasingly lumped with New York, Los Angeles and Miami.
 The $9.99 buffet has been replaced by star chefs and $60 hamburgers. Souvenir shops like Bonanza are being priced out by Neiman Marcus and Harry Winston. Serious art hangs on casino walls, and the number of theatrical productions rivals Broadway's; ''Avenue Q'' is skipping the national circuit to go to Las Vegas, and one London West End musical even bypassed Times Square to open there. Meanwhile, celebrities like Britney Spears and Colin Farrell are flocking to Las Vegas nightclubs at levels not seen since the days of the Rat Pack.
 Any doubts about the vertical boom were erased last month when MGM Mirage, which owns 11 casinos, announced its own condominium plans. Before, high-rise proposals had all been hatched by smaller, private companies. Under the MGM Mirage $4 billion master plan, some 1,650 luxury condos will be built in the heart of the Strip, between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo hotels. It is a new direction for a corporation built on slot machines. 
 ''What we want is an urban environment with pedestrian walkways and residences on top of retail shops and restaurants,'' said Alan Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Mirage. The 66-acre site, he noted, is roughly the size of Times Square, Rockefeller Center and SoHo combined ''Before, you were either a residential builder or in the gaming industry,'' he said. ''There was no overlap. That has all changed. This is being defined as a real estate investment rather than a gaming investment.''
 Las Vegas experts are already calling this a pivotal moment in the city's history. ''This is the next big step in how Las Vegas evolves,'' said Mr. Eadington, the economics professor. ''My guess is that it's going to be a very successful gamble.''
 But gambling, of course, is no longer the sole reason for visiting Las Vegas. ''The restaurants, the shows, the nightlife, the people watching -- that's why I go there,'' said Don Roden, 58, a retired pharmaceutical executive who has a farmhouse in Virginia, a pied-a-terre in Greenwich Village and now a sumptuously furnished condominium at Park Towers. ''There is a certain electricity there you won't find anywhere else.''

HEADLINE: Bottom Line at Fannie Mae: Looking Safe vs. Being Safe

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Fannie Mae wanted to look very safe, but to do that it cut accounting corners, two regulatory agencies have now concluded. And that has severely damaged the image of the company and its management.
 The management of Fannie Mae had agreed to change its accounting as a result of harsh criticism levied in September by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, its regulator. But the company, in a highly unusual move, asked Donald T. Nicolaisen, the chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to rule that it had acted reasonably in the past. 
 On Wednesday night, he instead concluded that the accounting was wrong, making it all but certain that Fannie Mae will have to restate its financial reports for recent years, reducing its profits by billions. Yesterday, Fannie Mae stock fell $1.39, to $69.30, amid speculation that Franklin D. Raines, the chief executive, would be forced to resign.
 At the heart of Fannie Mae's problem is that it is in a very volatile business. That volatility is produced by the fact that mortgages in the United States usually come with an option that benefits the borrower. The option allows the borrower to repay the loan, often without penalty, at any time.
 That means that prepayments of mortgages are likely to accelerate when interest rates fall, as borrowers refinance, and to slow sharply when rates rise. (Some loans will be paid early in any case, because mortgages normally are paid when a homeowner sells the home.)
 That volatility does not mean that the mortgage business is a bad one. But Fannie Mae believed that it needed to report steady earnings increases to persuade investors that it was a safe enterprise that deserved a low cost of capital. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight report concluded that it violated accounting rules to produce the desired smooth numbers.
 Armando Falcon Jr., the director of Ofheo, testified to Congress that the company engaged in a ''pervasive and willful misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles.''
 The accounting issues confronting Fannie Mae concerned two accounting rules. Neither is simple, and results from both can be changed if the company changes its assumptions. But the fact that a range of numbers might be appropriate did not give the company the right to pick numbers based on what figure would look best on its financial statements. Still, that is what the Ofheo report concluded happened.
 The first rule was Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 91, which took effect in 1988. Under that rule, when Fannie Mae purchased a loan it was to estimate the amount of expected prepayments and then treat the loan as having a constant yield over its expected life.
 But Fannie Mae was also expected to review those assumptions periodically and change them to reflect experience. Such changes could indicate that the company had reported too much or too little income in the past, and in such cases the extra income or expense was to be recognized immediately.
 In 1998, American interest rates plunged abruptly after Russia defaulted on some debts and investors sought safety. Mortgage prepayments soared, and that meant that Fannie had recorded too much interest income in the past, since it had assumed mortgages would remain outstanding for longer than they did. Fannie Mae should have taken a $400 million hit to profits, but instead it deferred half of it. That meant executives qualified for bonuses that would not have been paid had the full impact been taken.
 That was not an isolated occurrence, although it was the most dramatic, Mr. Falcon later said. ''Fannie Mae improperly delayed the recognition of income to create a cookie jar reserve that it could dip into whenever it best served the interests of senior management,'' he testified in a Congressional hearing in October. ''Those interests included smoothing earnings and meeting earnings-per-share targets linked to executive bonuses.''
 Much but not all of the accounting was approved by KPMG, Fannie Mae's auditor. It signed off on all the financial statements the company produced, but Mr. Falcon testified that KPMG recorded the 1998 dispute as ''an audit difference, a term which means KPMG disagreed with Fannie Mae.'' Presumably the auditor was persuaded that the $200 million difference was not material.
 The other rule important in the Fannie Mae case is Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 133, the rule on derivatives. That rule, which took effect in 2001, required that companies report changes in values of the derivatives they owned, and add or subtract them from profits.
 The rule provided a way to avoid that, called hedge accounting. If the company documented exactly what asset was being hedged by a derivative, then it could keep the change in value of the derivative off the income statement. That is what Fannie Mae said it did, but both Ofheo and the S.E.C. concluded that it had not complied with the rules. And if the rules were not met, that meant the changes should have been reported in income. For Fannie Mae, that is expected to produce losses of more than $9 billion when profits are restated.
 It is not clear how much of that could have been avoided had Fannie Mae followed the rules. It is also not clear how much of that write-off is real in the sense that it reflects an actual loss. 
 If the hedges in fact were good, even though they were not documented, that could provide a lift to future profits, because there will be no need to offset the realized profits from Fannie Mae's investments with the deferred losses from the derivatives.
 If that happens, and if Mr. Raines does leave, a result might be very good profits that would be reported by his successor.

HEADLINE: The Latest in a String of Setbacks for KPMG

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission's announcement on Wednesday night that Fannie Mae had violated accounting rules was the latest blow to the company, whose top executives had long maintained that its methods were in compliance. 
 But the announcement was also an embarrassment for the company's independent auditor, KPMG, which had raised questions about Fannie Mae's practices but continued to sign off on the company's statements. 
 The S.E.C.'s chief accountant found that Fannie Mae's accounting practices ''did not comply'' with two requirements for recording gains and losses on derivatives contracts, which the company used to hedge against the risk of interest rate swings. 
 While Fannie Mae said that it would comply with the S.E.C.'s decision, which could wipe out as much as $9 billion when it restates its earnings, the company's executives had previously argued that the accounting rules had room for a different interpretation and often consulted with KPMG when there was a concern about compliance.
 KPMG, which had previously stood by Fannie's financial results, said in a statement yesterday that it accepted the company's decision to follow the S.E.C.'s directions with respect to prior financial reports. The firm also said that it accepted the S.E.C.'s findings on a complex derivatives accounting rule, known as FAS 133, ''as the final arbiter of GAAP.'' 
 ''It should have a jarring effect on KPMG, but the quiet undertone shared by all of the Big Four accounting firms is, 'this too shall pass,''' said Allan D. Koltin, president of PDI Global Inc., a Chicago-based consultancy that works with many large accounting firms.
 The decision on Fannie Mae is the latest setback for the accounting firm. In recent years, KPMG has been at the center of several high-profile financial scandals and has settled a number of lawsuits without admitting wrongdoing. 
 In October, KPMG agreed to pay $10 million to settle S.E.C. charges that the firm and four of its accountants did not properly audit the financial statements of Gemstar-TV Guide International. 
 Earlier that month, KPMG's American and Belgian business units agreed to pay $115 million to settle shareholder claims of accounting malpractice that arose from the collapse of Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products, a Belgian speech-recognition software company. 
 Last year, KPMG paid more than $200 million to settle lawsuits stemming from its audits of Rite Aid and Oxford Health Plans. 
 The firm is also under investigation by a federal grand jury in Manhattan looking into the sale of tax shelters. And it remains entangled with the S.E.C. over Xerox, whose books it audited while executives there committed securities fraud.
 But the firm's swift action to dismiss partners and clean up practices in other cases has allowed it to survive, accounting analysts said. While the KPMG name may now be more frequently in the news, they said, its practices were in line with the rest of the industry during the late 1990's.
 ''If you look at all the instances of negative publicity and lawsuits, all of them are occurring for pre-Enron activity,'' said Arthur W. Bowman, the editor of an accounting industry newsletter. ''Today, KPMG would probably stand up and tell Fannie Mae you can't do that.''

HEADLINE: Assessing What Will Now Happen to Fannie Mae

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Gretchen Morgenson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the housing-finance giant, for years has fended off critics who contend that the company is too big, too powerful and too risky. But the Securities and Exchange Commission's Wednesday ruling, that Fannie Mae had seriously breached accounting rules, could touch off a chain reaction that results in stricter government controls, legislation limiting its growth and possibly even a change in top management. 
 Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike demanded on Thursday that senior executives, including the chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, return tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation that they had earned based on inaccurate financial statements that the company issued from 2001 until this year. 
 Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the S.E.C.'s order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9 billion as a result of the accounting violations. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers vowed to swiftly overhaul the oversight of the federally chartered company. 
 The board members concluded their unscheduled meeting early Thursday evening without deciding whether to keep or remove Mr. Raines after the announcement by the S.E.C.'s top accountant that the company had violated two rules. That decision will now force the company to restate its earnings and take steps to significantly raise its capital level. Three board members, joined by Mr. Raines and other regulators, had attended a briefing at the commission by its chief accountant on Wednesday shortly before he announced his decision, people at the meeting said.
 But people involved in the inquiry said that board members know that they cannot let the uncertainty hanging over Mr. Raines linger, for the sake of both the company and the markets, and predicted that a decision would be made soon.
 Fannie Mae, which for years has been one of the most formidable political forces in Washington, maintained a low public profile. The company declined to comment further about the findings of the S.E.C. staff or the remarks of lawmakers. Nor did it issue any statement in support of its senior management.
 In response to the findings of the commission, Democrats and Republicans called on Mr. Raines and other executives to return their bonuses.
 Over the last three years, Mr. Raines has made $14 million in salary and bonus and has taken home $25.6 million in incentive pay. As of the end of last year, he held options on 1.9 million shares of Fannie Mae stock, valued at almost $12 million. Fannie Mae also paid almost $200,000 for Mr. Raines's use of company transportation in 2003.
 Timothy Howard, the company's chief financial officer, made $4.3 million in salary and bonus over the last three years and received $7.4 million in incentive pay. At the end of last year, Mr. Howard held options on 607,699 shares with a value of $11.5 million. Fannie Mae's stock has fallen a bit since the end of 2003 when it was $75.06. Thursday the shares closed at $69.30, down $1.39. It is impossible to determine how many of the executives' options are exercisable at current prices.
 Securities lawyers said that it was murky whether a little-used provision of the landmark corporate law that Congress adopted after the scandals at Enron and other companies could force Mr. Raines and Mr. Howard to forfeit the bonuses and incentive pay they had received. 
 The provision, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, only appears to apply to Fannie Mae starting in 2003, when it first filed stock registration documents with the commission. The company, which as a Congressionally created organization enjoys benefits that other public companies do not have, including an implicit financial guarantee from the Treasury and an exemption from local taxes, is exempt from federal securities laws. It reached an agreement two years ago with the S.E.C. to voluntarily comply with securities rules beginning in 2003. Section 304, which has proven troublesome to apply because of its vagueness, also requires a finding of ''misconduct,'' which the commission has not made.
 That could change in coming months.
 Lawyers involved in the Fannie Mae investigation underway at the commission and at the Justice Department said that, now that the commission's chief accountant has ruled, the S.E.C. will focus more sharply on the reasons for the violations and the conduct of top executives. 
 Mr. Raines and other company officials have acknowledged that they approved of the accounting treatment of derivatives and loan prepayments that were the subject of the chief accountant's report. But they have also challenged the conclusions of another agency, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo. That agency precipitated the crisis at Fannie Mae when it found three months ago that Fannie Mae violated accounting rules as part of an effort to manipulate earnings and in at least one year, 1998, meet profit targets that would trigger larger bonuses for executives. 
 Although lawmakers stopped short of seeking the ouster of Mr. Raines and his top aides, some predicted their departure would likely be forced by the company's board.
 ''I think the board is well out front and ahead on that issue,'' said Representative Richard H. Baker, the Louisiana Republican who heads a subcommittee overseeing Fannie Mae. He said that as a result of the findings of the commission and Ofheo, ''I think we'll have legislation on the president's desk by summer time.''
 Mr. Baker also sent a letter to the S.E.C. asking it to examine $200 million in deferred expenses in 1998 and whether, as Ofheo concluded, it was done to meet earnings projections that allowed executives to win their maximum bonuses under an employee incentive program.
 Even some of the company's strongest supporters appeared to be shaken in their confidence of its management as a result of the findings.
 ''To the extent that any executive compensation was enhanced as a result of inaccurate accounting, which led to the achievement of particular earnings targets, it must be repaid to the corporation,'' said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee and one of the company's most vocal allies on Capitol Hill. ''This didn't happen by accident. This is defective corporate governance.''
 In the Senate, meanwhile, Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, said he would reintroduce legislation that was not adopted this year but that would strengthen the government's oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 The two companies, created by Congress, play a major role in the economy by buying mortgages from banks and then either holding them or selling them to investors as securities.

HEADLINE: U.N. Aide Says U.S. Voiced Concern on Paper on Arabs

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
A United Nations official said Thursday that the Bush administration had expressed concerns about a draft report on trends in democracy in the Arab world on the ground that it criticized the war in Iraq and other administration policies.
 The official's assertion, however, was disputed at the State Department, where Richard A. Boucher, the spokesman, said no criticisms or expressions of concern had been conveyed to anyone connected with the report.
 ''We have utmost regard for these reports on development and democracy in the Arab world, '' Mr. Boucher said. '' We have not received a draft of the latest report. We have not seen a draft. We have not conveyed any criticism.'' 
 The report is being prepared by leading Arab intellectuals and specialists for publication by the United Nations Development Program. 
 A report that there had been an American attempt to censor the report was contained in a column by Thomas L. Friedman published Thursday in The New York Times.
 The United Nations official said, ''The U.S. government has raised some concerns about the report,'' adding that Egypt had also expressed concern about language criticizing its government. But the official said that the report was ''still being drafted'' and that ''it is not being suppressed, and the United States is not asking us to withdraw or suppress it.''
 A senior State Department official, asking not to be identified, said some officials at the department had made ''a couple of inquiries'' about when the report would be issued by the development program and whether it would contain a repetition of criticism of administration policies that has been a feature of at least one previous report in the same series.
 The official said the inquiries did not amount to criticism, however.
 The report was supposed to be published last month, but will now be published in the new year, a program official said.
 The United Nations official said that in the past when United Nations reports reflecting the views of the authors have contained such conclusions, the State Department has expressed concerns. 
 ''We've raised concerns in the past, but the way we've approached this is that the reports have been good for us and that it's good to get them out there,'' another State Department official said. ''The idea of suppressing a report like this is the last thing on the minds of the administration.''

HEADLINE: Bush Says Social Security Plan Would Reassure Markets

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush said on Thursday that addressing the long-term problems in Social Security would reassure the financial markets, offering a rationale to offset criticism that his plan to add personal investment accounts to the retirement system would require up to $2 trillion in new government borrowing.
 On the second day of a White House conference on economic issues, Mr. Bush continued to lay the groundwork for a strong effort by the White House and its allies to overhaul Social Security and pursue an economic agenda next year that also includes re-examining the tax code, limiting lawsuit awards and reining in the growth in government spending.
 ''What I'm saying is we're going to submit a tough budget,'' Mr. Bush said, setting the stage for a new budget that holds down the growth of domestic spending. ''And I look forward to working with Congress on the tough budget.'' 
 As he did throughout his re-election campaign, Mr. Bush largely avoided talking about the specific steps to assure the long-term solvency of Social Security. Social Security trustees estimate that if no changes are made, the system will start running short of money to pay full benefits to retirees in 38 years.
 In particular, Mr. Bush never mentioned the near certainty that without raising taxes, which he has ruled out, any plan to add personal investment accounts to Social Security and improve its financial condition would include a reduction in the guaranteed retirement benefit. 
 His aides say there really is no guaranteed benefit in the long run, because without any changes to the system, Social Security will not be able to afford to meet its promises.
 Mr. Bush used the conference, which was intended to build public and legislative support for his agenda, to begin addressing the likelihood that the plan on personal accounts would require borrowing hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars at a time the government runs up large deficits. A big new borrowing program could bring political and economic risks for the administration.
 Mr. Bush, his aides and some participants in the conference suggested that addressing the long-term financial pressures on Social Security would give new confidence to the financial markets by showing the government to be confronting one of its biggest economic problems, the imbalance between the benefits it has promised to future retirees and the revenue that Social Security, set up as it is now, can be counted on to generate to money for those benefits.
 Their basic argument was that borrowing as much as $2 trillion in the short run would be a bargain, because it would help create a new system that would take care of the more than $10 trillion in benefits payments over the next 75 years that the government has not provided for.
 Mr. Bush cast dealing with the long-term problems of Social Security as part of a broader fiscal policy approach under which he would also meet his promise of cutting the budget deficit in half over five years. 
 The president has not fully explained how he would sharply reduce the deficit while also absorbing the costs of his Social Security program, pursuing new tax cuts and paying for the war in Iraq.
 Mr. Bush said his administration would ''send a message not only to the American people that we're here for the right reason, but we'll send a message to the financial markets that we recognize we have an issue with both short-term deficits and the long-term deficits of unfunded liabilities to the entitlement programs.'' 
 Sitting with him at a panel discussion on Social Security and other budget questions, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at the Charles Schwab brokerage firm, said a plan to address long-term fiscal imbalances was ''absolutely what the market wants to see.'' 
 Mr. Bush's spokesman, Scott McClellan, said later, ''Markets will look favorably on a plan that addresses the long-term sustainability of Social Security.''
 One expert who was not at the conference, Gary Gensler, a former top executive at the Goldman Sachs investment firm and the official in the Clinton administration who oversaw government borrowing, said Mr. Bush and his team were wrong in saying the markets would forgive additional borrowing in the short run to ease the need for borrowing in the long run.
 ''Their politics are overwhelming their economic reason,'' Mr. Gensler said in a phone interview, referring to the Bush administration. ''They have to diffuse the issue of the $2 trillion. So they're saying that we already have this obligation and we're just changing it from an actuarial imbalance into a legal debt.''
 The markets, Mr. Gensler added, ''aren't going to see it that way'' and would probably drive up interest rates.
 The first order of business on Social Security, Mr. Bush told the conference, was ''to convince people that there is a problem that needs to be addressed.''
 There were no real dissenting viewpoints from the panelists. Away from the conference, some opponents of Mr. Bush's approach, mostly liberals who want to preserve the current Social Security program, said in interviews that the administration was exaggerating the scale of the problem to create an air of crisis that justified radical but unnecessary changes like creating private investment accounts.
 Noting that Social Security can pay full benefits for at least 38 years, Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center on Economic Policy Research, a liberal research group, said the system's financial condition now was no worse than it has been at most points in the last few decades.
 ''This whole idea that Social Security needs to be fixed is false,'' Mr. Weisbrot said.
 Democrats in Congress say they support taking some action to deal with Social Security. But many say Mr. Bush is leaving the false impression that personal investment accounts will take care of the system's financial problem.
 ''If the president insists on privatizing Social Security,'' Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, said, ''he needs to tell us how he's going to pay for the enormous costs and how the benefit cuts imposed will affect future retirees.''

HEADLINE: Clamor Grows in the Privatization Debate

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
Introduced as a ''single mom'' from Iowa, Sandra Jaques was cool and confident as she praised President Bush's plan to partly replace Social Security with private savings accounts.
 ''I have a daughter at home. Her name is Wynter,'' said Ms. Jaques, sitting a few feet from President Bush at the White House economic conference on Thursday. ''I want to make sure that she has Social Security when she retires as well.'' 
 Mr. Bush chimed in a moment later. ''One of my visions of personal savings accounts is that Sandy will be able to pass her account on to Wynter as part of Wynter's capacity to retire as well.''
 The exchange was an example of how Mr. Bush promotes his agenda with testimonials from ''regular folks,'' in the words of Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, who introduced Ms. Jaques. 
 But Ms. Jaques is not any random single mother. She is the Iowa state director of a conservative advocacy group, FreedomWorks, whose founders are Jack F. Kemp, the former vice-presidential nominee, and Dick Armey, the former House Republican leader.
 Ms. Jaques also spent much of the past two years as a spokeswoman in Iowa for a group called For Our Grandchildren, which is mounting a nationwide campaign for private savings accounts.
 Her path to the stage was engineered by another advocate for private accounts, Leanne Abdnor, who previously organized a business coalition in Washington called the Alliance for Worker Retirement Security.
 ''Sandy is the perfect person to explain the benefits of this for women,'' said Ms. Abdnor, who has founded another group, Women for a Social Security Choice.
 Ms. Abdnor said she had raised start-up money from friends, whom she would not identify. She said the group would wage a publicity campaign to counter groups that oppose private accounts.
 Armies of lobbying and advocacy groups are mobilizing on both sides, with ''alliances'' and ''coalitions'' forming almost every week.
 The New Century Alliance for Social Security, a loose coalition of 100 organizations, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the National Organization for Women, is raising money to battle Mr. Bush's plan. 
 The senior citizens' lobbying group AARP is gearing up its own campaign to preserve traditional Social Security benefits.
 Mr. Bush and his supporters argue that Social Security faces a financial crisis that is best met by letting people divert some of their payroll taxes into personal savings accounts in exchange for lower guaranteed benefits. Opponents say privatization would do nothing in itself to reduce the financial problems and would undermine the concept of a secure retirement.
 Supporters of the president's plan have assembled scores of organizations, small and large. Some of their money comes from wealthy individuals, but much of it comes from corporations and industry trade associations.
 The Alliance for Worker Retirement Security, started by Ms. Abdnor in the late 1990's at the behest of the National Association of Manufacturers, now includes powerful industry lobbying groups. The alliance has close ties to the White House. Ms. Abdnor was succeeded at the alliance by Charles Blauhaus, now an architect of Social Security policy on Mr. Bush's National Economic Council. ''The power of our group rests on its Washington cache,'' said Derrick Max, the alliance's executive director. 
 Support for overhauling Social Security also comes from numerous self-described grass-roots organizations: For Our Grandchildren, which employed Ms. Jaques as a director in Iowa; SocialSecurityChoice.org, backed by pro-business political groups like Club for Growth; and USANext, a Virginia-based group run by Charles Jarvis, a former Reagan administration official.
 Mr. Jarvis, who recently changed his group's name from United Seniors Association, said that it had $28 million in annual revenues and that he aggressively sought contributions from industry: ''Health care companies, energy companies, the food industry, just about everybody except for financial investment companies.''

HEADLINE: Kremlin Reasserts Hold on Russia's Oil and Gas

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND and SIMON ROMERO; Erin E. Arvedlund reported from Moscow for this article and Simon Romero from Houston.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
On Sunday, Russia plans to auction the jewel of what used to be its most profitable, high-profile and well-run private company: the oil giant Yukos. And if the auction takes place, the winner most likely will be a financially opaque, government-run natural gas behemoth, Gazprom.
 Practically overnight, Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, would create an energy company that not only controls about 20 percent of the nation's oil exports but also has some of the world's largest energy reserves.
 A Kremlin campaign that unfolded over the last year will have succeeded in dismembering the country's foremost private oil company, and it will send a signal to Russia's business elite that the state is back in business, literally.
 Yukos was created under questionable circumstances from the remains of state oil assets in the early and mid-1990's. On its face, the Russian government is trying to sell Yukos's largest production subsidiary, Yuganskneftegas, to pay back a tax claim of more than $27 billion. But the startlingly low opening bid of $8.65 billion, which the government set, was expected to tip the scales toward a state-friendly bidder like Gazprom. 
 A ruling late Thursday in a federal bankruptcy court in Houston, however, raised some questions about the participation in the auction of banks that were expected to finance the deal. A federal bankruptcy judge in Houston, Letitia Z. Clark, issued a temporary restraining order intended to block the participation of lenders and Gazprom. The banks, analysts said, have extensive operations in the United States and might be concerned about ignoring the restraining order, which could put them in contempt of court.
 But Judge Clark's ruling did not apply to the government of Russia, and analysts said they expected the Russian authorities would go ahead with the auction on Sunday regardless of the ruling. 
 The management of Yukos, in a statement late Thursday, said that while they were heartened by the ruling and would continue their fight in the American courts, they remained realistic about its immediate effect. 
 Although two other largely unknown companies have submitted bids for Yukos in the auction, their presence was seen as purely an effort to make the auction seem valid. Foreign investors, including companies from China, India and other overseas energy investors, have been discouraged from participating.
 If the auction is completed on Sunday, Yukos will essentially die that day -- a casualty of efforts by Russian prosecutors that came with the tacit blessing of Mr. Putin. The founder of Yukos is now being held in jail, the company's American executives are in self-imposed exile and its shareholders are out billions of dollars. Russia's actions have set foreign and domestic investors on edge, prompted capital flight and raising questions about the rule of law and how businesses will fare.
 Whether the Kremlin initially intended to dismantle Yukos, or merely to make an example of it to private business, is unclear, but a result, said Fiona Hill, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, is ''not outright nationalization, but creeping nationalization.'' 
 Mr. Putin had made no secret of the fact that he views Russia's oil and gas, diamonds and precious metals as strategic natural resources -- weapons in his nation's fight to regain its global economic status.
 For Mr. Putin, oil may also be more than just a strategic asset. It is a symbol of power and a resource that helped support the Soviet government, especially during troubled economic times. Thanks to oil exports, the Soviet Union managed to maintain the illusion of economic health even during years of stagnation in the 1970's and 1980's.
 It is also Mr. Putin's best hope of restoring Russian ambitions and presenting a facade of security. 
 Only months ago, Yukos was the darling of Western investors and it was poised to become an international oil giant with influence far beyond Russia's borders.
 Gazprom is the largest natural gas company in the world, with a quarter of all gas reserves. By adding Yukos's oil assets, it will become one of the largest energy companies in the world by reserves.
 ''The Kremlin wants to set the strategic economic agenda, and that means not leaving the long-term strategies and decisions about how revenues should be spent to private companies,'' Ms. Hill said. ''The state wants control of the commanding heights. This is how Russia positions itself as a superpower.''
 With a bulked-up Gazprom, Mr. Putin will take a leaf out of the book from China, Japan and South Korea, where governments worked hand-in-hand to champion certain industries and build successful corporate leaders. Mr. Putin was probably paying close attention when China's high-technology giant, the Lenovo Group, bought the personal computer business of I.B.M. this month. 
 The Kremlin hopes to create huge world-class corporations in important sectors -- what Vladimir Konovalov, a member of the Petroleum Advisory Forum, a lobbying group, has called ''ship of state'' companies.
 Sergei Bogdanchikov, who would lead Gazprom's oil and gas business, said Gazprom wanted to compete with giants like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and BP. 
 Ms. Hill said it was even possible that Gazprom might someday buy oil assets outside of Russia.
 For American consumers and investors, the obituary of Yukos would be a symbol of what Russia can do to companies that have come into such riches that even the Kremlin is envious.
 Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, a little-known banker, took oil assets won at a controversial state auction in 1993 and developed Yukos into the country's most prominent and profitable commercial enterprise, worth nearly $40 billion a few months ago; it is now worth only $2 billion. 
 Early on, Mr. Khodorkovsky fought bitterly with some foreign shareholders. But in 2000, he decided to embrace Western-style corporate governance practices. Yukos's value soared, and Mr. Khodorkovsky even sought a merger with a smaller rival, Sibneft, and then a sale of his combined company to Exxon Mobil or ChevronTexaco.
 The company did not become as visible as the Russian oil giant Lukoil, whose red-and-white gas stations are popping up in Manhattan and in other East Coast cities. But Yukos traced the arc of Russia's post-Communist economic recovery, with all the good and bad that post-Soviet capitalism offered. And Yukos put Russia on the map as an alternative to Middle Eastern oil -- even as the campaign against Yukos helped push oil prices above $50 a barrel. 
 Yukos and Gazprom are vastly different. Mr. Khodorkovsky, 41, had no experience in the oil business. But he salted the exploration-and-production ranks of Yukos with expatriate engineers, like the Joe Mach and Ray Leonard of the United States. Yukos sponsored Formula One race cars, and its headquarters in downtown Moscow featured open architecture and posters of Mr. Khodorkovsky. 
 By the time it was a decade old, Yukos was Russia's top oil producer, with a global brand name. It was pumping 1.7 million barrels a day, or 2 percent of the world's supply. Mr. Khodorkovsky met with Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser in the Bush administration, in Washington; he visited Houston for energy summit meetings, and he pushed for Russia to start shipping oil to the United States.
 The production costs at Yukos were lower than those of Russian competitors; it was the first private Russian oil company to export crude to China; and it proposed building privately financed pipelines to Asia. Other companies have been less embracing of free-market practices. Gazprom, for example, still provides some employee housing, kindergartens and special stores for workers. It boasts in television ads that it contributes a billion rubles a day -- about $35 million -- to the federal budget, and Aleksei Miller, its current head, is a Putin loyalist.
 Mr. Putin, according to reports in the Russian media, was furious that a private energy giant was making decisions, and headlines, that were usually reserved for those in power behind Kremlin walls.
 Mr. Khodorkovsky financed politicians and parties who pushed his agenda in Parliament, like lower taxes for oil companies. But then, not long after he revealed negotiations to sell part of Yukos to a major Western oil company, Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested and jailed in October 2003. These days, he goes to criminal court four days a week in Moscow. 
 His lawyers posted a statement from Mr. Khodorkovsky on his Web site on Thursday, lamenting Yukos's downfall. ''Such a turn of events is upsetting,'' he said.
 So does the state-sponsored auction of Yukos mean foreign investors are still welcome in Russia? Conventional wisdom is divided. 
 Foreign investors are still welcome in the energy sector, but only in specific projects, and only on the government's timetable. 
 BP spent about $6.5 billion buying half of TNK, Russia's No.3 oil producer behind Yukos and Lukoil. But even TNK's Russian shareholders conceded that such a deal probably would not have happened in this new environment. ConocoPhillips took an equity stake in Lukoil this year, but it was capped at 20 percent -- not a controlling stake. Companies like Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, Shell and others will be allowed to invest in specific projects -- perhaps Gazprom's giant undeveloped Shtokman gas field--but not to buy companies outright. 
 ''Putin is definitely re-Sovietizing'' the oil and gas industry, said Michael J. Economides, a professor at the University of Houston and the co-author of ''The Color of Oil.'' 
 In Houston on Thursday, in issuing the injunction, Judge Clark granted a request sought by the management of Yukos, which took the unusual step of filing for bankruptcy protection in Houston on Wednesday. The judge based her decision on testimony by Bruce Misamore, Yukos's chief financial officer and an American citizen, who said that investors in the United States stood to suffer from the auction.
 Judge Clark wrote that ''participants in international commerce, in Russia, in the United States and elsewhere, need to have an expectation that when they invest in foreign enterprises they may do so without fear that their investments may be the subject of confiscatory action by agencies of the foreign government.''
 The expected demise of Yukos has rattled even the world's biggest oil companies. Lee R. Raymond, chief executive at Exxon Mobil, said this month that he was re-evaluating whether it was the right time to invest in Russia. Mr. Raymond said in a television interview Dec. 7 that the government's actions against Yukos raised questions ''about how they are going to manage their natural resources.'' 
 ''Until some clarity comes to that, I think it's going to be pretty difficult for people to think about putting large sums of money in as an investment,'' Mr. Raymond said.
 All along, the Russia government has argued that Yukos was merely a tax cheat, and that auctioning off Yuganskneftegas, which pumps a million barrels a day of oil, was meant simply to cover the tax bill. 
 But the sheer mountain of taxes the government claims seems to undermine that argument: Yukos now owes over $27 billion for the years 2000 through 2003 -- more than all its revenues in some years, and during a period of record high oil prices. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Khodorkovsky's imprisonment has prompted other Russian business executives to wonder if they might face government actions. 
 Igor Shuvalov, an aide to Mr. Putin, acknowledged this year that ''whatever the outcome, the Yukos affair will be negative for the country because it harms its image.'' 
 But the end of Yukos has revealed unpleasant truths about the absence of the rule of law in Russia, and has corrupted every institution that was dragged into the process.

HEADLINE: On Stage and Off, the Mystery of Willy Brandt 

BYLINE: By HUGH EAKIN

 BODY:
In Michael Frayn's play ''Democracy,'' the supposedly sober and orderly world of West German politics is transformed into a seedbed of treachery and betrayal. The play, which recently opened on Broadway, depicts more than the spy scandal that apparently precipitated the 1974 resignation of Willy Brandt, the popular German chancellor. It also hints at a government torn apart by sexual solicitation, drinking, personal rivalries and (perhaps) cabinet-level intrigue. 
 But one reason for the play's successful run in Berlin, as well as in London and now New York, may be its resonance with the actual events on which it is based. In Germany, where Brandt is remembered as one of the country's most charismatic leaders, these events remain every bit as murky and unresolved as they are in Mr. Frayn's script. For decades, the resignation has generated much debate, and more than a few conspiracy theories: Was the unmasking of Gunter Guillaume, a personal assistant of Brandt's, as an East German spy, only the pretext behind a larger plot to oust the chancellor in favor of his fellow Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt? Did Brandt resign to cover up a looming sex scandal with which his opponents planned to blackmail him? Or was the chancellor looking for any excuse he could find to quit a job that had pushed him to the brink of a breakdown, and even suicide? 
 ''No event in the history of the Federal Republic has been subject to more diverse interpretations than the resignation of Willy Brandt,'' the journalist Hans Werner Kilz observed recently in Suddeutsche Zeitung. In fact, since Mr. Frayn completed his play, a new round of magazine articles and books, including a biography of Brandt by his widow, Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt, have brought some additional facts -- and much fresh speculation -- to the mix. (They have been complemented by a recent television docudrama that plays up Brandt's reputation as a serial womanizer, and in which, as it happens, Brandt's real life son, the actor Matthias Brandt, plays Guillaume, the spy.) 
 Above all, these books have put increasing scrutiny on one of the more sinister characters in Mr. Frayn's play: Herbert Wehner, the powerful boss of Brandt's party in the German Parliament, and a former Moscow-trained Communist. 
 ''Did Wehner play a part in Brandt's collapse? That is the famous question,'' said Hermann Schreiber, author of the recent book, ''Downfall of a Chancellor: Why Willy Brandt Resigned,'' in a telephone interview from Hamburg.
 As in Mr. Frayn's play, previous interpretations of the resignation have focused on Wehner's increasingly open hostility to the chancellor in 1973 and 1974, and his private meeting with Brandt shortly before the resignation. Although no written record of the meeting was made, Wehner is said to have encouraged or even forced Brandt to resign in order to put Schmidt in power. In her new biography, however, Ms. Seebacher-Brandt suggests that Wehner not only engineered Brandt's downfall, but also did so with the explicit support of Moscow and East Berlin. 
 As the basis for her theory, she cites personal notes made by Brandt after his resignation, in which he suspects Wehner of having contacts with the East German government about the Guillaume affair. She also argues that Soviet involvement in a plot to oust Brandt may be detailed in several KGB files on Brandt to which the Russian government has denied public access. 
 Scholars have dismissed these charges, noting the lack of hard evidence and the fact that the author, who was Brandt's third wife, was not present at the time. They also question why the East German government would have been so eager to get rid of Brandt, Germany's first left-leaning chancellor and the architect of its revolutionary Ostpolitik, or policy of detente with the Eastern bloc. (Among other things, it was later discovered that the Stasi had, without Brandt's knowledge, helped him defeat a no-confidence vote in 1972 by bribing a Christian Democrat politician not to vote against him.) 
 Most historians have also discounted the possibility that Wehner discussed the Guillaume case with the East German leader, Eric Honecker, when he met him in May 1973. ''It's theoretically possible, but there is no proof,'' Mr. Schreiber said.
 Still, new information about Wehner's Communist past has raised further questions about his character and motives. During his later career, Wehner, who died in 1990, was long suspected of having briefly cooperated with Stalin's secret police, the NKVD, in the late 1930's. Recently unearthed KGB files reveal that Wehner's complicity was far more damning than previously thought. In ''Herbert Wehner: Moscow 1937,'' a book published this fall, the Hamburg scholar Reinhard Muller uses the files to show that Wehner not only collaborated with the NKVD, but also betrayed thousands of fellow German Communist exiles (''German Trotskyists'') who were not adhering to the Stalinist hard line. Many of them were subsequently killed. 
 Despite these revelations, Mr. Muller does not see grounds for implicating Wehner in a Communist conspiracy during the Brandt chancellorship. ''He was a power politician, and he disagreed with Brandt about a number of things,'' Mr. Muller said, noting that Wehner had become a full-blooded Social Democrat almost 30 years earlier. ''But there is nothing to suggest he was Moscow's man in Bonn.''
 Even so, there remain numerous unanswered questions. Several years ago, a German court convicted Karl Wienand, another Social Democratic leader who was close to Wehner during the Brandt years, on a charge of having been a high-level Stasi informant. Meanwhile, it has become increasingly clear from East German archives that Guillaume himself, despite having gained entree to Brandt's inner circle, did not succeed in passing many secrets to the East Germans.
 ''Politically, it wasn't necessary for Brandt to resign because of the Guillaume affair,'' Mr. Schreiber said. Mr. Schreiber argues that the resignation was above all a result of Brandt's own physical and psychological exhaustion -- he is well known to have suffered from deep depressions -- at a time of increasing economic and political uncertainty in Germany. 
 As it turns out, amid all the new speculation, the dramatic license taken in ''Democracy,'' which focuses mainly on Brandt's faltering leadership, Guillaume's espionage and the power struggle within the Social Democratic Party, has, for its German audience, appeared relatively mild. As Mr. Frayn observes in a postscript to the published version of his play, ''I can only say that fact has subsequently outstripped any fiction of mine in sheer implausibility.''

HEADLINE: White House Predicts Slower Growth in 2005

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
The Bush administration predicted on Friday that economic growth would slow next year but still be strong enough to reduce unemployment slightly.
 The forecast, which will be used to estimate tax revenues and shape next year's federal budget, called for economic growth to slow to 3.5 percent in 2005 from about 4 percent this year. 
 The estimated growth, which is roughly in line with forecasts of private economists, would be off from this year's pace but still slightly faster than average. 
 The forecast will also make it easier for the White House to project higher tax revenues and potentially a reduction in the $413 billion budget deficit.
 N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, predicted on Friday that both inflation and unemployment would decline next year. 
 The forecast calls for employment to rise by 2.3 million jobs, slightly faster than the growth in population, and for unemployment to decline to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent. 
 ''In terms of G.D.P. growth and employment, the estimates are lower than our own,'' Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting company in St. Louis, said referring to the gross domestic product. 
 Mr. Mankiw acknowledged that his predictions about employment growth were cautious. They imply the economy will add about 175,000 jobs a month next year, compared with a monthly average of 185,000 this year.
 Mr. Mankiw said the official estimates assumed that productivity would continue to grow rapidly, which would slow the pace of job growth.
 The White House predicted that inflation would slow sharply from its current annual pace of about 3.5 percent. Apparently assuming a modest decline in the price of oil, now $46.28 a barrel, the White House predicted that the Consumer Price Index would climb 2 percent next year.
 In a departure from previous practice, when Mr. Bush released the economic forecast at the same time as he unveiled his budget proposals in February, the White House decided to release this forecast more than six weeks in advance of the budget.

	 	 		--------------------	 	

Consumer Prices Rise
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 (AP) -- The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in November, helped by smaller increases in energy and food, the Labor Department reported Friday. The index rose 0.6 percent in October, reflecting the surge in energy prices as crude oil costs hit records and the soaring food prices related to supply disruptions from the hurricanes that hit the Southeast. Energy and food costs, however, moderated last month, helping to restrain the overall index. 
 The core inflation rate, removing energy and food prices, also rose 0.2 percent in November for a second consecutive month. That suggested other prices remained relatively well behaved. 
 The latest inflation readings matched economists' forecasts. 
 The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates Tuesday by one-quarter percentage point, to 2.25 percent, the fifth increase this year.

HEADLINE: Firings on Ecuador's Top Court Stir Opposition's Wrath

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; Carla D'Nan Bass contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
The judges of Ecuador's Supreme Court still arrive at work each day in their Italian-style suits, briefcases under their arms and somber expressions on their faces. But they no longer have clerks, nor perks like chauffeur-driven cars. 
 They no longer convene in Ecuador's modern Supreme Court building but rather in the cramped Room 701 of Catholic University.
 This is what has become of Ecuador's highest tribunal a week after a majority in Congress, in a special session called by President Lucio Gutierrez, fired 27 of the court's 31 judges and named a new court. 
 The move has plunged this oil-rich country, which is chronically unstable, into uncertainty and raised questions over whether Mr. Gutierrez is trying an institutional coup to consolidate power. The court was dissolved weeks after Congress replaced judges on the country's Electoral and Constitutional Courts, stacking both bodies with government allies. 
 ''Congress has no right to name, to judge or to vacate judges so this action by a majority in Congress is not only unconstitutional but it's absurd,'' said Teodoro Coello, one of the fired justices. ''It's a monstrous abuse of power.''
 Angry that the court sided with opposition politicians in a failed effort to impeach him in November on corruption charges, Mr. Gutierrez was able to summon 52 lawmakers in the 100-member unicameral Congress on Dec. 8, and they voted to remove the judges. He contended that the measure was aimed at restoring independence to the court because the replaced judges had been closely aligned with the opposition Social Christian Party, which the president says represents the country's elite.
 ''We have removed the oligarchy's claws,'' Mr. Gutierrez told a group of foreign reporters this week.
 The mass firing has not generated general outrage among Ecuador's 13 million people because many Ecuadoreans see the courts as corrupt purveyors of a status quo that favors special interests at the expense of most people. 
 But it has generated a firestorm of protests from influential entities like the Roman Catholic Church and the country's leading newspaper, El Comercio, which warned that the dissolution of the court had ''hurt the fate of the republic.'' 
 Local leaders -- from big-city mayors to small-town politicians, most of them said to be allied with the opposition -- have vowed to support the fired justices. Powerful business groups, which advocate a free trade agreement with the United States, said they would not support the president in negotiations after he arranged the judges' removal.
 ''We look like a country where our leader does whatever he needs to do for his own good,'' said Blasco Penaherrera, president of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce. ''What we have here is a coup d'etat.''
 Mr. Gutierrez, citing the need to eliminate political and party interests in the court, has steadfastly denied that he strong-armed Congress into dismissing the justices. ''When we do something to help the people, they say it's unconstitutional,'' the president scoffed.
 To remove the court, the government mustered votes from an unusual coalition of political parties whose members argued that the judges' terms had actually ended in 2003 and that a 30-year-old statute governing judicial appointments permitted Congress to remove them. Most experts disagree with their interpretation. The congressional majority also said the judges were appointed in 1997, a year before a new Constitution was enacted to provide for more judicial independence.
 But that Constitution clearly states that judges are to receive life terms and that only the court may appoint new judges. 
 Both measures in the new Constitution were clearly aimed at depoliticizing a court that had long answered to Ecuador's political parties, which are considered the world's most corrupt in a recent survey of 62 countries by Transparency International, a group that tracks global corruption.
 ''Judicial independence is an essential ingredient of a functioning democracy,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch. ''The fact that President Gutierrez and his congressional allies could purge the Supreme Court clearly shows that it is a missing ingredient in Ecuador today.''
 Few Ecuadoreans, even among the president's rivals, doubt that the fired judges had allegiances with Mr. Gutierrez's opponents in Congress. 
 The court had been closely allied to the Social Christians, the party that initiated the impeachment effort after accusing Mr. Gutierrez of misappropriating money. Further, control of the courts had helped Congress drive two presidents from power since 1997.
 So Mr. Gutierrez, political analysts said, had been understandably worried that his opponents would manipulate the court to weaken his government.
 He won office in 2002 as a populist friend of the poor, but his popularity has fallen as he has embraced the neoliberal economic model that he had campaigned against. Though the economy has steadily grown, with this year's expansion expected to approach 6 percent, the president's political troubles have only increased.
 His alliance with the indigenous Pachakutik Party fell apart, and his political enemies in Congress had begun to plot his removal.
 With this backdrop, Mr. Gutierrez moved against the Supreme Court, forming an alliance with the influential Roldosista Party, which wants to facilitate the return to Ecuador of its leader, former President Abdala Bucaram, who has been in exile since being ousted in 1997 and has not returned because he faces corruption charges here.
 ''What the president's majority in Congress did was dissolve the court and replace them with a list of judges who are indebted to the lawmakers who supported the president,'' said Julio Gonzalez, who leads the Pachakutik bloc in Congress. 
 The president of the new court, Ramon Rodriguez, begged to differ in an interview in his new office, vacated just days ago by Judge Hugo Quintana, who was among those fired.
 ''In my case, I'm an independent,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''The country and the world should know that my work here will be subject to the law and justice.''
 Just blocks away at the Catholic University, the fired justices have been meeting daily in a law school classroom, discussing just how long they should meet in defiance of their termination. But with few options, and the judiciary ever more in the hands of the presidency, several judges have begun to ponder life off the bench.
 ''We have to just hope for the best, hope that maybe Congress will change its mind,'' said Ernesto Alban, one of the fired judges. ''It's not going to be easy to go find a new job at 65 or so.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Saturday with an article about the dismissal of most of Ecuador's Supreme Court judges by President Lucio Gutirrez misstated the nationality of protestors demonstrating in support of his action. They were indigenous Ecuadoreans, not Peruvians.

HEADLINE: Formula Change May Increase Rent Vouchers by $8 Million

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
New York City officials say that the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has adjusted a formula used to calculate a special rent voucher that has helped keep tenants in neighborhoods they otherwise could not afford. The change potentially adds up to $8 million in housing assistance for 2005.
 Had the formula not been adjusted, city officials said this week, as many as 1,816 households in federally subsidized Mitchell-Lama housing and other buildings -- including Independence Plaza North in TriBeCa -- might have been displaced because of unaffordable rents. 
 ''We were very concerned,'' said Shaun Donovan, the city's housing commissioner. ''New York was on their doorstep at every chance reminding them of this issue. So this was a huge lift, to try and get it changed.''
 Jerry Brown, a spokesman for HUD, said the directive was made across the board, and not just in New York or any specific area
 But city officials said they were pleased that the federal housing agency had responded positively to their lobbying efforts. 
 The Bush administration has made clear its goal to contain what it says are the program's spiraling costs. But in September, after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spoke with Alphonso Jackson, the HUD secretary, federal officials announced that they would restore $52 million in local Section 8 funds that had been proposed for cuts.
 Then, on Dec. 3, Mr. Donovan wrote to Michael Liu, HUD's assistant secretary for public and Indian housing, expressing concern about the financing for the enhanced rent vouchers in the 2005 federal budget. These vouchers are used primarily in developments with contracts set to expire under federally assisted Mitchell-Lama and Section 8 buildings, programs that helped subsidize apartment building construction.
 As those contracts expire, units in the developments are rented at market rates. Those tenants who meet income eligibility criteria can use the vouchers to bridge the gap between what the government says tenants should pay -- 30 percent of their annual income -- and the market rate. In Manhattan, that gap can average $2,000 a month, which officials say is among the highest in the country.
 Under the 2005 federal budget, the government said it would pay an amount based on the average cost of the vouchers through July 2004, with an inflation adjustment. But that calculation, Mr. Donovan said, threatened to exclude any new vouchers promised after that date. In New York that could exclude up to 1,332 apartments in Independence Plaza North and as many as 484 in Sea Park West/North in Coney Island.
 In addition, Mr. Donovan said, New York officials urged the agency to use actual costs for enhanced vouchers (about $1,500 a month), and not the average cost for all Section 8 vouchers (about $600 a month).
 On Dec. 8, HUD issued a final notice on its appropriations. In explaining its calculations for enhanced vouchers, it provided examples of vouchers issued in October -- after the July cutoff date. The next day, in a presentation to local housing authorities, the agency said that it would pay the higher of actual or average costs of the rent vouchers.
 Mr. Donovan said there were no guarantees that the city would not have to do the same kind of lobbying next year. That is when the contracts for Mitchell-Lama or Section 8 buildings with 4,500 units are set to expire, which would require enhanced vouchers that could cost up to $43.5 million. Still, he expressed cautious optimism that the city was in a better position for negotiations, because ''there's a strong precedent, now that the language is in there.''

HEADLINE: Gunmen Kill 4 Men in Attack on Car in Northern Iraq

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MOSUL, Iraq, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Gunmen attacked a car in Mosul on Friday, killing three armed men who appeared to be foreigners and their Iraqi driver. 
 In a separate report, an Iraqi militant group, the Islamic Jihad Brigades, claimed responsibility on Friday for the killing of two American construction contractors last week near Baghdad. 
 In Mosul, in the north, a white American-made sedan was driving Friday through the violent western district when it was attacked by rifle fire, witnesses said. Afterward, the vehicle was set ablaze and a small crowd gathered around the burning wreckage. 
 Witnesses said they saw the bodies of the car's four passengers. In addition to the Iraqi driver, they said, they saw three men. One was described as looking Turkish, while the two others appeared to be fair-skinned Europeans, and the witnesses said one of the bodies had been beheaded. 
 The identities of the victims were not clear, but the witnesses said they had been carrying small automatic weapons. 
 Many private security firms operate in Mosul and throughout Iraq.
 An American military spokesman said troops had recovered three bodies in western Mosul around 6 p.m. but that the dead men appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent. 
 ''All three died of gunshot wounds,'' he said. ''None of the three were decapitated. A fourth body was not discovered.''
 The claim by the Islamic Jihad Brigades about last week's attack was made in a video posted on the Internet. The militants showed identification papers for two Americans, Dale Stoffel and Joseph Wemple, whom they said they had killed. They claimed the two were agents of the Central Intelligence Agency and the American military. 
 An American construction contractor in Iraq, CLI USA, based in Canonsburg, Pa., said the two men worked for the company.
 It identified Mr. Stoffel as the company's vice president for international development and said Mr. Wemple was a project manager from Orlando, Fla., The Associated Press said. 
 In Baghdad, American diplomats identified an American taken hostage there on Nov. 1 as Roy Hallums, a contractor with a Saudi Arabian company, and said they were working toward his release. ''We believe he's alive,'' a spokesman for the American Embassy said. ''We're working on that assumption.'' 
 Gunmen took Mr. Hallums, a Filipino, a Nepali and three Iraqis hostage after raiding a villa belonging to the Saudi Arabian Trading and Contracting Company, based in Riyadh.
 The Nepali and the Iraqis were quickly released, but Mr. Hallums and the man from the Philippines, Roberto Tarongoy, are apparently still being held.
 Officials in the Philippines have said the kidnappers are demanding $20 million in ransom for the release of Mr. Hallums and Mr. Tarongoy. 
 In Falluja, Mayor Mahmoud Ibrahim, who was installed by American forces after the assault on the city last month, said families could begin returning Friday to some southern neighborhoods. But there was little sign of movement by late afternoon.
 More than 200,000 people who fled the city have yet to go home, and many are in need of aid as temperatures at night are near freezing. 
 American forces have been working to restore medical centers and water and power plants in the city, and the military said Wednesday that Falluja residents would be able to begin returning soon.

Bin Laden Urges Attacks on Oil Sites
 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 17 (Reuters) -- In his most recent videotaped message, Osama bin Laden urged militants to concentrate their attacks on Iraqi and Persian Gulf oil facilities, saying it was the most powerful weapon against America, according to a transcript of the tape.
 ''Weakening America in Iraq economically, morally and through loss of life is a golden and unique opportunity that you should not waste so not to have remorse,'' the transcript quoted Mr. bin Laden as saying. 
 The transcript was seen Friday; portions of the tape were posted on the Internet on Thursday. After the tape was first posted on the Internet, an intelligence official in Washington said an analysis had determined with ''high confidence'' that the tape was by Mr. bin Laden.

HEADLINE: Facing Down The Killers

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; David Brooks is on vacation.. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The new movie ''Hotel Rwanda'' is a gut-wrenching true story of a hotel manager who sheltered 1,268 people in his hotel during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, bribing, begging and bullying the killers who came to hack people apart with machetes.
 One of the most powerful scenes comes when the U.N. commander admits to the hotel manager, Paul Rusesabagina, that the West is allowing the genocide to run its course. ''We think you're dirt, Paul,'' he says brokenly, adding: ''You're an African. They're not going to stop the slaughter.'' 
 Against that backdrop of local butchery and Western indifference, the hotel manager summons the courage to stare down the killers, even as they hold guns to his head. The film is painful to watch not only for the slaughter it depicts, but also because it forces us, as viewers, to wonder what we would do in such a situation.
 But we don't have to wonder. We know, for a genocide is unfolding again, in Darfur. And rather than standing up to the killers, we're again acquiescing. 
 The Darfur situation, after a few months of looking a bit more hopeful, is deteriorating sharply. The rebels have grown more intransigent, and security on the ground is getting worse. Save the Children has now had four aid workers killed in Darfur, and aid groups are pulling back.
 ''The present situation in Darfur is therefore that of a time bomb, which could explode at any moment,'' Maj. Gen. Festus Okonkwo, the commander of an African Union force, said at a press conference yesterday. He said an ''astronomical'' amount of weaponry had been brought into Darfur, and suggested that the fighting was now poised to get much worse.
 Early in his presidency, Mr. Bush read a report about Bill Clinton's paralysis during the Rwandan genocide and scrawled in the margin, ''Not on my watch.''
 But in fact the same thing is happening on his watch, and I find that heartbreaking and baffling. Mr. Bush's core constituency, the religious right, has been pushing him to be more active on Sudan, and some of the first people to jump up and down about Darfur were in Mr. Bush's own Agency for International Development.
 Mr. Bush did take modest action (much more than most Europeans), and even these baby steps halted the worst of the killing, saving tens of thousands of lives. So, in effect, Mr. Bush had the ball in his hands -- and then fumbled it.
 What should the president do?
 Mr. Bush should travel to Sudan, as Tony Blair did. He should forcefully denounce the brutality -- and also the misconduct of the rebels. He should convene a summit meeting to organize a larger international force for Darfur. He should push ahead with a U.N. resolution, even at the risk of a veto from China. And he should threaten targeted economic sanctions against Sudan's leaders unless attacks stop immediately.
 Finally, Mr. Bush should bar the Sudan government from using its aircraft to terrorize civilians. Imposing such a no-fly zone wouldn't have to involve constant surveillance flights. As an American general, Charles Wald, whose command includes Africa, told me, ''It would be easier to tell the Sudanese that if they do use aircraft for civilian attacks, bad things will happen to their planes on the ground.'' After Sudan lost its first plane, it might stop strafing civilians.
 What can ordinary Americans do? They can call the White House or their members of Congress to demand action, and they can reach into their pockets. Jack Weisberg, a New Yorker with no previous interest in such causes, asked me for the name of an organization doing good work in Darfur. I mentioned Doctors Without Borders. Saying he was suffering an ''attack of conscience,'' he then wrote the group a check for $500,000.
 ''Look, I love money,'' Mr. Weisberg said. ''But it's time to share what I've made. Our money is life to them.''
 A lot of lives, in the case of his donation, although even a $20 contribution goes a long way in Sudan. But above all we need Mr. Bush to show some moral leadership -- and, yes, some of his ''moral values.''
 Mr. Bush bemoaned Mr. Clinton's use of the White House for sex with an intern, and he was right to do so. But it's incomparably more immoral, and certainly a greater betrayal of American values, for Mr. Bush to sit placidly in the White House and watch a genocide from the sidelines.

PERSON: Seymour Melman

HEADLINE: Seymour Melman, 86, Dies; Spurred Antiwar Movement

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
Seymour Melman, a Columbia University scholar who helped galvanize the antiwar movement from the 1950's on with analyses of the social costs of military spending, died on Dec. 16 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
 The cause appeared to be an aneurysm, said Benjamin Abrams, his research assistant. 
 Dr. Melman, an economist who taught industrial engineering at Columbia, was a leading advocate of disarmament for nearly half a century. He opposed nuclear weapons almost from their inception and he opposed the current war in Iraq. 
 A longtime co-chairman of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, he emphasized arguments that military spending diverted resources from health care, public housing and education.
 In speeches, editorials, scholarly articles and close to a dozen books, he criticized the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and maintained that the United States and the Soviet Union were draining their economies for little more than the ability to destroy each other hundreds of times over. He popularized the use of the word ''overkill'' to describe the buildup. ''Isn't 1,250 times overkill enough?'' he wrote in a 1964 letter to The New York Times. ''Since the Soviets by similar calculation can overkill the United States only 145 times, are we to believe that any advantage exists here for either side?''
 He rebutted a post-World War II argument that war drove the economy, maintaining that the opposite was true and that other factors helped pull the country out of the Depression. 
 In his 1974 book, ''The Permanent War Economy,'' he composed a long list of military trade-offs. The money spent on one Huey helicopter, he said, could buy 66 low-priced homes, while a recent $69 million reduction in child-nutrition programs represented the cost of two DE-1052 destroyer escorts. He added, ''To eliminate hunger in America = $4-5 billion = C-5A aircraft program.'' 
 ''His work changed the debate in the peace movement to much broader issues,'' said Marcus Raskin, a founder of the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal research institute, and an adviser to the National Security Council in the Kennedy administration.
 Professor Melman's arguments appealed to a wide spectrum, attracting unions like the United Automobile Workers and the Machinists Union as well as public advocates like Ralph Nader, who yesterday described Prof. Melman's studies as ''prescient for decades.''
 Noam Chomsky, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and antiwar activist, said Dr. Melman helped mobilize what once was weak and scattered resistance to war and other military operations. 
 ''The country is a lot different than it was 30 to 40 years ago, and he had a big role in that,'' Mr. Chomsky said. ''There's much more widespread opposition to the diversion of resources to military production, to the use of force in international affairs, to nuclear development.''
 Dr. Melman became an authority on a process called ''economic conversion,'' the retooling of arms factories and military bases for civilian purposes. He outlined such plans in ''The Demilitarized Society'' (1988) and ''Rebuilding America'' (1992). He advised the United Nations on the possibilities of economic conversion from 1979 to 1980, and from 1988 on, he was chairman of The National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament.
 Seymour Melman was born in the Bronx on Dec. 30, 1917. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from College of the City of New York in 1939.
 After serving in the United States Army during World War II, he received a doctorate in economics from Columbia, where he was later chairman of the industrial engineering department.
 His books on military spending include ''Our Depleted Society'' (1965), ''Pentagon Capitalism'' (1970) and ''Profits Without Production'' (1983).
 His more recent books, including ''After Capitalism: From Managerialism to Workplace Economy'' (2001), describe the potential of employee self-management, an idea that interested him for decades. As a young man, he briefly lived on a kibbutz in Israel, and later in his career participated in studies and meetings on the productivity of such collective settlements.
 Dr. Melman is survived by a brother, Myron, of Rehovot, Israel. His marriage to JoAnne Medalie ended in divorce.

HEADLINE: Needing a Weapon Mightier Than the Pen

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
IN the aftermath of a rash of coaching changes in college football, the most encouraging news of the week was a letter written by 62 former University of Illinois athletes. 
 The letter, addressed to the athletic director, Ron Guenther, offered a list of experienced minority candidates for the football coach's job at Illinois. The letter was written in late November after Ron Turner was fired as the coach, and a copy of it was released this week in reaction to Illinois's hiring of Ron Zook, the former Florida coach, who was fired in midseason. 
 The signers, consisting of black and white former Illinois football and basketball players, said in interviews that they felt that the university's administration had violated the spirit of a selection process that was intended to give minority candidates a fair opportunity to become the head football coach. 
 What they suspect is that the job was all but promised to Zook, who is white, in the middle of the interviewing process.
 ''Because of our letter, Illinois put together a process that it had never before had in place,'' said Eric Rouse, who played football for the Illini in the 1970's. Illinois began with 20 candidates, a number that was reduced to 7 and then 3 before Zook was chosen. 
 ''Somewhere in the middle, a decision may have been or may not -- they say everything was open, no offers were given, but it smells funny,'' Rouse said. ''But the fact is, this shows that if we band together, at least they'll give us a process.'' 
 Neither the interim chancellor, Richard Herman, nor Guenther was available for comment yesterday. ''We had specific needs, and Coach Zook met those needs,'' said Robin Kaler, the interim associate chancellor for university communications.
 I'm not sure what they could say, though. The university's record of hiring African-American coaches speaks for itself.
 In a separate letter to the chancellor, Dino Pollock, who played football for Illinois in the 1980's, said: ''There are 139 full-time jobs listed on the site and tied to the athletic budget. I counted 9 African-Americans among the 139, which includes assistant coaches, administration and only one black head coach, in men's track.'' 
 He added that more than 70 percent of the athletic budget was derived from football revenue and 15 percent to 18 percent from men's basketball.
 ''We all know the dominant composition of the players in those two revenue sports,'' Pollock said. ''So what we have is young black men being the economic fuel for the engine that is D.I.A.'' -- the division of intercollegiate athletics. 
 Pollock added, ''The message is abundantly clear: send your black child to Illinois to run, jump, dance and dunk but don't expect to use your degree or playing experience to administer and lead athletics, for that is a province solely reserved for whites.'' 
 The group's letter came at a time when hundreds of African-American athletes have finished their professional football careers and are coming of age as assistants in the collegiate and pro ranks.
 Rouse said the list of signees represented three decades of University of Illinois athletes. 
 ''I would love every black athlete from every university in the country to do exactly what we did,'' he said yesterday from Arizona, where he is an account executive for Eli Lilly. 
 Rouse added, ''I'm still getting people calling me and saying, ''This is great, I want to hear more.'''
 The letters are well and good, but in the realm of athletics, former players are just former players. The lifeblood of intercollegiate athletics is 18-year-old high school blue-chip athletes. If there is a battle to be fought, it should be over control of the minds of this precious raw material. 
 When the parents and guardians of 62 of the nation's top recruits send open letters protesting the lack of a minority presence at institutions that pursue their children, changes will be made. Unfortunately, few 18-year-olds have the savvy or conviction to punish big-time universities for racist hiring practices. In fact, the players want to run for the universities as badly as the universities want them to run.
 The challenge former athletes face is how to force powerful institutions with well-heeled backers to give black candidates, and white candidates with no connections, a fair shot at head coaching jobs.
 ''We have to continue to apply pressure,'' Howard Griffith, a former Illini football player and one of the signees, said yesterday. ''The ones with the power, with the influence, are the ones that can effect change. If you don't have the power or have not been given the power, you can't effect change. You're just a voice that's out there speaking.''
 Griffith, who graduated from Illinois in 1990 and played 10 seasons in the N.F.L., admitted that he was reluctant to stare down power.
 ''This is really the first time that we've taken a stand,'' Griffith said. ''Sometimes you pick and choose your battles. Sometimes you don't want to go against the grain because it's the unpopular thing to do, because you think you have something to lose.
 ''If the University of Illinois decided that Howard Griffith, we'll no longer list him as one of our famous alumni or we're no longer going to invite him back, so what?
 ''I'm not trying to embarrass the school,'' he said. ''The school should be embarrassed.'' 
 It is not. 
 If they haven't discovered it already, the former athletes will soon find that the days of institutions yielding to moral outrage are over. 
 Illinois and institutions like it will not budge until forced to budge, when young athletes and their parents steer clear of universities with poor records of minority hiring. Words are fine, but forceful confrontation will be more useful.

HEADLINE: San Quentin Debate: Death Row vs. Bay Views

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SAN QUENTIN, Calif., Dec. 17 

 BODY:
So many people in California have been sentenced to death that the state is about to spend $220 million to build a bigger death row next to the current one on a spectacular bayside bluff here.
 The state has long had the most populous death row in the country -- it now has 641 condemned inmates -- and the problem is that very few residents ever leave. Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977, just 10 inmates have been put to death, and many spent 20 years or so in their cells before being executed by lethal injection. Four times as many have died from other causes like suicide and AIDS.
 ''The comment may sound a bit whimsical, but it's literally true that the leading cause of death on death row is old age,'' said Chief Justice Ronald M. George of the California Supreme Court, a former prosecutor of capital cases. 
 The decision to build the new prison was made by the State Legislature last year and the environmental reviews are nearing completion. With construction scheduled to begin next September, there is a stepped-up effort by opponents to block it.
 But in an indication of how accustomed Californians have grown to their Potemkin-like death row, the debate over the new prison is centered on real estate prices and panoramic views, not the snail-paced approach to executions that has made a bigger prison necessary. Many elected officials here in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, do not oppose a new prison, they just insist that it be built far away on less valuable property, and for that matter would like to move the entire complex.
 ''The site's location on the bay and proximity to San Francisco along with access to nearby cultural and recreational opportunities provide a unique opportunity to leverage the physical characteristics and natural beauty of the property,'' states a developmental plan prepared by the county. The proposal, called the San Quentin Vision Plan, contemplates residential communities, bike paths, parks and a transportation center in place of death row and the rest of the prison and its 5,000 inmates.
 Margot Bach, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Corrections, characterized the county's approach to San Quentin this way: ''They want the real estate. That's the bottom line.''
 Even with a sharp drop in the number of people sentenced to death in recent years, the new prison is being designed to house 1,408 men, more than double the current death row population. (Women will continue to be housed at a prison in Chowchilla, in the Central Valley.) Most everyone involved expects that death row will get more populous in the coming years because so few of the condemned will be executed.
 Franklin E. Zimring, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of a book on capital punishment, said a bigger prison at San Quentin would be an appropriate metaphor for a state that values law and order but seems to have little appetite for Texas-style justice. Texas leads the nation in executions, with 336 since 1976. Its death row now houses 444 inmates.
 ''What we are talking about looks like an inefficiency, but it may function to give us exactly what we want, which is a death penalty without executions,'' Professor Zimring said. ''When people are ambivalent and not very honest about their priorities, it is very difficult to distinguish between ingenuity and inefficiency.''
 He said that what was most remarkable about capital punishment in California was that even with strong public support for it -- a Field Poll in March showed 68 percent favored the death penalty for serious crimes -- there was scant outrage over the courts' slow-paced application of it. 
 ''There isn't a crisis here,'' said Professor Zimring, a death penalty foe. ''Nobody's mad. The district attorneys get death sentences. That is their reward. They frame that. But they are not sitting there waiting for executions.''
 Many advocates of capital punishment, while unhappy with the situation, say they are resigned to it.
 ''Our Legislature is run by people who don't want the death penalty to work,'' said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a Sacramento-based group that favors stepped-up executions. ''They can't repeal it outright because the voters would hang them, but they can sabotage it. It is basically a matter of not pushing.''
 Chief Justice George said in a telephone interview from Sacramento that the slow pace of executions was caused by both the state and federal courts. The state courts have been cautious in making sure defendants receive the best legal representation possible, he said, while on the federal level, ''an active federal bench looks at these cases more carefully than the federal bench in other parts of the country.'' Unlike the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which handles cases from Texas, the appeals court that serves California, the Ninth Circuit, is well known for its liberal interpretation of federal law.
 California is very slow in processing death penalty appeals, starting with the State Supreme Court itself, which under the state's Constitution is the first to review death sentence appeals. The waiting list for an appeals lawyer to be assigned by the court is about four years. Right now, 118 people on death row have not yet been assigned a lawyer. Six years ago the number reached 170.
 ''The virtues of the system also represent its vices because it does end up causing a lot of delay,'' Chief Justice George said. ''We take great care to try and appoint competent counsel.'' He added, ''I could take care of that backlog in two or three days if I were not following the very rigorous standards that California has established.''
 Professor J. Clark Kelso, director of the Capital Center for Government Law and Policy at the McGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific, was a consultant to the state in the late 1990's, when legislation was passed to speed up the appeals process, including paying higher hourly fees to lawyers. But even with those changes, Professor Kelso said it would take 15 or 20 years to catch up with the backlog of cases before the Supreme Court.
 Some groups opposed to the death penalty objected to a new prison when the State Legislature was considering it, but the debate has been minimal since then. Some of the groups have even thrown their support behind the bigger prison because it promises to offer better facilities and would keep the inmates close to San Francisco, maintaining easy access to them by death row lawyers, volunteers and service organizations.
 ''This was an effort that kind of pulled the movement apart a little bit,'' said Lance Lindsey, executive director of Death Penalty Focus, a San Francisco group that opposes a new prison. ''Of course a lot of us are for humane conditions, but conditions could be improved without expanding death row, and if we ended the death penalty, we wouldn't need all that money to expand death row.''
 The Prison Law Office, a nonprofit firm located outside the gates to the 152-year-old prison here, is among the groups that have supported a more modern death row. It has also resisted efforts to move it away from San Quentin, insisting that executions, when they do occur, need to be held in a big urban center so that they receive public scrutiny.
 Steven Fama, a lawyer with the Prison Law Office, said the new prison was indicative of ''a sort of stalemate that has become entrenched'' in the state over capital punishment. While the overcrowded death row signals ''a legal system that cannot accommodate the death judgments,'' Mr. Fama said there was widespread acceptance of the status quo and a feeling on both sides to make the best of an imperfect situation.
 ''Increasingly it just doesn't work the way it is now,'' he said of death row. ''There are not enough cells for the disabled. The mental health care has to be given out in a makeshift way. They have had to be creative, building a chapel in an old shower area.''
 Assemblyman Joe Nation, a Democrat from Marin County, has been promised a meeting with aides to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has expressed support for the new death row, to make a last-ditch pitch to sink the plan. Mr. Nation, who wants the new prison to be built somewhere less expensive than the Bay Area, said his presentation to the governor's staff would focus entirely on economic issues.
 A state audit of the prison proposal last spring raised some financial questions about the plan, and Mr. Nation said it was a mistake for the state to ''box itself into having a prison'' at San Quentin for another 50 to 100 years by making such a big investment. He said state officials had estimated that the land there was worth as much as $750 million.
 In the long run, opponents of the death penalty hope money concerns might also persuade Californians to give up on death row entirely. Though there have been few comprehensive analyses of the financial impact, the Indiana Criminal Law Study Commission in 2002 found that the additional legal and incarceration costs to that state for a death sentence versus one for life without the possibility of parole was about 30 percent.
 ''In a perfect world, we would have a serious discussion about the death penalty in California,'' Mr. Nation said.

HEADLINE: Harry Ueno, 97; Exposed Corruption in War

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Harry Ueno, who took a stand against the corruption of operators of a Japanese-American internment camp in World War II, died here on Tuesday. He was 97. 
 The cause was pneumonia, his family said. 
 Mr. Ueno, a Japanese-American, was active in the movement to win reparations for about 120,000 Japanese-American internees, which was eventually successful. Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, the surviving internees received reparations of $20,000 each. 
 Mr. Ueno, born in Hawaii, took a job on a merchant ship as a teenager and abandoned it when it docked on the American mainland. He settled in Los Angeles, where he married and reared three sons while selling produce. 
 That life was interrupted in 1941 after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Mr. Ueno and his family were taken to the Manzanar internment camp, at the base of Mount Whitney, which eventually housed 10,000 men, women and children.
 While working in the mess hall, Mr. Ueno realized that camp operators were selling sugar, which was intended for his fellow internees, on the wartime black market. He confronted them and was arrested. 
 An uprising ensued, and two young internees were shot and killed by guards.
 For more than three years, Mr. Ueno was moved from jail to jail around the West, spending a year in solitary confinement, though he was never charged with a crime or given a hearing.
 After the war, he received $15 and a train ticket to San Jose, Calif. He began a new life there, raising strawberries and cherries and retiring in 1972.
 His story has been included in an oral history, ''Manzanar Martyr''; a documentary film by a fellow internee, Emiko Omori, ''Rabbit in the Moon''; and a book about the internment, ''And Justice for All.''

HEADLINE: China's Army May Respond If Taiwan Fully Secedes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
The Communist Party-controlled legislature has indicated that it is preparing to enact a law against secession, possibly mandating military action if Taiwan were to declare independence.
 A draft law forbidding secession by any part of China, announced Friday by the New China News Agency, suggests that President Hu Jintao is seeking to eliminate any lingering doubts that the Chinese military would attack Taiwan if the island formally severed ties with the mainland.
 China's top leaders have said consistently that they would wage war against Taiwan if it were to declare itself an independent state, so the passage of such a law basically reiterates existing policy.
 But outlawing secession may be an attempt to counter skepticism in Taiwan that China would really start a war it might not win. 
 The United States has pledged to defend Taiwan if the mainland attacks, and China would risk derailing its trade-dependent economic growth if it launched an attack.
 ''This is a step the people have been demanding for many years,'' says Yu Keli, a Taiwan expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. ''There can be no ambiguity that China will fight Taiwanese independence no matter what.''
 The New China News Agency report said committee chairmen of the National People's Congress had submitted a draft of the measure on Friday. It is to be considered by the standing committee of the legislature during the period Dec. 25-29. 
 The report provided no details of the legislation.
 It is unclear how long it would take to consider and pass the law. The legislature acts under party orders, so the timing is likely to be dictated by the country's leadership. It is possible that party and military officials will choose to prolong debate to stir nationalist sentiment at home and keep pressure on Taiwan.
 The wording of Friday's announcement suggests that the new measure it is not intended to serve as a ''reunification law.'' Some hard-line nationalists in China have advocated a law mandating that Taiwan return to the Chinese fold, possibly by a specified date.
 Mr. Yu said he believed that the law would address only China's reaction if Taiwan declared statehood, rather than requiring active steps by the mainland to force reunification. Mandating reunification would appear to violate China's repeated pledges to the United States to maintain the status quo in cross-strait relations.
 Still, the news agency seemed to leave open the possibility that the law could evolve into something more pointed. ''Over the past year, quite a few Chinese lawmakers and senior government advisers have proposed that a law on national reunification should be enacted as soon as possible,'' the agency said.
 Just last week, Taiwan's Nationalist Party-led opposition won a surprise victory in legislative elections against parties supporting President Chen Shui-bian, who is considered pro-independence. The Nationalist Party has called for improving relations with the mainland and generally opposes independence.
 The election marked the first time in years that the Taiwan party favoring improved relations prevailed in a democratic poll against rivals who advocating taking steps toward independence. But some analysts said China was nonetheless unlikely to soften its stance.
 Mainland analysts said the Beijing government was likely to conclude that its efforts in recent months to make a war with Taiwan seem imminent have worked, persuading some residents of Taiwan that backing Mr. Chen may be dangerous. 
 By this line of reasoning, these analysts said, mainland officials would be reluctant to stop saber-rattling after a one-time election setback for Mr. Chen.
 Moreover, although Mr. Chen's leeway to rewrite Taiwan's Constitution and take other steps that might strengthen its separate identity are likely to be blocked by the opposition-led legislature, Beijing is still focused on other actions the president might take.
 ''We observed Chen Shui-bian's comments during his resignation speech yesterday and we believe he still insists on Taiwan independence,'' Li Weiyi, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a news conference on Wednesday. 
 He was referring to Mr. Chen's announcement that he would step down as head of the Democratic Progressive Party to take responsibility for the election defeat.

HEADLINE: Interest Rates and Deficits

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan did what he had to do last Tuesday, raising interest rates for the fifth time in a row by a quarter point, to 2.25 percent, and leaving little doubt that the increases would continue. But whether the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee will be able to stick to its self-described ''measured'' pace is an open question. Much depends on decisions that have more to do with fiscal and trade policy, the domain of President Bush and his merry band of weak-dollar-big-deficit policy makers, than with monetary policy, the domain of the Fed. That's because the administration's policies exert upward pressure on prices and interest rates, risking what a recent Fed staff report on trade imbalances calls ''wrenching changes.'' 
 The Fed has to raise rates because continued low rates would only contribute to a glut of dollars, further inflating real estate values and, eventually, other prices as well. At the same time, however, the Fed must contend with the inflationary pressures inherent in the administration's weak-dollar policy. The administration believes that it can rely on a weak dollar to fix America's huge trade imbalance, thereby avoiding the more fundamental fix of reducing the huge federal budget deficit. But a weak dollar runs the risk of inflating the prices of all goods, not just foreign ones, because as imports become more expensive, domestic producers raise prices in tandem. 
 Moreover, the outsized deficits require huge infusions of capital from abroad, and that need could also lead to higher interest rates as the Treasury attempts to lure lenders to our heavily indebted shores. 
 Against this backdrop, measured interest-rate increases may someday seem a luxury -- and that someday could be soon. In a report issued on the day after the Fed's latest rate increase, the Treasury Department reported that money flowing into the United States -- capital that is crucial to finance our deficits -- plummeted in October to $48.1 billion, a 12-month low. It was the seventh decline this year out of the 10 months for which data has been collected, and that is a bad omen for America's continued ability to finance its deficits on the terms currently being offered.
 Meanwhile, higher interest rates hurt job creation and wages. A majority of working Americans have never participated fully in this economic recovery, now more than three years old. The need to raise rates before employment and wages have rebounded is another indication of an economy off-kilter. 
 The Fed's attempt to be ''measured'' is imperiled by the administration's willingness to risk ''wrenching changes.'' The wrenching change the country really needs is to move away from profligacy and toward a semblance of balance in fiscal and trade matters.

HEADLINE: What Will Be Left When We Retire?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 My undergraduate degree in economics and 15 years of experience in the financial services industry tell me that President Bush's proposed ''privatization'' of Social Security is a bad idea. Common sense has me convinced it is a recipe for disaster. 
 Think about what would happen if just 10 percent of the population depleted their retirement funds as a result of mismanagement, poor securities markets or both: millions of Americans would be newly destitute. 
 In a country where big business dominates our culture and increasingly controls our government, disposing of one of the few financial protections for the average American is not only a bad idea, it is also immoral.

HEADLINE: Biggest Utility In New Jersey Seen as Target Of Acquisition

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
The Exelon Corporation, the owner of utilities in northern Illinois and eastern Pennsylvania, is in advanced talks to acquire New Jersey's largest utility, P.S.E.&G., for about $12 billion, executives involved in the negotiations said yesterday. 
 A deal would create the largest utility holding company in the country, with annual revenue of more than $26 billion and 25,000 employees. 
 Buying P.S.E.&G. would allow John Rowe, Exelon's chief executive, to expand his business in the Northeast, the country's largest electricity market, and add both customers and nuclear power plants to his existing assets in Illinois and Pennsylvania. The Public Service Enterprise Group, the parent of P.S.E.&G., also owns plants in California, Texas and Hawaii, as well as businesses abroad. 
 The move comes a year after Exelon abandoned its offer to buy Illinois Power from Dynegy for $425 million in cash and $1.8 billion in assumed debt.
 Exelon is also negotiating to assume $14 billion of Public Service debt, the executives involved in the discussions said. While an announcement of a deal may come as soon as next week, the executives cautioned that the terms were not yet complete and the transaction could still fall through. The talks come a year after Exelon abandoned its offer to buy Illinois Power from Dynegy for $425 million in cash and $1.8 billion in assumed debt. 
 Shares of Public Service spiked yesterday afternoon after chat boards talked about a possible merger and the Web site of The Wall Street Journal reported the talks. Shares of Public Service rose to a three-year high of $49.10 before retreating a bit to close up 3.6 percent, at $47.27.
 Exelon shares fell 1.7 percent, to $41.86. They are up 26 percent this year, compared with an 8 percent gain for Public Service.
 Exelon runs the largest nuclear power operation in the United States, including the Three Mile Island reactor in Middletown, Pa. The company accounts for 20 percent of the nation's nuclear power capacity, with a total of 10 power stations generating 18,000 megawatts of power.
 The offer comes as nuclear power advocates are pushing for the construction of new-generation power plants to offset the country's growing reliance on imported oil at a time of soaring energy costs. No nuclear plants have been built in the United States since the accident at the Three Mile Island reactor in March 1979. 
 The acquisition fits with Exelon's pattern of buying troubled companies and turning them around by selling some assets. The companies already jointly operate some power plants.
 While Exelon has a reputation of being best in class, the parent of P.S.E.&G. is viewed with more caution by industry analysts. The company's Salem power plant in southwestern New Jersey, for example, was cited this year for its poor management and lax maintenance.
 The latest deal is the largest for the industry since June 2000 when the American Electric Power Company bought the Central and South West Corporation for $12.2 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
 ''There are a lot of economies of scale to be made in the nuclear power industry,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Glenrock Associates. ''Whether you own one plant or 10, there's a certain amount of regulatory framework and oversight to deal with. There will clearly be some synergies there.''
 Exelon, which had revenue of over $15 billion last year, was formed in 2000 when the Philadelphia-based PECO Energy bought Unicom of Chicago. Exelon distributes electricity to 5.1 million consumers in northeastern Illinois and southeastern Pennsylvania. It also sells natural gas to 460,000 customers, according to the company's Web site.
 ''Over time you should see more of these deals in the industry although that's not happening too rapidly because of regulatory hurdles they face,'' Mr. Patterson said. 
 The offer is expected to face review from the states involved as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has oversight over electric and gas utilities.
 Public Service, based in Newark, employs 10,500 people and had annual revenue of $11 billion in 2003. The company operates power plants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and serves 2 million electric customers and 1.6 million gas customers. 
 The company's roots go back to 1903 when more than 400 electricity and transport companies in New Jersey were amalgamated to form the Public Service Corporation. Its operations abroad include plants in Brazil, Oman and Poland.

HEADLINE: An Overcrowded Playground In British Columbia's Future?

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SOLOMON

 BODY:
FOR some time, British Columbia has been considered a backcountry paradise for vacationers who get their thrills atop a pair of skis, in hiking boots or on a mountain bike. But now, with the enthusiastic backing of the local government, a startling growth spurt of new ski areas, resort expansions, lodges and other tourism-related development is taking place, and some people worry the changes will turn British Columbia into an overcrowded playground. 
 There is no doubt that the pace of change has been breathtaking: 
 Revelstoke Mountain Resort is expected to open within two years in southeast British Columbia with long-term plans for 25 ski lifts and a resort village with 16,000 beds. 
 Twenty-three Sno-Cat-skiing companies may now guide skiers to backcountry ridgelines, a 50 percent increase since the Liberal Party took office in 2001, according to Land and Water British Columbia, the government corporation charged with promoting development through commercial use of public lands and waters. The number of heli-skiing companies also has increased by nearly one-third, to more than 30. 
 In 2003 the government approved the Canoe Mountain resort project southwest of Jasper National Park. The all-season resort, which is expected to cost $84 million, at 1.22 Canadian dollars to the United States dollar, will have a gondola for summer sightseeing and skiing, golf courses and homes. It is expected to open in 2007.
 In October, after nearly 14 years of study and rancor, the government gave environmental approval for the $376 million Jumbo Glacier Resort, which could appear in the Purcell Mountains by the end of 2007. The resort will offer the most summer glacier-skiing on the continent.
 Including the Jumbo and Revelstoke projects, Land and Water British Columbia expects to sign six more agreements over the next 12 to 15 months, according to Bill Irwin, director of the all-seasons resort program for the agency, who added that ''each one of those projects will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.''
 Another $860 million in development is expected over the next five years at existing ski resorts, Mr. Irwin said. That is in addition to the development spurred by the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. 
 Premier Gordon Campbell, has asked the tourism industry to double its revenues by 2015. The goal is to reduce the provincial economy's reliance on the unstable crutches of logging and mining. Though tourism brings in nearly $22 million a day and is the province's largest employer, forestry and oil and gas exploration still account for most of the province's gross product. 
 British Columbia's ski resorts have experienced threefold growth since 1980, to 6.2 million skier visits a year, said Jimmie Spencer, president and chief executive officer of Canada West Ski Areas Association, which includes 60 ski areas in the province. (In comparison, Colorado had 11.2 million skier visits in the 2002-3 season.) That number is expected to hit 10 million by 2015, Mr. Spencer said. 
 British Columbia's land area is greater than that of California, Washington State and Oregon combined, but since 94 percent of the province is public land, almost every river-rafting entrepreneur, fishing guide and tour operator must gain government approval to operate. The system that the Liberal Party inherited when it took office was widely agreed to be too slow. ''We had people who were waiting for anywhere from six months to six years to be processed,'' said John Willow, director for tourism in Land and Water British Columbia's strategic initiatives division.
 Today the buzzword among political officials is ''streamlining.'' Premier Campbell's Liberal Party, more business-friendly than the rival New Democratic party , now is processing 90 percent of applications within 140 days. In September he doubled the annual budget of the government's tourism arm. 
 ''The natural resource is there,'' said Mary Mahon Jones, chief executive officer of the Council of Tourism Associations of British Columbia. ''Our challenge is now to take the resource and develop it to the extent that we can.'' 
 Some environmentalists and tourism operators worry that this fevered pursuit of tourist dollars will damage the very scenery, wildlife and solitude that lure vacationers. 
 The number of new recreation permits issued by the government has increased 127 percent over the last five fiscal years. There are now 743 permits issued to companies to use public lands, according to Mr. Willow of Land and Water British Columbia. 
 ''They've essentially thrown open the floodgates,'' said Paul Leeson, a director of the BC Wilderness Tourism Association and the owner and manager of Fortress Lake Wilderness Cabins and Purcell Lodge, two wilderness retreats that are usually reached by helicopter. Existing lodges have suffered from the influx, Mr. Leeson said, in large part because the pool of customers who want a vigorous hiking or backcountry skiing vacation is not huge. About three dozen lodges now pepper the backcountry, double the number a decade ago, according to Brad Harrison, vice president of the Backcountry Lodges of British Columbia Association. 
 Growth isn't only a threat to low vacancy rates, said Mr. Leeson. ''If you put too much into a given landscape unit it's no longer capable of providing a wilderness experience. Because a wilderness experience is not just scenery,'' he said. ''The public doesn't want a lodge in every valley, and they don't want a heli-ski operation in every valley.'' The galloping growth hurts businesses by cluttering the very wilderness that draws tourists to a province whose marketing slogan is ''Super, Natural British Columbia,'' and alienates residents who love and enjoy the land, too, he said. ''Tourism is about to become the new public enemy No. 1 in British Columbia.'' 
 Wildlife frequently feels the greatest impact from development. The Jumbo Glacier Resort would draw more than 500,000 visitors annually to a breathtaking valley where icy peaks rise from wildflower meadows, according to the provincial government. John Boulanger, a biologist hired to assist in the project's environmental review process, said it's ''very hard'' to quantify the long-term impact on the estimated 45 grizzly bears that use the area at different times. (The project, which is controversial, still must gain zoning approval from a regional council.) 
 The resort's developers point out that the environmental certificate the project received in October was preceded by years of thorough study.
 Environmentalists have also complained that the government has not imposed even greater restrictions on heli-skiing companies that use areas that are winter grounds for endangered mountain caribou, or prohibited such operations entirely. 
 British Columbia officials say that their watchword is sustainability. ''In no way is my initiative or the government's initiative out to kill the goose that lays the golden egg,'' said Sandy Santori, the new minister of state for resort development. ''People have to put into perspective,'' Mr. Santori added, ''that this is a huge, huge province.'' 
 Meredith Hamstead, a spokeswoman for the Jumbo Creek Conservation Society, which opposes the Jumbo ski resort, is pessimistic about the future. ''When we've developed the last of British Columbia's accessible wilderness, what is it that we'll have left to tell the world that they should come here to see?'' asked Ms. Hamstead. ''It will be just like everywhere else.'' 


CORRECTION-DATE: December 26, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about resort development in British Columbia referred incorrectly in some copies to an action by the provincial government on the Jumbo Glacier Resort. The project received only environmental approval; it still needs approval by a regional council.

HEADLINE: U.S. Waters Down Global Commitment to Curb Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Two weeks of negotiations at a United Nations conference here on climate change ended early Saturday with a weak pledge to start limited, informal talks on ways to slow down global warming, after the United States blocked efforts to begin more substantive discussions.
 The main focus was to discuss the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, which goes into force on Feb. 16 and will require industrial nations to make substantial cuts in their emissions of so-called greenhouse gases. But another goal had been to draw the United States, which withdrew from the accord in 2001, back into discussions about ways to mitigate climate change after 2012, when the Kyoto agreement expires.
 Governments that are already committed to reducing emissions under the Kyoto plan used diplomatic language to express their disappointment at the American position. Environmental groups, however, were more critical of what they characterized as obstructionism. 
 ''This is a new low for the United States, not just to pull out, but to block other countries from moving ahead on their own path,'' said Jeff Fiedler, an observer representing the Washington-based Natural Resources Defense Council. ''It's almost spiteful to say, 'You can't move ahead without us.' If you're not going to lead, then get out of the way.''
 Because the United States rejects the Kyoto accord, it cannot take part except as an observer in talks on global warming held under that format. It has, however, signed a broader 1992 convention on climate change that is based on purely voluntary measures, and the European Union and others had hoped to organize seminars within that framework.
 But the United States maintains it is too early to take even that step, and initially insisted that ''there shall be no written or oral report'' from any seminars. In the end, all that could be achieved was an agreement to hold a single workshop next year to ''exchange information'' on climate change.
 ''We are very flexible, but not at all costs,'' said Pieter van Geel, state secretary of the environment for the Netherlands and president of the European Union delegation. ''It must be a meaningful seminar'' with ''a report somewhere,'' he added. ''These are very modest things when you start a discussion.''
 Delegations and observer groups also criticized what they described as an effort led by Saudi Arabia and supported by the United States to hamper approval of so-called adaptation assistance. That term refers to payments that richer countries would make, mostly to poor, low-lying island countries to help them cope with the impacts of climate change. 
 The group that would receive the aid includes Pacific Ocean states like Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia, and Caribbean nations like the Bahamas and Barbados. At a news conference here on Thursday, their representatives said rising sea levels, accelerated land erosion and more intense storms were already affecting their economic development.
 But the issue was complicated by Saudi Arabia's insistence that the aid include compensation to oil-producing countries for any fall in revenues that may result from the reduction in the use of carbon fuels. The European Union, which had announced its intention to provide $400 million a year to an assistance fund, strongly opposed any such provision.
 Harlan Watson, a senior member of the American delegation, would not specifically discuss the American position other than to say there are ''always tos and fros in any negotiation.'' He described the results as ''the most comprehensive adaptation package that has ever been completed,'' and ''something that satisfied all parties.''
 The United States also stood virtually alone in challenging the scientific assumptions underlying the Kyoto Protocol. ''Science tells us that we cannot say with any certainty what constitutes a dangerous level of warming, and therefore what level must be avoided,'' Paula Dobriansky, under secretary of state for global affairs and the leader of the American delegation, said in her remarks to the conference.
 At a side meeting organized by insurance companies, however, concerns were expressed about rapidly rising payments resulting from more severe and frequent hurricanes, heat waves and flooding. Representatives of major European reinsurance companies described 2004 as ''the costliest year for the insurance industry worldwide'' and warned that worse is likely to come.
 Thomas Loster, a climate expert at the Munich Re insurance group, estimated that the cost of disasters will rise to as much as $95 billion annually, compared to an average of $70 billion over the past decade. Experts here acknowledge that extreme weather patterns have always existed, but maintain that their frequency and intensity has been increasing because of global warming.
 ''There is more and more evidence building up that indicates that whatever is going on is not natural and is no longer within the realm of variability,'' said Alden Meyer, policy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Enough research has been done, especially in the Arctic, he added, to establish that ''we are starting to see the impact of human interference'' and ''a clear pattern of human-induced climate change.''
 Those sharply different perceptions led to a clash even over what language should be used in discussing disaster relief. Bush administration emissaries opposed the use of the phrase ''climate change,'' employed since the days of the first Bush administration, in favor of ''climate variability,'' a much more nebulous term.

HEADLINE: Is There Censorship?

BYLINE: By Rachel Donadio

 BODY:
In accepting a lifetime achievement award from the National Book Foundation at a black-tie gala in Manhattan last month, Judy Blume, the doyenne of young-adult fiction, delivered herself of the following admonition: ''Your favorite teacher -- the one who made literature come alive for you, the one who helped you find exactly the book you needed when you were curious, or hurting, the one who was there to listen to you when you felt alone -- could become the next target.'' 
 A target, that is, of censorship. Blume's books, which address sexuality and religion with a frankness that has made many a grown-up squeamish, have been among the books most frequently banned from public school libraries over the years, and so the author certainly knows whereof she speaks. Yet there was something slightly alarmist in Blume's remarks. In somber, insistent tones, she spoke as if the authorities were lurking behind the doors of the Marriott Marquis ballroom ready to burst in at any moment and break up the party. 
 Blume's speech perfectly captured the mood in certain literary circles these days, where air once thick with now banned cigarette smoke instead hangs heavy with talk of the C-word. But the kind of censorship Blume has faced concerns individual libraries choosing not to lend her books, or placing restrictions on who can borrow them. It isn't about government harassment, even though that's what Blume seemed to be implying. 
 The definition of censorship has loosened so much that the word has become nearly devoid of meaning. Long gone are the days when the government banned racy books like D. H. Lawrence's ''Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' Henry Miller's ''Tropic of Cancer'' or James Joyce's ''Ulysses.'' When it comes to the written word, censorship debates are no longer about taste and decency -- although those issues are much in the news concerning the visual arts, television and radio. Instead, the debate over books tends to center on geopolitics, national security and foreign policy. 
 Today, most defenders of the written word are focusing their energies on opposing certain sections of the USA Patriot Act, chief among them Section 215, which states that federal investigators can review library and bookstore records under certain circumstances in terrorism investigations. Larry Siems, the director of international programs at the PEN American Center, strikes an oft-heard chorus when he denounces ''the growing use of government surveillance and government intrusion into your creative space.'' This, in turn, feeds a concern ''that the government is able to see more deeply into our intellectual lives,'' Siems says. 
 Where there is smoke, there may very well be fire, but there may also be mirrors. It's often hard to draw the line between perception and practice, between how certain government regulations are viewed and how they're actually being enforced. The very mention of the Patriot Act is enough to drive many publishers, writers, librarians, bookstore owners, readers and concerned citizens into a near-paranoid frenzy at the idea that the government is intruding into their personal business, although few can cite specific instances in which that is the case. 
 Indeed, the marketing department of any given publishing house probably has far more power over free expression in America than any government office; if it decides a smart book won't sell, the publisher may not sign it. Attitudes are rampant, but facts are harder to find. And ultimately, grandstanding and self-righteousness obscure the fact that some cases do approach government censorship. 
 Consider two recent lawsuits. This fall, a group of publishers and Shirin Ebadi, a lawyer and leading women's rights advocate in Iran who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, filed two separate lawsuits against the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which places serious restrictions on importing written work by authors in Iran, Sudan, Cuba and other countries under United States trade embargo. Under these regulations, buying the rights to unwritten books or making significant editorial changes to written works without a license is considered ''providing a service,'' and therefore akin to trading with the enemy, something punishable with jail time and fines of up to $1 million. Publishers argue that this regulation violates the First Amendment. 
 OFAC devotes most of its resources to investigating terrorist financing and narcotics trafficking, and the regulations are largely intended for those aims. Some of the regulations at issue have been on the books for decades -- the Trading With the Enemy Act dates to 1917 -- and since the 80's amendments have been added to exempt ''informational materials'' from being subject to sanctions. But the current fuss dates back to this spring, when the Office of Foreign Assets Control issued a particularly stiff response to a query from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, which wanted to publish papers by scientists from countries under embargo. The Treasury office ruled that the institute could edit a manuscript from a country under embargo, and engage in peer review, but that making any ''substantive or artistic alterations or enhancements of the manuscript'' would be illegal without a license. Likewise, no publisher could market a book and no literary agent could sign an author from an embargoed country without a license. 
 This sent the publishers through the roof. In September, Arcade, an independent publisher; the international writers' organization PEN; the Association of American University Presses; and a division of the Association of American Publishers filed suit against the foreign assets office. ''I think that censorship is the biggest danger that could confront this country, aside from physical attack,'' Richard Seaver, the editor in chief of Arcade Publishing, said in a recent interview in his comfortably cluttered Manhattan office. ''Censorship is never dead. It can always rear its ugly head. The danger is greater today than in the past 30 years.''
 A month later, Ebadi -- the Iranian human rights lawyer (and Iran's first Nobelist), who under the rules can't sell her memoir to an American publisher -- filed her own suit, along with the Strothman Agency of Boston, which can't officially represent her. Ebadi raised the censorship question in an Op-Ed article in The Times last month (which she could publish because newspapers are exempt from some of the regulations). ''If even people like me -- those who advocate peace and dialogue -- are denied the right to publish their books in the United States with the assistance of Americans, then people will seriously question the view of the United States as a country that advocates democracy and freedom everywhere,'' she wrote. ''What is the difference between the censorship in Iran and this censorship in the United States? Is it not better to encourage a dialogue between Iranians and the American public?'' 
 Salman Rushdie, the president of the board of trustees of the PEN American Center and an old hand at such debates, wrote in a declaration as part of the suit: ''Writers in Iran, Cuba and Sudan cannot publish freely in their own countries. It is a tragic and dangerous irony that Americans may not freely publish the works of those writers here, either.'' Publishers say several books have been suspended or canceled pending the ruling, including ''City of Columns: Historic Architecture of Havana'' by Alejo Carpentier (Smithsonian Institution Press), ''The Encyclopedia of Cuban Music'' (Temple University Press) and a paper by geologists at Shiraz University in Iran for an issue of the journal Mathematical Geology. ''Even if there isn't a single case where they actually prosecuted, there's a famous chilling effect,'' says Leon Friedman, a lawyer for PEN and Arcade who helped bring the lawsuit. ''Publishers just won't take a chance.''
 Molly Millerwise, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, declined to comment on the lawsuits. She says that over the years, no more than a dozen license applications have been submitted, most of them since last year, and none have been denied, although some are still pending. She says the department encourages publishers to approach them with queries. 
 So why don't the publishers simply apply for a license? Just ask any self-respecting publisher. ''I'm not going to ask permission,'' Seaver says. ''That's the Iranian way of doing things.'' He says Arcade is going full speed ahead with ''Strange Times, My Dear: The PEN Anthology of Contemporary Iranian Literature,'' which is due out in April. He acknowledges that the lawsuit might help draw attention to the book. ''I think libraries will be more attentive because they will have to be. Booksellers, too.'' 
 You can't help getting the sense that there is a certain amount of public relations going on here. Ebadi could conceivably have sold the rights to her memoirs in Britain, and the British publisher could have subsequently sold the American rights. But that wasn't the point. ''American readers deserve to be hearing directly from someone like Ebadi,'' says Wendy Strothman, the literary agent and former publishing executive who is informally representing Ebadi. Strothman says Ebadi might well have been able to get a license ''because of her stature as a Nobel laureate,'' but the lawsuit was ''a matter of principle.'' It's also not entirely clear whether the Treasury Department would allow an American publisher to import such a work from Britain. ''There are so many weighing factors,'' Millerwise says. 
 Ebadi hasn't yet written her memoir. In her statement to the court, which reads a little like a book proposal, Ebadi says her book would discuss ''how I became a lawyer, a judge and a law professor despite the obvious and often official obstacles women in Iran have had to face.''
 There certainly does seem to be a market for Iranian women's memoirs. Both lawsuits cite the success of Azar Nafisi's best-selling ''Reading Lolita in Tehran,'' about a group of women who met weekly in secret to read forbidden works of Western literature, and of ''Persepolis,'' Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel about growing up during the Iranian revolution. Nafisi emigrated to Washington in 1997, and Satrapi now lives in France; neither could have published her book in Iran. For her part, Nafisi says she finds the Treasury Department regulations ''mind-boggling,'' and has written a letter to the court supporting Ebadi's suit. ''I understand sometimes there might be sanctions,'' Nafisi says. ''The point about this law is the people it will hurt are the people who have been suppressed in that country anyway.'' She continues: ''The principle of publishing should be understanding, should be more knowledge. On principle I think you have to publish even Ayatollah Khomeni!'' 
 Although the Treasury rules have been on the books for ages, the lawsuits play into the literary world's general dislike of the Bush administration. When the regulations ''reached international ears, it was a very clear example to the international community of a kind of American cultural closed-mindedness,'' Larry Siems of PEN says. ''I spent a lot of time explaining to my international colleagues that this was not this administration's doing.'' 
 Both lawsuits may very well be settled in the coming months. In November the Treasury Department asked for a one-month extension so it could file its response to the suits in January. ''The reason for the requested extension is that the parties anticipate that there may be developments with a possibly significant effect on the posture of the case, such that the briefing may need to be refocused or may even prove unnecessary,'' the Treasury Department's attorney wrote to the judge, according to a copy of the letter provided by the Strothman Agency's lawyer. The group of publishers received a similar letter, one of its lawyers said. Both sets of plaintiffs agreed to the extension. It remains to be seen whether the Treasury Department will adjust its regulations or rule only on those specific cases. 
 Meanwhile, these lawsuits have provided many in the literary and publishing world with a cause -- one that's far more concrete than nebulous fears about the Bush administration or the Patriot Act. And it's certainly more satisfying to focus on censorship than on the future of publishing. It also seems to get the creative juices flowing. ''There's always a clash, an underlying tension, between politics, which is basically trying to keep the status quo, and literature, which is constantly questioning the status quo,'' Nafisi says. ''This tension between politics and culture is healthy. Each of us are playing our roles.'' You might say that all this conflict about infringements -- both real and perceived -- on free expression bodes well for free expression.

HEADLINE: A Modest Proposal: Israel Joining NATO

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: HERZLIYA, Israel 

 BODY:
THE death of Yasir Arafat has been like the holing of a dam on a long-blocked river, with a sudden and powerful surge of optimism and new ideas in the Middle East, even if some of them are still rather muddy.
 One of the most intriguing is the suggestion that Israel, which has always seen itself as a singular David among Goliaths, should consider joining NATO.
 The idea, at least, is that closer ties to NATO -- and perhaps eventual membership -- would embed Israel in the West and, by providing security guarantees, give it more confidence to make a comprehensive peace.
 Such logic stands in contrast with a core lesson that Israel's founding generation took from the Holocaust: in the end, the Jewish people should count only on themselves to guarantee their survival. 
 But Uzi Arad, a former Israeli intelligence official who heads the Institute for Policy and Strategy, says it is time for Israel to ''drop its Groucho attitude'' toward NATO and work ''to establish a solid and comprehensive partnership with both the United States and Europe.''
 Mr. Arad chairs an annual conference here on security that draws senior Israeli and foreign policy makers and analysts. This year, he is urging Israel to get over its mistrust of alliances and lessen its isolation. He argues that the prospect of a nuclear Iran makes better ties with NATO more logical and urgent.''The Euro-Atlantic community is Israel's natural habitat,'' he says.
 In his efforts, he has been joined by former American and European officials who helped manage the two expansions of NATO since the Soviet collapse and draft NATO's Partnership for Peace, which has countries like Georgia and Azerbaijan prettying themselves up for possible membership.
 One former American official, Ronald Asmus, who is now with the German Marshall Fund, said he has wondered why NATO, which extends through Turkey and is fighting in Afghanistan, was seeking partnership with Georgia and not Israel. ''Israel is already a Western democracy that shares our values and interests in a part of the world that is becoming central to NATO,'' he said. ''So why is Israel off limits?''
 Of course, the prospect of closer ties with Israel would create debate within NATO, especially in the absence of a final Israeli-Palestinian settlement. But first Israel itself needs to talk through the military and political pros and cons, and decide if the organization is a club it wants to associate with.
 While the idea of Israeli membership may seem a stretch, it could only be raised because NATO is reinventing itself. Originally a military alliance designed to deter or fight the Soviet Union in Europe, NATO has become a broader and more political association of democracies with a partnership role for former enemies, including Russia.
 Especially after the Sept. 11 attacks, NATO is concerned much more with terrorism than with tanks, and is developing a Middle Eastern avocation, since that is where most of today's threats to its members lie. From Islamic radicalism to potential Iranian nuclear missiles, the threats are much the same as Israel faces, and Israeli intelligence knows a great deal about them.
 As for Israel, the collapse of the Oslo accords and the last four years of warfare with the Palestinians have badly undermined the dream, which began with Zionism, of a Jewish state taking its proud place as an integral part of the Middle East, accepted by its neighbors. Like Oslo, it was a lovely vision, but it is in tatters.
 In economic, trade and technology terms, too, Israel's connections to Europe dwarf any it has with its own region. Half of Israel's imports come from the European Union, which absorbs a third of Israel's exports. And Israel already has a very close relationship with the union and its institutions. Still, Israelis worry that the occupation of Palestinian territory, Israeli settlement policies and the last four years of fighting have badly hurt their reputation in Europe, and even in the United States.
 The Israeli military is skeptical about closer NATO ties, Israeli officials say, because it fears losing any freedom of action. Israel retains a fierce commitment to doing whatever may be necessary to preserve its existence and security, however distasteful such actions may be to others -- whether assassinating Hamas leaders, detaining suspects without trial or destroying the homes of suicide bombers and militants.
 There is also the question of Israel's privately acknowledged nuclear capacity. And Europeans express some anxiety about how Arab nations might react.
 The benefits for Israel would be significant, said an ambassador here from a European NATO country. Threats and risks the Middle East may present, he said, include not only a nuclear Iran but also ''an Islamicized Saudi Arabia or a collapsing Egypt.''
 FOR Europeans, too, he said, there is a potential benefit beyond Israel's military and intelligence assets. ''We mustn't let Israel divide Europe from the United States,'' he said. ''NATO can help the Israelis extricate themselves from this mess of occupation.'' 
 Before anything can happen, though, the Israelis will have to think through their future interests, NATO officials say.
 ''The initiative will have to come from the Israeli side,'' said Sir Peter Ricketts, the British ambassador to NATO. ''But if so, there will be a strong echo back.'' 
 NATO, at its summit meeting in Istanbul in June, opened the possibility of relationships with each Middle Eastern country. Mr. Arad would like Israel to seize the chance, and start with an arrangement like Sweden's -- no full membership, but compatibility of forces and consultation. Membership could come later, if at all.
 NATO's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, is coming to Israel next spring to press the case. He has promised to work for closer ties if Israel wants them. By the time he visits, Israeli officials say, they are likely to have the beginnings of an answer.

HEADLINE: A Political Arabesque

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I have long believed that any American general or senior diplomat who wants to work in Iraq should have to pass a test. It would be a very simple test. It would consist of only one question: ''Do you think the shortest distance between two points is a straight line?''
 If you answered ''Yes,'' you would not be allowed to work in Iraq. You could go to Korea, Japan or Germany -- but not Iraq. Only those who understand that in the Middle East the shortest distance between two points is never a straight line should be allowed to carry out U.S. policy there. 
 What I worry about most right now -- after a week in the Persian Gulf -- is that we have entered a really complex, arabesque phase in Iraq. It requires enormous understanding of the complexities of Iraqi and Arab politics and the ability to produce outcomes not by the traditional, straightforward U.S. approach, but by the more subtle, bazaar-oriented politics in that part of the world.
 For instance, with the elections in Iraq only six weeks away, and Iran actively using its influence and money to push its candidates, one thing is perfectly clear: The Bush neocons desperately need an Iraqi neo-Baath.
 By that I mean they need to find a political framework that will advance the interests of the pro-Baath Sunni Arab nationalists in Iraq, but do it with a more progressive, pluralistic outlook than the old Baath Party of Saddam Hussein.
 This is what we should be most focused on right now in Iraq -- not the bogeyman of Iranian influence. There is no way to prevent Iranian influence in Iraq. Iran is next door and it has myriad economic and cultural links with Iraqi Shiites. Moreover, while the Iraqi Shiites are certain to emerge with the most seats in the new Iraqi parliament, and while some are pro-Iranian, the majority of Iraqi Shiites have no intention of being ruled from Tehran. The Iraqi Shiites are Arabs, not Persians, and they are aware of their Arabness. Any Iraqi leader who is depicted or presents himself as the cat's-paw of Tehran will face a backlash.
 The best way to reduce Iran's influence, and to prevent civil war, is to ensure as much Sunni participation in the election as possible, so that when the new Iraqi constitution is written, the more secular Iraqi Kurds and Sunnis will balance the more religious-oriented Shiites. If there is not enough Sunni participation, the elections, rather than defusing civil strife in Iraq, will increase it, because all the spoils will go to the Shiites and Kurds, and the Sunnis will feel even more excluded.
 For all these reasons, the Bush team should be working with Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Arab states and even Syria to use all their contacts with Iraqi Sunnis to embolden them to take part in the elections -- and to make sure they have bags of money to get out the vote, particularly among the Sunni tribes. It is imperative the Sunnis be brought in, even if some have to be bought. 
 Unfortunately, America's Arab friends ''are doing nothing'' right now, a senior Iraqi minister told me. The Americans need to be more demanding of their Arab friends, he said. While many Arab leaders are appalled at the idea of Shiites ruling an Arab state in the otherwise Sunni-dominated Arab world, they also know that a civil war in Iraq would lead to terrible instability at a time when all these Arab regimes understand they have to start reforming. 
 Yes, the U.S. invasion of Iraq made America some new enemies, but it also has triggered a huge debate about reform in the Arab world, said Ammar Abdulhamid, who helps run DarEmar, a pro-reform NGO in Syria. ''For some people it forced the reform issue, because they said, 'Let's change ourselves before the Americans change us,''' noted Mr. Abdulhamid. Some Arab liberals want to use the U.S. presence to pressure their governments to go ahead with reform. Some regimes are feeling very vulnerable and believe the only way to stave off the Americans is to be seen as working on reforms. But one way or another, ''the Iraqi issue is forcing the issue of reform on everyone, and in some ways it is independent of what actually happens in Iraq,'' Mr. Abdulhamid said. 
 A sophisticated U.S. approach that uses both sticks and carrots with Syria, Iran and America's Arab allies could still shape a decent election in Iraq, but we have to get in gear right now, and be smart. Does this administration have anyone who knows how to play this game? Attention: Iraq is having an election. Elections are rare in this part of the world, so when they happen, everyone in the neighborhood tries to vote. We need to make sure our friends do as well.

HEADLINE: How to Succeed on Wall Street, Conflict-Free

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
GREGORY P. TAXIN was appalled at the state of brokerage firm research at the turn of the century. The system was so broken that he decided the only way to give investors what they really needed was to start from scratch. 
 Mr. Taxin would create a firm, Glass Lewis & Company, that would provide big stock investors with sharply analytical and unbiased advice. The surprise is how quickly Glass Lewis, based in San Francisco, has established itself since he set up shop with two co-founders in 2003.
 In the two years since the regulatory investigation into Wall Street research highlighted conflicts of interest at brokerage firms, many independent research firms have sprung up to serve investors who fear that analysis from companies with investment banking operations might still be biased in favor of clients, or potential clients. One requirement of the $1.4 billion deal struck by the Wall Street firms to settle the investigation was that they offer customers independent research as well as their own. 
 But while many independent research shops have struggled, Glass Lewis has thrived, attracting clients that include 7 of the top 10 mutual fund companies and 9 of the 15 largest public pension funds. Over all, its customers manage $8 trillion in assets.
 The firm started to take shape in 2002, when Mr. Taxin was a technology banker at Banc of America Securities. He and his co-founders, Lawrence M. Howell, an investment banker, and Kevin J. Cameron, a lawyer who had been general counsel at several technology companies, began serious discussions to start a research firm.
 Glass Lewis's formation followed the stock market collapse of 2000, when it became painfully clear how woeful Wall Street analysts had been at identifying risks in companies. But it also occurred as public companies' financial statements were becoming increasingly complex and as scrutiny of institutional investors' votes on proxy issues became more intense.
 ''Investors were getting little help from analysts on accounting, financial transparency issues, corporate governance or corporate integrity,'' said Mr. Taxin, who is 35. ''Helping investors answer the question, 'Is this management team working in the interest of shareholders, or is there some other motivation for their conduct?' takes a strange mix of accounting, legal, financial and Wall Street expertise that hadn't been put together under one roof.''
 The firm was named for two Supreme Court justices who fought for individual rights and ethical corporate practices, Mr. Taxin said. ''Glass'' is derived from the surname of William O. Douglas, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman and a justice from 1939 to 1975, while ''Lewis'' is a bow to Louis D. Brandeis, a justice from 1916 to 1939 who wrote ''Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It.''
 Neither Glass Lewis nor its principals invest in any securities on which it reports. And it does not manage money for its own account or for others. 
 Glass Lewis's first hire was Lynn E. Turner, its managing director of research and a chief accountant of the S.E.C. from July 1998 to August 2001. Mr. Turner is a vocal critic of the accounting gimmicks used by companies to dress up their financial statements.
 He oversees 30 analysts who follow 6,200 companies worldwide. Most of his staff members have advanced degrees in accounting, law, finance or public policy. The firm is best known, however, for the advice it gives investors about how to vote their proxies at corporate meetings. Glass Lewis has unseated Institutional Shareholder Services of Rockville, Md., from its position as the undisputed leader in the field. 
 Glass Lewis was able to compete aggressively with I.S.S. because the firms differ in their business structures. I.S.S., for example, provides governance advice to public companies in addition to recommending how shareholders should vote on proxy issues. Glass Lewis provides no governance advice. 
 By advising both companies and their shareholders on corporate governance issues, I.S.S. has created a potential for bias, some former clients say. This has opened the door to Glass Lewis.
 Cynthia L. Richson, corporate governance officer for the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, a $62 billion pension fund, said she and her colleagues recently searched for a proxy advisory service. ''It was basically Glass Lewis or I.S.S.,'' she said. ''I recommended to the board that we go with Glass Lewis because of the actual or perceived conflicts at I.S.S. coupled with the fact that I had worked with Lynn Turner, who is an extremely competent accountant and is very committed to protecting investors.''
 Patrick McGurn, the chief counsel at I.S.S., said that his firm's corporate governance advice accounts for only 15 percent of revenue and is simply a diagnostic tool to help companies understand how a change in their practices will produce different results in their scores versus peers. ''We are obviously not going to potentially compromise our institutional business for any marginal additional revenue we get from the corporate business,'' he said. ''These products lead to companies making very substantial changes in their governance.''
 Kenneth F. Broad, a portfolio manager at Transamerica Investment Management in San Francisco, says Glass Lewis's reports have been especially informative and clear about the economic costs to shareholders from companies' stock option grants. Given that Mr. Turner, a longtime proponent of accounting for options as an employee expense, sets the tone among the firm's analysts, this approach is not unexpected.
 ''They give a better snapshot of what the real economic cost of an option plan is,'' Mr. Broad said. ''They look at it as a percent of value transfer versus a percent of market cap. I have found them to be very truth-seeking; they want to get to the right answer.'' 
 The company's research often focuses on companies with aggressive accounting, significant litigation risks, unclear financial disclosure and transactions between affiliated companies and people that may create conflicts. Glass Lewis says these undetected risks can be crucial to shareholder returns. The reports appear only when a noteworthy development occurs.
 In the 12 months ended Sept. 30, Glass Lewis wrote up 30 companies for what its analysts saw as unrecognized risks in reporting or operations. From the time of the reports to last Friday, shares in 23 of the 30 had dropped at least 10 percent, and 8 of those 23 had fallen more than 45 percent. 
 Last June, for example, Glass Lewis issued an alert on the Andrx Corporation, a drug maker in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., questioning its reversal of a bad-debt provision, among other things. The reversal let the company meet its quarterly forecast, Glass Lewis said.
 THE company's revenue recognition also troubled Glass Lewis, according to the report, which was issued when Andrx's stock was at $27.55. In August, the company reported weak results and recorded $33 million in extraordinary charges. The stock fell to $17.46 the next day; it has since climbed to $21.47. Andrx did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
 Mr. Taxin says the firm hopes that its research and proxy advice will help enforce good corporate conduct. While most companies do the right thing, he said, some will always flout the rules. ''You have to discover them and alert shareholders when companies are doing questionable things,'' he said. ''You have to fight them where it really matters -- in their pocketbooks.''

HEADLINE: A Tree Seller Builds a Street-Level Duplex

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
DANIEL LEMAY was mock-testy last Saturday when a reporter brandished a measuring tape. ''Do you think I don't know how big my house is?'' he said with exaggerated horror, eyebrows at full hoist. 
 Since Dec. 1, Mr. Lemay, a 36-year-old French Canadian computer graphics designer who spends most of the year in a commercial loft outside downtown Montreal, has been living in a 8-by-5-foot duplex hut, 10 feet high, made from quarter-inch plywood and decorated with birch saplings, French doors, plexiglass windows, floodlights, Christmas wreaths, a green plastic storm fence and a complex rig of colored lights. 
 Set beneath a street light on Second Avenue between 10th and 11th Streets and looking toward St. Mark's-in-the-Bowery Church, Mr. Lemay's temporary home, or abre, as he calls it, is both office and shelter, the hub of his Christmas tree business, which he runs until midnight on Dec. 24.
 In contrast to his competitors, most of whom are merely camping -- shacked up in R.V.'s, pickup trucks and vans around the city -- Mr. Lemay's home this month displays all the folksy, architectural elan of a hand-built Buckminster Fuller dome or a tricked-out yurt. (Even his partner, Bart Miazga, is sleeping in a van in front of the schoolyard at Mary Help of Christians Church around the corner on First Avenue.)
 St. Mark's is Mr. Lemay's landlord, to whom he and Mr. Miazga pay 10 percent of their roughly $30,000 in sales. The church provides power, a washroom and a veneer of good works -- added value for an enterprise that runs on holiday spirits. 
 Not that holiday spirit is in short supply at Chez Lemay. To be sure, Mr. Lemay and his tree brethren make a few thousand dollars each for their 24/7, 24-day efforts each year, but for Mr. Lemay, who is overseeing his 10th Manhattan Christmas, the lark of it all trumps the perfectly adequate but by no means extraordinary fiscal rewards. 
 Combining street theater with an Outward Bound leader's manifesto -- respect the land, make do with what's on hand, be neat -- Mr. Lemay, though tied to his plywood universe like a joey to his mother's pouch, is clearly having a glorious time. Displaying a dizzying array of sweater fashion, he's the mayor of Abe Lebewohl Park in front of the church-- a 0.155-acre, cobblestoned triangular park, named for the late proprietor of the Second Avenue Deli -- happily expounding on the difference between a balsam and a Douglas fir, the economy and Cadillac models of his product. He will hurl children happily into the tops of trees stacked along the iron gates of the churchyard, or saw off a stump to point out the growth rings to an 8-year-old.
 ''I need to do it each year; I need my social fix,'' he said. ''You just stand on the sidewalk and the world comes to you.''
 Five years ago, when Mr. Lemay and Mr. Miazga struck out on their own, after five years with a New York-based tree seller, the world was greeted by two sticks and a tarp. Two years later, a lean-to. Last year, four walls and a roof. 
 Like any good designer, Mr. Lemay looked around the neighborhood and picked up its architectural vernacular: the scaffold. 
 ''I thought, let's build a scaffold and wrap it with wood and trees,'' he said. He saw a pile of scaffolding at a friend's garage in Brooklyn and bought it for $50. Another day, a guy in a pickup truck idling on Second Avenue, with two French doors in the back, asked Mr. Lemay to feed the parking meter for him. 
 Which Mr. Lemay was delighted to do, in exchange for the French doors. One is the door to his living room/office; the other, set in horizontally, is its picture window, strung with tiny white lights. Plastic plant pots are nailed in rows as pigeonholes, filled with saw blades, sugar packets, walkie-talkies, plastic forks and napkins, Dunhill cigarettes and the compact edition of Webster's New World Dictionary of American English. Upstairs is a tangle of sleeping bags and cans of maple syrup -- a gift with purchase to favored customers. 
 Other found objects include two plexiglass windows, two office chairs and, this year, three door-sized painted white plywood panels that Mr. Lemay has deployed as a kind of storefront awning, dotted with evergreen wreathes.
 Mr. Lemay shares his home this year with Justin Tremblay, 25, who lives year-round in the tiny town of Angliers (population 324, Mr. Tremblay said), nine hours northwest of Montreal. Mr. Tremblay says he will use his earnings as Mr. Lemay's nightwatchman to help fight the efforts of a private power company to dam waterways around Mr. Tremblay's town for hydropower. He explained all this with great passion the other morning, and then climbed up the ladder to his rest. 
 ''You don't have to speak quietly,'' he said to a visitor. ''I can sleep through anything.''
 Mr. Tremblay's shift is from midnight to 7, during which he deflects the attentions and redirects the perambulations of local riff-raff: pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers. A young woman early Saturday morning wondered if she might pay for a tree with cash or ''in there,'' she said, gesturing toward the shelter. Mr. Tremblay waved her off. ''That stuff doesn't work well with Christmas trees,'' Mr. Lemay said. ''We have to reinforce that.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Lemay and Mr. Tremblay's constant housekeeping keeps this stretch of Second Avenue, which normally is host to a small but tenacious population of drunk old men hurling garbage and insults to the street and passers-by, squeaky clean and sweet-smelling. 
 Christmas tree work for the two men begins in November, when they spend 10 days scouting local growers in the Eastern Township. It takes 10 days to harvest and customize the trees, as Mr. Lemay put it, and then the haul of just over 1,000 trees is driven by 18-wheeler down to New York, in a convoy that this year included a Chevy pickup and Mr. Miazga's van. Last Sunday was their best day yet, with sales of about 120 trees, including a 10-footer at 10:30 that night, to a family of six. 
 Next Friday, Mr. Lemay will trash most of his abre, saving the scaffolding, the French doors and the plexiglass windows, which he stores in the basement of the church. He is already planning next year's construction.
 ''I would like,'' he said slowly, ''to make a replica of the church.'' Mr. Tremblay has his heart set on a log cabin.

BACK FROM THE LAND
How Young Americans Went to Nature
in the 1970's, and Why They Came Back.
By Eleanor Agnew.
Illustrated. 274 pp. Ivan R. Dee. $27.50.
 IN the summer of 1989 I was a speaker at a memorial for Abbie Hoffman. This was a rolling and unstructured all-day event, but at the closing moment the stage held the simultaneous presence of Bobby Seale, Norman Mailer, Amiri Baraka, William Kunstler, Terry Southern, Allen Ginsberg and one or two others whose names collectively spelled ''sixties.'' Camera lights popped and there were many independent filmmakers squinting through lenses. I later wanted a photograph of myself in this lineup, but was told after exhaustive inquiries that none of the organizers or participants could lay hands on even one. Thus I rediscovered the metaphysical truth that if you claim to recall the decade you were not really there. (Also, if you lay any claim to have been commemorating the high points of the 60's after a lapse of two further decades there is no proof that you were there, either.) 
 Yet photographs (plus a certain pungent reek that some people, such as myself, never actually inhaled) are the best mnemonic prompting. To turn the shiny pages of ''Hippie'' is to breathe deeply. My copy fell open at a manifesto by Frank Zappa, in which he admitted that ''A freak is not a freak if ALL are freaks,'' and went on to assert that ''Looking and acting eccentric IS NOT ENOUGH.'' How true. And yet, what a long time it took to find that out. Here they all are: Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Brian Jones -- this book includes a good deal of the British scene -- Bob Dylan and Timothy Leary. (The latter, the last time I saw him in the early 90's, was planning to have himself cryogenically frozen but was ''not to be reanimated during a Republican administration.'') Occasionally, there is a picture that jars. What exactly is Martin Luther King Jr. doing in a book with a title like this? He is standing on a road outside Selma under a billowing Stars and Stripes. He's wearing a suit and tie. He's not even trying to look or act eccentric, let alone freakish. 
 The marketing of the 60's has come to necessitate the blending of quite discrepant images: the dogs of Selma and the bearded Puritans of the Cuban revolution, along with the moon-faced narcissists and dropouts of Haight-Ashbury and the groupie-draped avatars of rock. (Francis Ford Coppola later managed this subliminal association even better, synthesizing the music of The Doors with the near-psychedelic bloom of napalm in the verdant foliage.) This would be another way of saying that the days of love and peace had their sordid and nasty side, too. The Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco was idyllic for about five minutes before the following famous flier was distributed:
 ''Pretty little 16-year-old middle-class chick comes to the Haight to see what it's all about & gets picked up by a 17-year-old street dealer who spends all day shooting her full of speed again & again, then feeds her 3,000 mikes & raffles off her temporarily unemployed body for the biggest Haight Street gang bang since the night before last. The politics & ethics of ecstasy.''
 The ''3,000 mikes'' there are micrograms of LSD (''Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'' in the Sergeant Pepper ecstatic version) and represent 12 times the ''normal'' dose. I still know people who undertook such voyages of the imagination, or had them inflicted upon themselves, and who never quite came back. 
 It is conventional to say that ''the 60's'' of the herbivorous -- in both senses -- Woodstock ended with the homicidal events of the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont (where Hell's Angels beat and stabbed a man to death in front of the stage) and with the sadistic fiesta of Charles Manson on Cielo Drive in Beverly Hills. Why is it conventional to say this? Largely because it is true. The Christlike beard of John Lennon mutates into the Judas-like visage of ''Charlie,'' whose disciples were robotic and spaced-out sadists. It was an open secret even at the time that some of the supposed ''communes'' were places of twisted, paranoid cultism -- the pseudo-Satanic ''Process'' group was one such warning -- and in retrospect the subsequent events of Jonestown seem easy to predict.
 Yet Frank Zappa and John Lennon were icons on the wall of Vaclav Havel, who had always considered himself a ''60's person'' and, two decades later, helped bring down an unsmiling authoritarianism without a shot being fired -- and to the accompaniment of a joyous effusion of rock music, jazz, improvised theater and blue jeans. To the extent that the decade had a moral seriousness that could be transmitted forward, this inhered in the partly spontaneous opposition to an unjust war in Indochina, and to the coincidence of this movement with the battle for civil rights. To this day, there are people who are convinced that they took part in these struggles just by being young and alive at the time, and who have the beads and the Dylan albums to prove it. A great merit of ''What's Going On?'' is that it recreates, more in words than pictures -- though there are some arresting photographs -- the especially tough way in which this was all fought out in the nation's most various and politicized state (if I may say that without offending New York readers). It was in the San Francisco Bay Area, especially, that the convergence of campus rebels, black militants and antiwar activists was most vividly on show. Many of the activists were short-haired and white-shirted Marxists of one stripe or another, who leafleted factories and served in the field with indentured farmworkers while trying to ''shut down'' the bases and induction centers that serviced the hideous war on the other side of the Pacific. Easy as it is to mock the atmosphere of Berkeley -- ''Berserkely'' -- in those days, there was a thread that connected the free speech movement to the freedom riders and to the exposure of depraved statecraft overseas, and this volume restores that connection with exemplary force. A rather telling chapter, toward the end of the book, recounts the long battle to build a Vietnam memorial in Orange County, Calif., this time to honor the many thousands of Vietnamese who fought against Ho Chi Minh and whose refugee families constitute one of the largest minorities in the state. It's brave of the editors to have included what many people think of as an irony of history -- an irony that is at their own expense.
 The friends I just mentioned, who took LSD and never quite returned from the trip, are in a different category from the friends who left town and seemingly disappeared altogether. Every now and then, one would hear people talk in mysterious tones about log cabins or geodesic domes on virgin land in Vermont or Montana, and the growing of organic vegetables. John Denver's song ''Country Roads'' made West Virginia a favored destination. Then there would be a brisk exit from the blighted city, with a car towing an assortment of furniture, tools, pets and sometimes children. The pull of nature and authenticity, so imbricated in the original material of the American Dream, had overcome the easy temptations of materialism. For me, there are only two really memorable scenes in ''Easy Rider.'' The first is when Jack Nicholson edges in from the side of the screen and we know at once that something has happened to American acting. The second is when Fonda and Hopper pull up at a remote rural commune where, among other things, bearded boys and full-skirted girls are broadcasting seeds into furrows from improvised sacks. (''You can tell just by looking,'' said a comrade of mine at the time, ''that nothing's gonna grow in those furrows except footprints.'') There was always a slight embarrassment to be experienced when these would-be Amish came sidling back to town, to resume work in brokerages and banks and universities. To this day, that especially vile reminder of the epoch -- the graying and greasy ponytail trailing off the balding pate -- is their living memorial. 
 Eleanor Agnew's lovely memoir of this movement of primal innocence is at once honest and hilarious. She recaptures the period with unerring skill: a period when the Apollo mission had shown us our fragile, blue planetary home from outer space, thus promoting (first) ''The Whole Earth Catalog'' and (second) a mentality that despised the science and innovation necessary for the taking of that photograph in the first place. 
 Countless educated young Americans went off the map, in pursuit of Walden or some other version of bucolic utopia. They learned to chop wood and sometimes to grow crops, and they got hypothermia and piles. 
 Irving Howe, when attacked for being a sellout by some young master of certitude at Columbia University, turned on his tormentor and hissed: ''You know what you're going to be? You're going to end up as a dentist.'' This was meant, in the context, as an impressive put-down of bourgeois aspirations. Yet here is John Armstrong, from a family of dentists in Michigan, who is introduced to us by Agnew with the perfect pitch she brings to quotations. Armstrong ''started a premed program in college but 'quickly discovered that medicine wasn't my bag, which shouldn't be misconstrued to mean that I had the slightest clue as to what my bag might be.' '' With his new wife Darma -- a name that just might be coincidental -- he embarked on homesteading in the Upper Peninsula of his home state and found it very snowy indeed. 
 It was probably just as well that neither he nor Darma needed the services of a dentist -- surely one of civilization's great boons -- during the time when they were frozen in. Agnew is at her driest and wittiest when she describes the reaction of her sodbusting ''sisters,'' in particular, to the hygienic arrangements and then to the knotty question of natural childbirth. More than one agreed to have a baby on a kitchen table before getting pregnant again and heading as fast as possible back to town for ''serious numbing drugs.'' 
 If you look back to the founding document of the 60's left, which was the Port Huron statement (also promulgated in Michigan), you will easily see that it was in essence a conservative manifesto. It spoke in vaguely Marxist terms of alienation, true, but it was reacting to bigness and anonymity and urbanization, and it betrayed a yearning for a lost agrarian simplicity. It forgot what Marx had said, about the dynamism of capitalism and ''the idiocy of rural life.'' Earlier 18th- and 19th-century American communards had often been fleeing or preparing for a coming Apocalypse, and their emulators in the 1960's and 1970's followed this trope as well, believing everything they read about the impending crash, or the exhaustion of the world's resources. The crazy lean-to of the Unabomber began to take dim shape at that period, even if many of the new pioneers were more affected by the work of the pacific Tolstoy or of C. Wright Mills (who used to recommend, if memory serves, that people should build their own cars as well as their own houses). 
 Is there a moral to point out here? Of course there is. Maybe more than one. The first is that, as Agnew deftly notes, more of her friends ought to have read about the Joad family before setting out. The second is that not all was wasted or futile. Everybody in society now has a better idea of our relationship with the natural order and our kinship with animals, and we are no longer so casual about what once seemed the endless bounty of our environment. In some ways, we have the ''love generation'' to thank for this. Meanwhile, though, the anti-globalization movement has started to reject modernity altogether, to set its sights on laboratories and on the idea of the division of labor, and to adopt symbols from Fallujah as the emblems of its resistance. Conservatism cannot and does not, despite itself, remain static. It mutates into something far more reactionary than anything from which the hippies were ever fleeing.

HEADLINE: Uncharitable?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Cohn. 
Jonathan Cohn is a senior editor at The New Republic. He is writing a book on the American health care system for HarperCollins.

 BODY:
Margaret Loncar was about to leave her trailer home in Bridgeview, Ill., one April morning in 2003 when she noticed her 49-year-old husband, Michael, hunched over the side of the bed and coughing up fluid. Although he had battled a variety of lung and liver ailments for years, he seemed worse than usual, Margaret recalled not long ago -- bad enough, she thought, that he should get to the emergency room. 
 The nearest E.R. was at Advocate Christ Medical Center, four miles away in Oak Lawn, a mostly working-class Chicago suburb. Both Loncars had been admitted and treated there before; a few months earlier, doctors performed emergency surgery on Michael's lungs. The Loncars were satisfied with the treatment at Christ Medical, as it is known. Their problem was that they already owed the hospital more than $40,000. Michael, who for years had been too sick to work, had no health insurance, and Margaret had acquired hers only a few months before. Margaret's salary as a Wal-Mart cashier was barely enough to support the couple and their two children -- a 17-year-old daughter at home and a 22-year-old daughter away at college. It left no money for adding Michael and the kids to her health plan, let alone for paying a five-figure hospital bill. 
 During Michael's past admissions to the hospital, Margaret says, she asked staff members if there was some way to discount or waive the charges -- figuring that Christ Medical, a nonprofit institution sponsored by religious organizations, might be inclined to help. But the answer, she says, was always no. So, as the hospital bills piled up on the dining table, Margaret lay awake at night, wondering how the family would crawl out from under the debt. On that April morning, as Michael kept insisting that it was ''just the flu,'' she suspected that it was something more serious. But Michael wouldn't let her take him to the E.R., and eventually Margaret headed to work. When she returned that night, she found him on the floor, dead. 
 Margaret had Michael's body cremated a few days later. But the family's dealings with Christ Medical were not over. That July, Margaret learned that the hospital had sued her over part of their debt, winning a judgment allowing it to garnishee her wages. (Margaret says she never received summons papers before the wage-garnishment hearing.) Soon the hospital was taking the maximum amount from Margaret's salary that state law allowed, or about $100 of the $680 in gross pay she earned every other week. Margaret says that this left her with no money for repairs when the furnace in her trailer broke down the following winter. She and her younger daughter moved to an apartment, which Margaret says she could afford only by skipping the medications she took for her asthma and high blood pressure. 
 That fall, researchers from the labor union trying to organize Advocate Health Care, the parent company that owns Christ Medical, came across the Loncars' file while investigating the company's treatment of uninsured patients. With the help of the union's attorneys, Margaret eventually persuaded a judge to overturn the garnishment order based on her testimony that she had never received the summons to that hearing. In April 2004, the judge ordered Christ Medical to repay the money it had taken, some $1,800 in all, although Advocate complied only after several months. Margaret still had other unpaid medical bills at Christ Medical -- from separate hospitalizations not included in the initial lawsuit. At one point, according to her attorneys, Advocate's collection agent threatened to pursue those debts if Margaret continued to demand that her garnished wages be returned. (Advocate denies ever making such a threat, but a spokesman acknowledged that it cannot vouch for the behavior of the bill collector, an outside contractor.) 
When a faith-based hospital sues a grieving widow over medical debt, plunging her family deeper into poverty, some part of the health care system has clearly failed. But which part, exactly? One answer is to blame the hospital, which is precisely what many advocates, elected officials and academics have been doing as stories like the Loncars' have made headlines in the last year. ''To put so much silent agony on hapless, hard-working low-income Americans, that's just absolutely unacceptable as conduct,'' says Uwe Reinhardt, the well-respected Princeton health economist. Along with this indignation has come the threat of costly retribution. Illinois officials have already revoked property-tax exemptions for the Provena Covenant Medical Center in Urbana, after a Wall Street Journal article documented the hospital's use of ''body attachments'' -- court orders authorizing the police to haul unresponsive medical debtors into court, by force if necessary. In other states, patients who have been sued by hospitals have started suing back, charging that the hospitals' conduct violates consumer-fraud statutes and the legal obligations that come with tax exemptions. In perhaps the most ominous sign for the hospitals, a group of litigators led by Richard Scruggs, the Mississippi attorney whose pursuit of the tobacco industry famously yielded a $206 billion settlement, have filed class-action lawsuits naming more than 400 nonprofit hospitals around the country. 
 But executives of nonprofit hospitals say that they are victims, too -- of unions that have spread misinformation to embarrass the hospital industry, and of a society that has made impossible demands of financially beleaguered health care providers. According to the calculations of trade groups, hospitals in the United States already deliver unreimbursed care worth billions of dollars every year. ''We have roughly 44 million uninsured in the U.S., 1.7 million in Illinois,'' says Ken Robbins, longtime president of the Illinois Hospital Association. ''It's unrealistic to think that we can solve that problem by hospital behaviors alone.'' As for their seemingly harsh collection efforts, the hospitals say that the stories are more complicated than most people realize -- that they typically sue only after patients refuse to complete paperwork, fail to seek government help or are otherwise unresponsive to outreach efforts. ''In our experience,'' Ed Domansky, the Advocate Health Care spokesman at the time, told me in June, ''lack of patient cooperation often poses a significant roadblock to us being able to make charity care available to patients in financial need.'' Although Advocate would not comment on the Loncars' case specifically, citing patient-confidentiality laws, Margaret herself confirmed that Advocate staff members suggested that Michael apply for coverage under the Illinois state Medicaid program. (He did, but he died before his application could be approved.) 
 The transformation of the nonprofit hospital from savior to scourge is particularly evident in and around Chicago, where two large religious-based health care organizations now face withering public criticism over their practices. One is Advocate, a group of hospitals, physicians' practices and related subsidiaries sponsored jointly by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the United Church of Christ. The other is Resurrection Health Care, a similarly diverse collection of Catholic facilities sponsored by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth and the Sisters of the Resurrection. Both systems trace their roots to the great hospital-building boom of the late 19th century, when religious orders established hospitals for the growing enclaves of impoverished immigrants in America's cities.
 On into the 1970's, these hospitals were still serving the urban poor, largely thanks to a convoluted system of indirect financing. Every time a health insurer, whether private or a government provider like Medicare, wrote a check to a hospital for a medical service, it was in effect paying more than the actual cost of that service; hospitals could then use the extra money to finance care for those people who had no way to pay. But the arrangement began to unravel as the cost of care rose. In the 80's, the federal government, nervous that Medicare spending was out of control, reduced the program's payments to hospitals. Not long afterward, private insurance companies, pressured by employers concerned about their own premium costs, moved most of their business into managed care, which limited inpatient admissions and pressured hospitals to cut prices. By the late 90's, after another round of Medicare cuts, one-third of American hospitals said they were losing money. Among the worst off were those nonprofits that served large numbers of the uninsured, since they depended on the old system's subsidies.
 Hospitals survived by adapting, which in some cases meant consolidating into large systems that had leverage with insurance companies and spending money to lure professional executives with the business savvy that the ministers or nuns who formerly ran these institutions often lacked. (In fiscal year 2002, Joseph Toomey, president and C.E.O. of Resurrection Health Care, received $2.3 million, including benefits and one-time bonuses.) It was also around this time that nonprofit hospitals began trying to lure customers -- that is, patients -- who had good insurance coverage. Making the hospital more attractive to the affluent was essential to this effort, which is why a patient strolling through the courtyard inside Resurrection Medical Center today can pray at the statue of Saint Joseph or order a latte from Seattle's Best Coffee. 
 Fancy coffee wasn't the only sign that nonprofit hospitals were evolving into consciously commercial enterprises. A more significant shift was evident in the way hospitals billed patients. Before the 80's and the advent of managed care, hospitals limited themselves to a single set of charges -- say, $1,000 for use of a surgical room. But when private insurers began demanding lower prices, hospitals would typically meet those demands by offering the insurers special discounts -- so an insurer with a 50 percent discount would pay only $500 for the surgical room. Inevitably, as the hospitals sought to generate more revenue, they would raise the ''sticker price'' for services, which just as inevitably prompted the insurers to demand even steeper discounts the next time both sides negotiated. The gap between charges and insurance payments grew, and today, according to Gerard Anderson, who directs the John Hopkins University Center for Hospital Finance and Management, charges for something like an operating room can be four times as much as what insurance companies actually pay when their beneficiaries are treated.
 But no one is negotiating discounts on behalf of the uninsured. Nor do they benefit from the prices that government dictates for its Medicare and Medicaid enrollees. When the Service Employees International Union, which is trying to organize Advocate workers, analyzed Advocate's billing in 2001, it found that uninsured patients were being asked to pay 140 percent more than those with private insurance. Advocate disputes the figure but did acknowledge that a payment gap exists, just as it does at most hospitals.
Nobody seriously believes that hospitals deliberately created a tiered pricing structure with the intention of singling out the uninsured. But many critics believe that hospitals could have done more to offer ''charity care'' -- discounted or free care. In a nationwide survey of the uninsured conducted in 2000 by the Access Project at Brandeis University, 70 percent of needy respondents who had been through emergency rooms said they were never told that the hospitals would discount or forgive their bills if they couldn't pay. And among the patients I interviewed, even those who had been informed about charity care said the information was incomplete or delivered in a haphazard way. 
 When Robin Lee Kemp received emergency room care at Resurrection's Westlake Hospital in 2000, she had two young children and had just lost her job. But the only conversation about financial assistance that she recalls came while she was heavily medicated, when a nun suggested that she write a letter asking the hospital to discount the charges. According to Kemp, the next time she heard from the hospital was when she was served with a summons for an unpaid bill for nearly $9,000. (Kemp insists that she left a valid address and never received a bill.) At that time, she says, she offered to pay the collection agent $500 immediately and then monthly installments of $100, only to be told that it was too late. She ended up filing for bankruptcy. Advocate and Resurrection say they have done their best to tell patients about charity care -- that it's usually the patient, not the hospital, who fails to communicate. In a written response to questions submitted by The New York Times Magazine, Phyllis Pavese, a Resurrection spokeswoman, disputed Kemp's story, saying that its representatives ''attempted to work with [her] to file applications both for R.H.C. financial assistance and Medicaid, but Ms. Kemp declined to provide information.'' (Pavese also says that Kemp never left a valid address.) 
 At least at Resurrection, the unions say, hospital administrators have been waging a stealth campaign to limit the admission of uninsured patients ever since 2002. According to memos first obtained by the organizers from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (A.F.S.C.M.E.) -- which has been investigating Resurrection as part of its organizing efforts there -- two years ago the hospital instructed its employees to offer financial assistance only to those living within certain local ZIP codes and to require 50 percent prepayment from uninsured patients seeking nonemergency care. (In accordance with federal law that prohibits withholding lifesaving care from any patient who needs it, such requirements do not apply to emergency cases.) Along with these rules came strict documentation requirements, demanding that applicants for assistance submit their tax returns, bank statements, recent pay stubs or other proof of income, rent or mortgage receipts and proof of citizenship. ''If any of the above are missing/incomplete,'' a leaked document read, ''the application should be 'DENIED!''' 
 In a written statement, Pavese said that the documents were ''written by one individual for use in a training program.'' Pavese added that Resurrection provided new training to employees because the documents were ''inconsistent with our values.'' Still, Pavese acknowledged that some of the guidelines described in the memo exist. ''We believe that requiring substantiation is responsible stewardship of our resources,'' Pavese wrote, noting that assistance programs like Medicaid require detailed documentation, too. She denied that Resurrection substantially revised its charity-case policies in 2002. But A.F.S.C.M.E. union officials and other critics of the hospitals contend that the practical effect of the supposed changes has been to reduce charity care either by intimidating would-be applicants, many of whom have poor English skills, or simply trapping them in bureaucratic confusion. Filings with the state government show that charity care declined by one-third in the first year after A.F.S.C.M.E. claimed that these policies went into effect. All told, in 2003, the union calculated that Resurrection hospitals gave back just six-tenths of 1 percent of its gross charges in the form of charity care. The average for other private hospitals in Cook County was more than twice as much.
Resurrection challenges the import of these statistics, partly blaming a change in accounting methods, while its physicians say they still see a steady flow of indigent patients. ''We've never been told to cut back,'' Dr. Timothy McCurry, director of the family practice center at Resurrection Medical Center, told me. ''In fact, we're always being told to be more mission-oriented and out finding patients that need care.'' Even the hospital's fiercest critics would concede that Resurrection provides indigent patients with care all the time -- just as it did two years ago, when the Chicago Fire Department transported a homeless man to one of its E.R.'s. Over the next few months, the hospital performed several operations on him, sometimes admitting him to the intensive-care unit. Eventually, Resurrection social workers tracked down the man's family -- in Poland -- and arranged for him to return to them. Resurrection estimates that it absorbed nearly $140,000 in hospitalization and surgical costs alone.
 Stories like that are why Dr. Neil Rosenberg, medical director of the intensive-care unit at Resurrection's Westlake Hospital, gets angry about the current criticism. ''We give away care routinely,'' he said. ''I don't think there's another business alive that does close to what we do.'' Indeed, hospitals say focusing narrowly on ''charity care'' figures produces a skewed picture of their true value to the community. They prefer to consider estimates of ''uncompensated care,'' a broader category that includes all charges that ultimately go unpaid. In all, the Illinois Hospital Association said that state hospitals -- most of which are nonprofit -- provide some $2 billion in uncompensated care to the uninsured each year. ''I'd like to see somebody buy a car and not get a bill -- it just doesn't happen,'' Rosenberg said. ''Why don't the hotels in this country give free rooms to the homeless?''
 But car dealers and hotels don't get millions of dollars in property- and corporate-tax breaks; nonprofit hospitals do. And while hospitals lose some money on uncompensated care, critics say that uncompensated care hardly qualifies as charity if the hospital has relentlessly pursued collections, as Resurrection Medical Center did after Marijon Binder visited the hospital in August 2001. Paramedics insisted on taking the 62-year-old to the E.R. after she complained of chest pains when attending a disabilities-product show. But they also gave her a choice. ''I'll take the Catholic hospital,'' Binder, who happens to be a former nun, recalled telling them.
 Binder is a live-in aide for a severely disabled elderly woman, a job that provides no health insurance. When she told the hospital that she had no way to pay the bill, she was given a charity-care application, which she says she submitted. But soon a bill arrived in her mailbox, detailing $11,395 in charges for her two-night stay. Resurrection said it never received the charity application or responses to half a dozen notices over the next few months; Binder says she called when the first bill arrived, explained that she was supposed to be a charity case and was told not to worry, that the mailing was probably caused by a clerical error. Either way, Resurrection eventually decided to pursue collection a different way: it sued.
 Binder learned about the lawsuit when a police officer showed up on her doorstep, summons in hand. She quickly faxed a handwritten letter to Resurrection's collection attorney, explaining that she had ''devoted the last 10 years to caring for the elderly'' and worked full time for an infirm woman. The letter gave a detailed picture of Binder's financial situation, explaining that the housemates lived off the elderly woman's Social Security and pension, which in a typical month left no more than $40 after expenses. Sometimes, Binder wrote, the two even shared a Meals on Wheels dinner to save money. Binder made sure to attach two documents to her fax: a balance sheet from the bank (showing an end-of-month balance of $41.27), plus an affidavit to the Chicago Housing Authority vouching for her financial status. Then she asked for instructions on again applying to become a charity case. A few days later, Binder made a similar appeal -- this time in person, to a nun who worked in hospital administration. But the hospital wouldn't give up the case. Not until the following April -- after repeated appearances in court -- did Binder find somebody sympathetic to her story: a judge. After listening to her testimony in person, he immediately ruled in her favor, absolving her of any responsibility for the bill.
 To this day, Resurrection argues that its records show Binder to have been the irresponsible party. ''While we strive to ensure fairness and reasonableness in the collection process,'' Pavese wrote in Resurrection's statement, ''it can be particularly difficult when individuals do not respond to our attempts to discuss financial arrangements.'' But while Binder says she now wishes she had called the hospital more than once after the bills started coming, she remains bewildered that the hospital refused to stop the lawsuit after she made a personal appeal. Nor does Binder understand why Resurrection's attorney continued to pursue the case after her first appearance in court, since on that day she filed for ''indigent'' status, which exempted her from a court-appearance fee. To do this, Binder had to sign a sworn affidavit that her income was less than $11,225 a year.
 Binder's economic circumstances are hardly unusual among the defendants in Chicago's medical-debt cases. From 2000 to 2003, Resurrection pursued cases against at least 77 other people who qualified for indigent status. And because the legal system does very little to advertise the availability of indigent status -- Binder found out only because she overheard somebody in line at the courthouse talking about it -- many more defendants would probably qualify if they knew to apply. To Michael Zucker, director of corporate affairs and strategic research at A.F.S.C.M.E., this alone suggests that the hospitals have gone too far, no matter how supposedly unresponsive some patients may be. ''The court's approval of an indigent petition has to be taken at least as an indication that the debtor is a good candidate for charity care,'' Zucker said. ''Why pursue litigation instead of charity care at that point?''
Binder was fortunate in one sense. Aside from a little dignity, her losses were limited to the $1,500 she spent paying professional aides to look after her housemate while she went to court. But the legal system isn't always so forgiving. In Chicago, the proceedings over medical debt take place at the Richard J. Daley Center, an intimidating 31-floor building that occupies almost an entire city block. For a defendant facing a hospital lawsuit, the first stop is the clerk's office, where defendants pay a court-appearance fee -- $90 for debts under $5,000, $140 for debts over $5,000 -- unless they file for indigent status. The trials take place upstairs, in the courtrooms, where there are typically no juries and, except in rare cases, no defense lawyers, either -- just a judge, some court personnel and collection attorneys scurrying about, exchanging files with the clerks as they dispatch cases involving defendants who haven't shown up. When a defendant is present, the judge will customarily ask him or her to meet with the collection attorney privately and work out a mutually acceptable arrangement. On any given day, if you troll the hallways during the morning or afternoon ''calls,'' you will see people huddled in conversations, as the attorneys pepper defendants with questions about their assets, employment and access to cash.
 Although a judge must approve any agreement before it takes effect, the outcome of any particular case depends a great deal on the attorney involved, and Judge Wayne Rhine, a two-decade veteran of the bench, says he has seen all kinds in his courtroom. There are compassionate lawyers who try to work out fair payment plans -- the kind who pursue wage garnishments only against patients who have been blatantly irresponsible or clearly have the means to pay. And then, he says, there is the other kind, the ''guys who would take the fillings out of your teeth.'' Alan Alop, deputy director of the Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago, says he has ''seen hospital attorneys at citation proceedings say to the debtor, 'How much money do you have in your pocket?' And the debtor says something like, '$42,' and they say, 'Well, let's turn it over to the hospital right now.''' In fact, in Illinois, though few debtors realize it, $2,000 worth of their personal property is exempt from being collected.
 Both Advocate and Resurrection maintain that their attorneys act in ways consistent with their religious values. But Bruce Vladeck, a former director of Medicare during the Clinton administration who recently joined Ernst & Young, says that until the latest controversies, ''90 percent of the hospital C.E.O.'s in the U.S. had no idea what the collection offices were doing.'' That would explain why Advocate might not know that its collector was holding on to Margaret Loncar's garnisheed wages or why Resurrection might not know that Robin Kemp had offered to make payments on her bill. Today, Resurrection still uses the standard method for paying its collection attorneys -- offering them a percentage of the money they collect. Under this scheme, if an attorney discovers that a defendant was wrongly denied charity care and refers the patient back to Resurrection's financial-assistance office, that attorney would get no compensation. (The Grabowski Law Center, the firm that seems to handle many of Resurrection's cases, declined multiple interview requests.) In 2003, Advocate began paying its attorneys even if they refer cases back for charity assistance. 
If everybody is supposed to have a right to basic medical care, how much responsibility does an individual hospital have to provide it? ''Providing health care for the uninsured should be addressed by a great many governmental and societal sectors,'' Pavese wrote in her lengthy statement. ''Relying solely on hospitals to absorb all the costs of care for uninsured individuals is neither feasible nor realistic.'' And it's not just hospital officials who think that other parties, particularly the government, could do more. If Illinois had processed Michael Loncar's Medicaid application more quickly, his wife says today, he might have felt comfortable going to the E.R. and have received the treatment he needed to live. 
 But while critics agree that the problem of the uninsured is bigger than the hospitals, they also think the hospitals could do much more to help, particularly when they are spending large sums of money on executive compensation and expensive marketing schemes. ''As a policy matter, if you're going to waive a large tax burden to a billion-dollar corporation, what do you get in return as a society?'' Zucker asked. ''I think what society has asked for in its laws is a real effort to deliver free care to all who need it.'' And whether or not Zucker is correct, the spectacle of nonprofit hospitals suing the indigent may provoke the courts and lawmakers to intervene -- a possibility some of the hospital industry's most powerful friends have already considered. ''I cannot overstate the level of concern this chain of events has given some of the more sophisticated people in the credit-granting area,'' said James Unland, president of the Chicago-based Health Capital Group, which assesses hospital finances on behalf of would-be creditors. ''I can't have a whole bunch of hospitals being sued in class-action lawsuits and being threatened with huge property-tax bills and reasonably predict the cash flow of the hospitals.''
 Today, when hospitals approach Unland to rate their credit-worthiness, he urges management to take a proactive approach to its charity policies: set strict guidelines about collections, clearly define charity-care policies and advertise them sufficiently. ''I don't mean posting a sign,'' Unland insisted. ''I mean a person saying, 'It's clear you don't have insurance -- you may qualify for charity care.''' Some nonprofit hospitals already seem to be moving in that direction. Provena Covenant Medical Center in Urbana has given up asking the police to take debtors to court and established a committee of community representatives to monitor its treatment of the uninsured. (The hospital has appealed the state's decision to revoke its property-tax exemption.) Advocate has introduced new charity-care policies, offering financial assistance to patients with incomes up to four times as much as the poverty line, or well into the middle class. Resurrection has also expanded its offerings and ended the ZIP code restriction. And in perhaps the most sweeping remedial action to date, after being sued by the litigators led by Richard Scruggs, North Mississippi Health Services, a six-hospital system based in Tupelo, settled for a reported $150 million in August, promising, among other things, to repay money it collected from needy uninsured patients in the past few years. It also vowed never to ask uninsured patients to pay more than 10 percent of their income for medical bills.
 For now, the hospitals can afford such changes. The last two or three years have actually been relatively profitable, largely because hospitals have extracted higher prices from insurance companies and because Congress eventually restored some of the late-90's Medicare cuts. But financial experts continue to fret over these institutions' long-term financial outlooks. The demand for hospital services by those who cannot pay is rising as employers shift medical costs to employees and relatively more employers simply drop coverage altogether. The competitive pressure on hospitals may be increasing, too, particularly given the recent explosion of physician ownership of specialty facilities that draw lucrative lines of business, like orthopedics and cardiovascular surgery, away from hospitals. As Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist and author of ''The Divided Welfare State,'' explained, the mandate to be competitive and the mandate to be compassionate are in some ways simply incompatible: ''We can't ask nonprofits to be more like for-profits in the ways that we like -- efficient, responsive, aggressive -- without expecting that they will also become more like for-profits in the ways that we don't: rapacious, hardheaded and, yes, sometimes selfish.'' 


CORRECTION-DATE: January 9, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 19 about nonprofit hospitals that charge fees to poor patients and sue for unpaid bills referred incorrectly to a settlement reached between North Mississippi Health Services, a six-hospital system, and a group of litigators that has filed class-action suits against hospitals. The settlement was reached before a suit was filed against North Mississippi.

HEADLINE: Exchanging Cigarettes For Bagels

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
OBESITY is considered a major public health problem today, but a number of scientists are coming to see it as a comparative blessing, given the alternative. These public heath experts believe, in effect, that America may have traded smoking -- a truly lethal habit -- for the lesser deadliness of eating too much. 
 The story of this trade-off can be seen in the data. From 1973 until 1983, Americans were actually growing thinner. During that period, the average weight of middle-aged men fell about two pounds, while that of middle-aged women fell nearly three pounds. 
 Then the trend reversed: from 1980 to 2000, the average weight of Americans rose by nearly 20 pounds. Everyone got heavier, said Dr. David Williamson, a statistician at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''Competitive cyclists weigh more than they did 20, 30 years ago; HIV patients weigh more.''
 Yet the nation also is healthier. Life expectancy has gone up by more than six years over the past three decades, and heart disease, long the major killer, is on the wane.
 A big reason Americans are fatter and healthier, Dr. Williamson believes, may be the steep decline in cigarette smoking. 
 If he is right, the rise in obesity is a classic case of unintended consequences -- one of a long list of medical and public health interventions whose full effects could not be foreseen.
 For example, Americans once died in great numbers in infancy, or childhood, and women died in childbirth from infectious diseases. Now they don't -- a triumph of public health. But as a consequence, the population is growing ever older, which is in turn creating a host of profound new public health challenges. 
 ''We're just now trying to deal with the medical consequences'' of an aging nation, Dr. Williamson said.
 The connection between smoking and obesity is not yet proven, but the statistical correlations are there. From 1980 to 2000 -- as body weight was rising -- smoking rates fell by 27 percent in the nation as a whole and by 38 percent among middle-aged Americans. (Today, smoking rates have leveled off, Dr. Williamson notes, and there are signs that the obesity rates are leveling off, too.)
 ''There is no question that smoking affects the epidemic'' of obesity, said Dr. Neil Grunberg, a psychologist and neuroscientist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md.
 Smokers who quit, he noted, gain about 10 to 12 pounds on average, in part because they crave sweet foods and carbohydrates. In addition, Dr. Grunberg said, smokers' metabolism slows down after they quit.
 Dr. Michael Grossman, an economist, and his colleagues at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York have analyzed the economic causes of obesity. They have calculated, based on cigarette tax receipts, that for every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes, the number of obese people rises 2 percent. Smoking cessation, they estimate, accounted for 20 percent of the obesity increase in this country.
 Dr. Katherine Flegal, a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics, said the effect may be even bigger, once scientists add the upward effect on average weight of the growth in the number of Americans who, because of the success of the antismoking movement, never smoked in the first place. 
 One possible explanation, Dr. Williamson said, is that as the number of smokers started to plummet, the demand for calories went up and the food industry began offering and advertising larger portions and more snack foods. ''The food industry in general subconsciously picked up on this and went to town,'' he said. Soon overeating more became the norm, for everyone, even children. 
 Over the same period, said Dr. David Musto, a historian of science at Yale, America's preoccupation with healthy foods -- oat bran, broccoli, fish, etc. -- also resulted in what he called a ''barrage'' of pro-eating commercial messages. 
 In the 1960's, Dr. Musto said, it was socially imperative to smoke. ''A man had to know his brand'' of cigarettes, he said. In much the same way, he said, it became socially imperative to eat the right foods -- those supposed to be good for you. 
 ''The process of becoming obese is greatly facilitated by a search for health and healthy foods,'' Dr. Musto said. ''You've read that something fights Alzheimer's or lowers your blood pressure, so why shouldn't you have a healthy portion?''
 It all makes for an odd and not entirely satisfactory coda to the antismoking crusade. But on balance, Dr. Williamson points out, a nation with an expanding waistline is in far better shape than one with a cigarette in its mouth. Obesity may be bad, he said, but the health effects of smoking are far worse.
 ''I sure would like for people not to be obese,'' Dr. Williamson said. But, he added, if they got that way because they don't smoke, then ''maybe the sky isn't falling quite as much as we think it is.''

HEADLINE: The Long View in Long Beach

 BODY:
In the end, the water always wins.
 This principle, as old and as obvious as the Grand Canyon, is worth keeping in mind when considering present-day efforts to bend nature to the demands of urban planning and beachfront development, like the one planned for Long Beach by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
 The project is an ambitious attempt to make real estate in Long Island's only oceanfront city safe from a 100-year storm. It would rehabilitate the 18 existing stone groins that jut into the water to capture sand on its relentless march from east to west, build four new groins and use sand dredged offshore to bulk the beach up to steroidal levels. Between boardwalk and water, a long parallel dune would rise to within two feet of the boardwalk. The beach would be higher and broader -- a 110-foot-wide berm from Long Beach east to Point Lookout. 
 The corps estimates the initial costs at about $93 million, to be borne mostly by the federal government and New York State, with help from the City of Long Beach, the Town of Hempstead and Nassau County. But the beach will regularly have to be replenished, at a cost of about $12.7 million. The corps expects to have to do this every five years.
 Or less often, if the new, improved Long Beach proves to be as sturdy as other nearby corps beach projects, like Coney Island. Or more often, if disastrous storms hit -- Long Island is long overdue.
 In a dream world, the beach would be left alone, groinless, to regularly erode and regrow as nature intended. Such a beach would be healthy and lovely, but you could not rely on it. Buildings, boardwalks, roads and people would have to bend to the shifting will of wind and tide. But this city and its boardwalk are not going anywhere, so the beach must also stay put.
 There's the problem -- once humans decide to subdue a beach, they commit themselves to an endless regimen of control. Army engineers don't mind that. To them, the beach is municipal infrastructure, like a street -- you build it and pave it with sand as often as necessary or until the funding runs out. 
 Others do have worries, practical and aesthetic. Some complain that dredged sand will be browner and rougher than the lustrous white sand Long Beach is known for. Others say the project could ruin a prime Long Island surfing spot. (The corps says not to worry -- the new shoreline slope will match the old, so the waves presumably will, too.)
 A greater fear is that much of what the corps wants to do involves guesswork. Is this insurance worth the premiums? Is the battle worth fighting in the long run? How will the dune hold up in a hurricane? Will the new beach be as inviting as the old? 
 The uncertainty apparently makes the Long Beach City Council uneasy. Charles T. Theofan, the acting city manager, said last week that council members were leaning against the project because of a specific worry about the artificial dune: They fear that it will grow grass, the grass will trap sand, and the sand will pile high and block the view of the beach -- and that once the federally established dune is up, the city will not be allowed to touch it. And then the council members will forever be known as the idiots who spoiled Long Beach.
 Call them cowardly, but at least they realize how beach management can open a universe of unintended consequences. They know that once you decide to take on nature, you are in for the long haul.

HEADLINE: For East End Restaurateurs, a Cashless Winter

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
ERIC LEMONIDES, an owner of Almond, the popular Bridgehampton bistro, greeted a couple on a recent Tuesday evening as they walked through the door. Mr. Lemonides, a gregarious host who often seems to know each customer, recognized the pair as habitues of red/bar, the swank Southampton brasserie a few miles west.
 Red/bar closes on Mondays and Tuesdays after Labor Day, then shuts down Jan. 2 to Feb. 18. That tradition, a vestige of the East End's seasonal economy, is repeated at dozens of restaurants on both forks. As one after another goes dark, customers venture out on Montauk Highway in search of a restaurant open for business. 
 ''When red/bar closes, people say, 'Let's go to Almond,''' Mr. Lemonides said. ''Even if you get a couple of people like that a night, it makes staying open worthwhile.'' 
 He didn't say it, but when Almond closes a few weeks later, from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, the game of musical restaurant chairs will resume anew.
 It's the same every winter. Gone are August's ravenous, deep-pocketed crowds -- the moguls and the models, the trust-fund Lotharios and the antitrust litigators -- all of them clamoring for the best tables and for whatever entree has just sold out. In their place is a core of occasional weekenders and a growing number of year-round residents, most of them tighter with the buck than their summer counterparts.
 In the food business on the East End, winter can be a lonely, and fiscally perilous, place. Restaurateurs who did turn-away business in July and August often struggle to break even. 
 ''The core of a restaurant's success in the Hamptons is how you handle the winter season,'' said Ed Kleefield, the owner of JL East in East Hampton and the JLX Bistro in Sag Harbor, along with the flagship Jean Luc on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. ''Not everyone handles it right.'' 
 The circumstances are daunting even for restaurant veterans. Deliveries to South Fork restaurants predictably fall 70 percent in the winter, said John King, the president of J. Kings Food Service Professionals in Holtsville, a leading distributor. Deliveries to the North Fork drop by half, he said, reflecting the less seasonal economy there. 
 ''We cut deliveries to three days a week, down from six in summer,'' Mr. King said, referring to his company's schedule for East End restaurants.
 Mark Smith, a partner in Nick & Toni's in East Hampton, a celebrity mecca, said business drops about 30 percent in winter, as customers like Howard Stern, Alec Baldwin and Betsey Johnson resume their winter lives. To cope, the restaurant has purchased a Cryovac machine to extend the shelf life of produce, meats and fish.
 But close for the winter? Not Nick & Toni's. ''You don't want your customers wondering, 'Are they open tonight or closed?''' Mr. Smith said.
 Pacific East, the cavernous Amagansett shrine to top-of-the-line seafood and a prestigious spot for summer reservations, stays open all year, too. Volume drops from an average 2,500 meals a week in August to about 250 a week in December, said Michael A. Castino, the chef and an owner.
 ''I lose money in November, and I lose money in January,'' Mr. Castino said. ''Breaking even some months isn't really an attainable goal.''
 Still, this beats shutting down and reopening, he said. He tried that the restaurant's first couple of years, struggling every spring to hire new staff and retrain them by Memorial Day. ''It was like opening a new restaurant every spring,'' he said. ''It was an awful lot of very hard work.''
 To stay open and at least break even in the winter, restaurateurs must plan better and exercise far tighter controls than they need to in the summer, Mr. Castino said.
 Anticipating demand is both art and science. If bad weather comes along, diners will stay home. A sunny day will spur last-minute trips east and a desire to eat out. A great ad or a positive review will fill a room. 
 Still, chefs and owners must order provisions, schedule their staffs and prepare the meals. ''You can do 50 covers one night and 12 the next,'' said David Loewenberg, an owner of red/bar. ''The thing is to keep the food and the service consistent for the 50.''
 In comparison, restaurateurs on the North Fork face a gentler climate. In Greenport, La Cuvee Wine Bar and French Bistro at the Greenporter Hotel thrives in cold weather. Deborah Rivera, the owner, said she serves fewer meals in winter but the average checks are higher.
 As she put it: ''Summertime, everyone orders chicken Caesar salad or burgers. In the fall I sell roasted pheasant, venison stew and truffled corn.''
 She has also seen year-to-year growth in holiday party bookings in December, she said. And next month, three different conferences have been booked at the hotel, and the restaurant will cater all their meals.
 Then, in February, Valentine's Day means still more business. ''Valentine's is the highest-grossing weekend of the year for us,'' Ms. Rivera said. ''I definitely am not closing for winter.''
 The situation is a little different on the South Fork. For many of the restaurants dotting a 16-mile stretch of Montauk Highway, a Restaurant Road that stretches from red/bar in Southampton to Pacific East in Amagansett, winter operations are a pale shade of summer's peak. 
 Most restaurants that do not close reduce their staffs, simplify their menus and cut their hours. Most cut back to four or five days a week in September or October, then shed more days and hours after Thanksgiving, often opening only on the weekends. On nights when no one walks in by, say, 8 p.m., some owners send their staffs home, douse the lights and leave early.
 But cutting losses that way is not wise, said Jerry Della Femina, the advertising executive and an owner of Della Femina in East Hampton, a white-tablecloth restaurant known for its Italian-influenced cuisine and in August especially, for its celebrity sightings.
 If you open a restaurant, he said, keep it open all year, not just when it's convenient to do so. 
 ''Consistency is part of the product,'' he said. ''You can't take a month or two off and come back and expect to have the same consistency, the same quality. It just isn't doable.''
 Mr. Della Femina said winter brings in customers he doesn't see in summer, a period when landing prime-time reservations becomes a competitive sport, a Hamptons status symbol and the equivalent of owning beachfront property or driving a Hummer.
 ''The restaurant attracts a different type of clientele in the summer,'' Mr. Della Femina said. 
 The owners who choose to close in winter say it's a necessary hedge against financial risk, an opportunity to take a breather from the demanding pace of the restaurant business and a chance to make repairs not possible when the building is in use.
 ''When you come back, it's like returning to college after summer break,'' said Mr. Lemonides of Almond. ''You find everything is just where you left it, and nobody is saying, 'What's the phone number of the refrigeration repair guy -- we need him right now!'''

HEADLINE: A Banner Year for Co-ops

BYLINE: By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
AS the price of a median home on Long Island has jumped 13 percent this year, demand for co-ops -- the least expensive market segment -- has been particularly strong, according to Long Island brokers.
 The number of co-ops sold this year has soared more than 70 percent from 2003, and yet the median price has gone up 10 percent, a slower rate of increase than that of home prices over all. In part, this seems to reflect that sellers see an opportunity to take advantage of equity in their property while interest rates are still relatively low and demand is high, real estate professionals say.
 ''Co-ops are still a very good alternative in the residential housing market, which has skyrocketed,'' said Kathy Engel, manager of ReMax Elite Realty, which covers East Rockaway, Lynbrook and Rockville Centre in southwestern Nassau County. 
 According to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, the median closing price last month for all home sales was $435,000 in Nassau and $361,000 in Suffolk County. A year earlier, the median in Nassau was $385,000 and in Suffolk, $318,500. 
 The price of co-ops has also increased but at a somewhat slower rate. From Jan. 1 through Dec. 6 this year, a total of 1,144 co-op units were sold in Nassau and Suffolk, with a median price of $175,000. For all of last year, 669 were sold, with a median price of $159,000. 
 Co-ops tend to be concentrated in Nassau County, with sales heaviest in Great Neck and Long Beach, popular locales because of the easy commute to Manhattan and their shorefront locations.
 In the Great Neck area alone, 231 co-op units had been sold by Dec. 6 compared with a total of 131 for all of 2003. 
 According to Mona Holzman, sales manager for June Shapiro Realty Fine Homes and Estates in Great Neck, about 80 percent of Great Neck's 52 co-op buildings are in the bustling downtown area near the Long Island Rail Road station, a 26-minute ride from Manhattan. 
 ''There is a tremendous difference in price between co-ops, where you own shares in a building, and condos, which is like owning your own house in a building,'' Ms. Holzman said. Condos tend to be more than double the price of comparable co-ops, she said, noting that the least expensive one-bedroom condo in Great Neck is $375,000, compared with $146,000 for a one-bedroom co-op.
 Most of the co-ops in Great Neck are in three-story buildings, and some do not have elevators. There are some converted seven-story prewar apartment buildings with elevators but with little or no parking, she said, noting that the co-ops mostly sell to single professionals and empty-nesters. 
 ''Nothing is a deterrent today if people want to live in Great Neck,'' Ms. Holzman said. ''Even a third-floor walk-up is a hot market. In the 1980's we couldn't give these apartments away.'' Since then, she said, demand has increased significantly. Despite price appreciation, she said, ''They all sell.'' 
 One-bedroom co-op units have sold this year at prices ranging from $146,000 to $349,000, and two-bedrooms from $208,000 to $710,000. In 2003 one-bedrooms sold for $125,000 to $342,000 and two-bedrooms from $201,000 to $430,000.
 This year, several high-end co-ops have been sold, including a sprawling three-bedroom penthouse with a fireplace and a city view that sold for $875,000 in one of the seven-story buildings. ''But that was one of a kind,'' Ms. Holzman said.
 Homes in the area average $1.2 million with a typical three-bedroom, one-bath house on a small lot selling for $518,000, she said. The largest sale was the nine-bedroom Kings Point waterfront estate on 2.3 acres that belonged to the comedian Alan King, who died last May; the property sold for $12.75 million. The next highest sale was for $8 million, Ms. Holzman said. 
 Farther south, in the city of Long Beach -- a half-mile-wide barrier island with a two-mile-long boardwalk -- the housing stock includes co-ops, condos, small ranches and upscale oceanfront houses. 
 By Dec. 6 of this year, 126 co-op units had been sold in Long Beach compared with a total of 115 all of last year. The price range has widened this year, with sales stretching from $125,000 to $457,500 for one-bedroom co-ops, compared with $150,000 to $350,000 last year, according to Joyce Coletti, a sales agent with Ryan & Walis Realty. 
 Condominium prices have ranged from $300,000 to $545,000 for one-bedroom units and topped out at $2.45 million for a four-bedroom rooftop penthouse in an oceanfront building, she said. The prices of houses currently on the market range from $325,000 for a three-bedroom ranch to $1.7 million for a large three-bedroom house on the oceanfront.
 ''In view of the fact that housing prices have risen to an average of $500,000 in Long Beach, it has made the co-op market very attractive to first-time home buyers,'' Ms. Coletti said.
 Many other communities in southwestern Nassau also have co-ops, although their selection is not as concentrated as in Long Beach and Great Neck. 
 Using Lynbrook as an example of how prices have increased in the area, Ms. Engel of ReMax Elite noted that last year a one-bedroom co-op typically sold for $80,000 and that by Dec. 6 of this year similar units are listing for $100,000 to $180,000. A two-bedroom co-op with an eat-in-kitchen sold for $250,000 last year and a similar one for $340,000 this year.
 ''Many of the buyers are retirees who have sold their Long Island home, maybe purchased one in Florida but want to maintain a residence here to be near the city, friends and family,'' Ms. Engel said. 
 In Lynbrook, condos range from $213,000 for a one-bedroom to $305,000 for a two-bedroom with an efficiency kitchen. A two-bedroom house on a busy street in Lynbrook sold for $305,000 this year, compared with $250,000 for a similar one last year. On the higher end, a four-bedroom colonial on a residential street sold for $800,000 this year, compared with $500,000 last year for a similar house on a similar street.

HEADLINE: Off the Canvas And Onto the Big Screen

BYLINE: By M.G. LORD

 BODY:
On a brisk winter day last February, the backyard of a fashionable West Los Angeles house was suffused with artificial summer light. Two women -- the actresses Tea Leoni and Cloris Leachman -- sat by the pool, exuding languor beneath a striped umbrella. For the artist D.J. Hall, a West Coast-based realist painter, the movie scene had a deja vu quality; it was based on an almost identical image she had painted nearly a decade earlier. The banana plants and agapanthus were the same, freshly placed in the ground to enhance the resemblance to Ms. Hall's original image. Ms. Leoni wore the shirt that Ms. Hall's model had worn and thumbed through a scrapbook of Matisse-inspired images the artist had had made. Even the polyethylene foam noodles in the pool bore her imprint: she had painted them with designs based on desert flowers. 
 This tableau vivant was far from accidental. James L. Brooks, director of the movie ''Spanglish,'' in which this scene figures prominently, owns Ms. Hall's painting, and the work, he said, was his ''companion'' while writing the screenplay. It ''perfectly caught a certain upscale woman in Los Angeles,'' he said. Such women have a facade of prosperity and happiness, ''but you can see how haunted they are behind it.'' 
 Before Mr. Brooks hired his production designer, Ida Random, and set decorator, Leslie A. Pope, he brought on Ms. Hall as a consultant. ''When I got the job, the first thing Jim showed me was D.J.'s painting,'' Ms. Random recalled. 
 By the end of filming, Ms. Hall said, she was stunned by Mr. Brooks' fidelity to her vision. ''It was like seeing one of my paintings come to life,'' she said.
 The challenge didn't end with the scene by the pool. Assisted by Jennifer Long, founder of Film Art LA, a Hollywood-based company that finds and licenses artwork for movies, television and commercials, Ms. Random and Ms. Pope secured paintings that contribute to the emotional tone of the movie. Increasingly, production designers have come to view artwork as the visual equivalent of a musical score and to rely on experts like Ms. Long to provide it. ''Over the years I've learned that paintings are critical,'' Ms. Random said, ''because they are usually behind the actors' heads. If a painting is wrong, it can really throw off a scene.''
 On ''Spanglish,'' Ms. Random, Ms. Pope and Ms. Hall reviewed every dish, glass and tablecloth used in sets for the house.
 The artist also suggested paintings that reflect the taste and economic status of Deborah Clasky, Ms. Leoni's character, a sometimes unsympathetic woman whose good intentions are marred by neurotic behavior. A Carlos Almarez painting of a female jogger, rendered in blue against an intense red background, comments on Deborah's compulsive running. A still life by Janet Fish mirrors the objects in the house: an expensive teacup, freshly cut flowers, snapshots seemingly taken on a family trip. 
 For digital copies of these paintings and permission to use them, Ms. Pope turned to Ms. Long, a former commercial illustrator who, while working long hours as a production designer, had no time to track the contemporary art scene to select the right work for certain interiors. Charged with creating a New York loft for a sneaker commercial, she found herself desperately searching prop houses and art galleries.
 Ms. Long conceived Film Art LA nine years ago to eliminate such scrambling. ''If someone asks me for a painting with a certain type of feeling, I can pull the slides of 10 artists in five minutes,'' she says. She represents artists like Charles Arnoldi, Peter Alexander and Ed Moses, and has found artwork for more than 130 feature films, 60 television shows and 55 commercials. ''When I got started, the industry was accustomed to paying for things like music,'' she recalls. Today, because of heightened awareness that images can also be copyrighted, filmmakers have learned to pay for art, too.
 Fees for art range from $500 to $10,000, depending on the fame of the artist, the amount of time the work is on screen, and the size that the work appears in the movie. Not all work is used at the size the artist made it. A 6-by-3-inch painting by Ms. Hall, for example, was blown up to 2 by 4 feet for a wall in the Clasky house. 
 Breakthroughs in digital reproduction have also been a boon to Ms. Long's business. By copying a work digitally onto canvas -- which she can do at her office -- ''you can put a $30,000 piece of art on a set for a fraction of its cost, and there's no liability if it gets damaged,'' she said.
 Though the extensive attention to artworks may seem extreme, ''people see everything,'' Mr. Brooks says. In test screenings of ''Spanglish,'' for example, viewers fixated on a tiny photograph in the bedroom of Deborah and John Clasky's daughter, Bernice. The photo shows her father, played by Adam Sandler, as a young man. But because the likeness bore a slight resemblance to John Kerry, audiences wanted to know why the daughter was making a political statement. 
 Ms. Long has worked with equally painstaking production designers on other film projects. ''Shopgirl,'' adapted from the novella by Steve Martin, drew on Ms. Long's knowledge of contemporary art to create three fictional gallery shows with artworks that reflect transformations in the main character's temperament. For background images in a bank in ''Spider-Man 2,'' Ms. Long tracked down and received permission to use a social realist mural by Robert Lepper in a classroom of a West Virginia college. 
 The color palette of each scene is especially crucial to establishing the mood. ''If you paint a room blue, it's going to be a sadder room than a bright yellow room,'' Ms. Random said. Because Deborah and John Clasky have a troubled marriage, not only is their bedroom blue, but it is also dominated by an ominous ultramarine paining. The work, by Cynthia Evans, depicts a rigid woman, eyes clamped shut, standing atop a wedding cake that is bracketed by caged doves: an unambiguous totem of disharmony. 
 The painting was on the bedroom wall during filming, yet Ms. Long said she does not know whether it will appear in the finished movie. Some of her artists, like one who recently sat in vain through ''13 Going on 30'' for a glimpse of his mural, have learned the hard way that scenes can be cut.
 To avoid embarrassment, Ms. Long counsels her artists, ''See the movie first before you bring your whole family.''

EAST SIDE STORY
By Louis Auchincloss.
227 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $24.
 MORE than 40 years and 40 books ago, Louis Auchincloss depicted his maternal grandmother's family, the Dixons, in a novel called ''Portrait in Brownstone.'' Now, in the writer's 88th year, it's come time for his father's people. We are told that the Carnochans of ''East Side Story,'' Auchincloss's latest novel, were brought to New York from Scotland by David, ''the emigrant,'' a bluff Presbyterian thread merchant, in 1829. But the eulogy delivered at the patriarch's funeral, excerpted on the book's first page, is closely adapted from the one actually given for Auchincloss's great-grandfather Hugh, which the novelist quoted in his autobiography, ''A Writer's Capital,'' published in 1974.
 This new book, a mere 227 pages, is a considerable, if selective, saga. Near its opening, one character pays $300 for a stranger to take his place in the Union Army; near its close, another suffers estrangement from his children over Vietnam. And yet, ''East Side Story'' is really no more a novel than earlier Auchincloss offerings like ''The Book Class'' or ''Fellow Passengers,'' each a necklace of character cameos given unity by a shared narrator or milieu.
 In this case, the chain of the necklace is the Carnochan bloodline. Depending from the center is another David, not the emigrant but his great-grandson, ''a politician to the core of his being,'' a familial manipulator who in the mid-20th century rises high in his professional world (president of the New York State Bar Association), but not quite high enough: ''He had never been summoned to take any part in the administration of his great nation, either as an attorney, a diplomat or a cabinet officer.'' This relative failure is less important than its contribution to David's self-awareness, which comes to include the understanding that ''to face defeat with assumed equanimity was the nearest thing to a victory that such a man as himself could expect.''
 In Auchincloss's world, the victories are often Pyrrhic or partial. The best and most lasting ones require cunning, patience and an acceptance of limits. Here people engage in a continuing, almost commercial, transaction with life; they cut themselves the best deal they can get. Eliza, the emigrant's turn-of-the-last-century daughter-in-law, marries the son who proposes, not the one she's in love with: ''She knew, in short, the cost of discipline and could sympathize with the pains of those who had subjected themselves to it -- or who had tried to and failed.'' Eliza's own son will also make a marriage more sensible than romantic, ending up with ''a life and not a bad one.'' The reader doesn't pity him and isn't meant to.
 Those who in adversity make a sudden embrace of religion are like panic sellers during a market downturn. Their failure of nerve does no one any good. If some people are luckier than they should be, others are better than we know or expect: Pierre, a nephew of the younger David's, makes a strategic, social-climbing marriage that renders his wife alcoholic and miserable -- until he rises, or lowers himself, to the occasion and lovingly sees her through.
 And when character won't adapt this well to circumstance, circumstance may give character a break. Another of David's nephews, Jaime, a libertine from the time he wrote his Yale senior thesis on Restoration comedy, shocks New York in the 1930's by his rumored request of an open marriage with his wife. Thirty years later, New York has caught up to him, accepting his excesses and making him a successful party planner for the members of a liberalized social elite who must now ''identify their quest for festivity with the alleviation of human misery or the fostering of the arts. They danced for hospitals and medical research; they wined and dined for museums and schools. Charity excused their show of diamonds; humanity justified their mirth.''
 Auchincloss has always given us not only the textures of this world (who else would remember the novels of Francis Marion Crawford?) but also its elemental and evolving truths. As a chronicler of the upper class, he could hardly be indifferent to wealth, but money interests him more as a kind of enzyme -- sometimes inherited, sometimes injected -- than as an object of worship. The Carnochans are, in fact, suited to an almost naturalistic explanation, which Auchincloss provides us through the viewpoint of David's cousin Loulou: the family's ''contribution to the arts, to politics, to teaching, to any occupation that involved giving out rather than taking in, was minimal. If there were no criminals, neither were there any saints. The Carnochans seemed dedicated to their own permanence.''
 IF everyone in Auchincloss seems a type, that is less a sign of this writer's limitations than his fidelity to real life. Each of us, like it or not, is born to embody at least one iron law of demographics, and Auchincloss's gift has been the ability to typify with more specificity than most novelists can individualize. He is especially good at having one character explain another to his face: ''Isn't the son-in-law the natural heir of the American tycoon? The son too often goes to the dogs.''
 Auchincloss has been known to complain when ''told that I have confined my fiction to too small a world.'' He has a point. The objection slights not only the depths of his exploration but also his consistent consideration of at least five generations. He has traveled far, if not wide, and still he perseveres. ''East Side Story'' is his 60th book. The list of his other titles now takes up a full two pages in the front of each new volume, but the prose of this prolific writer remains decidedly economical, its firm, stately syntax inviting the kind of admiration produced by an old man's ramrod posture or still-serviceable 50-year-old briefcase.
 In chronicling a precinct of life in which the bon mot is unusually prized, Auchincloss still mints or overhears some awfully good ones: ''It couldn't have been suicide, for he'd dined the night before with the Stoddards, and why, to anyone who had that behind him, wouldn't the future have seemed bright?'' If one or two slips of usage seem to occur -- ''hang-ups'' and ''recycling'' coming out of characters' mouths a decade or so prematurely -- I'm still not sure I'd bet my ear, or even my dictionary, against this particular master.

HEADLINE: Buying Near the Tracks Could Prove Profitable

BYLINE: By JUDITH YATES BORGER

DATELINE: Minneapolis 

 BODY:
AFTER many years of contentious debate, the last leg of the new light rail line opened here early this month, linking downtown Minneapolis to Twin Cities International Airport and the Mall of America, both in suburban Bloomington.
 Many people argued that $60 million a mile was too much to pay for a mode of transportation that would benefit only a small percentage of Minnesota's 4.5 million residents. But the former wrestler Jesse Ventura, the state's governor during the final stages of talks about the line, twisted enough arms to convince legislators that the 12-mile line was worth the money.
 The governor apparently was right in his conviction that the line would be beneficial. The number of people who have ridden the line since the first eight-mile segment opened in June has been more than double the preconstruction projections. And although Minneapolis is several years late to the light rail rage that has already gripped cities like Dallas, Denver, Salt Lake City and Sacramento, it has been the talk of this town this fall. 
 It used to be a property-value deflator to live near railroad tracks, but now a significant portion of the area's residential real estate boom is happening in neighborhoods along the path of the train, called the Hiawatha Line. According to a study by the Minneapolis Community Planning and Economic Development Department, 7,000 new housing units can be tied in some way to the train. Owners of existing property, meanwhile, are betting that the line will increase their home values.
 ''We're definitely seeing people holding on to their properties longer,'' particularly homeowners, said Jeff Corn, the community development coordinator for the Longfellow Community Council, a nonprofit group representing the Longfellow neighborhood, one of many city neighborhoods along the line.
 Early returns are that riders like the clean, fast and quiet trains with bright yellow bullet-shaped lead cars. Except where the train connects the Humphrey and Lindbergh terminals at the Minneapolis-St Paul airport through a 7,400 foot-long tunnel, it travels above ground, with windows from waist high to ceiling affording great inside lighting. Platforms for the 18 stations are on the same plane as the train, so passengers can walk on to the train, rather than climbing up steps, like on a bus. Bicyclists who get on at the Lake Street station can take an elevator to the platform, then wheel their bikes onto the train and secure them on a rack next to their seats.
 Thirty years ago, homes were razed along Hiawatha Avenue, which runs parallel to the line, to make way for an eight-lane freeway to the airport. When the freeway was scotched, most of the land was sold to developers, who built homes there. As a result, much of the residential property in the middle of the line is just beginning its second generation.
 ''Those homeowners are sitting pretty now,'' said Dewayne Townsend, a homeowner who is active in the Longfellow Community Council. Michael Christenson, director of economic development for Minneapolis, says property values along the line seem to have increased, though it's too early to say how much. While some other cities have built their light rail in a spokes-to-hub fashion, Minneapolis's Hiawatha line connects two hubs. The biggest real estate boom is at either end. 
 The proposed Reflections condominium complex is a good example of the kind of housing that is going up on the south end of the line near the Twin Cities airport and the Mall of America, which has stores, restaurants, movies and an indoor amusement park, complete with Ferris wheel. The developer, McGough Development of St. Paul, plans to break ground in midwinter on a 43-acre parcel that was bought in December 2001, when final plans for the Hiawatha line were nearing completion. At the time, company officials weren't sure whether the line would be a plus for potential buyers. 
 ''Light rail turned out to be a huge enhancement to the marketability of this site,'' said Laurence Harmon, a spokesman for the McGough project. 
 Since October, 126 purchase agreements have been signed to buy apartments in the 274-unit condo complex, which is steps away from the Bloomington Central stop on the light rail line.
 Access to the light rail line has apparently led to a drop in car use, Mr. Harmon said. There are fewer requests for garage spaces from buyers than the developer had expected, he said.
 McGough had more than the usual challenges in building Reflections. Because the parcel is less than five miles from the airport, each unit will be encased in floor-to-ceiling, six-inch-thick triple-paned glass with two layers of air to keep out thundering jet noise. The windows do not open; an interior white noise that sounds like the hum of air-conditioning guarantees that residents will not hear the planes, the builders say. Meanwhile, Federal Aviation Administration requirements said the project could rise no higher than 170 feet.
 The result is two 17-story towers, with units varying from 750 to 2,300 square feet and prices from $166,000 to $773,000, a range below what is available in downtown Minneapolis. Some shoppers complain that the bleached hardwood floors and floor-to-ceiling windows make the units feel cold. Others think they allow a wash of sunlight on even a dreary day, a boon for those suffering seasonal affective disorder here in the north where it's dark by 4:30 p.m. in the deepest of winter.
 ''You either love it, or you hate it,'' Mr. Harmon said of the design.
 The model unit is laid out with the kitchen, laundry and bathroom in the middle of the floor plan, circled by open-space living, dining and bedroom areas.
 It was the seven-minute train ride from the buildings to the airport that really appealed to a couple from South Dakota, who wanted a place to stay when they are in Minneapolis. The couple, who asked that their names not be used to protect their privacy, fly in every month for private tango lessons. 
 ''This will be a good place to enjoy our retirement,'' said the woman, a professional in her mid-50's who loves to travel. ''The easy train ride to the airport and places like the Guthrie Theater was definitely a factor.''
 Paul Krumrich, 31, who owns an audio-visual company, Spyeglass, said he isn't bothered by the fact that he cannot open the windows of the units. What's important to him, too, is the fact that he can easily hop on the train to downtown Minneapolis to meet with friends on weekends.
 The design of the apartments was also a draw for Mr. Krumrich, who has reserved two two-bedroom units next to each other, paying $280,000 for one and $206,000 for another. He will have a view of the open, frontier-like Minnesota River valley to his south and downtown St. Paul to his east. He will live in one apartment and use the other as an investment.
 ''They're sleek, minimalist and modern,'' he said. ''I stayed in an apartment just like the model when I was in Ottawa, Canada, and when I saw this I knew it was the one for me. It's unlike anything else in Minneapolis.''

 CORRECTION:
The National Perspectives column on Dec. 16, about transportation in and around Minneapolis, misstated the name of the city's main airport. It is the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, not Twin Cities International. The error was pointed out recently by a reader.

HEADLINE: Edging Toward A Whack At Property Taxes

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
''If you're not getting something for nothing in Trenton, you're not getting your fair share.'' 
 Former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne
 LIKE an alcoholic crying, ''Stop me before I drink again,'' New Jersey's political leadership is desperately looking for someone, or some way, to stop themselves from more taxing and spending.
 This year their hopes are tied to the Task Force on Property Tax Reform, a 15-member panel, which this week is virtually certain to call for a constitutional convention aimed at amending the state's basic charter in a way that ends the cycle of higher taxes and higher spending.
 The group faces a daunting task because -- as each member knows, and as the Legislature that voted last summer to appoint them also knows -- the unoffending word ''reform'' can only mean a combination of two things: The rising property tax burden will have to be shifted -- to high-income earners and businesses -- and new sales taxes. Or, short of those remedies, the task force will have to recommend chiseling mandatory spending cuts into the granite of the constitution, and reducing spending is one of the things politicians hate more than limp salad and cold chicken dinners. Cutting spending, after all, means cutting jobs and services, particularly in the state's highly rated public schools, which consume most of the property tax bill.
 ''That's the fundamental dilemma,'' said James Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Policy and Planning at Rutgers University. ''We provide a high level of services compared to other states -- that's why people move here. But people want Cadillac services at Chevy prices.''
 Barely beneath the surface of that dilemma is a still thornier issue, tinged with issues of poverty and race and educating New Jersey's public schoolchildren. Nearly 9 in 10 dollars spent by the 31 poorest school districts come from state taxes based on the constitution's guarantee of a ''thorough and efficient'' education for all children -- and requiring that the poorest districts be financed at the same level as the richest.
 Many legislators, particularly those representing the majority of school districts that are not poor yet still far from rich, would like to see a constitutional amendment either toning down the ''thorough and efficient'' clause or making the aid formula less redistributive. 
 After all, they have grumbled, why should Asbury Park, one of the poorest districts, operate the most expensive K-12 school district in the state, spending $17,733 for each pupil, with 80 percent of that coming from state aid, when public schools in Manasquan Borough, only eight miles to the south, spends half that amount for each pupil, or $8,870, with just 6 percent coming from the state?
 New Jerseyans pay $17 billion a year in property taxes, more per capita than residents of any other state. About $4 billion of that is raised from commercial property, with the rest from homeowners, and the combined tax bill pays for 75 percent of local services, compared with the national average of 50 percent. The tax reformers will be aiming to reduce the property owners' share of local costs to where it is closer to the national average. 
 That the state is even considering whether to revisit the constitution to accomplish this is a sign of just how deeply the dilemma facing the state runs. After all, as several witnesses testified in seven hearings over the past three months, the governor, the Legislature and a swarm of local and county governments already have ample statutory power to shift taxes from homeowners, cut them, or raise new ones. But, as other witnesses testified, they just do not want to.
 ''The Legislature has never solved this problem,'' Governor Byrne testified earlier this fall, ''and I don't blame them. Property taxes are a third-rail issue with them, and to get them to make recommendations on it is a tough thing to do.''
 Judith Cambria, a fiscal policy specialist for the New Jersey League of Women Voters, made the same point when she testified.
 ''It is wishful thinking to believe that our elected leaders can or will address this sensitive issue,'' Ms. Cambria said. ''The political pressures that face our leaders are systemic, and they will derail any attempt to carry out other reforms.''
 It is not as if state leaders have not already tried something like this. In 1988, the New Jersey State and Local Expenditure and Revenue Policy Commission headed by Henry Coleman, another professor at the Bloustein School at Rutgers, issued more than 100 recommendations aimed at making the tax system more equitable, but none were heeded --''dead on arrival,'' as one task force member reminded the panel.
 And as Dr. Coleman has pointed out since then, the state budget was $10.4 billion when the report was submitted; today it is $26 billion.
 Still, several witnesses told the latest task force that since the power to tax and to spend belonged to the Legislature and the governor, the panel should deliver, in effect, a one-sentence recommendation: Do your job. 
 ''We're desperate in this situation we're in now, and I understand the attraction of desperate solutions,'' said Richard C. Leone, a former state treasurer and now president of the Century Foundation, a policy research organization based in New York. ''But I think it is the job of politics, the Legislature and the governors, to sort out the state's financial priorities.''
 Yet far from reining in property taxes, elected officials have been raising them, and faster than any other except, perhaps, the new business taxes that former Gov. James E. McGreevey pushed through in 2002. And higher taxes get cemented into the political fabric of the state by the very thing that taxes buy: jobs. 
 As a result, while total private and federal employment has fallen slightly in New Jersey since end of the last recession in 2000, state and local employment -- fed by rising property taxes locally and deficit spending in Trenton -- has soared. In the past four years, the state has added 14,000 jobs, just as local governments have -- excluding schools. As for the local school districts, already the state's biggest public employer, they have added 26,000 jobs, or an increase of 11 percent -- twice the average increase for the entire country and despite the rising cry over taxes and an uncertain economy. 
 Among the still unresolved questions facing the task force is this: should a constitutional convention simply deal with how taxes are raised, or with the expenditure side as well. People on both sides of that issue know that tinkering with spending will in some measure affect the livelihoods of thousands of households throughout the state.
 According to some of members of the task force, the group has worked out several of the simpler housekeeping issues. For instance, the panel plans to recommend that a convention -- made up of 80 or 120 delegates, with 2 or 3 representatives from the state's 40 legislative districts -- be held in New Brunswick, away from Trenton's baleful influences. In addition, the group will recommend that election for the delegates and the question of whether they will even have something to attend be voted on at the same time -- in the general election next November.
 But the tougher questions remain to be settled, such as whether a convention should be able to make statutory changes -- rewriting laws -- or limit itself to constitutional language? And will language be inserted in the referendum limiting the convention to taxing and spending, insuring that other combustible issues like abortion or the election of judges remain out of bounds?
 All of the decisions reached by the task force will come as recommendations to the Legislature, which will then have to define the scope of any possible convention. If the recommendation is that the convention not touch expenditures, delegates will have to shift the property tax burden to new sources. If it advises opening up expenditures, the main concern among many, including the Democratic majority in the Legislature, is that the ''thorough and efficient'' clause might be meddled with, perhaps by putting a limit on the proportion of state aid to the 31 poorest districts, or tying their aid levels to an average of all districts. 
 Several Republicans, including Leonard Lance, the Senate minority leader who is also a member of the task force, want the constitution's section on taxation and finance -- which would include the formula for financing the poor school districts -- open for discussion. But the very idea of reopening the debate over equity in education spending brings nothing but scorn from David Sciarra, director of the Education on Law Center, which represents the poor urban children in the so-called Abbott litigation.
 ''This idea that the Legislature is incapable of acting to deal with property taxes is a myth,'' Mr. Sciarra said in an interview, as well as in his testimony. ''All you have to do is go back to June when they increased the tax on high-income taxpayers to provide relief. Then they gave it away as rebates, which is the politicians' way to buy votes. If they would reconvene tomorrow and take the $800 million and come up with a formula in which it is distributed to lower property tax bills in municipalities with high property tax bills, the problem would go away.''
 Yet as Professor Hughes of Rutgers pointed out, shifting school taxes onto income taxes is hardly a sure bet, because while real estate taxes are fairly stable, income taxes fluctuate with the economy, and no school board wants to plan a budget or negotiate a contract on a fluctuating revenue stream.
 Diminishing the schools' reliance on property taxes would also further weaken restraints on spending in a system the Legislature manifestly believes is already out of control, since residents vote on their property taxes each year, but not on their income taxes. 
 Short of recommending limits on spending and the elimination of inefficiencies through consolidation, the task force could also propose looking at sales taxes. New Jersey's gasoline tax -- 14.5 cents on each gallon -- is the fourth lowest in the country. But only a couple years ago, even the hint of raising the gas tax to pay for transportation projects brought howls of protests and persuaded Governor McGreevey to quickly back off.
 Sales taxes are not collected on many services, including legal fees, accounting and advertising. But will a Legislature populated with a sizable collection of lawyers and accountants vote to tax their clients?
 And finally, looming over the entire debate, as Professor Hughes pointed out, is the $4 billion budget shortfall that acting Gov. Richard J. Codey and the Legislature will have to deal with by next June. That means the legislative debate over the task force's recommendations will come just as the Legislature wrestles with yet another tidal wave of tough choices even it cannot shift to others.
 ''If there is a constitutional convention, it will come after we've dealt with some pretty extreme crises,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''What's the appetite going to be after we've dealt with a $4 billion gap?''

LIBERTY AND FREEDOM
By David Hackett Fischer.
Illustrated. 851 pp.
Oxford University Press. $50.
 When patriotic country music fans sing Lee Greenwood's lyric ''I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free,'' what do they mean? Is Greenwood's idea of freedom the same as Bruce Springsteen's or Francis Scott Key's? And is this freedom the same as the liberty of the Declaration of Independence, the Pledge of Allegiance or the statue in New York Harbor? In ''Liberty and Freedom,'' David Hackett Fischer, a historian at Brandeis University, argues that we cannot learn how most Americans understand freedom by studying political theory or intellectual debates. ''Most Americans do not think of liberty and freedom as a set of texts, or a sequence of controversies or a system of abstractions,'' he writes. ''They understand these ideas in another way, as inherited values that they have learned early in life and deeply believe.''
 To probe those unspoken meanings and examine how they've evolved through the nation's history, ''Liberty and Freedom'' seeks to combine the ''new history'' with the ''old,'' using the habits and customs of ordinary people to illuminate the actions and ideas of political leaders. The book, Fischer says, is ''iconographic. It uses images, artifacts, and material culture as empirical evidence.'' Before he gets to images, Fischer turns to etymology, establishing a contrast between liberty, whose Latin roots suggest release from bondage, and freedom, which shares Northern European origins with friend. ''The original meanings of freedom and liberty,'' he writes, ''were not merely different but opposed. Liberty meant separation. Freedom implied connection.'' He makes much of this distinction throughout the book, favoring ''freedom'' and often disparaging ''liberty'' (associating it, for instance, with Southern racism). Yet he also declares that the creative tension between the two concepts has given English-speaking people ''a distinctive dynamism in their thought about liberty and freedom.''
 The book's more than 400 illustrations include largely forgotten symbols like liberty caps, folk art like the cloth dolls of Frederick Douglass as a slave and a free man, and bizarrely patriotic consumer products like the 1900 toilet adorned with an American eagle. Fischer's narrative, however, concentrates on official iconography, including flags, statues, coins, seals and campaign graphics, and on political leaders and intellectuals. He tells the stories of well-known icons like Uncle Sam, whose evolution he traces from the kindly, avuncular figure of 19th-century cartoons to the stern, demanding face of 20th-century recruiting posters. ''Liberty and Freedom'' is not a book about the previously unexplored expressions of unknown individuals.
 Still, there's much to learn even from well-known objects. Take the American flag. Compared to the simple iconography of Japan, China or Canada -- or the plain stripes of France, Italy or Russia -- our flag is a gaudy mess. Yet its complexity, like the complexity of the Constitution, reflects an order of checks and balances, of unity and federalism, past and present. It is a graphic representation of e pluribus unum. A historian of early America, Fischer offers rich accounts of the Revolutionary-era creation of national symbols like the flag. In the early Republic, different people put forth all sorts of seals, mottoes and flags, representing both competing ideas of liberty and different graphic heritages. The Stars and Stripes, he notes, emerged as a national banner not out of an official committee but through a decentralized process of experimentation.
 In 1777, the Continental Congress finally voted that the national flag should combine the red and white stripes used by Boston's Sons of Liberty with the star-strewn field of blue carried by George Washington's Army. But even that decree left the exact design open. ''American citizens received it not as a fixed instruction but as an invitation to creativity,'' Fischer tells us. ''The result was an outpouring of stripes and stars in many designs.'' Some flag makers arrayed the stars in rows, others in a circle, still others in an ellipse; five-, six- or seven-pointed stars appeared. Some flags included mottoes (''Virtue, Liberty, Independence''), additional images (the Liberty Tree) or the Masonically significant number 76. John Adams added the constellation Lyra to his version. Only in 1912 was the flag's form fixed by law, a symbol, unremarked by Fischer, of that centralizing era.
 The most peculiar early American flag, revived after 9/11 as a naval standard, is the rattlesnake banner with ''Don't Tread on Me.'' A poisonous reptile, Fischer notes, was ''a strange choice for a sacred emblem.'' It also represented a symbolic shift, appearing first as a symbol of unity -- powerful when joined, mortally wounded if divided -- and then becoming an emblem of backwoods liberty.
 ''The rattlesnake is solitary, and associates with her kind only when it is necessary for their preservation,'' wrote a Pennsylvania Whig in 1775, adding that the snake always gives warning to her enemies and ''never begins an attack, nor, once engaged, ever surrenders. She is, therefore, an emblem of magnanimity and true courage.'' The rattlesnake flag represented the ornery get-out-of-my-face liberty that remains particularly strong among Southerners, black as well as white. This idea of ''natural liberty'' will be familiar to readers of Fischer's 1989 book, ''Albion's Seed,'' in which he argued that the four waves of British immigration to the American colonies brought with them distinct and geographically enduring folkways, including specific ideas of freedom.
 New England Puritans pursued ''ordered liberty,'' or community self-government, which could impose substantial restrictions on individual freedom of action or conscience. Southern cavaliers believed in ''hegemonic liberty,'' a status system in which liberty was a jealously guarded aristocratic privilege that entitled some men to rule the lives of others. By contrast, Delaware Valley Quakers subscribed to ''reciprocal liberty,'' in which every person was recognized as a fellow child of God, entitled to self-determination and freedom of conscience. Finally, the largest group of immigrants, the borderlanders often called Scotch-Irish, adhered to ''natural liberty,'' a visceral, sometimes violent defense of self and clan. In foreign policy, Fischer's ''natural liberty'' maps directly to the ''Jacksonian America'' outlined by the political scientist Walter Russell Mead -- isolationist by preference but relentlessly violent when attacked. 
 ''Liberty and Freedom'' expands greatly on that earlier book's discussion, adding other ethnic influences, particularly that of German refugees who sought ''a freedom that would allow them to establish their own way of life in security and peace.'' For German-Americans, the icons of freedom were the fig tree and vine, alluding to the biblical prophecy that ''they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.'' This dream, Fischer observes, ''was an image of a world without violence, very different from the bellicose ways of British borderers but similar in a desire to be left alone by government.''
 Through the first half of the 20th century, ideas of good government clashed with that ideal, and during World War I and Prohibition (which devastated German-owned breweries and beer halls) German-Americans were among the country's greatest victims. Fischer insightfully characterizes the debate over Prohibition as ''a collision between two ideas of liberty and freedom. One of these American visions combined the 'orderly-liberty' of Theodore Roosevelt with the 'publick liberty' of old New England. The other descended from the natural liberty of the backcountry, the reciprocal liberty of the Quaker colonies and the Feigenbaum Freiheit of German immigrants. It created something new from those old materials.''
 So the folkways of the colonies have divided and fused into two distinct traditions of freedom, one collective, the other individualist. Unfortunately, Fischer doesn't develop the point beyond its application to Prohibition. Given his general sympathy for the collective vision and his frequent disdain for the desire to be left alone by government, he may not want to push the issue. He might feel forced to defend Prohibition or, worse, to acknowledge that the individualist fusion has evolved into American libertarianism, best represented by his bete noire, the economist Milton Friedman. (Fischer's antipathy for Friedman, whom he doesn't name but whose department at the University of Chicago he refers to as ''dogmatic'' twice in as many sentences, may stem less from Friedman's libertarian popular works than from his influential monetary scholarship, which contradicts Fischer's own eccentric -- to put it mildly -- theories of inflation. )
 Fischer is far happier depicting the Schlesingerian ''vital center'' of his childhood. The book's climax is the Freedom Train of 1947, which toured every state and was visited by 3.5 million people. It carried 126 ''universally accepted'' documents of freedom, from Magna Carta, Thomas Jefferson's draft of the Declaration of Independence, James Madison's draft of the Bill of Rights and Abraham Lincoln's text of the Emancipation Proclamation to the United Nations Charter. The train also displayed physical artifacts, mostly from World War II, including the flag raised at Iwo Jima.
 Its goal, one government official said, was ''to re-establish the common ground of all Americans'' and ''to blend our various groups into one American family.'' Fischer visited the train as a child in Baltimore, and it made a lasting impression: ''The train itself and its streamlined cars were emblems of modernity, and its big locomotive (number 1776) was a symbol of American power. By contrast, the documents seemed old and fragile. They were symbols not of power but of right, and their condition made clear their need to be protected in a dangerous world. Altogether the Freedom Train expressed the material strength and moral resolve of a united people.''
 Ah, the good old days. The closer the book gets to the present, the less it discusses popular culture or visual symbolism. It loses its early, charming tone and becomes instead a dutiful, sometimes cranky march through the political movements of the late 20th century. Cliffs Notes versions of ideas and individuals appear, but iconography and material culture almost entirely disappear. Fischer doesn't mention the Adam Smith neckties conservative activists adopted in the late 1970's or explain how triangles and rainbows came to symbolize gay liberation. He has room for a mention of Shulamith Firestone's radical, intellectual feminism but none for Marlo Thomas's popular record and television special, ''Free to Be You and Me.'' He provides a dumbed-down version of Friedrich Hayek's classical liberalism but doesn't mention Ayn Rand's blockbuster novels. He devotes pages to Stokely Carmichael but says nothing about Afros, dreadlocks or cornrows. He misses the chance to consider California as a symbol of freedom across the political spectrum. In short, once the apparent uniformity of World War II dissolves, ''Liberty and Freedom'' loses interest in popular culture. This absence may reflect the author's fatigue as the book moves beyond its 500th page. Or perhaps it is simply harder for Fischer to take a sympathetic interest in the mental and material lives of those contemporaries with whom he disagrees. He seems to resent all these contentious people (except for consensus civil rights heroes) who insist on disturbing established institutions and ideas with their demands for liberty and freedom.
 Indeed, he implies that they're downright dangerous. ''If a free society is ever destroyed in America, it will be done in the name of one particular vision of liberty and freedom,'' he concludes. But not, of course, his own.

HEADLINE: Reward Outgains the Risk of Fourth-and-Short

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
One yard from victory, Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman appeared to lose his nerve. Leading the Eagles, 17-14, with just over two minutes to play in the fourth quarter, the Packers faced fourth-and-1 on the Eagles' 41-yard line. By gaining a first down, the Packers could have all but run out the clock and moved on to last season's National Football Conference championship game. But Sherman sent in his punter, and many Philadelphia fans -- who would soon see the Eagles tie the score before winning in overtime -- remember how happy they were to see him run on the field. 
 A week later, the Patriots faced a fourth-and-1 during the first series of the game, in their own half of the field. They went for it, made it and were on their way to the Super Bowl. 
 Together, those plays seemed to be enough to shake N.F.L. coaches out of their acute fear of taking chances. More than a couple of high-profile anecdotes, the decisions were game-day proof of what statistics have long made clear: Teams have a better chance of winning if they go for it more often when facing fourth-and-short.
 So what has happened this season? Fourth-down plays have fallen to their lowest level in at least a decade. Through last weekend, teams were on pace to go for it on fourth-and-1 only 150 times, 18 percent less often than they did last season. 
 The closeness of this year's playoff races could be a cause of the new conservatism. When a game matters, coaches are loath to break from dogma and do something they might have to defend after the game.
 But fourth-down boldness should be one of the easiest decisions for a coach to defend. He can say that he believed in his players and that he was trying to give them the best opportunity to win.
 ''It wasn't gutsy at all,'' Jets Coach Herman Edwards said after ordering a fourth-down quarterback sneak against the Patriots this season. ''There was no doubt we were going to go for it. We are trying to win.''
 The main reason to go for the first down is that a team can often make it. In recent seasons, two out of every three fourth-and-1 attempts have succeeded, and success is the equivalent of erasing a turnover. Failing costs a team only field position, because a punt would have handed over possession anyway. The advantages of going for a touchdown instead of a field goal deep in the other team's territory can be even bigger.
 Using play-by-play records, William S. Krasker, a retired Wall Street executive who analyzes strategy at the Web site footballcommentary.com, has created a computer model that calculates an N.F.L. team's odds of victory in any situation.
 Last month, the Seahawks trailed the Bills, 10-0, midway through the second quarter and had the ball on the Buffalo 1 on fourth down. A team that tries a field goal then will win about 27 percent of the time on average, according to Krasker. A team that goes for the touchdown increases its odds to 32 percent.
 A touchdown, obviously, would be the best result. But the odds favor trying for it partly because failing is not so bad.
 The Bills would have been pinned on their goal line, and the Seahawks might have had another shot at a field goal a few minutes later.
 Every situation is different, of course. The Seahawks' running game is strong. But the Bills have a good defense. ''It was not a close call,'' Krasker said. 
 Then why did Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren call for his kicker and decrease his chance of victory by 5 percentage points, roughly as much as some turnovers would have hurt the team?
 Coaches seem to focus on all the things that could go wrong on the next play, like a goal-line stuff, while assuming their team can control what happens later in a game. They figure they should be conservative now, and everything will work out later.
 Often, though, their best chance at victory is staring them in the face.
 ''Tying the game does not guarantee that you win,'' Buccaneers Coach Jon Gruden said last month after going for it on fourth-and-1, and failing, from the Falcons' 28 with his team behind, 17-14. 
 Other coaches say they fear the effects of a momentum shift. But teams that fail on fourth down actually play slightly better after the attempt, said David Romer, an economist whose work has been read by Patriots Coach Bill Belichick. Perhaps players are inspired by the confidence their coach has shown in them.
 In the end, the best advice may come from a former high school tackle named Franklin D. Roosevelt. Fear itself rarely leads to wise decisions.

HEADLINE: A Quick Way to Build A Nation of Savers

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS

 BODY:
AMERICANS seem to hate saving. In October, the nation's households saved just 0.2 percent of their income. And despite the tax advantages conferred by 401(k)'s, individual retirement accounts and other savings vehicles, most people simply refuse to stash much money in them. As of 2001, the most recent data available, only 8.4 percent of 401(k) investors made the maximum contributions, according to Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
 Cultural critics have bruited a host of theories to explain our aversion to thrift: Americans are hoggish consumers. Like children, we live for today and don't worry about the future. Our popular culture and our economy encourage consumption. 
 But economists have been more perplexed. After all, the tax advantages and employee match of 401(k)'s -- free money! -- should appeal to any rational person. 
 Well, it could be that Americans' failure to save is caused by mechanics, not morals. At least that is one conclusion of a recent paper by four economists: David Laibson and James J. Choi of Harvard and Brigitte C. Madrian and Andrew Metrick of the University of Pennsylvania. 
 The scholars examined what happened at four companies that switched the way they pitched 401(k)'s to employees. When employees were offered the option of signing up for a 401(k) upon hiring, participation rates after six months ranged from 25 percent to 43 percent. Not bad. But when the same companies instituted default enrollment -- people were automatically enrolled in the plan when hired but could opt out -- participation rates after six months were 86 to 90 percent. In other words, changing the position of the on-off switch essentially doubled the rate. 
 At a different company, when employees were simply asked to make a decision about whether to participate -- yes or no -- within 30 days, the rate of enrollment rose to 70 percent from 30 percent.
 ''This gives the lie to the mythology that the American household doesn't want to save,'' Professor Laibson said. ''Whatever our propensities to save may be, they can easily be changed by changing the institutions in which we make choices.'' 
 What accounts for these vast differences? Well, people have to invest time and effort to opt out -- or in -- to a program. (But, really, how much psychic energy must one muster to check off a box?) ''You can call it laziness, or you can also call it busyness. But there are an awful lot of other things to compete with your time,'' said Christopher D. Carroll, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. As a result, in many situations, he said, ''whatever the default is, an awful lot of people will go with it.''
 A default can also be a sort of endorsement. Employees see the forms that are presented to them by authority figures and then infer that someone with more expertise has concluded that the default -- whether to save, or not to save -- is a good idea.
 Beyond simple inertia and deference, opting in to a 401(k) also sets off a series of complicated decisions -- about investment allocation and long-term planning. Complexity turns people off.
 ''It's almost like you have to be a financial expert to wade through it,'' said Bill Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies savings.
 At root, then, the researchers found, the choice of whether to save comes down more to psychology than to economics. Their approach is squarely in the growing field of behavioral economics, which is gingerly stepping away from the economists' orthodoxy that humans are eternally rational, relentlessly profit-seeking machines. In this schema, our consuming selves are constantly at war with our saving selves. 
 ''You know you'd be happier tomorrow not to put the extra purchase on the credit card, but you don't have a way to prevent yourself from charging it,'' said James M. Poterba, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''These findings suggest that there's a lot of psychology here that economists might not fully understand.'' 
 Indeed, Richard H. Thaler, the Nobel winner and dean of the behavioral economics field, has investigated this phenomenon. Professor Thaler, of the University of Chicago, and Shlomo Ben Artzi of the University of California, Los Angeles, devised and tested a program, called Save More Tomorrow, under which employees could opt into a program that automatically increased their savings rate over time. The results also pointed to higher levels of savings.
 PROFESSOR LAIBSON suggests other possible uses of default mechanisms to increase national savings. For example, what if income tax rebates were automatically channeled into individual retirement accounts, unless people chose to opt out? 
 So even if the bad news is that we don't save enough, even with all the vehicles and tax breaks, there's still some good news. To increase savings, we don't have to engineer a fundamental transformation of the American character. Instead, we may just have to tweak the institutional levers that have the effect of channeling cash in different directions.
 As Professor Laibson said: ''People will save if it's on the path of least resistance.''

HEADLINE: Learning Early That Success Is a Game

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin. 
This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN my children push my buttons, they do it with an Xbox controller. As I watch the two of them staring at the screen, oblivious to the real world around them (specifically their mother standing nearby and talking about room-straightening), I fear for their future. What kind of juvenile delinquents am I raising? Who would ever hire someone whose proudest achievement is reaching the 70th level in Everquest? 
 Before you start composing your outraged e-mail messages, let me assure you that, yes, there are limits on the amount of time that Evan, 13, and Alex, 10, can spend playing video games. And, yes, we revisit those rules periodically as their life-schoolwork equation changes. But even the strictest limits would not mitigate my baseline worries. 
 Why are my boys so entranced with this world in the first place? What does it mean that they want to climb into this magic box instead of heading outside or joining a team or even talking on the phone for far too many hours? (For the record, I used a touch-tone Princess phone to press my parents' buttons.) Why can they look at a screen and see a world where they belong while I look at the same screen and get a migraine?
 Just in time for gift-giving season (Evan wants Xbox Live, Alex wants the new Game Boy, but they are not getting them), John C. Beck and Mitchell Wade have come along to make me feel a little better. 
 Mr. Beck, a senior research fellow at the Annenberg Center for the Digital Future at the University of Southern California, and Mr. Wade, a consultant to companies like Google and the RAND Corporation, have just published ''Got Game: How the Gamer Generation Is Reshaping Business Forever'' (Harvard Business School Press). They collected 2,000 detailed questionnaires and conducted 200 additional interviews for the book. And they assure me that by playing video games my boys are actually training for the new world of work, not avoiding it.
 Mr. Beck and Mr. Wade divide the world into two groups: those who grew up with video games (the gamers) and those who did not. The fault line, at the moment, is at about age 30, and the difference in worldview is so sharp that it is already transforming the workplace. ''This new generation is completely different from the baby boomers, in the way they think and work,'' said Mr. Wade, who, like his co-author, is a nongamer in his mid-40's, ''and all of this is directly attributable to gaming.''
 My first mistake -- and the first mistake of many workplace managers, the authors write -- is in thinking that these games are an oddity or a niche. ''Game Boy and PlayStation aren't just a faintly embarrassing part of the economic landscape,'' they write. ''They are a central, defining part of growing up for millions of people. The first massive wave of mainstream gamers are in their 20's and early 30's now. They think games are just another part of the real world.''
 So, my children are not social outcasts. But what are they learning? According to Mr. Wade and Mr. Beck, they are learning a lot more than how to steal cars (no, I don't let them play that one) or shoot aliens (yes, they do quite a bit of that). Among the author's list of lessons from the gaming world: 
 ''You are the star. Unlike, say, Little League, where most kids will never be the star.''
 ''You're the boss. The world is very responsive to you.'' 
 ''There's always an answer. You might be frustrated for a while, you might even never find it, but you know it's there.'' 
 ''Trial and error is almost always the best plan.'' 
 ''It's all about the competition.'' 
 ''Young people rule.'' 
 Now imagine how some of these messages translate into the work world. To start, gamers are 50 percent more likely than nongamers of the same age to describe themselves as ''a deep expert in my work,'' a somewhat arrogant worldview for people in their 20's. The flip side of this arrogance, however, is a willingness to take a chance (60 percent of frequent gamers, compared with 45 percent of nongamers in the same age group, agree that ''the best rewards come to those who take risks'') and a view of failure as just part of the game.
 ''Sometimes you do everything right and you still die,'' Mr. Wade said. ''So you pick yourself up and start again.''
 I can live with that message, even though I can't shake the feeling that it was designed to sell books to conflicted parents like me. I will let my boys continue to play their games, with restrictions. And I will hope that navigating the Legend of Zelda is somehow helping them navigate the world. What do I know? I am a dinosaur who can't even operate the controller.

HEADLINE: Clear Sailing

 BODY:
Break out the concertinas. Clearwater, the sloop that helped save the Hudson River, just got a big boost in its battle against age and the elements. The Dyson Foundation has made a $300,000 grant to help pay for a seven-year, $1.6 million restoration project that is about half complete. 
 This is excellent news for Clearwater, the environmental organization based in Poughkeepsie that shares the boat's name. It may not be as momentous as, say, major new federal antipollution legislation, but in these challenging days of the second Bush term, we're glad of it, so pleased we could yodel. 
 The Clearwater, launched in 1969, has problems that surely afflict other aging veterans of the 1970's environmental movement: it's thin up top, where the deck planks have worn down, and it has creaking joints and shivery timbers. But the boat still has a mission -- as a floating classroom, to raise schoolchildren's awareness of history, science and the wonders of the riverine world, and as a living link to an earlier era of grassroots activism.
 We have come a long way from the age of belly-up fish and flammable rivers, of groundbreaking lawsuits and the Clean Water Act of 1972. The old boat and its namesake organization have had a lot to do with getting us here. They represent a style of homegrown advocacy that was somehow both dreamy and levelheaded, passionate and smart. The same organization that raised money selling pumpkins and baked goods faced down the Environmental Protection Agency, New York State and the river's industrial polluters, most notably General Electric, the source of the polychlorinated biphenyls that are the river's most durable chemical stain.
 The Clearwater has functioned as a literal patrol boat, monitoring the river for evidence of pollution that would compel government agencies to do their regulatory jobs. And it has been the focal point of the annual festivals that enlist warhorse folk singers to perform the less tangible but no less vital task of making people know and love the Hudson better.
 There have been many other factors behind the rebirth of the Hudson, of course, like the national environmental awakening inspired by Rachel Carson and ''Silent Spring,'' Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's support of a pioneering 1965 bond act to build sewage plants, and broader economic trends that led many industries to abandon the region.
 But the biggest forces behind the Hudson's restoration have often been private ones based along the river, groups like Scenic Hudson, Riverkeeper and Clearwater. The folk singer Pete Seeger founded Clearwater and lent his reedy, banjo-assisted voice to the struggle, which was joined by a broad coalition of fishermen, local property owners, artists and activists of every stripe. 
 The river and everyone who lives near it owe much to advocacy groups like these and to every other romantic who can look at an industrial cesspool and envision a place to sail, fish and swim.If all goes as planned, sometime around when President Bush leaves office, the Clearwater restoration will be complete. The shiny sloop will be relaunched with new sails, replanked foredeck, fresh rigging and a modified diesel engine that burns soy-based biofuels. And it'll be time to say again: Damn the PCB's. Full speed ahead.

HEADLINE: New Life for Former Hospital Site

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
LURED by the recent economic revitalization of White Plains, a Manhattan-based firm bought the 23-acre St. Agnes Hospital property for $21.4 million at a state-run auction last week. The winning bidder, the Noyack Equity Group, a partnership of six investors formed to acquire and develop the hospital property, said it plans to build housing for the elderly on the site.
 Noyack Equity outbid six other groups contending for the prized piece of real estate, which is one of the few undeveloped parcels its size in White Plains. Its proximity of less than a mile from this city's downtown -- where luxury high-rise residences are being built and big-box retailers are moving in -- makes it particularly valuable. 
 Noyack Equity Group, was recently formed to acquire and develop the St. Agnes property, said C.J. Follini, managing member for the investors. Mr. Follini, 37, said he and his partners were influenced by the new development taking place in White Plains. ''If this were 10 years ago in White Plains, I wouldn't have been a bidder,'' Mr. Follini said. 
 The hospital property has six buildings on it but is mostly undeveloped. The campus buildings include medical offices and the former hospital, which closed last fall.
 The 184-bed hospital, owned by the Archdiocese of New York from 1988 until last year, was founded by the Sisters of St. Francis in 1908 to help disabled children. The hospital shut its doors 14 months ago, leaving the state Dormitory Authority with an outstanding debt that included $36 million in bonds it issued to St. Agnes to make renovations and to pay off a loan.
 The auction represented the first time that the Dormitory Authority, a public benefit corporation that finances and builds facilities for higher education, health care providers, courts and some nonprofit organizations and public agencies, held a foreclosure sale, said Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the authority. The St. Agnes Hospital Corporation, she said, ''decided one day to close the hospital and walk away.''
 The hospital corporation was part of the Catholic Health Care System in Manhattan, which runs the Children's Rehabilitation Center on the St. Agnes property, a separate building that is still open and cares for children with developmental disabilities. It was included in the property sold at the auction, but its fate has not been decided, although Mr. Follini indicated he is taking part in discussions aimed at keeping the center on the property.
 In all, 45 nonprofit and for-profit groups requested fact sheets, tax maps, leases and other materials related to the former St. Agnes site, Ms. Hutton said.
 Mr. Follini said Noyack Equity Group had not drawn up specific plans for the hospital land, and the investors had not decided whether the retirement community units would be geared to high- or middle-income residents. But he said the investors planned to market the housing to empty-nesters and retirees. Much of the St. Agnes property is zoned for single-family housing. Depending on the proposals, some city approvals may be needed. 
 Mr. Follini and another investor, Alfred Caiola, 40, grew up in Pelham, and their fathers, Charles Follini Sr. and Ben Caiola, had been development partners for residential real estate. The four other partners were not identified.
 The other major bidder at the auction, which was held at the Richard J. Daronco Westchester County Courthouse, was 311 North Street Associates, an alliance of three companies. Simone Development Companies of New Rochelle; Fisher Brothers of Manhattan; and the Pirro Group of White Plains. That group had also planned to build housing for the elderly on the site.
 ''There's enough high-end and market-rate housing already in Westchester,'' Joseph Simone said a day before the auction. ''We'd like to do a different type of housing.''
 Similarly, housing for the elderly is being considered for some of the Reader's Digest property in Chappaqua, where Greenfield Partners and Summit Development of South Norwalk, Conn., will take title to the 114-acre campus this month. Because the Reader's Digest property is zoned for corporate use, any plans for housing for the elderly there would require approvals by the Town of New Castle. 
 Mr. Simone, a developer who reportedly was a contender for the Reader's Digest property, is building the Hutchinson Metro Center, an office complex in the Bronx on the foundation of what had been a state mental health center.
 Fisher Brothers is a three-generation family real estate company in New York City.
 Anticipating their acquisition of the property at the auction, the partners in 311 North Street Associates acquired a long-term ground lease on a five-story brick medical building on the grounds next to the hospital site on Dec. 7, in what Mr. Simone called a ''strategic acquisition.'' The building, which includes 400 parking spaces, was not included in the auction. 
 Mr. Simone's group paid $8.6 million to the previous leaseholder, the New York Medical College, for the 87 years remaining on the 99-year lease. The Medical College, which is affiliated with the archdiocese, leased the office building in 1991 because its medical students and residents completed some of their training there.
 Despite 311 North Street's intentions, Mr. Simone stopped bidding after the 57th offer for the property came from the Noyack group.
 ''The economics weren't there after that,'' said Geoff Thompson, a spokesman for 311 North Street Associates. Mr. Simone said earlier in the week that if his group failed to buy the 23 acres, the office building, which is two-thirds leased, would continue to be used for medical offices. 
 Another bidder for the property, the Italian Hospital Society, a 67-year-old nonprofit group, wanted to build what it said would have been the nation's first Italian-American continuing care retirement community there. Its initial plans called for up to 270 independent-living units, 75 assisted-living units and 35 to 45 skilled-nursing beds.

HEADLINE: Change Is Coming At the Top

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

 BODY:
THE search is on for new directors at four of Westchester's cultural institutions. And a fifth institution has just made a change.The simultaneous changes are unusual, but do not appear to herald any major shifts in the county's cultural scene; the public face of each institution will remain more or less the same, according to officials at the groups.
 As of Jan. 1, the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts will have a new executive director, Michael K. Unthank. Mr. Unthank, a staff member and program director at the New York State Council for the Arts, will take over from Ken Marsolais, who will become artistic director. 
 The Performing Arts Center of Purchase College, where Christopher Beach has said he will step down after next season, is looking for its own new executive director, while the Philipsburgh Performing Arts Center in Yonkers, whose executive director, Mathilda Hohensee resigned last month, is facing an uncertain future. The Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College and the Katonah Museum of Art also lost their leaders this year, and are seeking replacements. 
 The Neuberger has significant permanent collections of African art and 20th-century art and sculpture, including works by Milton Avery, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keefe and Jackson Pollock. 
 Lucinda H. Gideon resigned in the spring after heading the museum for 13 years to beome executive director of the Vero Beach Museum of Art in Vero Beach, Fla. Anne L. Bradner, former deputy director, is interim director. Denise Mullen, director of the School of Art and Design at Purchase, is heading a search committee of board members, students and faculty. The hope is that a new director will take over in the fall.
 Thomas Schwarz, president of Purchase College, said he hoped the new leader would make the 30-year-old Neuberger a more integral part of the campus.
 ''There was too much division between the museum and the rest of the college when I came here,'' said Mr. Schwarz, who arrived in 2002. ''My view is that the museum ought to be part of the curriculum.''
 The college is known for its dance, music, film and theater conservatories; its art school; and the Performing Arts Center, where students get hands-on experience. 
 Tracy S. Fitzpatrick was hired in September to fill a new joint position -- as assistant professor of art history at the college and adjunct curator at the Neuberger -- intended to better connect the institutions. Dr. Fitzpatrick was formerly an adjunct professor at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and at Rutgers University. 
 A search committee to find a replacement for Mr. Beach is to be formed shortly, said Carol Luiken, a spokeswoman. 
 The 50-year-old, privately run Katonah Museum does not have a collection, but concentrates on changing exhibitions and educational programs. It is choosing a successor to Susan H. Edwards, who left after six years to become executive director of the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville.
 ''Education is the most important part of our mission,'' said Yvonne S. Pollack, the president of the board. ''We need someone who is passionate about explaining this to the community.'' 
 Until 1990, when the first director was named, the museum, which has 12 paid staff members, was run largely by volunteers, who are still a vital part of daily operations, Ms. Pollack said. She said a new director would need to be able to work closely with the volunteers -- retired teachers, lawyers and others -- whom she called ''the spirit of the museum and its future.''
 She said a search committee was considering five candidates and would announce its decision next month. 
 The Northern Westchester Center for the Arts is 25 years old and based in Mount Kisco. It runs arts education programs and presents cultural events and performances. 
 A year ago, financial woes reached a crisis, when a $150,000 shortfall caused 11 staff members, including Mr. Marsolais, the executive director, to be laid off. Many, including Mr. Marsolais, continued to report for work.
 Renewed fund-raising has put the center in a healthier economic position, said Peter Giles, the president of the board.
 ''The way things are moving, the center is getting a strong grip on its financial picture,'' Mr. Giles said, adding that $60,000 was raised at the group's latest fundraiser, held on Dec. 11. 
 Mr. Giles said Mr. Marsolais, who has led the center since 1997 and is a former producer of award-winning Broadway and off-Broadway shows and documentary films, will focus on artistic programs, while Mr. Unthank will focus on finances.
 Mr. Unthank has directed statewide grant programs totaling $5 million at the council and has 25 years of administrative experience, including work with the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.
 The Philipsburgh Performing Arts Center was begun two years ago as part of an effort to revive Yonkers. Under Ms. Hohensee's leadership it presented performances, community events and classes in the restored 100-year-old Philpsburgh Building. 
 Ms. Hohensee left last month to become director of development at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry. The Rev. S. Burtner Ulrich, a founder of the center and chairman of its board, said the group was not yet looking for a replacement because money was tight.

HEADLINE: Tunnel Vision

BYLINE: By PRESTON NIBLACK. 
Preston Niblack is a deputy director of the New York City Independent Budget Office.

 BODY:
THE much-discussed fare increases and service cuts for mass transit are meant to ease the pressures on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's daily operating budget. 
 But attention must be paid as well to another budget at the M.T.A. -- the $27.7 billion, five-year capital plan. This budget has a gaping hole of $16 billion, money needed for buying subway trains and buses, repairing stations and constructing new lines like the Second Avenue subway. 
 Finding a way to pay for this enormous but crucial investment in our transportation system is the key to resolving the agency's long-term fiscal problems. 
 If the M.T.A. keeps doing what it's been doing -- borrowing the money itself for these capital improvements by issuing bonds whose principal and interest payments come out of the operating budget -- the shortfall in its operating budget will continue to grow substantially. 
 The agency can rely on outside assistance -- mostly federal transportation grants -- for less than one-third of the money needed for the maintenance and repair portion of its capital plan. And half the financing (at most) for the expansion portion will come from federal and city subsidies. The rest the M.T.A. has to generate itself. 
 That's a problem, because debt service -- the principal and interest paid to those who invest in M.T.A. bonds -- is already the fastest growing part of the authority's expenditures: it is projected to rise from 12 percent of operating expenses in 2004 to 20 percent by 2008. 
 The authority already issues nearly $2 billion in debt a year. And the fares, tolls and taxes that pay for the M.T.A.'s operating costs are not keeping pace.
 To get out of this fix, the agency must either slow the growth rate of its debt service by canceling or delaying its capital projects, or find a way to pay its escalating borrowing costs. Choosing the latter will mean that total M.T.A. operating expenses will continue to grow by at least 5 percent annually for the foreseeable future; meeting this expense will be possible only if there are regular tax increases, regular fare increases, entirely new revenue sources, or (most likely) all of the above. 
 But there is a third way -- one that slows the growth rate of the M.T.A.'s debt service without cutting back capital projects. 
 The idea would be to reduce the need for new debt by dedicating any new revenue sources to help finance the capital program on a pay-as-you-go basis. A realistic target might be to finance on this basis half of the ''normal replacement'' needs of the system -- about $1 billion annually.
 In a recent report, the Independent Budget Office identified two possible new revenue sources for the M.T.A.: tolls on the city bridges and the reinstatement of a commuter tax like the one eliminated by the Legislature in 1999. 
 We estimate that bridge tolls could generate more than $400 million annually after deducting bridge-maintenance and collection expenses. Reinstating the commuter tax -- essentially an income tax levied on those who work, but do not live, in the city -- would raise $443 million in 2005 and about $550 million annually by 2008. (A tax at the same rate on all residents of the M.T.A. service region, including New York City residents, would yield more than $1 billion annually.) 
 Other groups, like the Regional Plan Association, have proposed similar and other fees and taxes. The association estimates that a 10-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax in the M.T.A.'s operating region would garner $300 million annually. Increasing driver's license fees to $50 annually would raise $290 million every year. 
 Why is it fair to ask people who might not ride the M.T.A.'s subways, buses and trains to help pay for mass transit? Because passengers are not the only ones who benefit from a robust, reliable transit system. 
 Drivers also benefit from the reduced traffic that is a byproduct of a good mass-transit system. Businesses benefit from increased regional mobility. And all of us benefit from decreased air pollution when commuters use mass transit instead of cars. 
 There is no magic formula for determining how to apportion these costs, but it is important to recognize how widespread the benefits are and how vital mass transit is to a healthy regional economy and quality of life.
 Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other political leaders have so far rejected these fee- and tax-based measures. And they have not yet proposed any alternatives. 
 The M.T.A. does not have the power to tax. Only the state can raise fees and taxes -- and raising them to support our region's mass-transit system is a political decision that requires political leadership.
 We cannot continue to pretend that the burden of financing the M.T.A.'s daily operations and long-term capital programs are somehow the exclusive responsibility of the agency itself. It is not. The impetus for a solution must ultimately come from Albany and from City Hall.

HEADLINE: A Bronx Curbside Whisper: 'Hey, Need a Tuneup?'

BYLINE: By ANDREA ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The men saunter up and down a littered block of Third Avenue in the Bronx, casting sidelong glances at passing cars. When the cars slow down, the men mouth silent promises of a cheap fix. When the drivers pull over, the men scan for cops before sliding up to the curb.
 It is a singular hustle. There are no drugs or sex. Instead, the hoods of the cars fly open and the men get to work, pulling out greasy tools to perform every mechanical remedy from oil changes to hair-raising tuneups and axle replacements, right on the street.
 In the vast underground of New York's economy, street mechanics hold a peculiar if utilitarian place. For people who balk at a $30 oil change, there is Country, a 41-year-old Virginia native who charges a third of that, jacking up his clients' cars as rush-hour traffic creeps by. In the expert hands of Chino and Heavy, a $200 brake job costs half as much, parts included. 
 On busy days, cars line Third Avenue like sick patients, propped up by metal jacks, worn-out tires flung to the side. The mechanics disappear underneath, their boots peeking out, their tools splayed on asphalt outside the neon blink of auto parts shops.
 Sometimes ingenious, sometimes deceptive, they form a blue-collar rung in the city's freelance work ladder. They are mobile, carrying their tools in wheeled suitcases, on call around the clock by cellphone or pager. They draw clients from as far as Connecticut and Rhode Island. Some even wear uniforms, and the best ones travel on distant missions, reviving broken-down cars on roadsides from Boston to Atlantic City.
 ''I'm like an ambulance,'' said Luis Mares, 40, who installs rebuilt alternators for as little as $85. ''Where there's trouble, I go.''
 The flourishing, although illegal, street business blends comical improvisation with corporate savvy. But as it does in any profession, the talent ranges. Some mechanics leave customers careering away brakeless. Many make a mess, with discarded oil and strewn parts. And hovering over them all is the constant threat of the police, who issue tickets to the men tirelessly, leading to hundreds of dollars in fines and repeated stays in jail. Yet week after week, the mechanics stubbornly return to the same street to eke out a living on their own terms.
 ''This is New York,'' said Country, who would give only his street name and who has been issued, he said, 42 summonses in the last two years. ''If you're not on your feet, you're on your butt.''
 Street mechanics ply their trade all over the city. They can be found near Shea Stadium in Queens and around Pacific Street and Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn. But perhaps nowhere are they more brazenly visible than on Third Avenue from East 161st to 163rd Streets, in the Melrose Commons section of the South Bronx.
 On any given day, up to 15 mechanics work the street, competing for clients. Repairs begin after noon (the late hours are among the perks of the job) and pick up around 5 p.m., when customers leave their jobs and stop by for a new timing belt change or a brake adjustment. Paydays are the peak. Saturdays are prime: the best mechanics can pocket $400 in one day, saving clients the steeper prices charged by Pep Boys or Jiffy Lube. 
 ''I can't afford to go to the shop,'' said Howard Dawson, 66, a retired Amtrak repairman who regularly takes his '93 Cadillac Fleetwood to the street. ''One hand's got to wash the other.''
 The Third Avenue mechanics, like most workers, operate in a hierarchy.
 At the top are the owners of the auto parts stores, who moved to the street starting in the early 1970's. The mechanics came uninvited around the same time, like weeds in a garden. They formed a symbiotic relationship with the stores' employees. The stores sell parts to customers who often need a mechanic to install them and the mechanics will send their clients to the stores. 
 ''You help me and I'll help you,'' explained Humberto Ortiz, 56, a salesman at Ocampo Auto Electric on Third Avenue.
 At the bottom of the ladder are the ''helpers'' -- mechanics in training who earn much of their pay by luring clients. They, too, have street names that in the mores of the South Bronx are assigned more than chosen. There is Little Mexico, Dominica and Mouse. Not by coincidence, they share several traits: they are small in build, move quickly and seem to have an outsized view of their own mechanical abilities.
 ''Every time I see them doing something heavy, they look stuck in it,'' said Luis Martinez, who goes by Chino and is among the street's veterans. 
 Tales abound of jobs the helpers started and botched, only to be saved by the street's experts. But unlike other would-be street mechanics, whose bad reputations result in swift excommunication, these helpers have clung to their place on the street. They tend to live off small jobs, not always involving cars. 
 ''I walk this dog for $2,'' said Little Mexico, stabbing two fingers in the air as a tiger-colored pit bull named Puppy yanked him away.
 Some mechanics admit they work to support a drug habit. Others say they are ''clean'' and look upon their entrepreneurship as a career choice. Two Third Avenue mechanics -- Pernell Dingle and Elliot Rodriguez -- claim they graduated ''Mechanic of the Year'' from Alfred E. Smith High School, two decades ago. (An official at the school, Jeff Block, confirmed that both men got mostly A's. ''Dingle owes us $8,'' he added, for an automotive encyclopedia he never returned.) 
 Chino, who has dozens of regular clients, takes his job especially seriously, arriving promptly at noon with a yellow plastic tool case. He wears one of his six navy blue uniforms, washed and pressed by his wife. ''Who would you hire: a guy who looked like a bum or me?'' he says.
 One recent weekday, Mr. Martinez is swiftly dismantling the innards of a shiny black Lincoln Town Car to change the alternator. His hands maneuver expertly around the radiator tank, the power steering wheel tank, several hoses and the engine belt. (He learned the trade as a boy, taking apart engines in his backyard in the Soundview section of the Bronx.) Mr. Martinez's client watches closely and then instructs his gum-chewing girlfriend, who is seated behind the faux-fur covered wheel, to rev the engine.
 The engine roars. A Betty Boop air freshener flutters from the rearview mirror. The job is almost done.
 ''I promised him more power,'' said Mr. Martinez, 40, who has worked on the street for a decade. ''Now we'll check.'' The two men jump into the car and head off. Not only do clients get test drives, some get credit. 
 ''I've got about $200 in the street right now,'' Mr. Martinez said.
 He keeps a stack of his clients' business cards. One is a plumber, another a lawyer. Then there is the candy wholesaler whose fuel pump went bad on a trip to Boston. He paid Mr. Martinez $400 to fix it. Recruiters from auto repair shops visit the street from time to time, looking for potential hires, but Mr. Martinez is quick to rebuff them. He makes enough on his own, he says -- about $40,000 a year. 
 ''You walk into my house right now, you won't want to leave,'' said Mr. Martinez, who lives in a housing project a few blocks away. ''Big-screen TV. Surround-sound system.'' He sends his stepdaughter to a Catholic school and vacations in Puerto Rico twice a year. 
 The only nuisance, he concedes, are the tickets and occasional trips to jail. Mr. Martinez has been locked up twice, for two days each time. Some mechanics pay their tickets as dutifully as other people pay taxes. Mr. Dingle, on the other hand, has not paid one of his more than 50 tickets and has been jailed 17 times.
 ''I tell them to put me in my regular cell,'' said Mr. Dingle, 44, as he stood on the street one early evening. ''The cops know me by name.'' A few minutes later, a Chevy Impala with tinted windows slowly glided by. 
 ''See that little black car?'' said Country. ''That's the captain. He's out scouting.''
 Street mechanics violate a number of city codes seemingly written with them in mind: on the street it is illegal to repair vehicles, remove vehicle parts or discard oil. Each violation can carry a fine of $100. 
 But fines were rare, the mechanics said, until 2000, when the 42nd Precinct made ''quality of life'' issues a sudden priority and the police began cracking down on the trade. It was a sign of new times: the South Bronx was transforming, block by block, amid sweeping plans for urban renewal. 
 These days, the police know the mechanics well. They know, for instance, that Frankie Rosado flashes his worn brown tool belt at passing cars the way a prostitute might lift her skirt. 
 ''If I'm looking at a car, I'm guilty,'' said Mr. Rosado, 44.
 One recent weekday, the security guards at the Bronx Criminal Courthouse on East 161st Street gave Mr. Rosado a familiar nod as he emptied his pockets: fuses, bulbs and screws. He navigated the building like he was walking through his own kitchen. He turned without looking, smiled at a guard who winked back, and approached a man sitting before a computer.
 ''When's my next court date?'' he asked. With so many tickets, he had lost track. His latest offense, written up on a pink summons dated Sept. 29, was for ''dismantling.'' The man behind the desk lifted a plump arm, ''Monique'' tattooed across it in curly letters, and clicked on a mouse.
 ''Somebody's always messing with you somewhere,'' said the man as he searched the Rosados on the screen. ''Frankie C.?''
 ''That's my son,'' Mr. Rosado said.
 Seconds later, the dates were found and Mr. Rosado took off in search of more work.
 The street mechanic world is organic to South Bronx life, but like other underground trades, it is increasingly at odds with the borough's evolving self-image. The Melrose Commons area is awash in new development: stately town houses, a gleaming BP gas station, and a $250 million criminal courthouse close to completion. Even the three-block stretch where the mechanics work is destined to become part of a new $30 million campus for Boricua College.
 The mechanics shrug it all off, doubtful that new buildings will extinguish the need for bargain car repairs. Some of their clients, they laugh, are off-duty police officers. One of them, Edward Sanchez, dropped by recently to have the alternator changed on his 1993 Nissan Maxima. 
 ''For me, it's better if I see somebody working on the street than making problems, stealing in stores,'' said Mr. Sanchez, 29, who flashed his badge to prove he works as an auxiliary police officer. ''Maybe it's not legal, but I give them credit. They're trying to survive.''

THE WHOLE EQUATION
A History of Hollywood.
By David Thomson.
Illustrated. 402 pp.
Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95.
 IN the abstract, 400 pages doesn't seem like a lot to cover the history of that hydra we call Hollywood, one word (and one place) that has so many disparate meanings. David Thomson scrutinizes every one of those meanings in his ambitious sprawl of a book, ''The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood.'' For Thomson, ''the whole equation'' means ''not just the history of American movies, but the history of America in the time of movies.'' His intention, he says, was to write a history ''of magicians, con men, hacks and scoundrels.'' He continues: ''No one thinks to try the history of the whole thing in a way that could accommodate the artistic careers, the lives of the pirates, the ebb and flow of business, the sociological impact -- in short the wonder in the dark, the calculation in the offices and the staggering impact on America of moving pictures.''
 Four hundred pages isn't much in the face of such vast, dazzling territory. Then again -- what if it's too much? Thomson is knowledgeable about his subject, and opinionated: as histories go, this is a highly subjective one, which won't surprise anyone who has dipped into his contentiously idiosyncratic jardiniere of a reference book, ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film.''
 Thomson doesn't always run with the most obvious angles. He illuminates the tyrannical brilliance of Louis B. Mayer, ponders the possibility that Erich von Stroheim's original, forever lost, nine-hour ''Greed'' may not have been much better than the two-hour version and makes a case for the advantages of the old Hollywood studio system. Later, Thomson presents the contours of postwar America using film noir, the threat of Communism and the encroaching ubiquity of television as defining pencil strokes, and predicts that modern movie ''events,'' like ''The Matrix'' trilogy, won't grip us in 30 years' time as much as, say, the first two ''Godfather'' movies did. 
 Theoretically, there's nothing wrong with any of that, particularly if you take comfort in being reminded that Hollywood's best years are now behind it (which is, after all, much easier than grappling with the scrambled equation presented by contemporary Hollywood). But particularly for readers who know Thomson only through the ''Biographical Dictionary,'' ''The Whole Equation'' may be something of a slog: it includes brilliant flashes of insight and patches of lovely writing (particularly Thomson's recollections of the thick carpets, gilt walls and perfumed air of the movie palaces of his youth in his native England). But to get to them, you have to wade through pages of gassy digressions: Thomson is loquacious to the point of reader numbness.
 The elongated thumbnail entries in Thomson's ''Biographical Dictionary'' have an informed eccentricity that can be at least as infuriating as it is entertaining. But ''The Whole Equation'' demands more commitment and deeper trust on the part of the reader, and Thomson too often comes off as droningly dictatorial, as if he were trying to impress us with his thoughtfulness as opposed to snaring us in the energy of his thought. His prose is lively and readable in some places but radiates condescension and academic showiness in others. His passion is real, but it's often smothered in pomposity.
 And for all the fact-gathering and serious pondering that Thomson has done over the years, his judgment is often downright screwy -- most notably in his approach to silent film. He is no great fan of D. W. Griffith, which is his prerogative (although it is worth noting that without Griffith, no film critic or filmmaker today would even have a job), but Thomson doesn't have much use for silent film as a whole.
 He writes that ''if there was an 'art' in silent film'' -- if? -- it was all too reliant on stilted dance, Victorian theatricality and the beginnings of Soviet dynamism in composition and editing.'' He damns all silent-film acting as overwrought and hammy: ''To be paradoxical, sound pictures allowed characters to be silent, or to be as naturally recessive, as thoughtful, or as mysterious as people we encounter in life.'' It's hard to know exactly how Thomson defines ''thoughtfulness'' and ''mystery,'' but does he seriously think Lillian Gish and Buster Keaton lacked either? 
 It's hard to trust a critic who one minute laments that modern audiences don't respond to black-and-white movies, and the next displays such outright dumbness about the special, and often mysterious, code of silent-movie acting. Like it or not, silents gave modern movie acting its foundation, as well as leaving us legacies that live and breathe in movies today -- the extreme close-up, for example, which demands that modern actors express the deepest of feelings without swerving into melodramatic overkill.
 Thomson's dismissiveness of silents makes him seem like a fogy who's trying to be jazzy -- as if he were overly concerned to reassure us he's not one of those film scholars who's hung up on the deeper meaning of Griffith's tinting techniques. But if the real test of our modernity is how we feel about the past, Thomson's view of Hollywood's earliest products -- and its earliest art -- suggests he's not as with it as he professes to be. Then again, silent film probably wouldn't be popular with a writer who likes words -- lots of them -- as much as Thomson does. To show a world of heartbreak in a single, silent frame is the kind of economy that's lost on him. Maybe that's why, when you reach the last page of ''The Whole Equation'' and close its cover, the silence seems so golden.

HEADLINE: $53 Million For Pedro? How Do You Figure?

BYLINE: By ANDREW ZIMBALIST; Andrew Zimbalist is a professor of economics at Smith College.

 BODY:
LAST week, the New York Mets agreed to pay Pedro Martinez between $53 million and $56 million to pitch for the next four years, leaving fans to wonder what management was thinking. Could the former Red Sox star, now 33 and apparently past his physical prime, really be worth that kind of money?
 Let's do the math. Say that he stays healthy and pitches well -- an optimistic but not unreasonable assumption. Say he starts 16 home games, and the Mets draw an average of 15,000 more fans at those games than their typical crowd last season -- 43,979 instead of 28,979. Figuring $25 a ticket and another $8 a head for the team's share of food and souvenir sales, parking and so on, Mr. Martinez 's direct impact on stadium revenue would be to add $7.92 million for the season. If the bump in attendance turns out to be just 10,000 fans at his games, then the impact would be a more modest $5.28 million. 
 But that's not all. More people at the ballpark means the team earns more money from stadium signs and sponsorships. And Mr. Martinez's presence would presumably lift the Mets in the standings and persuade fans that the team's owner, Fred Wilpon, is serious about winning, so attendance ought to rise at other games as well. 
 Stay optimistic and assume that the new general manager, Omar Minaya, isn't done yet: He signs another superstar or two (think Carlos Delgado), the 2005 team contends for the division title, and the crowds at Shea Stadium grow to rival the 2004 New York Yankees' average attendance of 47,788 -- a gain of about 18,800 a game. That brings us to $50.3 million in extra annual revenue. If we can attribute, say, one-third of this to Mr. Martinez, his incremental contribution would be $16.8 million a year.
 Did we crack the nut? Not quite. Major League Baseball has revenue-sharing rules that reroute some money from big-market teams to small; in the Mets' case, about 40 percent of the team's incremental revenue. That cuts Mr. Martinez's contribution down to just $10.1 million a year, well below his average salary of $13.5 million. 
 So, a bad deal, right? Not necessarily. We've left out television. Signing Mr. Martinez will not change the fee Cablevision is obliged to pay to televise Mets games next year, but his presence could affect the success of the Mets' new regional sports channel venture with Time Warner and Comcast.
 Across town, the Yankees have their own cable network, known as YES, begun in the middle of the team's protracted string of World Series appearances. The Yankees were hot, so the network was hot: in 2001, it was reckoned to be worth around $900 million, more than the team itself.
 The regional sports cable market is flooded in New York, with YES, MSG and Fox Sports New York already operating, and there is no guarantee that the Mets' new network will be successful. But a compelling product on the field would be a big help. If Mr. Martinez can win a lot of games and infuse the team with attitude and charisma, the network could pull in $250 million in annual revenue (most of which can be sheltered from revenue sharing), and it, too, could be more valuable than the team. 
 Nothing is certain in economics or sports, but some gambles are better than others. With the new network in the offing, this looks like a smart time for Mr. Wilpon to open his wallet for a marquee player like Pedro Martinez. 
 And if it doesn't work out as well as the Mets hope, Mr. Minaya can console himself with the thought that the Yankees will be paying Kevin Brown $16 million next year.

HEADLINE: Don't Dismantle The New Deal

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''What's New in the Legal World? A Growing Campaign to Undo the New Deal,'' by Adam Cohen (Editorial Observer, Dec. 14):
 It's long been clear that the conservatives have wanted to dismantle the New Deal, but usually, as in the case of Social Security, this aim has been obscured by the smoke and mirrors of a manufactured ''crisis.'' But the current explicit attempt to return to a pre-1937 legal era is the smoking gun that ought to inspire a fierce Democratic counteroffensive. 
 We should forget about becoming a faith-based imitation of Republicans. We need to recall our own Rooseveltian roots. As Mr. Cohen notes, few Americans may want to go back to the era when ''liberty of contract'' meant that consumers could be cheated, workers freely exploited and the air freely polluted, and old people were doomed to poverty.

HEADLINE: Career Training Needed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re: [''The Juilliard Effect: Ten Years Later,'' Dec. 12.] Music conservatories are increasingly leaving many bright and talented people woefully unprepared for the world outside the recital hall. While music students are some of the most intelligent and capable individuals in the college- student pool, their professional music opportunities are shrinking, and their education fails to support any other vocation. Conservatories need to respond by broadening their curriculum, introducing students to the history and political science that brought forth the music they love, exploring the connection between music composition and higher math, and by teaching students the economics of music-making and marketing of talent. And they must demand the same rigor in such a liberal artscurriculum as they do in their performance classes. There is no shame in graduating from a conservatory and opting to pursue a career outside music.

HEADLINE: Green Resorts, Good Jobs?

 BODY:

To the Editor: Steve Bailey, who wrote ''Where Being Green Can Be Easy,'' (Oct. 31), may think ''eco-resorts'' are ''virtuous'' but those of us who value human rights more than environmental purity will not call any business virtuous without first determining how it treats its employees -- a matter about which Mr. Bailey's article gives no information.
 For instance, when the land for Tiamo Resorts ''was cleared by hand, using machetes and chain saws, to limit damage to the vegetation," who did the actual labor, I wonder? How well were these workers paid?

Felicia Ackerman
Providence, R.I.

Mike Hartman, owner of Tiamo Resorts, responds: From the very beginning, Tiamo Resorts has worked diligently to pursue this development ''the right way.'' Not only have we taken every aspect of our impact on the environment into consideration -- but we have also put as much (if not more) effort into insuring that our impact on the local community and its members is positive and profitable.
 Since the inception of the Tiamo Resorts project four years ago, over $1,062,000 has gone into the local South Andros Island economy in payroll alone. Our starting wage is $5 per hour (plus benefits) and we have staff salaries ranging above $40,000. We have more than 30 staff members and only three are non-Bahamian. These same levels of pay were prevalent during construction. It might also be noted that I and my wife (who is originally from Jamaica) worked side by side, machete in hand, with the local crew during construction and still do.

Given the dozens of outlet stores in this town -- offering everything from discounted designer gowns to rugs to china -- and a conventional shopping center, it might be surprising that there is a retail niche that needs filling. But Hartz Mountain Industries, which built Harmon Meadow, 750 acres of stores, offices and hotels that opened in 1979, as well as Harmon Cove, the sprawling outlet center here, has discerned a gap and is rapidly filling it with ''big box'' retailing.
 The company created Harmon Meadow from farmland. It is now home to 11 restaurants, 7 hotels, 11 office buildings, the Mill Creek Mall and two movie theaters with 14 screens. Adding the big-box retailers to this lineup is a ''threshold moment,'' in the words of Hartz's chief executive, Emanuel Stern. 
 A 173,137-square-foot Wal-Mart and a 155,802-square-foot Sam's Club opened last month and nstantly began drawing throngs of shoppers. They are just the beginning, Mr. Stern said. 
 By next summer, Hartz will open an additional 199,200 square feet of big box space in three locations in the Harmon Meadow development. The company has already leased much of it to national chain stores: Marshall's/HomeGoods, A.C. Moore, Linens 'n Things and another large chain, as yet undisclosed.
 Marshall's/HomeGoods and A.C. Moore will be in a new building on Park Plaza Drive, east of Mill Creek Mall, an enclosed mall anchored by Kohl's with dozens of stores. There is still 26,000 square feet available in the Marshall's building, and Mr. Stern said negotiations are well under way with a likely tenant. 
 Linens 'n Things will occupy a building that fronts on Route 3.
 A third building, offering 34,000 square feet, is under construction across the parking lot from Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, just north of the Loews 8-Plex Theater. The space is being marketed now.
 The discount stores are bringing in crowds of shoppers from northern New Jersey as well as Manhattan, even as the outlet stores, about two miles away, battle for customers. ''We know the outlets are having some hard times,'' said Secaucus's mayor, Dennis Elwell. ''But the new stores' opening up is very, very positive for the economy, and the ladies in town love it. It's hard to get a parking spot on a weekend.''
 The parking lots are huge at the two new stores off Park Plaza Drive, but the mayor speaks the truth. Last Sunday, the place was jampacked, and there wasn't a prayer of finding a spot near the front door of Wal-Mart or the $15 Christmas tree lot between it and Sam's. 
 As an office and hospitality center, Harmon Meadow provides more than two million square feet of office space. The development is less than a mile from the new Secaucus rail transfer station for New York City-bound trains. Early next year, Harmon Meadow will begin running a shuttle service to and from the station. 
 The New Jersey Turnpike slices through Harmon Meadow, just north of where it intersects with Route 3. The development lies within three miles of Manhattan, where there are no Wal-Marts or Sam's Clubs, noted Mr. Stern, who added that the Secaucus stores are the closest to Manhattan of any in the tristate region.
 ''Harmon Meadow also draws heavily from Bergen County on Sundays,'' Mr. Stern said, ''because of the blue laws,'' county prohibitions against commerce on a traditional day of worship.
 The Hartz executive said that the original plan, as envisioned by his father, Leonard Stern, who preceded him in his position, was to build more office and hospitality space on the land parcels at the edges of Harmon Meadow.
 ''Things change over 20 years, though,'' Mr. Stern said. ''It's time for a rebirth. The first generation of assets was doing well, but as long-term leases expired, we have an opportunity to change direction with some existing space as well.''
 There has been considerable turnover in the restaurants at Harmon Meadow recently, he said. National chains opening new establishments include Bonefish Grill, Red Lobster and Cheesburger in Paradise. A newly opened Outback Steakhouse is already enjoying crowds of patrons that ''knock the socks off the ball,'' as Mr. Stern put it.
 Hartz also recently rebuilt and reopened the Olive Garden restaurant at Harmon Meadow and has updated the signs and renovated the walkways throughout the development.
 The Marshall's store will be the first in New Jersey with a HomeGoods store under the same roof, sharing a 70,000 square-foot space. A.C. Moore will operate its discount arts and crafts store in 21,500 square feet in the same building. Linens 'n Things, one of the leading national large-format retailers of home textiles, housewares and decorative home accessories, will occupy 47,000 square feet at the southern end of Harmon Meadow next to the westbound service road for Route 3.
 Mayor Elwell said the only clouds on the horizon he could see involve stiff competition and serious traffic problems that could potentially be generated by the Xanadu entertainment, retail and office complex that is planned for a site farther west on Route 3, on land surrounding the Meadowlands sports complex. 
 During the competition to develop the Meadowlands site, Hartz submitted its own proposal, and it has fought for two years to overturn the state's approval of the Xanadu project, which is to be developed by the Mills Corporation and the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.
 ''We'll just have to see how that shakes out,'' Mr. Elwell said, ''but retail can be fickle, and traffic has really become a big issue because of the size and complexity of the Xanadu proposal.''
 Other definite and prospective developments had the mayor sounding more merry. Riverside Court, the first new large-scale housing complex in 20 years, is nearing completion just off Route 3. The 212-unit condo development by Baker Residential will increase Secaucus's population, which stands at only 15,000. The town's redevelopment plan also calls for 1,800 new rental units to rise near the rail station.
 ''It's great how all that will come together: more residents, more stores, more shopping,'' the mayor said.

HEADLINE: Fannie's Fans Must Be In Denial

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE Securities and Exchange Commission's smackdown of Fannie Mae should upset not only the company and its arrogant executives. It should also embarrass the Wall Street analysts who reassured investors last September that the S.E.C. would probably take a friendlier view of the company's accounting than did its other regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. Instead, the S.E.C. said last week that Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage company, must restate its earnings for the past four years.
 But because shame is simply not in the typical brokerage analyst's DNA, investors were given further assurances that all remained fabulous in the house of Fannie. According to one of the shills, removing $9 billion in earnings from Fannie Mae's results since 2001 (Fannie's own estimate, by the way) would have ''no economic significance.'' 
 Of course, these are the same people who have never met a corporate management team they didn't like. And the steady stream of bounteous investment banking fees Fannie Mae provides to Wall Street probably doesn't hurt, either. In any case, the analysts' utterances had the desired effect: Fannie's stock fell only 0.5 percent by the end of the week.
 A few analysts are not under Fannie Mae's spell, however, and they take a different view. One such skeptic, Josh Rosner, an analyst at Medley Global Advisors in New York, said that while the company's regulatory woes were the immediate problem, other forces out of Fannie's control would put significant pressure on its business of buying and selling billions of dollars in mortgages. 
 And on the subject of Fannie Mae, Mr. Rosner is worth heeding. For a year, he has been warning clients about coming Fannie Mae woes; his has been a lonely voice of reason on the company's prospects.
 Mr. Rosner said that even after Fannie Mae works out its differences with legislators who want to rein it in and with regulators who want more conservative accounting, its troubles are far from over. That's because the mortgage market is changing, and those shifts are sure to lessen the company's dominance and, more important, cut into its income growth. 
 ''We're not in Kansas anymore,'' Mr. Rosner said.
 In making his case for why the landscape around Fannie Mae is forever changed, Mr. Rosner pointed to three major shifts. First is the fact that the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, the highly profitable loan that is Fannie Mae's stock in trade, appears to be losing some appeal among homeowners. 
 About 30 percent of the mortgage market is adjustable-rate mortgages. But so-called hybrid adjustables, which have a fixed rate of interest for a specified period and then move to a floating rate, are coming on strong. These hybrids make up almost three-quarters of the adjustable-rate mortgage market, up from 7 percent five years ago, Mr. Rosner said. 
 Consumers will be more likely to choose hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages in the future, Mr. Rosner reckoned, and not only because they are cheaper than 30-year fixed-rate loans. Increased family mobility has shortened the typical mortgage to five to nine years. So homeowners will figure that hybrid mortgages with fixed rates for 7 or 10 years are preferable. The only factor that could alter this trend would be a significant increase in interest rates. 
 Fannie Mae, of course, could compete in the adjustable-rate mortgage arena. But, Mr. Rosner noted, it would have a negative effect on the company's profit margins. 
 A second element that could undermine Fannie's business in coming years relates to new capital requirements expected in 2006 from the Bank for International Settlements. As Mr. Rosner explained, one of Fannie Mae's main roles is as a conduit for lenders seeking to free up both the capital to make additional loans and the reserves that must be held against those loans. 
 Lenders like to sell their loans to Fannie Mae because they can lend that money again, generating additional revenue. The banks can also swap loans for guarantees from Fannie Mae so that they have no exposure to the mortgages and do not have to add to reserves. 
 UNDER the new rules, capital requirements will move away from the one-size-fits-all attitude toward risk assessment. Now, all loans in an asset class have the same capital requirements. In the future, banks will be allowed to adjust their capital to reflect the risks in a particular loan. This change, Mr. Rosner said, will significantly increase the economic incentives for banks to hold onto mortgages, especially those with the most predictable credit and cash-flow characteristics. But it will also cut into Fannie Mae's growth.
 Another worry is the prospect for a decline in the fees that Fannie Mae earns from banks for guaranteeing loans, a big source of its income. 
 Mr. Rosner said that if Congress created a new regulator to oversee Fannie Mae and its mortgage finance sibling, Freddie Mac, that new entity would also likely supervise the Federal Home Loan Banks, which compete with Fannie and Freddie. Such a regulator would probably bring into line disparate practices at the entities; one of these relates to the size of guarantee fees they charge their customers.
 Fannie Mae charges guarantee fees that are roughly double those assessed by the home loan banks. Mr. Rosner said that this could soon change, further pressuring Fannie Mae's profit margins. Fannie Mae reaped $1.5 billion in such fees last year.
 Mr. Rosner concedes that these may be longer-term concerns. More immediately, he fears a possible wave of mortgage defaults. After all, mortgage defaults typically occur from three to five years after the loans are written. The flood of refinancing in recent years means that a great majority of outstanding mortgage loans are less than three years old. Defaults could rise substantially.
 A Fannie Mae spokeswoman said that the company would not comment, beyond its avowal to do what it must to comply with the S.E.C.'s findings on its accounting deficiencies. 
 Why Fannie Mae shareholders are so unfazed by the company's mounting problems is a mystery. Sean Egan, president of Egan-Jones, an independent debt-rating firm that does not receive payments from companies it analyzes, said he was surprised by the denial at work among Fannie Mae's investors and debt holders. 
 ''All big failures are built on false assumptions,'' he said. ''The tulips were always going to be in short supply, so prices were always going to go up. In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they have terrific assets -- mortgages that have historically been a low-default asset. And the federal government is going to stand behind them.''
 What if one or both assumptions are false? ''If Fannie Mae gets into difficulty,'' Mr. Egan said, ''It's highly likely that current investors are not going to get paid back in full and on time by the federal government.''
 Ridiculous? Maybe not.

HEADLINE: Sizing Up The New Toned-Down Bin Laden

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
WHAT does Osama bin Laden want?
 The vexing question emerged again last week with the release of an audiotape on which the Qaeda leader seems to be speaking. On it, he applauds the Dec. 6 attack against the United States Consulate in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and urges the toppling of the Saudi royal family.
 The tape indicated that Mr. bin Laden has apparently moved the fomenting of a revolution in his Saudi homeland toward the top of his lengthy and ambitious wish list, which also includes the reversal of American foreign policy in the Middle East, the retreat of the American military from the Arabian Peninsula and the creation of a Palestinian homeland.
 Mr. bin Laden has advocated these sea changes before. What intelligence officials and terrorism experts find particularly remarkable in his recent pronouncements is a shift in style from the raw anger and dark imagery of the post-9/11 days. They say he has subtly tempered his message, tone and even persona, presenting himself almost as an ambassador, as if he sees himself as an elder statesman for a borderless Muslim nation. 
 Earlier this year, he offered a truce to European governments that withdraw their troops from Iraq. In a message released just before the presidential election in the United States, he gloated that the war in Iraq and the ''war against terror'' were primarily responsible for record American budget deficits. Instead of talking about exacting blood from his enemies, he offered a sober discussion of the bleeding of the American economy.
 Perhaps most striking is Mr. bin Laden's expression of frustration. Like any politician on the stump, Mr. bin Laden craves the ability to deliver an unfiltered message to his audience. Speaking directly to Americans in the pre-election address, he complained that his rationale for waging a holy war against the United States was repeatedly mischaracterized by President Bush and consequently misunderstood by most Americans. 
 To change this, Mr. bin Laden is testing what he apparently believes are more mainstream themes, while trying to dislodge the entrenched American view of him as a terrorist hell-bent on destroying America and all it stands for. In the pre-election address, Mr. bin Laden said Mr. Bush was wrong to ''claim that we hate freedom.'' He added: ''If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike, for example, Sweden.'' 
 That remark surprised some counterterrorism officials and terrorist experts, who said the Al Qaeda leader rarely injects sarcasm into his public pronouncements. They took it as a signal that he was trying to broaden his appeal, particularly to moderate Muslims and possibly even some Americans.
 What they cannot say is whether the less strident approach means that he has changed his goals and is less of a danger or that he is just laying the groundwork to justify a new attack against the United States. But they are listening closely and debating an important question: Is Mr. bin Laden committed to destroying America, or has he become more pragmatic, trying to begin a rational foreign policy debate about its presence in the Middle East and even appealing to Americans' pocketbooks?
 ''Osama is not a man given to humor, but when he told this joke about Sweden, I think it showed his frustration that Americans are not listening to him,'' said Michael Scheuer, a former senior C.I.A. official who tracked Mr. bin Laden for years and is the author of ''Imperial Hubris.'' ''We are being told by the president and others that Al Qaeda attacked us because they despise who we are and what we think and how we live. But Osama's point is, it's not that at all. They don't like what we do. And until we come to understand that, we are not going to defeat the enemy.''
 The bin Laden messages are a historical rarity: a foreign leader speaking so directly and frequently to his enemy. Mr. bin Laden has spent 25 years honing his message, and began to address an American audience in the mid-1990's. Since Sept. 11, 2001, he has delivered 17 messages, while his top lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has made 12. That amounts to a message from a Qaeda leader every six weeks.
 Intelligence officials are divided on what the two men are trying to accomplish. Some believe they are the leading advocates for what is increasingly being called Qaedism, an anti-Western gospel that they hope will inspire attacks all over the world. Others say the messages are intended to be jihad pep talks, or veiled triggers for new attacks. 
 Some believe these messages were used that way before the commuter-train bombings in Madrid in March and the bombings of British targets in Istanbul in 2003. Some messages have bluntly threatened new terror strikes; on April 15, Mr. bin Laden warned that an attack would strike any European country that failed to withdraw its troops from Iraq within 90 days. (No country complied, and no Qaeda-linked attacks have occurred in Europe since then.)
 Mr. bin Laden's attempt to engage Americans is occurring while his message to drive the United States out of the Muslim world is resonating with those among the 1.2 billion Muslims who believe the Qaeda leader eloquently expresses their anger over the foreign policies of the United States and Israel. In recent years, he has emphasized the Palestinians' struggle. ''His genius lies in identifying things that are easily visible and easily felt by most Muslims,'' Mr. Scheuer said. ''He has found issues that are simple, and that Muslims see playing out on their televisions every day.''
 But Mr. bin Laden also wants Americans and Europeans to heed his messages and urge their leaders to change their Middle East policies. This has not happened and probably will not happen. ''He is tuned out by most Americans and Europeans, and it's begun to really annoy him,'' said a senior counterterrorism official based in Europe.
 In his pre-election address, Mr. bin Laden seemed irritated that interviews he gave to Western journalists in the 1990's went largely unheard by most Americans. He appeared to suggest that if American leaders had listened to his warnings that the United States must change its foreign policy in the Middle East or face the consequences, the Sept. 11 attacks could have been avoided.
 Analysts say Mr. bin Laden's repeated refrain is that Al Qaeda's strikes are retribution for American and Israeli killings of Muslim women and children. ''Reciprocity is a very important principle in the Islamic way of the world,'' Mr. Scheuer said. ''They judge how far they can go by how far their enemy has gone.''
 What stood out in the pre-election message was Mr. bin Laden's bid to reinvent himself. He traded his battle fatigues, his AK-47 and a rough-terrain backdrop for a sensible sheik's garb, an anchor desk and a script without a single phrase portending a clash of civilizations. No longer was he reflecting on his own possible martyred death in the ''eagle's belly'' -- the United States -- as he did in 2002, nor did he threaten another spectacular attack against America.
 Instead, he said the United States could avoid another attack if it stopped threatening the security of Muslims. He spoke at length about what he sees as the true motive for the Iraq war -- to enrich American corporations with ties to the Bush administration. (He cited Halliburton.) And he spoke of bloodshed, but this time metaphorically, about the American economy.
 He mocked the United States's budget and trade deficits, saying that Al Qaeda is committed ''to continuing this policy in bleeding American to the point of bankruptcy.'' And he said that the 9/11 attacks, which cost Al Qaeda a total of $500,000, have cost the United States more than $500 billion, ''according to the lowest estimate'' by a research organization in London that he cited by name.
 ''It all shows that the real loser is -- you,'' he told Americans, according to a transcript by Al Jazeera, the satellite network.
 Peter Bergen, a CNN analyst who interviewed Mr. bin Laden in 1997, said, ''The talk revealed bin Laden to be sort of a policy wonk, talking about supplemental emergency funding by Congress for the Afghan and Iraq wars, and how it was evidence that Al Qaeda's bleed-until-bankruptcy plan was working.''
 Jessica Stern, a Harvard professor who lectures on terrorism, said she was most surprised by Mr. bin Laden's detailed comments about the American economy. ''It seemed as if he was trying to appeal to more moderate Muslims, who might have found his 1998 fatwa to kill all Americans morally repulsive,'' said Ms. Stern, the author of ''Terror in the Name of God: Why Religious Militants Kill.'' ''His message on this tape is not nearly as offensive. He talks about Americans having a choice -- it is up to us to decide whether we will support a foreign policy that he says is bad for our economy and bad for the Islamic world.''
 Mr. bin Laden first turned his attention to Saudi Arabia in the early 1980's. He began demanding that the United States withdraw its troops from the Arabian Peninsula, home to the holiest Muslim sites. The American military presence in Saudi Arabia officially ended in 2003, months after a Qaeda-linked terror group launched a series of attacks inside the kingdom.
 Analysts say Mr. bin Laden believes that it will be much easier to overthrow Arab regimes if they are not supported by American power. And he wants to encourage the current upheaval in Saudi Arabia, though analysts say they are unsure why he has suddenly made it a priority. Saudi Arabia has killed or arrested hundreds of militants, but there are cells still capable of carrying out attacks there.
 ''He sees Saudi as one of the places where he might be successful,'' said Matthew Levitt, a former F.B.I. terrorism analyst. ''And he realizes there is tremendous potential in terms of societal issues that breed radicalization.''
 Does Mr. bin Laden's more moderate style mean there is less risk of a terrorist strike on American soil? Intelligence analysts are unsure. More than one analyst discerned an ominous warning embedded in his milder pre-election address.
 ''In Islamic jurisprudence, the warning is important,'' Mr. Bergen said. ''And if we don't respond, it's our problem and our fault. He's putting the ball back in our court. Maybe this is all rhetorical and they don't have the ability to launch another big attack. But he intended to tell us that if we choose to completely ignore him, which is a very viable option for us, then we are going to get hit again.''

HEADLINE: Who's Afraid of China?

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: Austin, Tex. 

 BODY:
SHAYNE MYHAND, the day-shift manager of Dell's flagship factory here, does a lot of chaperoning. As many as four or five times a day, he finds himself playing host to corporate chieftains and midlevel scouts who come to marvel at the dazzlingly efficient assembly plant that may be the best hope for keeping blue-collar jobs in the United States. 
 A 31-year-old with a crisp, militarylike bearing, Mr. Myhand begins each tour the same way, moving to a display case and grabbing an unimpressive wooden plaque commemorating Dell's production of 49,269 personal computers in the last three months of 1991. ''On a good day, during peak demand, we'll exceed that number by lunchtime,'' he said, with a slight nod and a faint smile gracing his lips. He told a visitor that even now, during the Christmas season rush, an order that hits the factory floor at 9 a.m. is typically stacked in the back of a truck motoring down an interstate highway by 1 p.m. 
 Inside Dell, the world's largest computer maker, executives study the assembly process with the intensity of Alfred Kinsey and his researchers. They wheel in video equipment to examine a work team's every movement, looking for any extraneous bends or wasted twists. Designers give one another high-fives for eliminating even a single screw from a product, because that represents a saving of roughly four seconds per machine built -- the time they've calculated it takes an employee, on average, to use the pneumatic screwdriver dangling above his or her head. 
 Computer software clocks the assembly-line performance of workers, whether they're putting together PC's or the servers and storage equipment that Dell sells to large companies. The most able are declared ''master builders'' and then videotaped so that others may watch and learn. The weak are told that it takes a special set of talents to cut it on the Dell factory floor -- and shown the door. 
 Steely-eyed cold, to be sure, but at a time when economists and politicians fret over the future of American manufacturing as China emerges as the workshop of the world, Dell isn't just defying a global trend; it's helping to set the standard. ''When everybody is outsourcing -- when everybody is outsourcing -- Dell continues to manufacture in the United States because over two decades of fine-tuning, they've figured out how to do it cheaper and smarter,'' said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst at Needham & Company who has been following Dell since 1991. (He has also been reaping the financial rewards as a longtime Dell shareholder, seeing a 33-fold return on his investment.) ''They're truly in the 21st century when it comes to manufacturing.'' 
 No other major computer maker produces computers in the United States. Long ago, Dell's top rival, Hewlett-Packard, outsourced assembly of its PC's to third parties, primarily based in Asia, as did I.B.M., the world's third-largest PC maker. And I.B.M., which created the PC market in 1981, is leaving the business, announcing this month that it is selling its PC unit to Lenovo, the Chinese computer giant. ''It's been a long time since one of our competitors actually made a computer,'' said Michael S. Dell, the founder and chairman of the company that bears his name. 
 Dell, by contrast, operates three giant assembly plants in the United States -- two in Austin and the third outside Nashville. Each is large enough to house six contiguous football fields. Last month, the company announced that it would build a fourth plant, twice as big as the others, near Winston-Salem, N.C. And, inside the company, executives talk about opening a fifth one, probably in Nevada, where it would build computers according to each customer's specifications. At a White House conference on the economy on Wednesday, Kevin D. Rollins, Dell's chief executive, boasted, not quite accurately, that all the computers the company sells domestically are made right here in the United States. ''None is outsourced; none is made in other countries and shipped in,'' he said, though Dell laptops are in fact assembled overseas. 
 Dell's decision to expand its American manufacturing presence, however, has nothing to do with patriotism. Executives here say their decisions are based on the bottom line as well as on geography; it is simply more efficient to stamp out computer equipment closer to the customer. ''The reason we continue to manufacture in the United States is that it's the optimal place to do so, and we can do it most cost effectively,'' said John Hamlin, who oversees Dell's entire consumer line.
 Few rivals know that better than Lenovo itself. The questions that many analysts have been asking in the wake of the I.B.M. deal is how well Lenovo, based in Beijing, can compete with Dell outside China, given how cheaply Dell can make its machines.
 Dell has run a factory in Xiamen, China, since 1998 -- but that's to produce computer equipment that the company sells to its Asian customers. Similarly, Dell's factory in Limerick, Ireland, makes machines for Europe. This month, Mr. Dell announced that his company would probably build a second European plant sometime soon. 
 Dell is also bucking global trends on another front. In an era when a call center is more likely to be in India than Indiana, the company has announced that it is building a new customer assistance facility in Oklahoma City. Earlier this year, it opened a call center in Edmonton, Alberta. And while Dell's laptops are produced in Malaysia, they are built by Dell employees working inside a Dell-owned factory.
 ''I tell employees all the time that we're in a race on costs,'' said Dick Hunter, who, as the Dell executive who oversees manufacturing in the United States, is Mr. Myhand's boss. ''When we lose the race on costs to Asia or wherever, that puts our own security in jeopardy.'' 
 EVER since 1984, when Michael Dell began selling personal computers from his University of Texas dorm room, his company has been able to sell cheaper PC's by cutting out the middleman, selling directly via the phone or, nowadays, the Internet. But the reason Dell continues to dominate as a low-cost leader -- whether selling a PC, a server or, more recently, plasma televisions and portable music players -- is its fanatical determination to save every penny it can. Mr. Dell may not quite be the Henry Ford of our time, but his company is certainly the Wal-Mart of the high-technology industry, for better or worse. 
 ''I set irrational goals, Michael and I together, to encourage our team so they don't think of conventional solutions,'' Mr. Rollins said in an interview. ''If we asked for a 10 or 15 percent increase in productivity, we'd get conventional solutions. But if we ask them to double their productivity, then they have to rethink everything.'' 
 This year, their goal was a 30 percent increase in the number of machines that the company's factories spit out -- a target that Mr. Myhand says he is confident they will hit. Among the recent changes was a rerouting of cable so that it no longer had to be laced over and under other parts, and the decision to replace L-shaped tables with a single workbench, to avoid time-consuming twists. A decision was also made to apply one fewer sticker per machine. ''We're going to get there by saving four seconds here, and four seconds there,'' Mr. Myhand said. The labor costs of a PC are ''roughly 10 bucks,'' Mr. Rollins said, meaning that payroll costs account for maybe 2 percent of the overall cost of the typical Dell PC. Five years ago, it took two workers 14 minutes to build a PC; it now takes a single worker roughly five minutes to do the same.
 NOT surprisingly, the Dell factory is a place of reverence for those who take philosophical pleasure in the elimination of wasted movements, or at least the extraneous movements of others. ''Shock and awe'' is the way Mr. Wolf of Needham & Company described the sensation he felt after visiting the flagship Austin plant; Jonathan Eunice, an analyst at Illuminata, a research firm in Nashua, N.H., called Dell ''remarkable.'' Fast Company might have trumped them all when the magazine labeled Dell ''one of the fastest, most hyperefficient organizations on the planet.'' 
 In 2000, when the company's flagship plant opened, no structure in it was more than maybe 10 feet high. Four years later, the plant is now laced with triple-decker conveyor belts that rise as much as 40 feet above the factory floor. Black bins filled with parts are dispatched via these belts and then lowered mechanically to any one of the hundreds of employees who assemble the machines according to each customer's specifications. The completed machines are then transported by conveyor belt to a shipping area, where they are boxed -- largely by robots, which were installed only recently -- and routed to dozens of idling big trucks. Typically, the trucks drive away with full loads 30 minutes after they arrive. 
 A dozen years ago, Dell stored roughly 30 days of inventory -- the outer casings, motherboards, Intel chips and other components needed to feed the beast -- in warehouses around the Austin area. The company, based just north of Austin in Round Rock, Tex., no longer operates any warehouses; instead, it requires suppliers to stock 8 to 10 days' worth of goods no further than 90 minutes from its assembly plants. Its de facto warehouse, therefore, is the lineup of semi-trailers parked in the 48 truck bays that line one wall of its plant. ''If a truck is four minutes late,'' Mr. Myhand said, ''I have an entire line standing and waiting.'' 
 Technically, Dell does not take possession of a part until it is wheeled off a truck and into its factory, and yet that same part will be a component of a complete machine within a couple of hours. A minimum of inventory translates into huge savings on Dell's books, and it also means that when the company switches, say, to standard 40-gigabyte hard drives, it doesn't have to blow through weeks of outmoded 20-gig drives. 
 All of that places a huge burden on Dell's suppliers, each of which Dell rates weekly for performance. ''To many suppliers, Dell is like having Wal-Mart for a client,'' said Mr. Eunice of Illuminata. ''You love the volume, but not the constant grinding pressure on price, terms, conditions and timing.'' 
 Dell executives say they have close working relationships with all their suppliers. The company says it helps them keep pace, if for no other reason than the more efficient a supplier, the better the price it can offer. 
 One executive at a Dell supplier, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity (''Dell is too critical to our business''), said: ''They're constantly reminding you about competitors. It's mostly a strategic card, but it also makes sense. It's the same as what Wal-Mart does. You say you want to sell pillows? So sell them to us for 10 cents apiece because otherwise I have all these people who'll sell them to me for 15 cents.''
 Not everyone, of course, is in awe of Dell. Scott McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, which competes with Dell among corporate customers, dismisses the company as a ''grocery store'' rather than a technology innovator -- an accusation repeated by Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, Carleton S. Fiorina. Mr. Eunice is inclined to render a more mixed verdict, slapping on Dell a phrase -- ''virtuoso vanilla'' -- that is at once a compliment and a dig. 
 Dell, Mr. Eunice said, performs ''brilliantly'' when stamping out commodity products like laptops, desktop computers and printers. But he has been much less impressed when Dell ''ventures into territory that requires new invention or significant investment in research and development.'' 
 As an example, he points to a fast-growing category of computers called ''blade servers,'' lower-cost machines that companies increasingly use to run their data centers and Web sites. ''When Dell's blade servers weren't overheating, they still weren't very good,'' Mr. Eunice said. ''Competitors like I.B.M. and H-P that are more innovation-focused have done significantly better there -- both in terms of product design and in terms of market share.'' 
 FAR more impressive has been Dell's entry into the printer business. It has been selling Dell-brand ink-jet and laser printers for just 19 months, and has only recently broadened its stable to include the range of offerings that corporate customers demand. But through the first nine months of this year, Dell has already captured a 13 percent share of new ink-jet printer sales, a category dominated by Hewlett-Packard, according to IDC, a research firm.
 ''Dell is going to let H-P and others break their toenails first to see exactly how the market works,'' said Roger Kay, an analyst at IDC, ''And then they move in. And once they ramp up the machine, it's 'watch out market,' because profit margins drop, and Dell ends up taking half of it.''
 In October, Dell aggressively jumped into the plasma television market with a 42-inch high-definition version that it sells for roughly $2,000 less than the competition's. ''We like to go after areas where we see high profit pools, and figure out how to save customers money while still remaining profitable,'' said Gerry Parrish Smith, the Dell executive responsible for the company's line of television products.
 Research and development is one way Dell tamps down costs. The company devotes 2 percent of its bottom line to this area, much less than its rivals. Innovation inside Dell is instead more about how one produces, packages and markets a product than it is about improvements in the product itself. ''We have some competitors who are spending 5 or 6 or 8 percent on R&D,'' Mr. Rollins said, ''but our financials suggest our R&D model is the right model.''
 Others, however, wonder if those cost savings come with a long-term cost. According to the Dell supplier quoted anonymously above, when Dell squeezes the profit out of a market it also squeezes out everyone's ability to innovate in any meaningful way.
 There is also the long-term impact of Dell's ability to keep increasing ''units per labor hour,'' a favorite measurement inside the company. People may marvel over Dell's manufacturing prowess, but the company is proving so efficient that it expects to employ only 1,500 people at its new North Carolina plant when it is fully operating.
 And Dell's commitment to keep jobs in the United States has its limits. To produce most of the new products the company has started to sell in recent years, from televisions and music players to electronics organizers and printers, Dell has turned to third-party manufacturers, primarily overseas. ''We seek the most cost-effective place to manufacture so we can pass along the savings to our customers,'' said Mr. Hamlin, the Dell executive, sounding very much like those at other companies who explain their outsourcing and offshoring strategies.
 EVEN so, computer equipment accounts for the bulk of Dell's revenues, and it is still produced by Dell workers inside Dell factories. That is why companies continue to beat a path to Dell's door to study from the wizards of efficiency.
 ''We have hundreds of companies come through here each year to learn from us,'' said Dick Hunter, Dell's manufacturing chief. Last year, he said, the company gave 2,000 tours to 10,000 customers, including a team from General Motors that included G.M.'s president for North America, Gary L. Cowger. 
 ''He brought his whole staff down here around a year ago, people from manufacturing, engineering, production, and they pumped us with questions over the course of a very long day, for 12 or 15 hours, about how we do things,'' Mr. Hunter said. 
 Mark R. Anderson, a longtime friend of Mr. Dell's who is also the publisher of The Strategic News Service, a weekly digest for the computer and communications industries, said he believes that nearly every company could benefit by studying Dell. ''No one does it as well as Dell, but even those companies that try and fail still succeed,'' he said. ''Car companies, TV companies, whoever: they're able to wring out costs by studying under Professor Dell. And they're all that much more efficient by studying with the master.''

HEADLINE: Whoops! It's 1985 All Over Again

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong for this article.

 BODY:
THE White and Gold Room at the Plaza Hotel in New York seems an appropriate spot for big financial decisions. Chandeliers drip crystal from high ceilings. White walls are bedecked in gold trim. It was in this opulent place on Sept. 22, 1985, that officials of the world's leading industrial powers convened to hammer out a plan to save the world from economic turmoil. 
 Almost 20 years later, the Plaza's sumptuous settings could be put to similar use again.
 President Bush starts his second term facing a financial bugbear that shares many of the same qualities of the crisis two decades ago: The United States' budget deficit is bloated. Its trade deficit is hitting records every month. The mushrooming growth of its foreign debt is scaring financial markets. And foreign exchange rates seem out of kilter. 
 In 1985, President Ronald Reagan managed to avert a storm. When he started his second term, a large budget deficit and high interest rates were fueling a relentless climb in the dollar, opening a huge gap in the trade balance. Yet by 1989 the dollar had fallen 50 percent against the Japanese yen and more than 40 percent against the West German mark, without prompting runaway inflation. And the current account deficit -- the broad gap between exports and imports of goods and services -- had finally begun to close. 
 A major component of Mr. Reagan's strategy was built at the Plaza, where finance ministers and heads of central banks of the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France agreed to intervene in currency markets -- furiously buying yen and marks -- to reduce the value of the dollar. The meeting also inaugurated a period of monetary policy coordination and introduced an international dimension to what had been strictly domestic discussions of fiscal policy. 
 While the nation's economic tribulations today are not identical to those faced by Mr. Reagan, some economists suggest that the process of policy coordination formalized at the Plaza provides a map that Mr. Bush may want to follow. ''The second Bush administration should take a page from the second Reagan administration and do a midcourse correction,'' said C.Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute of International Economics in Washington.
 But other than exerting pressure on China to let its currency, the yuan, fluctuate in value against the dollar, the Bush administration appears uninterested in coordinating economic policy with other countries. It has mostly just exhorted them to spend more to help close the United States' trade deficit. And Congress, now controlled by Republicans, has shown no more interest in taking action. 
 The world's finances today are balanced rather precariously between a big spender -- the United States -- and several countries around the world that are big savers. 
 In broad schematic terms, the United States imports and the rest of the world exports; the United States borrows and the rest of the world lends. Financial flows are so lopsided that last year America soaked up nearly three-fourths of the surplus savings in the entire world.
 Not surprisingly, this state of affairs is adding to the country's foreign debt. At the end of last year, the nation's financial deficit -- what the United States owes the rest of the world, minus what the rest of the world owes the United States -- amounted to more than $3 trillion, about 30 percent of the country's annual economic output. And it is growing. In the 12 months through October, foreigners acquired nearly $885 billion of new United States government and corporate debt. 
 THAT wouldn't be a problem if the world were comfortable lending ever-larger sums to the United States to pay for American investment and consumption. But this is unlikely. 
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who hasn't been one to worry idly about deficits, warned in a speech to German bankers last month that foreigners would probably demand higher interest rates and bond yields to hold American debt. 
 ''The question now confronting us,'' he said, ''is how large a current account deficit in the United States can be financed before resistance to acquiring new claims against U.S. residents leads to adjustment.'' 
 That is, when does the debt become so big that foreigners begin to worry about getting their money back with a reasonable return?
 Some foreign investors are already jittery. In the last two years, the dollar has fallen substantially against several currencies, including the Canadian dollar and the euro, and has slipped somewhat less against the yen. Investment from abroad has been falling since March. 
 Some economists are worrying that investor fears over the country's solvency could set off an uncontrolled run on the dollar, or worse. ''I think we are going to have a sharp increase in interest rates and a collapse in bonds,'' said Jeffrey Frankel, a professor of economics at Harvard who was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration. 
 Addressing this conundrum requires multiple changes on a global scale. Mr. Bergsten and other economists said they believed that today, as in 1985, international cooperation could come in handy. 
 First, the dollar must decline further against the Chinese yuan and other Asian currencies. The dollar's steep but narrow fall to date has placed a heavy burden on the exports of a small set of countries, while doing nothing to the exchange rates of China and some other major Asian exporters. And with the yuan's value virtually pegged to the dollar's, other Asian countries, like Japan and South Korea, have been reluctant to let their currencies rise much. 
 American pressure on China to let its currency float has been unsuccessful so far. But a multilateral approach -- one that could guarantee that other Asian currencies rose in tandem so as not to reduce China's export competitiveness in the region -- might work, some economists say.
 ''I could see the Europeans, the Japanese and the Canadians being very enthusiastic about this,'' Robert D. Hormats, a vice chairman at Goldman Sachs International, said of such a multilateral agreement. ''They argue that they are taking the brunt of the dollar's adjustment.'' 
 Many economists say a change in the dollar's value, however, is not enough. If the adjustment is to work, Asians and Europeans need to spend more and save less, reducing their pressure to export and increasing their appetite for imports. Most important, demand in the United States must fall. That means the budget deficit must be trimmed from its current level of 4 percent of the nation's output. Otherwise, interest rates will rise substantially to bring private consumption down.
 ''It is not enough for finance ministers to announce that they are unhappy with the current configuration of exchange rates,'' said Maurice Obstfeld, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.
 But how much can economic diplomacy achieve today? In the 1980's, the Group of 5 leading industrial democracies, which was later expanded into the Group of 7, or G-7, with the addition of Canada and Italy, had a very compelling reason to stick together: the cold war. The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's has made other countries less willing to follow the United States.
 ''G-7 plus China would impress the world that under the pressure of the developed nations, China gave in -- that's not really multilateral,'' said Xu Xiaonian, a Chinese economist who recently became a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. ''It's better than the U.S. versus China, but only marginally better.''
 Even traditional allies don't see eye-to-eye these days. Mr. Bergsten may want the yen to rise against the dollar, but the Japanese may not.
 MOREOVER, some things are just tough to coordinate. To begin with, fiscal policy is freighted with local politics and is virtually impossible to coordinate internationally. Persuading the indebted Japanese government to spend more or the European Central Bank to lower interest rates is not likely to be achieved by a global meeting at a five-star hotel. 
 ''The sizable fiscal deficit of Japan and the convergence criteria of Europe are obstacles to easy fiscal policy,'' said Tomomitsu Oba, a primary architect of the 1985 agreement as Japan's vice minister of finance for international affairs.
 Then there is the issue of getting the United States interested. Mr. Bush, in particular, has not shown a great enthusiasm for multilateral solutions to the world's problems. And his economic wish list -- led by the privatization of Social Security and a reform of the tax code -- leaves little space for policies that would reduce the bloated budget deficit. 
 ''There is a strong argument for a Plaza-like agreement at the moment. But the chances of having it are zero,'' said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The Chinese are going to say, 'If you want cooperation from us, we want to know what your contribution will be,' and I don't think they will accept Social Security reform as a quid pro quo.''
 The Plaza agreement itself provides an interesting insight into the possibilities and limits of international economic collaboration. 
 In the view of the United States' allies through early 1985, Mr. Reagan's economic policy had no place for international cooperation, either. That policy, executed by Donald T. Regan, the Treasury secretary at the time, was driven by an overriding belief in tax cuts. The administration contended there was no reason to worry about the trade deficit, and that a strong dollar was simply a measure of America's economic potency. 
 Advisers who didn't toe the line were dispensed with. In February 1984, for example, the Council of Economic Advisers, then headed by Martin Feldstein, blamed the budget deficit for the current account deficit and noted that the market considered the dollar to be overvalued by more than 30 percent. Mr. Regan dismissed the warning -- ''as far as I'm concerned, you can throw it away,'' he said -- and Mr. Feldstein resigned in July. He is now the president and chief executive of the National Bureau for Economic Research.
 But the politics would change. The rising dollar through the first Reagan term had been hurting some of the administration's most important allies in the business lobby. In early 1985, the National Association of Manufacturers said the $112 billion merchandise trade deficit of 1984 -- then a record, and double the amount of the previous year -- was a ''disaster'' that was crimping growth and ''radically changing the way American firms are doing business'' by ''driving more and more of them abroad.''
 Moreover, Congress, then controlled by the Democrats, started bubbling up with protectionist bills and resolutions. One proposal, by Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas and Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, would have imposed import surcharges on countries with large trade surpluses with the United States. Another, by Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, would have mandated intervention in currency markets to weaken the dollar if the trade deficit hit certain triggers. 
 So as he started his second term, Mr. Reagan changed course. Mr. Regan left the Treasury to become the president's chief of staff, while James A. Baker III, the chief of staff, moved to the Treasury. 
 One of Mr. Baker's first statements was that the Treasury's policy of nonintervention was ''obviously something to be looked at.'' By February 1985, the United States had started intervening in the currency markets to weaken the dollar. 
 AT the Plaza seven months later, Mr. Baker and the Federal Reserve chairman at the time, Paul A. Volcker, agreed with their counterparts from Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to not only collectively spend billions to weaken the dollar, but also to usher in an era of economic policy coordination. 
 In 1986, West Germany, Japan and the United States engaged in coordinated interest rate cuts. While there was no sustained coordination on fiscal policy, the multilateral process provided a forum to talk about its contributions to the global imbalances in the world economy. The United States even persuaded the Japanese government to increase public spending.
 ''The Plaza was very successful, measured economically or politically,'' said someone who participated in the talks, a high-ranking American official at the time who spoke last week only on the condition that he not be identified. ''We didn't get protectionist legislation, and the dollar's decline did not create problems in the United States.'' 
 Some people dispute the notion that the Plaza meeting was a success. For one, the collaboration was messy. The dollar fell further than expected, leading the United States and its partners to quickly seek a new accord, signed at the Louvre palace in Paris in 1987, to try to stabilize the currency. And the wrangling among the allies over monetary policy and exchange-rate coordination helped to prompt the collapse of the United States stock market in October 1987. 
 What's more, the current account deficit kept growing for two years after the Plaza accord. It started shrinking significantly only as the budget deficit narrowed and the economy slowed later in that decade. 
 Some economists argue that intervening in the foreign exchange markets was an unnecessary expense and that the attempt at coordination was pointless because countries followed their own interests anyway. America's budget deficit started shrinking after Congress passed legislation limiting public spending. The Fed cut interest rates to support growth. Japan, West Germany and the other European allies were also following their own interests in cutting rates. The markets just responded to the economic fundamentals, these critics say. 
 Richard H. Clarida, a professor of economics at Columbia University who was chief economist at the Treasury during Mr. Bush's first term, wrote in an e-mail message: ''I view Plaza as a public statement that conveyed to markets that the new Baker Treasury acknowledged that the dollar had to fall (and indeed it had been falling gradually since February 1985) and implicitly that monetary policy would be consistent with that goal, and that budget deficits would be coming down,'' 
 Yet for all the skepticism, Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs said he still saw a benefit from the efforts at multilateral coordination. He was at the Plaza on Sept. 22, 1985, waiting to hear news of the negotiations. ''The Plaza was the one thing that created the notion that we were willing at least to work with other countries on the exchange rate,'' he said. ''It changed a neglectful approach to one of international cooperation.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about current parallels to the economy of 1985 misstated the year in which the Group of Seven industrial nations -- or G-7 -- was formed. The first annual summit meeting of the full G-7 was held in 1976, not in the 1980's. From 1986, the finance ministers of the G-7 nations began meeting separately and more often to discuss economic performance and coordination.

HEADLINE: The Dollar? China Gets A Big Vote

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
IF there were a contest for the person most likely to influence the path of the dollar in 2005, it would be easy for many investors and travelers to overlook a compelling nominee. 
 Two of the most obvious choices are President Bush and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 Mr. Bush's sway over the dollar is considerable. He could, for example, direct the Treasury to fight a dollar decline by intervening in the foreign exchange market. 
 But while Mr. Bush said last week that he favored a strong dollar, he also said that markets should make the final decision on currency values, re-enforcing the view among traders that the administration won't move to help the dollar unless its decline disrupts other financial markets.
 Mr. Greenspan and his Fed colleagues are expected to raise interest rates further next year, a step that could help the dollar by making it more attractive to invest in bonds in the United States. 
 Central bankers and finance ministers abroad are important as well. Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, influences decisions on both interest rates and currency interventions. And Hiroshi Watanabe, vice minister for international affairs at the Finance Ministry of Japan, guides his country's foreign exchange policy. 
 But in the end, the most important figure may well be Hu Jintao, the Chinese president and Communist Party chief.
 The focus should be on Mr. Hu because China has pegged its currency, the yuan, to the dollar. When this peg is either relaxed or tossed out, the dollar is likely to plunge sharply against it.
 Some economists argue that if the Chinese do not allow the yuan to trade more freely, the dollar will not fall enough to reduce the nation's record current-account deficit.
 That deficit, the broad gap between the nation's exports and imports of goods and services, is expected to top $600 billion this year. A weaker dollar could reduce it by making foreign imports more expensive for Americans while American exports are priced more competitively abroad.
 China's possibly pivotal role in next year's dollar story is a reminder of its burgeoning economic importance, said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig. 
 ''The adjustment to the dollar that all the economic models say we need to reduce the current-account problem is in the hands of China,'' he said. ''It is not a U.S. call, and that is a profound change.''

HOLIDAY DATA -- The stock and bond markets are closed on Friday, Christmas Eve, and the bond market closes early on Thursday. Among the data coming out for November will be the leading indicators, expected to be up 0.1 percent; orders for durable goods, which are forecast to climb 0.6 percent; and new home sales, predicted to fall 0.5 percent, according to Bloomberg News.
 Also due is the second revision of the gross domestic product data for the third quarter. It is expected to show a climb of 3.9 percent at an annual rate, the same pace reported in the first revision. The G.D.P. inflation measure is also expected to remain at 1.3 percent, unchanged from the previous report.

HEADLINE: Free Trade That Isn't

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Thomas Frank's review of four new books (Nov. 28) concludes with a hymn of praise for ''Myths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed,'' by Representative Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio's 13th Congressional +District. The myth, Frank and+Brown say,+is that free trade is a good idea. The ''real battle'' in America, we are told, is not red state versus blue state, but ''between all of us and the corporate power that today bombards labor and environment from the ideological heights of free trade.'' 
 Since when did the power of the modern corporation have anything to do with free trade? I should have thought the myth would be that we had ever given free trade a try. Consider the World Trade Organization's recently imposed sanctions on the United States. The+object of W.T.O. ire was the ''Byrd amendment,'' which gives the government the right to fine any foreign company it deems to have sold goods here below cost. The Byrd amendment is just one of an unheavenly host of regulations, restrictions and special privileges corporate America has purchased from Congress and the White House. The special favors on sale from our federal government are deviations from free trade, not examples of it. 
 Frank gets one thing right: the real divide is not between red states and blue states. It is between those who enjoy special benefits from the federal government and those who must pay for those special benefits. In this time of Republican hegemony, we need political leaders who will speak against the rising tide of state power that sells out to the highest corporate bidders and brings fire and sword halfway round the world under the false banner of pretended liberty. The best the Democrats can offer, however, is John Kerry's Republican Lite and Sherrod Brown's anti-trade demagogy.

HEADLINE: Economics Catch Up With the Athletics

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
THOSE of us who do not subscribe to the ''Moneyball'' approach to baseball, the theories laid out in the book that celebrates Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics, have been quick to point to the real strength of the Athletics in recent years, the pitching triumvirate of Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito.
 And then there was one.
 Beane, a talented general manager whatever his philosophy, traded Hudson to the Atlanta Braves last Thursday and 48 hours later traded Mulder to the St. Louis Cardinals. In making those deals, Beane contributed to the likelihood of those teams repeating as division champions. 
 The Athletics cannot repeat as division champions next season because they didn't win a division championship last season. In fact, they failed to make the playoffs for the first time since the 1999 season. 
 The Yankees make the playoffs perennially but have not won the World Series since 2000. In the Yankees' world, that kind of failure calls for drastic action, and that's why Randy Johnson is expected to become a member of the Yankees' rotation this week.
 The Yankees add Johnson; the Athletics subtract Hudson and Mulder. That's the difference between having an unlimited payroll and a severely restricted payroll. Nobody said baseball economics were fair.
 Beane did not trade Hudson and Mulder because he discovered a flaw in the team's makeup. He did not trade Mulder because he staggered to an 0-4 record and a 7.27 earned run average in his last seven starts, dooming the Athletics to their final resting place -- one game behind the first-place Anaheim Angels.
 Why did Beane shred his vaunted starting rotation? 
 ''We needed to,'' he said in a telephone interview yesterday. 
 ''We're constantly playing a shell game here,'' he added. ''The status quo was not within our means. We need to be in a situation where our team is getting progressively better, and the status quo could have put us in a position where we'd be worse.''
 The status quo would have meant holding on to Hudson and Mulder along with Zito. In the past five seasons, the four playoff years and the near miss this year, those three pitchers combined for a 234-119 record, a sparkling .662 winning percentage. 
 If a team played at that percentage over the course of a season for several seasons, it would produce 107 victories a year and more than a few division championships.
 Now look at some other numbers. The Athletics had a payroll of about $58 million this year. They could not keep all of their star players and maintain that payroll. Hudson's salary was $5 million this year and goes to $6.75 million next year. Mulder was at $4.45 million this year and will go to $6.5 million next year. Together, they will escalate from less than $10 million to more than $13 million.
 The Yankees could sell a few more hot dogs and keep both pitchers. The Athletics don't have that luxury.
 ''We couldn't afford the status quo,'' said Beane, who likes his Yankees counterpart, Brian Cashman, and doesn't begrudge him a dollar. ''We were getting into the position where even with the loss of Jermaine Dye, it wasn't within our means. We were beyond our means to keep the status quo.''
 The Yankees let players leave as free agents, as Oakland did with Dye, and pretended they had to make those moves because of some imaginary budget. They are reminiscent of the story that when Edward Bennett Williams owned the Washington Redskins, he gave George Allen an unlimited budget, then said that Allen had exceeded it.
 Beane can be accused of being a bean counter, but he has to keep a calculator handy to make sure his payroll doesn't start with a 6. If Cashman used a calculator, it would have to be one of those fancy nine-figure models. Once Johnson is added to the payroll, the Yankees will have a payroll approaching $210 million, more than 15 percent higher than this year's record payroll.
 And that $210 million doesn't cover a complete roster. One name noticeably missing from it is Carlos Beltran, the free-agent outfielder the Yankees covet. If Beltran's agent gets what he wants, $20 million a year, make the Yankees payroll $230 million, nearly 30 percent higher than this year's.
 If the Yankees' rotation is Johnson, Mike Mussina, Kevin Brown, Carl Pavano and Jaret Wright, the combined 2005 salaries of the starters will be $67 million. That total is more than the 2004 payrolls of 18 of the other 29 teams.
 The anticipated Oakland rotation would fall a little short of that total. It doesn't figure to earn much above $6.7 million, let alone $67 million. And Zito's $5.6 million will account for most of it. The other four projected starters -- Rich Harden, Danny Haren, Dan Meyer and Joe Blanton -- have a combined major league service of two and a half years, with all but Harden less than a year each.
 ''It's a risky thing, but we've taken risks before,'' Beane said.
 Could any three younger members of the starting corps evolve into Hudson, Mulder and Zito?
 ''The three guys we had together were pretty historical,'' Beane said. ''If they became half of those guys, they'd be pretty good pitchers. But it's not fair to make that comparison. We had a pretty historical group. Nevertheless, we feel they can be very good big league pitchers.''

HEADLINE: Community Reels Over Plan To Close Its Only Hospital

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER, N.Y., Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Within four months, plans call for the last patient at New York United Hospital Medical Center to leave and its 224 beds to be stripped for the last time.
 The hospital's 625 staff members will move on, the equipment will be sold, and a 115-year-old institution will be closed, to live only in a community's collective memory of births, illnesses, recoveries and deaths. 
 The hospital's employees have been grappling with this prospect since Friday, when the administration announced that it had sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and would be closing down in three to four months.
 A spokeswoman for the medical center, Port Chester's only hospital, said Sunday that United would stop admitting patients on Christmas Eve, except for emergencies, and would begin to phase out programs, reduce case loads and staff and transfer patients to other medical centers. The plan to close the hospital still needs state approval. 
 United is the latest casualty of the harsh economic times in the hospital industry, both in the New York region and across the country. Earlier this year, St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Centers announced it was shutting down St. Joseph's Hospital in Flushing, Queens, and was going ahead with the closing of Bayley Seton Hospital on Staten Island. Last year, St. Agnes Hospital, a 184-bed hospital in White Plains founded in 1908, shut its doors under crushing debt.
 A spokeswoman for New York United Hospital, Cathy Callegari, said that like many community hospitals across the country, United could not surmount its debt.
 ''They've been operating in the red for over a decade,'' she said in a telephone interview Sunday. ''They've been trying to reduce it, reduce it, reduce it, but it gets to a point where you can't expect to keep doing business on this basis.'' She said she did not know how big the debt was, but staff members said they had been told it hovered around $70 million.
 The hospital's announcement has shaken this village, which has a population of about 28,000. 
 ''This is devastating,'' Gerald L. Logan, the village's mayor, said in a telephone interview. ''It's a community hospital in every sense of the word. People depend on that hospital. I've been a patient in that hospital a few times.''
 It was founded in 1889 and opened in two rented rooms above a dry-goods store on the corner of North Main Street and Willett Avenue here. It grew to serve southeastern Westchester County, including Port Chester, Rye, Mamaroneck, Rye Brook, Purchase, Harrison and Larchmont. It acquired its present name in 1999.
 Not only has the hospital, which is on Boston Post Road, figured prominently in the lives of patients and their families, but it has also been one of the village's largest employers. Many of those employees and their relatives have been patients there themselves. 
 Debra Blackburn, 47, a medical secretary at United, was born at the hospital. She got her first job there, at 16, and has worked there ever since. ''Everybody: My four grandchildren were born there, all my three children, all my nieces and nephews,'' she said.
 Ms. Blackburn spoke while standing in the foyer of a 12-story, 144-unit employee residence next to the hospital, a building where the residents were confronting not only the loss of jobs, but the loss of homes as well. Plans were being postponed, vacations were canceled, and some employees wondered if they could help their children or other family members pursue their education. 
 ''I've been crying for two days,'' Ms. Blackburn said. ''It's not a big hospital. We're so close, we all know each other.''
 In September, the hospital's board of directors hired Kurron Shares of America Inc., a Long Island management and strategic advisory firm that specializes in stabilizing health-care organizations, to help lead the hospital. Phillip G. Dionne, a Kurron executive, was named chief executive and president of the hospital. He followed Roberto Rodriguez, who had been hired by the board in 2002 to try to turn United around.
 Kurron and Mr. Dionne were unable to make a big enough change in the hospital's debt, Ms. Callegari said. At the same time, the number of new patients was declining and United could not keep up its aging physical plant, she said.
 Staff members were told of the board's decision to close during meetings with Mr. Dionne on Friday. Rumors had circulated among the workers last week that the hospital might be heading for Chapter 11, but several employees said they thought the new administration had been taking the necessary steps to address the financial problems.
 ''They dropped a bomb on us,'' said Raul Pimentel, 31, the hospital's acting lead technician in the emergency room, who lives with his wife and 21-month-old son in the employee residence. ''No warning, no nothing.'' Mr. Pimentel and other employees said they had not been told how long they could stay in the residence.
 People in Port Chester and surrounding towns will now have to travel to Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut, White Plains Hospital Center or the Sound Shore Medical Center of Westchester in New Rochelle.
 ''The board agonized over this,'' Ms. Callegari said. ''No one wants to close anything just before Christmas.'' But, she said, the board decided that a months-long, if sudden, phaseout was preferable to risking being shut down by the state.

HEADLINE: Home, or Elsewhere, for the Holidays

BYLINE: By MARK GLASSMAN

 BODY:
This November, what one in every five Americans may have wanted for the holidays was a ticket to somewhere else.
 Roughly 68 million people visited travel Web sites last month, up 13 percent from 60 million in November 2003, according to a report released last week by Nielsen/NetRatings. 
 The heightened traffic translated to increased sales, with online consumers spending $919 million on travel in November, up 11 percent from $828 million a year earlier, according to a separate report by Goldman Sachs, Harris Interactive and Nielsen/NetRatings.
 The annual spike in travel spending comes predominantly from passengers making holiday trips, said Heather Dougherty, an analyst at Nielsen/NetRatings. The timing of Christmas and New Year's Eve may have persuaded more people to travel this year, she said. Both holidays fall on weekends.
 The top five travel Web sites recorded substantial jumps in traffic over the year. Mapquest, the most popular travel site, had 31.2 million visitors last month, a 28.4 percent increase from 24.3 million visitors a year ago. Ms. Dougherty said Mapquest held an advantage over other travel sites because many people use the site to map directions even in their hometowns.
 The other top sites included the top three online travel agencies -- Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz -- and the Southwest Airlines Web site.The Southwest site attracts more customers than other airline sites in part because the company does not sell tickets through most major online travel agencies, Ms. Dougherty said.

HEADLINE: Report Sees Rail Expansion As Crucial for Manhattan

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Job growth in the New York metropolitan region will stagnate without a major expansion of commuter rail and subway access to Midtown and Lower Manhattan over the next 20 years, according to a report to be released by New York University today.
 The study calls for construction on a magnitude not seen in nearly a half-century. The rail and traffic configuration that links Manhattan with other boroughs and the suburbs has not changed substantially since the third tube of the Lincoln Tunnel opened in 1957. 
 ''Expanded transportation capacity is of vital importance to enable future economic and employment growth in the Manhattan central business district,'' according to the report, prepared by the university's Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management. 
 The report argues that four rail projects could relieve the crowding that has already begun to discourage riders from using subways and commuter railroads. 
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has announced its support for two of the projects: the development of a Second Avenue subway and a Long Island Rail Road connection to Grand Central Terminal. The authority's plans for expansion, however, have been greeted by silence in Albany. 
 The report recommends that new rail tunnels be dug under the Hudson River to Pennsylvania Station and under the East River to Lower Manhattan. The total cost of the four projects could be as high as $32.6 billion, the report states.
 ''We've gone through 40 years where we've really forgotten about the significance of building new capacity,'' said Rosemary Scanlon, an author of the report. (The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and Staten Island, was completed in 1964.) ''All of the major cities in the world seem able to grab hold of what they need to expand and grow. We seem to be myopic about it.''
 Ms. Scanlon, a former state deputy comptroller for New York City and a former chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said there had been not been major investment in the region's transportation infrastructure since Gov. Hugh L. Carey initiated financing for a general revitalization of the subway system. Since 1982, Mr. Carey's last year in office, the authority has spent $40 billion on restoration and maintenance of its transit network. 
 The other author of the report, Edward S. Seeley Jr., said that New York has been unique among American cities in the resilience of its downtown core. 
 ''We've had suburbanization in the region, as in all regions, but during the same time, the relative strength of Manhattan as an employment center and as a generator of personal income has grown,'' said Mr. Seeley, who retired in 1997 after a career at the Port Authority and the city government. ''It's become more dominant. This is not a centrifugal region like Los Angeles.'' 
 Employment in the central business district, defined as all of Manhattan below 60th Street, is expected to increase an average of 0.8 percent a year, according to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, a government-sponsored planning forum that includes city and state agencies, along with officials from five suburban counties.
 Assuming growth of only 0.6 percent a year, Ms. Scanlon and Mr. Seeley found, the business district would have 2.3 million jobs in 2025, 285,000 more than it did last year. Those workers would make 560,000 rush-hour work trips a day, an increase of 69,000 from last year.
 The increase would amount to 51 additional subway trains -- each with a full 1,400-passenger load -- entering Manhattan each day.
 Because the report calls for increased rail access, and not vehicular traffic, its recommendations are unlikely to be controversial among neighborhood advocates and environmentalists concerned about preservation of public space. But its call for major public investment -- at a time when the state faces rising education, health care and pension costs -- may be unrealistic. 
 ''We have to ask ourselves what's the price if we don't do these projects,'' said Elliot G. Sander, the director of the Rudin Center and a former city transportation commissioner. ''New York risks the possibility of having a real ceiling on the economic growth of the financial capital of the country.''

HEADLINE: For Some Parents, It's Never Too Early for S.A.T. Prep

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Every so often, a toy that reflects a national obsession makes its way into the marketplace. Seventy years ago, toymakers rushed out with the Dionne quintuplets in doll form. In the early 1960's, with the nation at war, there was G.I. Joe. 
 This year's example is the Time Tracker, a device whose purpose is to help children improve their performances on the standardized tests that have become unavoidable in education. Recommended ages: 4 and up. 
 Shaped like a colorful peppermill, with a digital readout panel, lights that suggest a traffic intersection and an electronic male voice that booms ''Begin'' and ''Time's up,'' the Time Tracker, which sells for a list price of $34.95, has turned into a surprise hit of the holiday season, according to some toy sellers. By using the tracker during playtime, homework or any other activity, children are supposed to develop a sense of passing time -- 20 minutes, half an hour, an hour -- that translates into better management during tests. Siren sounds indicate when a certain period has gone by, and the lights switch from green to yellow to red to demonstrate how close the child is to the end of the allotted time. 
 The Time Tracker became available in February and is being sold at scores of retailers and several nationally distributed toy catalogs, including Young Explorers, Leaps and Bounds, and Imagine the Challenge. The manufacturer, Learning Resources, would not divulge precise sales figures, but a spokeswoman, Lana J. Simon, said that thousands had been sold, adding that sales had been ''30 percent over what we forecasted for the year'' and that the company had ''had to reorder the product multiple times to meet the demand.'' The Time Tracker has become the top-selling toy for the company, which is based in Vernon Hills, Ill., she said. 
 ''It's obviously not the type of thing kids would want for themselves,'' said Andrea Galinski, product development manager at Chelsea & Scott, a Lake Bluff, Ill., company that owns Leaps and Bounds. But, she added, ''We've had a very positive response from parents.'' 
 Standardized tests, which were once largely confined to college entrance exams like the S.A.T., have become integral parts of primary education and sources of stress for parents of younger children, who often worry that low scores will penalize their offspring early in life. Federal laws and state-mandated testing at various grade levels have increased the importance of such tests. The National Center for Fair and Open Testing estimates that testing has more than doubled since the federal No Child Left Behind law was enacted nearly three years ago, according to Robert A. Schaeffer, public education director for the center. 
 ''I've come across a tremendous proliferation of everything else to help people do better on tests, but never these things,'' said Martin Carnoy, a professor of education and economics at Stanford University, referring to the Time Tracker. Such toys, he says, are likely to be bought by parents who want to give their children an edge in the testing that begins in some school systems in the third grade or even earlier. 
 ''Lower-middle-class parents are concerned about their school quality and their children's grades,'' Professor Carnoy said. ''The upper middle class is less concerned about the quality of the school than about the performance of their own kids on these make-or-break tests.'' 
 Standardized tests have prevailed despite critics who say teachers are being required to abandon more interesting lesson plans in favor of teaching to the test requirements. Others argue that testing offers only a limited measure of performance and potential. 
 But Eric A. Hanushek, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said he saw the emergence of the Time Tracker as a positive development. ''Parents in general are taking achievement and tests more seriously than they did in the past,'' he said, ''and toy manufacturers are trying to fill that niche.'' 
 But Joseph J. Pedulla, the director of the Center for the Study of Testing, Education and Educational Policy at the Peter and Carolyn Lynch School of Education, at Boston College, wondered: ''Whatever happened to the egg timer? If they can sell it, more power to them.'' 
 Of course, the Time Tracker could have applications other than testing. Clarisse Cowdery, senior buyer for the Young Explorers catalog, which is based in Chelmsford, Mass., said that while the catalog emphasizes the toy's helpfulness on tests (''Perfect for homework assignments and test practice,'' the copy says), it can be used in other ways as well -- for piano practice, say, or for setting limits on TV watching. ''You could even use it as a timeout clock,'' she said. 
 Still, test-taking seems to be the reason it sells. Ms. Cowdery, who described herself as a former elementary school teacher, said, ''People who have kids now find that there are standardized tests in third grade and sixth grade and all along.'' She went on: ''Not every kid does it well. The more you get them accustomed to it, the better off they will be.'' 
 There are those who see the Time Tracker as an ominous testament to priorities gone awry. Mr. Schaeffer of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing said he had not come across the toy himself, but that its appearance highlighted the way ''test-taking has permeated youth culture because of the prominence of high-stakes testing throughout education.'' Toys and other aids for test-taking have turned into ''almost an arms-race culture,'' he added, with parents reaching for every possible tool to be sure their children get the highest scores they can. 
 Professor Carnoy said the economics of supply and demand when it comes to college admissions and employment fueled the passion for testing and for gadgets that may give children extra help. ''This is obviously playing to a tremendous anxiety,'' he said. ''And it's happening because the payoff of going to university has risen very rapidly since the early 1980's.'' 
 Test scores have become ''a cheap way of making a decision,'' he said, when it comes to the early winnowing of candidates for college admission. 
 It is no wonder that toys have emerged that promise, however tacitly, to help.
 ''It's the modern-day equivalent of hanging a mobile above a baby's crib or playing Beethoven for the baby -- those were supposed to stimulate creative thinking,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. ''Now the emphasis is on test-taking.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Drops Tax Lawsuit Against San Diego Firm

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The Justice Department has withdrawn its lawsuit against a San Diego financial services firm that it said sold questionable tax shelters to thousands of doctors and dentists.
 The firm, Xelan, is still the subject of a criminal federal grand jury investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service is continuing to seek reimbursement of hundreds of millions of dollars that it says is owed by users of Xelan investment and insurance plans.
 But last Friday, without making a public announcement, the Justice Department withdrew a civil complaint against Xelan from federal court in the Southern District of California. The complaint had sought to shut down Xelan operations that it had called questionable and had demanded the payment of taxes and penalties. 
 The withdrawal comes after an earlier defeat of the Justice Department's tax division in its case against Xelan. On Dec. 3, a California federal judge declined the division's request to extend another judge's restraining order that had temporarily frozen $500 million in assets owned by 4,000 doctors and dentists who participated in Xelan-sponsored insurance and investment programs.
 In the Dec. 3 ruling, the judge said that the government had not yet proved its case that eight Xelan affiliates, part of the network of Xelan companies, were actually selling abusive tax shelters that were not valid for legitimate tax deductions.
 The Xelan case was one of the Justice Department's highest-profile efforts to combat what it considers abusive tax shelters. The temporary restraining order freezing the assets was one of the largest actions of its kind, and its later undoing surprised Justice Department attorneys.
 Xelan is a privately owned group of about a dozen companies that sell financial planning, investment and insurance through a nationwide network of offices. Four units of the company filed for bankruptcy protection in July as the government's investigation intensified.
 A Justice Department statement issued over the weekend said the agency's tax division had decided to press its case against Xelan through other channels, including through I.R.S. efforts to collect unpaid taxes and penalties against the firm in bankruptcy court. 
 On Friday, the I.R.S. filed a proof of claim against Xelan Inc., the marketing arm of the company, in federal bankruptcy court in San Diego for more than $474 million in back taxes and penalties. A separate I.R.S. claim in the same bankruptcy court, filed on Thursday against one of Xelan's insurance arms, Pyramidal Funding, seeks $33 million in back taxes and penalties.
 Xelan, whose full name is Xelan, the Economic Association of Health Professionals, had in recent years set up several types of plans aimed at helping doctors and dentists lower their tax bills. The government had turned its attention to two of them, one involving a charity administered by Xelan and the other a plan for disability insurance that the company said would allow investors to defer taxes on income for seven years.
 The government had attempted to argue that both of those plans were nothing more than illegal tax dodges by the medical professionals who bought them. Xelan has maintained that its investment and insurance programs are legitimate.

HEADLINE: Big mergers in the mobile phone industry worry consumer groups, but industry specialists see no cause for concern.

BYLINE: By Matt Richtel and Ken Belson

 BODY:
THE rapid consolidation in the mobile phone industry, as illustrated by last week's proposed merger of Nextel and Sprint and Cingular's recent acquisition of AT&T Wireless, raises a compelling question: With fewer carriers, has power in the industry shifted away from consumers? 
 Conventional wisdom suggests that with fewer competitors, companies are under less pressure to cut prices and improve services, and that prices ultimately may rise. That's the line taken by many consumer advocacy groups.
 But industry analysts and executives say the dynamic in the wireless industry is far subtler, and that price is only one way to gauge competition. They argue there is still plenty of competition between the remaining providers and a number of regional companies to ensure that consumers not only have ample choices, but also receive better service and prices. 
 Even with the mergers, most markets are still served by three and often more providers, which gives customers a chance to shop around. (If mergers leave the industry with just two bigger players, prices would probably rise, analysts said.) The rampant price war that typified the industry's early days is bound to ease, but partly, analysts argued, because there is not much room left to cut.
 According to J.D. Power & Associates, cellphone calls have fallen to 11 cents a minute, from 56 cents in 1996. Most analysts, including Raul Katz, president of the telecommunications consultant Adventis, do not expect prices to continue falling that steeply. Instead, they expect the variety of services and the quality of handsets and networks to improve.
 With mobile phones now in the hands of 80 percent of American adults, the carriers have to reach ever-narrower segments of the population. To do that, they are expected to expand the number of service plans they offer, not reduce them.
 ''As the industry matures, in order to grow, companies have to broaden their appeal,'' said Kirk Parsons, an analyst at J.D. Power.
 Mr. Parsons and others also said that network service was improving because the bigger wireless companies have more spectrum to expand and improve their coverage. They also have more money to introduce services like high-speed data links.
 This focus on wooing consumers with services instead of prices is not new, according to Bob Atkinson, the director for policy research at the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information, and a former director at the Federal Communications Commission. In the 1960's and 1970's, he said, there were three big international telex providers: ITT, RCA and Western Union International. After a price war abated, the companies started giving away more and more expensive devices.
 They realized that if they cut prices, everyone would match them, he said. The strategy made little sense, because business users cared less about price and more about features, he said.
 Wireless carriers are able to provide more functions and features to consumers because their increasing heft has given them more leverage over handset makers. They can drive companies like Nokia and Samsung to produce more models and cram more features into them. To lure customers, carriers have also subsidized the sale of phones and, in some cases, even given away handsets.
 There are ancillary benefits, too. Though carriers are not necessarily cutting the price of their service plans, they are offering consumers more minutes and, in Cingular's case, allowing subscribers to roll over unused time from month to month. With the extra time, wireless subscribers are finding it easier to use their cellphone for long-distance calls that they previously would have made on their home phones.
 By using their handsets more, consumers may be lowering their home phone bill.
 It is certain that consolidation has come to an industry of increasing significance to consumers. The industry recently hit a historic benchmark -- consumers now are spending more money on wireless services than on any other category of telecommunications, including their home phones.
 According to new figures from the F.C.C., Americans spent about $24 billion in the second quarter of 2004 on wireless communications; they spent some $20 billion on landline service.
 As the wireless industry has grown, though, so has the concentration of power. This worries Jim Lande, a telecommunications industry economist for the F.C.C., who notes that the two largest wireless providers, Cingular Wireless and Verizon Wireless, are owned by companies that also control most of the country's landlines. Cingular is owned by BellSouth and SBC Communications, while Verizon Communications owns 55 percent of Verizon Wireless (the rest is held by Vodafone of Britain).
 With fewer rivals, these powerful companies could have less incentive to compete, Mr. Lande said. ''We're not going to see the same level of competition,'' he said.
 That worries mobile phone customers like Nigel Pitters, who works in the legal department of a financial firm in downtown San Francisco. Mr. Pitters was a customer of AT&T Wireless until it was acquired, and now pays his monthly bill to Cingular. 
 Mr. Pitters said the transition had not been smooth; there are places in San Francisco and the surrounding cities where his calls have been getting dropped since the merger. He does not plan to switch carriers, but he said his larger concern was that there will be fewer choices if he decides to switch.
 The power, he said, is not in the hands of the customer anymore.
 Mr. Parsons of J.D. Power notes that there are always hiccups after mergers and that, in the long run, carriers are still under enough pressure that they are quick to iron out the worst kinks.

HEADLINE: An All-but-Unknown Company Wins a Rich Russian Oil Stake

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND and STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Russia dismantled its largest oil producer, Yukos, on Sunday by auctioning off the company's largest subsidiary to a little-known concern that registered as a last-minute bidder on Friday. 
 Gazprom, the country's natural gas monopoly and the Kremlin-favored front-runner to buy the Yukos property, did not even make a bid.
 The mystery surrounding the winner -- a company called the Baikal Finans Group that is registered in Tver, a medium-size city 170 miles northwest of Moscow -- immediately raised suspicion among industry analysts. 
 An analyst, Christopher Weafer, the equity strategist at Alfa Bank, remarked after the auction results that ''the surprise winning bidder in today's auction, Baikal Finans Group, is either a front for Gazprom or a state-friendly company,'' or, he added, ''a combination of state and state-friendly interests.'' 
 But officials of Gazprom insisted that their company had no connection to the successful bidder. 
 What unfolded on Sunday appeared to be a direct result of a surprise ruling in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Houston last week. A bankruptcy judge issued an injunction on Thursday against all bidders and lenders in the auction. That caused Deutsche Bank and others in a lending syndicate to withdraw from financing Gazprom's bid to buy the oil fields and production sites of the Yukos unit, Yuganskneftegas. The huge subsidiary pumps as much oil a day as all of Indonesia.
 On Friday, Russian officials denounced the American court's ruling and said that it had no legal bearing. But it clearly had an effect. Gazprom appealed the ruling on Saturday, but the appeal was denied. Gazprom's bidding vehicle, Gazpromneft, which was named in the Houston court ruling, stayed on the sidelines on Sunday. 
 The Yukos unit was being sold to help cover more than $27 billion in tax claims that the Russian government has lodged against Yukos, formerly the country's No. 1 private oil producer, over the last year. The action is part of a broader campaign against the company and its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.
 The auction on Sunday seemed reminiscent of Russian privatization deals in the early 1990's -- with murky financing, questionable bidders and unknown companies representing powerful financial groups emerging to win lucrative assets. Many of Russia's current generation of new oligarchs became billionaires in those deals overnight.
 ''This bid by Baikal Finans Group was a smoke screen and a delay tactic,'' said James Fenkner, head of research at the brokerage firm Troika Dialog -- possibly, he said, to allow Gazprom more time to raise funds. ''Why can't there be a transparent auction run by the state? The whole thing just makes Russia look bad.''
 The Baikal Finans Group, which listed its address as the same as that of a cellphone store in Tver, won a controlling stake, or 76.79 percent of the shares, in Yuganskneftegas with a bid equivalent to about $9.35 billion. That was above the starting price of $8.65 billion, but still far below what is considered he fair market value of the unit, according to independent banks hired separately by Yukos and the Russian government.
 It is possible that another Russian oil company with lots of cash, like Surgutneftegas, was the real bidder, but analysts said it was more likely that all this was a way to give Gazprom time to come up with new financing. 
 The Russian government's prosecutorial assault on Yukos and its founder, which began in summer 2003, has set foreign investors on edge and raised questions about the rule of law, property rights and President Vladimir V. Putin's commitment to economic change. And Sunday's blow to Yukos, which had already sought bankruptcy protection in Houston last week, seemed part of that pattern.
 The bidding process for Yuganskneftegas was a bizarre, confused affair: reporters were invited to watch the afternoon auction at the Russian Federal Property Fund's offices, but only on big-screen television sets. The property fund did not provide any information about the bidders.
 Officials of Gazpromneft and the Baikal Finans Group sat side by side at separate tables in a plain, brown and beige room. Baikal made an opening bid, and then a Gazpromneft official left the room briefly to take a phone call. He returned a few minutes later, but Gazpromneft never submitted a bid. 
 The Baikal Finans Group's representative again raised his paddle, winning with a bid of 260.753 billion rubles, or almost $9.35 billion. From time to time, he conferred with a colleague sitting next to him. After just 10 minutes of bidding, the Russian Federal Property Fund, which organized the sale, announced Baikal Finans Group as the winner. 
 ''The shares have been sold,'' said Valery Suvorov, a deep-voiced auctioneer dressed in bowtie and tails and wielding a gavel.
 Officials from the Baikal group, a man and a woman, who were seen on screen, did not appear at a news conference after their victory -- leaving the circumstances and motives of their bid a mystery. Yuri Petrov, acting chairman of the property fund, said he did not know anything about whose interests the Baikal Finans Group represented.
 ''It came as a surprise to us,'' he said later on Sunday.
 Ronald P. Smith, oil analyst at Renaissance Capital here, agreed that Baikal could be a stalking horse for Gazprom. As for the true identity of the winner, he added, ''Nobody knows.'' In prerevolutionary times, the address given for the Baikal Finans Group was that of a hotel. 
 If Baikal should fail to make full payment for the Yuganskneftegas assets in the 14-day period required, under Russian law the government can order a new auction or seize Yuganskneftegas in lieu of unpaid taxes.
 Russia's other major oil companies -- including, besides Surgutneftegas, TNK-BP and Lukoil -- all denied any ties to the Baikal group, according to the Interfax news agency. 
 Yukos, meanwhile, still faces a mountain of back taxes. The auction proceeds pay only one-third of the staggering $27.5 billion tax bill for 2000 through 2003. The company founder, Mr. Khodorkovsky, was arrested in October 2003 and has been held in jail ever since on charges of personal tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement in a separate privatization deal. There has been wide speculation that Mr. Khodorkovsky's real transgression was raising political opposition to Mr. Putin's government. 
 In the auction, the government effectively took back what it had turned over to Mr. Khodorkovsky on the cheap in the early 90's, and this is likely to be welcomed by average Russians. A large part of the Yukos industrial empire was amassed at far under market value in the loans-for-shares program -- a post-Soviet device through which a nearly bankrupt Kremlin sold off its most valuable companies to well-connected business executives, sowing deep resentment among the public.
 Yukos issued a statement after the auction Sunday saying that ''management will pursue every legal and commercial remedy available.'' 
 ''The so-called winners of this process,'' it added, ''along with any entity that supports them has subjected their businesses to considerable legal risks.'' 
 Lawyers for Group Menatep, the investment vehicle through which Mr. Khodorkovsky and his associates controlled Yukos, pledged to keep fighting against the sell-off of Yuganskneftegas, possibly by going after the winner's assets overseas. 
 Menatep may try to seize Russian oil and gas exports in foreign courts, perhaps those in the United States and Europe. ''We're not limiting ourselves'' to American courts, said Sanford M. Saunders Jr., a lawyer with the firm of Greenberg Traurig, representing Menatep.
 Yukos's other remaining assets include Samaraneftegas and Tomskneft, two smaller producers that nonetheless pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day. They, too, are likely to be sold or confiscated, analysts said.
 But it is expected that Gazprom will end up the owner of Yuganskneftegas assets -- with the worry that this will occur by a process as hidden as those of the early privatizations. 
 ''The big fear is that Gazprom will pay a higher price than that which Baikal Finance agreed to today,'' Mr. Weafer of Alfa Bank said, ''thus turning a profit for those who stand behind Baikal. That would potentially be a much greater scandal than even the actual destruction of Yukos.''

HEADLINE: Administration Looks to Curb Growth of Medicaid Spending

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Federal officials are sending auditors to state capitals across the country to investigate techniques used by states to shift hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicaid costs to the federal government.
 Also, under a proposed federal rule, the Bush administration will require states to prepare annual estimates of total improper payments and calculate payment error rates for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. States will have to identify the cause of each error, address it and recover any overpayments to health care providers.
 The moves come as the administration is considering a wide range of other new initiatives to curb the growth of Medicaid spending, crack down on improper payments and help states save money by restricting eligibility and benefits.
 Federal investigators said Medicaid wasted hundreds of millions of dollars a year by overpaying for prescription drugs. Many states pay on the basis of inflated, fictitious list prices reported by drug companies. One of the initiatives would link payments to actual market prices, which are often much lower. 
 Federal health officials said the nomination of Michael O. Leavitt as secretary of health and human services signaled the administration's desire to make big changes in Medicaid, like those Mr. Leavitt made as governor of Utah. 
 Under one proposal, states would be allowed to make many changes like increasing co-payments and limiting eligibility without having to get federal waivers. Local officials would also be allowed to provide different benefits in different parts of a state.
 Such plans will stir impassioned debate in Congress. In a letter to President Bush last week, 47 Democratic senators expressed ''opposition to any Medicaid reform proposal that seeks to impose a cap on federal Medicaid spending in any form or eliminates the fundamental guarantee to Medicaid coverage for our nation's must vulnerable citizens.''
 Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and the states. Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican who is vice chairman of the National Governors Association, said, ''None of us could live with 10-year caps on spending'' of the type favored by the Bush administration. If federal spending is capped and the number of Medicaid recipients increases sharply, Mr. Huckabee said, states will face dire fiscal problems.
 But he said, ''We would like to see the federal government give us more authority and power to control the costs and utilization'' of health care under Medicaid. 
 The Bush administration and senior Republicans in Congress said they were developing proposals to do just that. States, for example, would be allowed to charge higher fees to higher-income people.
 Medicaid, originally intended for the poor, has been expanded in some states to cover families with incomes up to twice the poverty level. But the limit on co-payments is still $3 for a prescription drug, regardless of a family's income. 
 Lawmakers have talked of overhauling Medicaid for a decade, but a confluence of forces has added new urgency to the debate, which will begin in earnest when Congress convenes next month. 
 Medicaid spending shot up 63 percent in the last five years. With more than 50 million beneficiaries and more than $300 billion a year in combined federal and state outlays, Medicaid is now bigger than Medicare. For prescription drugs alone, Medicaid spending soared to $34 billion in 2003, from $13.6 billion in 1998. 
 Mr. Bush has vowed to cut the federal budget deficit by half in five years, and Republican leaders in Congress say that goal will be virtually impossible without touching Medicaid. Gary R. Karr, a spokesman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the administration would work with Congress to come up with ''a long-term solution that helps state budgets while improving health outcomes for beneficiaries.''
 The growth of Medicaid has outstripped the growth of state revenues and is putting pressure on other state programs. This year, for the first time, Medicaid was a larger component of state spending than elementary and secondary education combined, the governors association said.
 Court decisions have upheld the rights of Medicaid recipients to sue for the denial of benefits, limiting the options for state officials who want to cut costs.
 ''When we try to curb expenses, we inevitably get sued in federal court, and we always lose,'' Mr. Huckabee said in an interview.
 Several states have tried unsuccessfully to deny benefits to poor children. Louisiana, for example, refused to cover disposable diapers prescribed by a doctor for a 16-year-old boy with spina bifida who had no control over his bowel or bladder. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, ruled last month that the state had to cover such supplies for children, regardless of whether they were available to adults.
 Services for a child must be ''determined by reference to federal law, not state preferences,'' the court said. Under the law, it said, states must cover any services needed to correct or ameliorate conditions discovered through medical screening of a child.
 In examining how states may be shifting costs to the federal government, the Bush administration contends, for example, that Massachusetts improperly obtained more than $580 million in federal Medicaid money without paying its share. Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, met recently with Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, to defend the state's method of financing.
 All state Medicaid programs cover prescription drugs. Federal Medicaid officials said they were now willing to let states limit the number of prescriptions, and the number of pills per prescription, for adults. But, they said, such limits cannot eviscerate the drug benefit, which under federal rules must be ''sufficient in amount, duration, and scope'' to meet the needs of most adults.
 Federal officials pointed to Utah's Medicaid program as an example of the kind of changes they would accept in other states. ''That's the direction the administration wants to go,'' said a federal Medicaid official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the administration is still working out details of its plan.
 As governor, Mr. Leavitt obtained a federal waiver allowing Utah to provide Medicaid coverage to more people at no additional cost to the federal government. To accomplish that feat, the state reduced benefits for some people on the rolls and provided a limited set of benefits to new recipients. The new group got coverage for primary care doctors and four prescriptions a month, but the benefit package did not include hospital care or mental health services. 
 Medicaid is now an entitlement, guaranteed to anyone who meets the federal and state eligibility criteria. 
 In 1995, Congress passed a bill to end the individual entitlement and let each state devise its own program with a lump sum of federal money. Lobbying for that proposal, Mr. Leavitt, who was then chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said, ''We are unanimously opposed to inclusion of individual entitlements'' in the Medicaid bill. The bill was part of a deficit-reduction measure vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
 The Bush administration is working with Congress to limit Medicaid payments for prescription drugs. Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, said: ''The current system is broken and needs to be fixed. The government reimbursement rate has to be based on an actual price that somebody pays, not just a posted price, a sticker price.''
 Patrick J. O'Connell, an assistant attorney general of Texas, said some pharmacies had received ''windfall profits'' because Medicaid had paid them far more than it cost to buy drugs from manufacturers and wholesalers. Moreover, Mr. O'Connell said, some manufacturers ''purposely reported false and inflated prices to Texas Medicaid.''
 Two drug companies have paid the state $45 million to settle Medicaid fraud charges.

HEADLINE: Roth Plot II

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In ''The Plot Against America,'' the novelist Philip Roth imagined what might have befallen this nation if the appeasing Charles A. Lindbergh had defeated the anti-Hitler F.D.R. in the 1940 election. 
 Here's my idea for the sequel: 
 Opening scene in the Oval Office in winter 2001, after U.S. and allied forces crushed the Taliban in retaliation for their part in 9/11, with bin Laden not yet found in Afghanistan.
 President Bush tells his national security aides he wants to continue to wage war against the web of terrorists, lest America be attacked again with nukes or germs. 
 The C.I.A.'s Tenet notes that Saddam's Iraq harbors the terrorists Nidal and al-Zarqawi. Adviser Rice adds that world intelligence services agree that Saddam seeks awful weapons. The Pentagon's Rumsfeld warns it is ''only a matter of time'' before Iraq shoots down one of our planes enforcing the no-flight zone protecting Iraq's Kurds from genocide. 
 State's Powell counsels relaxing U.N. pressure on Iraq by calling them ''smart sanctions,'' hoping this will persuade Saddam to permit inspections. Bush glumly agrees.
 Dissolve to a scene in a Tikrit palace where Saddam lays out his plan to (a)amass billions through a U.N. oil-for-food scam and his secret oil pipeline to Syria, (b)increase contacts with Al Qaeda, (c)take leadership of the Arab world by developing W.M.D. or pretending to have them already, and (d)openly challenging Bush.
 Back in D.C., at a critical go-no-go meeting in the Situation Room, Bush sides with Powell not to invade Iraq. Wolfowitz enters with news of a shoot-down of our ''Northern Watch'' aircraft by Iraq. Kofi Annan, on CNN, asks: What do we expect -- the U.S. flies over sovereign Iraqi territory. Bush decides against his aides' audacious regime-change proposal, and chooses a restrained, Clintonian pinprick response with cruise missiles.
 Having gloriously faced down the U.S. -- and gaining greater financial and weaponry strength every day -- Saddam becomes an iconic, heroic figure in the Arab and Muslim world. Through massive kickbacks and smuggling operations involving France, Russia and China, the murderous despot ensures U.N. protection from inspections. Free from fear of retaliation, Saddam offers safe haven in Iraq to bin Laden and followers seeking a center of operations. 
 Cut to Libya, where Qaddafi has purchased nuclear know-how and fissionable material from corrupt Pakistani scientists. The Libyan dictator shifts his fear of the U.S. to fear and envy of Iraq, and presses ahead to produce a nuclear bomb of his own. Intermediate-range missiles being shipped to him from North Korea are seized at sea by Israel.
 That Zionist entity is faced by a Hamas-dominated P.L.O. now heavily financed by Saddam. In 2003, he doubles his payments to the families of suicide bombers, ties the violent intifada tightly to Baghdad-based Qaeda, and sees to it that a Palestinian of his choice is ready to succeed Arafat.
 The terrified royal families of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait demand that the U.S. and European nations station troops in their countries to act as a tripwire against Saddam's longtime lust for their oil and against bin Laden's vengeance. Bush, having rejected reforms to make our forces more mobile, is forced to decline. Europe, furious at the U.S. for failure to fulfill the leadership responsibilities of a superpower, passes. The U.N. resolves it is seized with concern. 
 OPEC, with Iraq's shrewd acquiescence, retaliates by doubling oil prices, its price-gouging supported by Russia's oil cartel, which triggers Western-world recession. Egypt, seeking protection from Saddam, merges with nuclear-armed Libya, and both embrace Islamism.
 This disheartening train of events left the station, in my sequel to Roth's satire, with the fictional Bush's humiliating decision not to invade Iraq. But that's no proper ending for an optimistic, reconstructionist author. 
 In early 2004, a Wilsonian Democrat bursts upon the political scene. He wins the Iowa caucuses on the slogan ''Send Our Boys Abroad,'' conducts a campaign inspiring us to extend freedom throughout the world, and routs the G.O.P.'s equivocating wimp in the White House. As president-elect, he emulates F.D.R. in wartime by appointing Republicans Rumsfeld to State and Wolfowitz to Defense, overthrows Saddam, wins the terror war -- and the Plot Against America, Part II, is foiled.

PERSON: Dr. Herbert C. Brown

HEADLINE: Herbert C. Brown, 92, Chemist Who Won Nobel for Boron Work

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
Dr. Herbert C. Brown, a chemist who won a Nobel Prize for developing a valuable versatile addition to the tool kit for synthesizing drugs and other chemicals, died Sunday at a hospital in Lafayette, Ind. He was 92. 
 The cause was a heart attack, said officials at Purdue University, where Dr. Brown taught from 1947 until his retirement in 1978.
 Herbert Charles Brown was born in London in 1912. His father moved the family to Chicago two years later. His childhood and early adulthood swung between academic achievement and hardship in the economic turmoil of the 1920's and 1930's. In school, he skipped several grades, then dropped out of high school for three years after his father died to tend the hardware store that his father had opened. 
 Working odd jobs after graduation, Dr. Brown decided to attend a junior college, planning to become an electrical engineer. After one semester, the college closed. He then attended night school, supporting himself as a shoe salesman. He finally graduated from another junior college and attended the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1936. 
 For his graduation, his future wife gave him a book, ''The Hydrides of Boron and Silicon,'' which spurred an enduring curiosity about the element boron.
 Two years later, he received his doctorate, also from Chicago.
 After four years teaching at Wayne University in Detroit, now Wayne State, Dr. Brown joined Purdue as a professor.
 Dr. Brown's boron research initially focused on a class of inorganic compounds known as boron hydrides. Later, he discovered that boron compounds could also be enlisted in synthesizing carbon-containing molecules.
 ''He was really the pioneer of putting boron to work in organic reactions,'' said Dr. Dale W. Margerum, a colleague of Dr. Brown's at Purdue. ''That really led to a whole generation of people working in that area.''
 The compounds that Dr. Brown developed, known as organoboranes, have provided a low-cost way of making many molecules used in drugs and agricultural chemicals, among other uses.
 Dr. Brown liked to point out that the three primary elements involved in the reactions -- hydrogen, carbon and boron -- were the initials of his name.
 He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979 for the work. Even after retiring and winning the Nobel, Dr. Brown continued new research as a professor emeritus until his death, Dr. Margerum said.
 He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
 Dr. Brown is survived by his wife, Sarah; a son, Charles, of San Jose, Calif.; and two granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Cellphones in Flight: The Story Is Data, Not Chatter

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
Conventional wisdom has it that once federal authorities approve the use of cellphones on commercial flights, an airplane cabin will quickly resemble an Amtrak train car, simmering with hostility between those who want peace and quiet and those who bray their way from Penn Station in New York to Union Station in Washington.
 Here are three little words to consider on the subject: not so fast.
 As regulatory authorities seek comment and study the technological and safety implications, no one expects the existing ban on using cellphones on commercial flights to be eased for at least two years, if ever. More important, it appears there is not a great deal of support for in-flight cellphone chatter among business travelers, whom most airlines regard as their most valuable customers. Leisure travelers are even less enamored. 
 ''Our research indicates that among business travelers, only 13 percent want to use their mobile phones on an airplane for conversation, and less than 10 percent of leisure travelers want to,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, airline analyst at Forrester Research. 
 That does not mean there is not wide support for the decision by the Federal Communications Commission last week to seek formal public comment on easing the ban on in-flight use of wireless devices such as cellphones. In fact, there is overwhelming support for changing the rules to allow the use of wireless communications devices in the air, Mr. Harteveldt said. It just does not manifest itself as a vote of approval for ''suffering through some blabbermouth on a transcontinental yak-fest,'' he said.
 Instead, airline passengers mostly want the ability to stay in touch by text-messaging -- using cellphones, wireless communications devices like BlackBerrys and other personal digital devices, or laptop Internet connections. 
 ''The story here is data, not voice,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''The real interest and opportunities lie in using our mobile phones or BlackBerrys for text messaging, e-mail and even the Internet.''
 It has become ''very, very clear that people want silent communications'' on an airplane, he said.
 Travel industry and communications specialists cite several reasons for the desire to discourage cellphone voice communications on airplanes. Unlike train trips, flights tend to be long. Space is cramped. Tolerance of cellphone louts is waning in general. And increasing numbers of business travelers say telephone chatting in close proximity to strangers raises serious privacy issues.
 Lawyers at big law firms, for example, are spending more time in the air as legal services increasingly become a global industry, much as accounting did years ago, said Paul Metselaar, chief executive of the Ovation Travel Group, an international travel management company. Law firms account for 70 percent of Ovation's revenue, he said.
 ''The increased usage of cellphones, if it happens, will enable them to do more work on planes, but it has a potential concomitant effect because privacy is a huge issue for our clients,'' he said. ''Where, say, you're working on a multibillion-dollar deal, the issues of confidentiality are going to present themselves. I mean, they're already concerned about people looking over their shoulders when they're using their laptops.''
 While relaxing the ban would increase productivity and billable hours, he said, the real demand is for access to e-mail and the Internet, whether on a laptop or on a hand-held device like a BlackBerry. BlackBerrys, introduced to the market six years ago by Research in Motion, a telecommunications company based in Canada, and similar hand-held wireless devices sold by competitors allow users to receive and reply to e-mail and surf the Web, and can even act as telephones. In the first 10 months of this year, the number of subscribers to BlackBerrys -- which avid users fondly call CrackBerrys -- doubled, to two million.
 ''Our clients love CrackBerrys -- they're addicts,'' Mr. Metselaar said.
 The matter before the F.C.C. is only part of the overall issue of wireless communications on planes. The main concern of the F.C.C., which regulates broadcast communications, is sorting out matters like the potential for interference with ground-based communications networks. Assuming the F.C.C. eventually gave clearance, the Federal Aviation Administration would still need to certify that in-flight wireless communications do not interfere with aircraft navigational systems, and that remains an open question.
 Last July, the biggest domestic carrier, American Airlines, tested voice and text mobile communications on a single flight, in a project with Qualcomm, the wireless communications company. The test, conducted under the supervision of the F.C.C., the F.A.A. and other regulatory agencies, showed that passengers could successfully make and receive calls, American said.
 While American and other airlines have not yet conducted detailed studies on what in-flight mobile communications customers want, ''the text-messaging side is very, very important,'' said Billy Sanez, an American spokesman. An in-flight mobile communications system ''has to have a connection -- not just basically tying two strings together to talk on the phone, but being able to use your BlackBerry or your P.D.A. to download e-mail or send text,'' he said.
 Right now, many users of Internet-capable cellphones, BlackBerrys and comparable devices download e-mail just before a flight, use in-flight time to compose replies with the transmitter turned off, and then transmit their text messages after the plane lands. The F.C.C. decision last week was ''just a very small step'' toward allowing those devices, along with voice telephones, to be used in flight, said Gary Shapiro, the president of the Consumer Electronics Association, a trade group.
 In the interim, as more travelers use transmission-capable devices on planes, the group has issued guidelines for manufacturers to help airlines detect the illegal use of any device during flight. The guidelines, now being adopted by manufacturers, call for a clearly visible, uniform icon to be displayed on such devices, so ''flight attendants can quickly see when someone's device is receiving or emitting a signal,'' Mr. Shapiro said.
 Mr. Shapiro said he believed that the commotion over cellphones on airplanes was overblown. ''The media has gotten this story totally wrong, being focused on the fact of how obnoxious it will be to listen to someone on a telephone when you're stuck flying in this pile of tin,'' he said. 
 Unless airlines come up with ways to segregate annoying cellphone chatterers -- which is considered highly unlikely -- he said he did not think in-fight voice communications had much of a future. ''Frankly, I don't think it will ever happen,'' he said, adding:
 ''As a guy who flies at least once a week, I can tell you that the intensity of emotion on this issue of allowing people to talk on telephones in flight is great,'' he said. ''People are never going to accept that, but what they do want is the ability to use their personal digital assistants, their BlackBerrys and telephones and other related products, to be able to get and receive information'' while the plane is aloft.

'Mikey and Nicky'
 Elaine May's ''Mikey and Nicky'' (1976) has had a troubled existence. But the film's fine new DVD incarnation from Home Vision Entertainment provides a happy ending, firmly setting this neglected wonder among the finest American movies of the 1970's, and perhaps of all time. 
 Ostensibly a buddy comedy about the small-time Philadelphia hoods Mikey (Peter Falk) and Nicky (John Cassavetes) who spend a frenzied night together during which Mikey must finger his boyhood friend for a mob hit man (Ned Beatty), the film was the product of a difficult production. Ms. May, coming off the commercial and critical success of ''The Heartbreak Kid,'' took her sweet time in shooting ''Mikey and Nicky,'' insisting on shooting entirely after dark and leaving her crew standing idle for hours at a time as she discussed the characters and situations with her two extraordinary collaborators, improvising pages of new dialogue nightly. 
 In the end, says the producer Michael Hausman in an interview on the new disc, Ms. May exposed more than one million feet of film, a record many believe stands to this day. Holed up in a hotel suite at the Sunset Marquis in West Hollywood, Ms. May carved the film down to a perfectly paced 105 minutes over a period of many months. When the film opened in New York in December 1976, it sank quickly out of sight and has remained for the last 28 years a legend among those lucky enough to see it at its periodic revivals. 
 Seen today, ''Mikey and Nicky'' offers an almost Shakespearean appreciation of human complexity, paradoxically centered on two characters who are anything but self-aware. During the long night, as Mikey, supposedly trying to help his old friend in a moment of mortal consequence, actually steers him toward an assassin's bullet, the two men instinctively explore the history of their friendship, from childhood alliance to adult betrayal. 
 Mikey's monstrous act is revealed to have so many complex roots, from perceived adolescent slights to a cold economic decision to back his mob bosses (played by the great acting coaches Sanford Meisner and William Hickey) over his unreliable, irresponsible friend, that his betrayal comes to seem inevitable and even necessary -- a working definition of modern tragedy. 
 In a movie filled with unforgettable performances, it is worth underlining the contribution of Carol Grace, who in two brief scenes creates an indelible portrait of Nellie, Nicky's sweet, sad mistress. Truman Capote's inspiration for Holly Golightly of ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' and later the wife of William Saroyan and Walter Matthau, Grace, who died last year, modestly displays a magical presence that more than justifies the tales that have grown up around her life. 
 The Home Vision disc features a scrupulously cleaned-up and color-corrected print (along with an informative documentary on how the buffing up was done) as well as an essay by one of the film's longtime critical champions, Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader. $29.95. R. 

'Gay-Themed Films of the German Silent Era'
 Whether Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1924 masterpiece ''Michael'' is indeed a ''gay-themed film of the German silent era,'' or, as cooler heads might suggest, a chastely pre-Freudian study of a mentor-protege relationship between a celebrated painter and his young model-student, its return as part of a new collection with that blanket title from Kino on Video is most welcome. Working in a German studio from a screenplay by Fritz Lang's wife and collaborator, Thea von Harbou, the great Danish filmmaker constructs a delicate, filigreed vision of the birth of art from pain. 
 The painter is played by Benjamin Christensen, another Danish master, who is best known today for his 1922 ''Witchcraft Through the Ages.'' The protege is Walter Slezak, startlingly young and handsome in these years before he became a sputtering Nazi villain in Hollywood films like Hitchcock's ''Lifeboat.'' The interloper, an exiled Russian countess, is played by the ethereal Nora Gregor, whose only other film role of note was as the doomed aristocrat of Jean Renoir's ''Rules of the Game'' (1939). But the real star of ''Michael'' is Dreyer's expressive lighting, which stirs emotional effects not from the shadows of German Expressionism then prevalent, but from the beams of blinding white light that would take on an explicitly spiritual dimension in ''The Passion of Joan of Arc'' (1928) and ''Ordet'' (1955).
 The collection is filled out by two intriguing novelties. Richard Oswald's ''Different From the Others'' (1922) counts among the earliest sympathetic film portraits of homosexuality. One of a series of ''sex hygiene'' films produced by Oswald, it tells the tragic story of a concert violinist (Conrad Veidt) blackmailed for his involvement with a younger man and includes an appearance by the pioneering gay liberationist Magnus Hirschfeld (a writer of the scenario). Heavily censored after its initial release, it has been reconstructed, using the existing film plus still photos and intertitles from the German censorship records, by the Munich Filmmuseum. 
 ''Sex in Chains'' was directed by and stars Wilhelm Dieterle, who later, as William Dieterle, directed 1930's Warner prestige pictures like ''The Life of Emile Zola'' and ''Juarez.'' Dieterle plays a young husband who, sent up the river on a manslaughter charge, gets a little too close to his cellmate, much to the concern of his wife when he returns home. Not so much interesting in itself, as for the evolving attitudes it depicts, it is presented here in its complete form, unseen since the Nazi repression. 
 The three features, not rated, are priced at $29.95 each. 

NEW THIS WEEK -- Among recent theatrical films making their DVD debuts today: Jared Hess's indie hit ''Napoleon Dynamite'' (20th Century Fox Home Video, $29.98, PG); Antoine Fuqua's period adventure ''King Arthur'' in an unrated director's cut (Buena Vista Home Video, $29.99); Irwin Winkler's musical biography of Cole Porter, ''De-Lovely'' (MGM, $26.98, PG-13); Jonathan Demme's paranoid political thriller ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (Paramount Home Video, $29.95, R); and Edgar Wright's delicious zombie comedy ''Shaun of the Dead'' (Universal, $29.98, R).

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Rebound After Five Months of Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A gauge of future economic activity that had declined for five consecutive months reversed course in November, signaling that the nation's financial engine is still gaining power even though the growth rate has slowed. 
 The Conference Board, a private research group, said yesterday that its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.2 percent in November, slightly better than economists had expected, after revised declines of 0.4 percent in October and 0.2 percent in September. 
 The indicator, which is intended to predict economic activity over the next three to six months, now stands at 115.2. Its high was 116.5 in May. It stood at 100 in 1996. 
 Six of the 10 indicators that make up the index rose in November, including stock prices, consumer expectations and manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials. Declining indicators included vendor performance, average weekly manufacturing hours and building permits. 
 John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said the Conference Board data indicated that ''the economy will be slower in mid-2005 than it is today.'' The recent strength of the stock market, however, suggests that ''over all, economic growth is still very positive.'' 
 Mr. Silvia said the direction of the index over the next several months would be a critical test of the economic recovery's durability. ''If you were to see another string of negative numbers, it would matter very much,'' he said. 
 For its part, the Conference Board said it did not believe that the index had fallen far enough or long enough to signal the end of the economy's expansion. 
 ''In terms of both duration and degree, the indicators suggest an economy losing forward momentum,'' said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the research group, which is based in New York. ''But even if economic performance in early 2005 proves sluggish, conditions could brighten by spring.'' 
 Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns, said, ''There's nothing in the data to lead me to think there will be a recession in '05, but we've definitely had a slowdown.'' 
 Ms. Cooper is forecasting gross domestic product growth of 3 percent in 2005, compared with roughly 4 percent in 2004.

HEADLINE: U.S. Slips in Attracting the World's Best Students

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
American universities, which for half a century have attracted the world's best and brightest students with little effort, are suddenly facing intense competition as higher education undergoes rapid globalization. 
 The European Union, moving methodically to compete with American universities, is streamlining the continent's higher education system and offering American-style degree programs taught in English. Britain, Australia and New Zealand are aggressively recruiting foreign students, as are Asian centers like Taiwan and Hong Kong. And China, which has declared that transforming 100 universities into world-class research institutions is a national priority, is persuading top Chinese scholars to return home from American universities. 
 ''What we're starting to see in terms of international students now having options outside the U.S. for high-quality education is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said David G. Payne, an executive director of the Educational Testing Service, which administers several tests taken by foreign students to gain admission to American universities. ''Other countries are just starting to expand their capacity for offering graduate education. In the future, foreign students will have far greater opportunities.'' 
 Foreign students contribute $13 billion to the American economy annually. But this year brought clear signs that the United States' overwhelming dominance of international higher education may be ending. In July, Mr. Payne briefed the National Academy of Sciences on a sharp plunge in the number of students from India and China who had taken the most recent administration of the Graduate Record Exam, a requirement for applying to most graduate schools; it had dropped by half.
 Foreign applications to American graduate schools declined 28 percent this year. Actual foreign graduate student enrollments dropped 6 percent. Enrollments of all foreign students, in undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral programs, fell for the first time in three decades in an annual census released this fall. Meanwhile, university enrollments have been surging in England, Germany and other countries. 
 Some of the American decline, experts agree, is due to post-Sept. 11 delays in processing student visas, which have discouraged thousands of students, not only from the Middle East but also from dozens of other nations, from enrolling in the United States. American educators and even some foreign ones say the visa difficulties are helping foreign schools increase their share of the market. 
 ''International education is big business for all of the Anglophone countries, and the U.S. traditionally has dominated the market without having to try very hard,'' said Tim O'Brien, international development director at Nottingham Trent University in England. ''Now Australia, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Canada are competing for that dollar, and our lives have been made easier because of the difficulties that students are having getting into the U.S.
 ''International students say it's not worth queuing up for two days outside the U.S. consulate in whatever country they are in to get a visa when they can go to the U.K. so much more easily.'' 
 American educators have been concerned since the fall of 2002, when large numbers of foreign students experienced delays in visa processing. But few noticed the rapid emergence of higher education as a global industry until quite recently. 
 ''Many U.S. campuses have not yet geared up for the competition,'' said Peggy Blumenthal, a vice president at the Institute for International Education.
 Still, Ms. Blumenthal said, it remains unclear whether the sudden decline in foreign enrollments is a one-time drop or the beginning of a long slide. 
 Not all educators are expressing concern.
 Steven B. Sample, president of the University of Southern California -- which last year had 6,647 foreign students, the most of any American university -- said colleagues who lead other universities had expressed anxiety at professional meetings.
 ''But we compete no holds barred among ourselves for the best faculty, for students, for gifts and for grants, and that's one of the reasons for our strength,'' Dr. Sample said. ''Now we'll compete with some overseas universities. Fine with me, bring 'em on.''
 Certainly many American universities continue to be extraordinary global brand names. Shanghai Jiao Tong University has compiled an online academic ranking of 500 world universities, using criteria like the number of Nobel Prizes won by faculty members and academic articles published (ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2004/2004Main.htm). Of the top 20 on the list, 17 are American. Of the top 500, 170 are American.
 During 2002, the most recent year for which comparable figures are available, some 586,000 foreign students were enrolled in United States universities, compared with about 270,000 in Britain, the world's second-largest higher education destination, and 227,000 in Germany, the third-largest. Foreign enrollments increased by 15 percent that year in Britain, and in Germany by 10 percent. 
 The countries exporting the most students were China, South Korea and India, but the annual global migration to overseas universities involves two million students from many countries traveling in many directions. That number is exploding -- by some estimates it will quadruple by 2025 -- as economic growth produces millions of new middle-class students across Asia.
 In October, the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, an economic forum for 30 leading industrial nations, took note of this global movement in a study. Stephan Vincent-Lancrin, an analyst at the organization's headquarters in Paris and an author of the study, said that traditionally most countries, including the United States, had tried to attract foreign students as a way of disseminating their nation's core values. 
 But three other strategies emerged in the 1990's, Dr. Vincent-Lancrin said. Countries with aging populations like Canada and Germany, pursuing a ''skilled migration'' approach, have sought to recruit talented students in strategic disciplines and to encourage them to settle after graduation. Germany subsidizes foreign students so generously that their education is free.
 Australia and New Zealand, pursuing a ''revenue generating'' approach, treat higher education as an industry, charging foreign students full tuition. They compete effectively in the world market because they offer quality education and the costs of attaining some degrees in those countries are lower than in the United States. Emerging countries like India, China and Singapore, pursuing a ''capacity building'' approach, view study abroad by thousands of their nation's students as a way of training future professors and researchers for their own university systems, which are expanding rapidly, Dr. Vincent-Lancrin said. 
 In August a delegation of education officials from Singapore visited Mary Sue Coleman, the president of the University of Michigan, at the Ann Arbor campus. They took over a conference room, set up computers and peppered her with questions about tuition policy, fund-raising, governance and research, Dr. Coleman recalled. They wanted to know how Michigan became a prominent university, and how it was run today.
 ''Eventually they'll reap the benefits of this work,'' Dr. Coleman said. ''Singapore will create world-class universities. Other countries are taking the same approach. We're going to have enormous competition. We'd better be prepared for it.''
 The rapid changes in India and China have special importance. The number of Indian students in the United States has more than doubled in a decade, to 80,000, the largest representation of any country. The 62,000 students from China make up the second-largest group. Graduate students and degree holders from those countries play a critical role in American science, engineering and information technology research. 
 Some 28 percent fewer Indian students applied to attend American graduate schools this fall than last year, according to a survey by the Council of Graduate Schools. This matched the overall decline for all foreign students. 
 Rabindranath Panda, the education consul at India's consulate in New York, said that huge private investments in Indian higher education in recent years had greatly increased options at home for Indian students, and that those who wished to study abroad were increasingly looking at universities not only in the United States and Britain but also in France, Germany, Singapore and elsewhere.
 Higher education is undergoing even more sweeping transformation in China. The number of students seeking a postsecondary degree is expected to rise to 16 million students by 2005 from 11 million in 2000 and to keep rising thereafter, according to a recent report by the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation. Even if only a small minority of those new students seek a foreign degree, they will enlarge their already important presence at hundreds of overseas universities. 
 But the new wave of Chinese students may not wash into the United States. Educators say applicants from China face more visa difficulties than applicants from any country outside the Middle East.
 One reason, they say, appears to be that many Chinese students pursue the science disciplines that set off a screening process known as Visa Mantis, intended to prevent the transfer of sensitive technology. A Congressional study found that during a three-month period last year, more than half of all the Visa Mantis investigations worldwide involved Chinese students. The especially long visa delays experienced by Chinese students are a major irritant for many university presidents.
 ''Chinese students are getting heightened scrutiny,'' said the president of Princeton University, Shirley M. Tilghman. ''I've asked many people for the rationale, but I've never gotten an answer that makes sense.''
 Chinese applications to American graduate schools fell 45 percent this year, while several European countries announced surges in Chinese enrollment.
 ''We had an especially large increase in Chinese students,'' said Martina Nibbeling-Wriessnig, a spokeswoman for the German Embassy in Washington.
 The United States is also losing some Chinese scholars, partly because of China's strategic decision over the last decade to channel special investments to 100 universities with a view to building them into world-class research giants capable of winning Nobel Prizes. 
 In October, Dr. Coleman of the University of Michigan visited Shanghai Jiao Tong University, which created the online university ranking system and has also built a vast new campus. Partly because Dr. Coleman is a biochemist, her hosts took her to visit their new pharmacy school. It had hired 16 professors, she said -- all of them returned from American universities.
 But not only Chinese universities are seeking to lure top faculty members from American campuses.
 ''Baseball's World Series includes only American teams,'' said Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University. ''But higher education is truly a world series now, because we're competing for students and faculty against universities all over the world.''

HEADLINE: DEBT DEAL LETS LEGAL AID SOCIETY STAY IN BUSINESS

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Anthony Ramirez contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The Legal Aid Society, the main legal provider for New York City's poor, has reached an agreement to stave off bankruptcy after settling with its creditors, negotiating budget cuts with its employees and receiving an unusual $9 million donation from dozens of private law firms to help settle its debts. 
 In negotiations concluded last week, Legal Aid reached agreements with dozens of creditors on debts worth more than $30 million. It was the final step in a complex plan to rescue the nonprofit agency from the bankruptcy that had hovered over it for months, after financial mismanagement brought it to the brink of collapse earlier this year.
 As part of the agreement, 30 of the city's biggest law firms made a one-time donation to help pay creditors, which include suppliers, landlords and a private bank. More than 50 lawyers and corporate restructuring experts worked without pay to help reach the agreement, said Legal Aid officials, adding that details were still being worked out. 
 ''When the music stopped, everybody had a seat,'' said Patricia M. Hynes, chairwoman of Legal Aid's board. ''This was a series of moving parts, and until you had all the pieces in place, the deal could not take place. Last Thursday, the last couple of pieces fell into place.''
 As a result, the country's oldest and largest defense group for the indigent will stay in business. Its collapse would have been broadly felt among the city's poor, since it provides about 60 percent of all legal representation in criminal cases to poor defendants each year.
 Many of the city's biggest law firms have long supported the society's work, and prominent partners serve on its board and occasionally assist in major cases. The firms would not necessarily have to pick up Legal Aid's burden if it were to go under, since there are other nonprofit groups in New York that could do much of the work, but several said they felt an obligation to keep the agency's mission alive.
 ''We are big believers in the mission of the society,'' said Jerome C. Katz, a partner in Chadbourne & Parke, which contributed $250,000. ''We as a firm decided that we would do anything in our power to assure its survival.''
 The firms agreed to make the contributions on the condition that Legal Aid first reach agreements with creditors on repaying debts and balance its budget. The society sliced $22 million from its expenditures by laying off some of its clerical workers and cutting costs on such things as office space and business cards. 
 No lawyers were laid off, and Legal Aid officials said the quality of representation had not been affected. Steven Banks, the attorney in chief, said Legal Aid hired 40 lawyers in September to replenish a work force that had dwindled during a hiring freeze. The agency now employs 1,396 people.
 All lawyers were asked to agree to cuts in their pension and health care benefits, officials said. Contributions to pensions fell to 3 percent from 6.5 percent for at least a year, for an annual savings of $2.1 million. 
 Several Legal Aid lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the reduction in clerical support meant that they must allow at least a week for copying and filing briefs, instead of a few days. As bills piled up, it became more difficult to hire expert trial witnesses, and investigator positions have gone unfilled, they said. Agency officials said the problems were only temporary.
 ''Everyone has more on their plate and everyone is running around,'' said a former staff member at Legal Aid. ''It's hard to quantify what the effect is. Everyone is trying really hard to get the job done.'' 
 James Rogers, the president of the union representing Legal Aid lawyers, said that during the financial troubles, caseloads have reached a record high of 85 to 120 per lawyer, although the city budgeted for 65 per lawyer in the current fiscal year, he said. 
 ''Most folks working at Legal Aid aren't making ends meet,'' he said, adding that the starting salary for a Legal Aid lawyer is $42,000. ''The challenge is to get the government to fund us at the actual cost of services.''
 Although the issue of the society's past debts appears to be settled, city officials say the biggest hurdle will come when the society tries to show that it can manage its books properly. 
 ''We're encouraged by some of the steps they've taken, but they have a ways to go before they're out of the woods,'' said John Feinblatt, the city's criminal justice coordinator.
 Legal Aid's current financial troubles date back several years. Its previous manager, Daniel L. Greenberg, headed both the legal and the business sides of the organization, and his dual role has been blamed for leaving Legal Aid without adequate financial oversight. 
 Last December, board members realized that a $9 million line of credit from Merrill Lynch was no longer being paid back, and earlier last year, an internal investigation revealed that Legal Aid's chief financial officer had charged more than $30,000 in items like pizza and shoes to the organization. The official later paid back the money and resigned.
 The board, which had exercised only passive control over the organization, began to investigate and found that financial reporting was almost nonexistent, and that accounting systems and controls were poor. Mr. Greenberg, who had pulled Legal Aid through severe budget cuts under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, stepped down in June.
 Since then, Legal Aid has been trying to avert collapse by trimming costs and persuading creditors to settle on debts. Alvarez & Marsal, a New York company that specializes in emergency restructuring for companies, set to work on the budget gap. 
 Even the smallest items were counted. Water fountains replaced bottled water. A new contract with the main office's cleaning company left lawyers to empty their own recyclables. Special letterhead paper was replaced with computer-generated templates. Offices in Brooklyn and Queens were consolidated. 
 ''A lot of us were a little shocked at how much the little items cost,'' said Patricia Bath, Legal Aid's spokeswoman. 
 The deepest cuts, however, were among employees of Legal Aid's administrative staff and management, and in benefits for lawyers. Over the last several months, Legal Aid cut its staff 14 percent, including about a quarter of its support staff, such as typists and receptionists, for a savings of about $4 million annually, officials said.
 In all, Legal Aid officials say, the savings have added up to $22 million, the amount of the budget shortfall, which was first made public by Legal Aid officials in February. 
 The city, which provides about half the agency's financing, steadily cut back Legal Aid's budget in the 1990's. Between 1994 and 1998, city support dipped by a third to $54 million, although the City Council added $5 million in 1998. It later rose under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and now stands at about $68 million.
 Legal Aid was founded in 1876 to defend the rights of German immigrants, and for years it was financed mostly through philanthropic donations by prominent New Yorkers, like the Rockefellers and Carnegies. It became publicly supported in the 1960's after the United States Supreme Court established the right to counsel for the poor.
 Competing organizations say the society's problems have siphoned off money in the criminal justice system that they could have used, a charge the city contests. Michael Coleman, who worked at Legal Aid for 25 years and is now executive director of New York County Defender Services, said the society's structure needed an overhaul. 
 The board is made up of lawyers from profit-making law firms, whose work has little in common with Legal Aid, he said. Decisions by upper-level managers have to pass through the union, further complicating the decision-making process, he said. 
 ''They ran it more like a bureaucracy than a business,'' Mr. Coleman said. 
 Legal Aid officials disputed that view, saying that the organization is now more efficient and streamlined than it has ever been. The board set up a finance committee, and stringent financial reporting requirements have been put in place, the officials said. The jobs of attorney in chief and chief executive have been split, and a new financial officer has been hired. Legal Aid is currently searching for a new president.
 What is more, Ms. Hynes said, Legal Aid is now reorganized to protect against such mismanagement in the future. The finance department has been overhauled and now produces reports monthly, not just annually. Three new accountants have been hired, as well as an experienced controller, Ms. Hynes said.
 ''All the hours of effort to save the organization can now be redirected toward serving clients,'' Mr. Banks said.

FAREWELL, FREE FOOD -- A news release put out by American Airlines on Friday cheerfully announced it was starting a ''new food service'' in coach cabins Feb. 1 on ''select domestic routes.'' Missing from the announcement was the fact that the new food service means that all remaining free meals in coach are being eliminated. Instead, American will begin selling meals on all domestic flights longer than three hours, including 120 daily transcontinental flights and 40 flights to Hawaii that were the remaining flights on which coach passengers got free meals. American said the new policy would save it $30 million a year. There will be no charge for meals in first class.

SOARING INTO ASIA -- The world's highest hotel is being planned in Hong Kong by the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. The company said yesterday that in 2009, it would open a new 300-room Ritz-Carlton to occupy the top 13 floors of a 1,574-foot, 100-story skyscraper being designed by the Kohn Pederson Fox Associates architectural firm in Kowloon. Among the features of the hotel will be windows with panoramic views of Victoria Harbor, the company said. It already operates another hotel, the Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong, across the harbor in the Central District. Ritz-Carlton also said yesterday that it had signed a letter of intent to open a second hotel in the rapidly developing Pudong Lujiazui district of Shanghai. Last week, Sofitel, a top-luxury brand of Accor Hotels and Resorts, said it had won the management contract to operate a new five-star hotel, the 453-room Sofitel Wanda Beijing, which is expected to open in Beijing's central business district in 2006.

DELTA MODIFIES SKYMILES -- Saying that changes it made two years ago in its SkyMiles frequent-flier program were too complex, Delta Air Lines is simplifying the process for elite qualification and making other changes to SkyMiles. The most important changes: Effective Jan. 1, passengers will have to fly only 75,000 miles annually on Delta to qualify for the top elite status, Platinum Medallion. Passengers flying on the most heavily discounted coach tickets will receive a full mile of elite-status credit for each mile flown. Two years ago, Delta changed the program to award those fliers only a half-mile credit for each mile. Delta will continue to award one and a half elite-status miles for each mile flown on first-class, BusinessElite and full-fare economy tickets. JOE SHARKEY

PERSON: Denis M. Hughes

HEADLINE: A Voice for Labor, Deftly Applied

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
SURE, Denis M. Hughes considered behaving like a stereotypical labor czar and throwing a fit last summer when his chronic ideological sparring partner, Gov. George E. Pataki, bestowed a courtesy call confirming his imminent veto of a raise of the state's minimum wage. He was outraged. This was legislation he had spent two years shepherding. But the tantrum is not his modus operandi. 
 Mr. Hughes, an electrician-turned-president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., has a leprechaun's physique and a diplomat's temperament. Wry understatement is his best weapon. So he quietly told Mr. Pataki he was disappointed, hung up and got cracking on a Senate override. It worked. 
 The minimum wage is to rise in January, and again in 2006 and 2007. Mr. Hughes, 54, is not gloating. That would be bad for labor's image, something he's evangelical about improving. Anyhow, at 5 feet 8 inches, gravity-defying hairline included, boorishness is a physical impossibility. Rants and raves aren't an option. And corruption? Not winked at on his watch: At the last A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention, he sponsored an ethics resolution as proof.
 None of this is accidental. Neither is the presence of what seems an out-of-context photograph, of Fidel Castro taking batting practice, amid the otherwise on-message decor, like George Meany's desk and a pictorial homage to Gov. Al Smith, in his office on Lower Broadway. 
 ''I keep Fidel here to remind me of the absurd nature of absolute power,'' says Mr. Hughes, carefully sipping hot coffee from a paper cup. ''There he is, in his best fatigues, interrupting a professional ball game just because he can.''
 ''Absolute power is something I'll never have,'' he observes, not unhappily. ''What I do is borrow power from the people who have it, and use it for the common good. That's the greatest thing about this job: no moral conflicts.'' 
 His definition of the common good is progressive legislation tailored to lighten the load of people low on the economic scale. A timely example is the Dec. 6 legislation raising the state's minimum wage to $7.15 an hour by 2007, from $5.15. 
 These days Mr. Hughes lives comfortably and gratefully in what he considers maximum-wage territory, making $160,000, wearing nice suits and traversing the state in a union-leased Buick. But he recalls starting out as an electrician's apprentice in the late 60's, earning $2.25 an hour. Fresh from the Navy, he lived with his parents on Staten Island. He had to, even after he got his first union raise, to $2.75. 
 ''There's nothing like a raise in pay to increase your dignity,'' he says, though he's not campaigning for one. ''To me, $160,000 is plenty.'' His salary enabled him to send his daughter to Fordham and lets him dabble in a lifelong indulgence, motorcycles. He exercises his orange Harley Sportster on weekends with a pack of electrician pals but is not, nor was he ever, a Hell's Angel: ''I don't think I'd pass the initiation.'' Insufficient flamboyance. 
 Mr. Hughes does not achieve his desired legislative results by throwing his weight around. He doesn't weigh enough, not even with a union membership of 2.5 million, the largest in the nation, for ballast. To compensate, he has become a deft and tenacious coalition builder, and consequently a behind-the-scenes arm-twister of Albany's lawmakers since being elected union president in 1999. His role model for tenacity, the baseball slugger Hank Greenberg, occupies wall space right below his antihero, Mr. Castro. 
 ''Hank Greenberg was tough, and toughness is something I need very badly in this job,'' he says. ''Labor legislation is in jeopardy, and we needed this minimum wage to re-establish the precedent for legislation that speaks to the needs of working men and women.''
 THAT the 700,000 minimum wage earners affected by it tend to be non-A.F.L.-C.I.O. members is beside the point. An economic ripple effect is the point.
 ''That's kind of the beauty of the whole thing,'' he says, ''that by doing something for people outside of organized labor, we've given ourselves a chance to provide a wage floor, a basement level so to speak. That's the self-serving side of it. Working the fight for a minimum wage was a good thing.
 ''We're issue-oriented, and we exploit political situations for the public good. I can't be partisan. The whole reason for doing this is to get progressive legislation passed.''
 About his rift with the governor: ''I can't take it personally. I can't be unpleasant.'' 
 Mr. Hughes grew up in a thoroughly unionized Irish-Italian clan. One grandfather was a boilermaker, the other a carpenter. His father worked for the Department of Sanitation, his mother was a keypunch operator and his uncles were pipe fitters and carpenters.
 He chose electronics because, of all the building trades, it struck him as one with ''more thinking and less lifting.''
 ''In my neighborhood,'' he said, ''being in a union was considered a major economic move. Getting into the electricians' union was like being accepted at an Ivy League college.''
 Not that Mr. Hughes, who lives with his wife in Rockland County, ignored college. Over 20 years, he accumulated a patchwork of credits from Empire State College, City University of New York, and Cornell, enough to receive a bachelor's degree in industrial labor relations.
 He worked his last on-site job, as a project manager at Pier 17 in 1985, the year he joined the union's administration as its political director and assistant to the president. But he'd still be penciling in ''electrician'' as his occupation on his tax return if his accountant hadn't made him switch to ''labor leader.'' He didn't argue.

HEADLINE: Uninspired Shoppers May Wait for January

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON; Rachel Thorner contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
As holiday shopping reaches the home stretch, consumers who are far removed from the silver-plated boutiques of Madison Avenue and Rodeo Drive say they are holding down their spending for the season. 
 While luxury is booming -- Bergdorf Goodman said anything furry is going fast -- Tareq Brown, 24, a mail sorter for the Postal Service who lives in the Bronx, said he was spending less on gifts than last year. So was Samantha Piper, 22, a nursing assistant at Brooklyn Hospital. And so was Alvita Junior, from Far Rockaway, Queens, who works for the city Parks Department. 
 ''I'm just going to buy presents for less people this year,'' said Ms. Piper, who spent $2,000 on holiday gifts last year and plans to spend only $600 this season.
 C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group in Charleston, S.C., said that low- and middle-income shoppers across the country have been telling pollsters that stores have not done enough to put them in the mood to buy; shoppers have criticized stores' decorations as flimsy and the merchandise as boring.
 Mr. Beemer agrees. ''I have surveyed a number of store display managers'' who have complained about budget cutbacks, he said. Consumers also report that their children are not pining for a ''must have'' toy this year -- because, he said, there isn't one.
 Yet all indications are that broad-based consumer spending remains strong. Economists pointed to last week's Commerce Department report, which suggested that overall spending is likely to rise by a solid 4 percent on top of an inflation rate of roughly 3 percent for the fourth quarter.
 The department looks at a wide range of retail outlets, from grocery stores to restaurants to the Internet, and includes new stores in its survey as well. That suggests many consumers are looking beyond conventional holiday retailers as they parcel out their hard-earned cash. 
 Retail industry analysts are rolling out reports with titles like ''Tick, Tick, Tick.'' While they said sales would strengthen this week, most predict a lackluster Christmas for retailers.
 Sales are expected to quicken in the days before Christmas, Merrill Lynch wrote in a report, though sales at stores open at least a year are likely to rise only 2 percent in November and December over 2003, down from 3.3 percent last year.
 This year, analysts, trade groups, and consultants cannot seem to agree on exactly how good -- or how bad -- this holiday season will be for retailers. More analysts say it will be weak rather than strong.
 ''We've heard a lot from the analysts -- a lot of bah humbug,'' said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, a trade group.
 ''We're still in the camp that thinks the holidays will be solid, respectable, but not spectacular,'' she said. ''We think we're on track to make our forecast,'' which is 4.5 percent over last year for retail stores open since the last holiday season.
 Ms. Mullin said that the major disappointment was the mass marketers like Wal-Mart, the country's largest retailer, which stumbled during Thanksgiving weekend. In response, the company later slashed prices on several dozen popular items in hopes of generating extra traffic. 
 ''Wal-Mart has been a little more negative than we've seen for a while,'' Ms. Mullin said yesterday. 
 Mona Williams, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said that many items appeared to be selling a week later than they did in past years. But she said that digital cameras, satellite radio and cellphones were now ''on fire.'' Among the items selling briskly, she said, are preschool toys, ride-on toys and girls' dress-up items like tiaras and princess attire. 
 If interviews in New York over the weekend are an indication, low- and middle-income shoppers are struggling with bills and are not in the holiday spirit -- at least, not yet.
 Walking out of a clothing store, Mr. Brown, the postal worker, said that he thought Christmas was ''still dreary; people are still suffering from 9/11 and we have a war now; there are a lot of open wounds.''
 Consumers across the country have particularly complained that the high price of gasoline, compared with last year, has dampened their tendency to drive and to spend. 
 But despite his worries, Mr. Brown, who said that he earned about $35,000 a year, carried shopping bags filled with goods. ''The hot gift this year is probably the PlayStation,'' he said, naming the Sony video game console. ''I'm getting one for my brother and one for myself.''
 Ms. Junior, who earns $300 a week working for the Parks Department, said she did not intend to buy many presents. But she said that she still had to shop for her five children, three nieces and nephews, and seven co-workers. She bought a $14 coat for her daughter at a children's clothing store, but did not plan to buy much more right away. ''I'm doing a little shopping now,'' she said, ''but I'll do most of my shopping in January.''
 Within the last couple of weeks, more merchants have started talking about people like Ms. Junior, and said that next month may be the biggest January ever for retail sales. Not only are post-Christmas discounts on the rise, but with the use of gift cards soaring, merchants are hoping to post whopping sales increases next month.
 And then there are analysts who are holding out for a very healthy Christmas.
 ''We know we're contrarians,'' said Craig R. Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners in New Canaan, Conn. ''Most of the conventional wisdom says 2 to 4 percent growth, but we're saying 6 percent plus -- potentially the strongest growth since 1999.''
 Mr. Johnson said his estimates, like those followed by the Commerce Department, included both Internet sales and home-improvement stores like Home Depot.
 At Sears, an early-bird promotion on Saturday offered $10 gift cards for the first 100 shoppers. ''We got reports of good traffic,'' said Larry Costello, a spokesman for Sears. ''It certainly wasn't as robust as the day after Thanksgiving, but there was still strong interest in tools, electronics and jewelry.''
 Where 1,000 people waited in line for early-bird specials the Friday after Thanksgiving, 150 to 200 people lined up last Saturday at some stores in the New York region, he said. This week, he said, the stores will open an hour earlier than usual, but the early-bird specials are over.
 So how will it all come out?
 ''It's just too early to tell,'' Mr. Costello said.
 Veronica Harrison, 80, is retired and on a fixed income. Like many others, she plans to buy many gifts after Dec. 25. She shopped this weekend at the Salvation Army store, on Fourth Avenue and East 12th Street in Manhattan.
 ''I just bought a little something for my granddaughter,'' she said. She bought two sweaters, both for $5. ''But that was an exception.
 ''Last year, I didn't wait until after Christmas,'' she said, ''but this year, I've sent my family and friends messages to expect their gifts after Christmas, because I don't have enough. 
 ''This year,'' she added, ''I feel more spiritual.''

HEADLINE: Clara and her 'Nutcracker' Friends Stop By the World's Fair

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Like San Francisco, the city it celebrates along the way, the visually smashing and all-new ''Nutcracker'' choreographed by Helgi Tomasson, artistic director of the San Francisco Ballet, is elegant and beautiful. Also, a paean to positive thinking.
 Removed from the usual 19th-century bourgeois German household and fantasy Kingdom of the Sweets of the 1892 original, choreographed by Lev Ivanov to Tchaikovsky's beloved score, this $3.5 million ''Nutcracker'' takes place during the Panama Pacific International Exposition held here in 1915. 
 Officially, the exhibition celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal. Like all world's fairs on an extravagant scale, it also celebrated progress -- with a special Californian optimism. After the city's earthquake and fire of 1906, the exposition was an economic boost. Not least, it was the source of civic pride that still resonated in the War Memorial Opera House on Friday night when a backdrop of San Francisco's Victorian houses (known as ''painted ladies'') opened Act I of this production's premiere to a flood of applause. 
 Today, only the Palace of Fine Arts in the city's Marina District recalls the mix of exotica from many lands and American aesthetics that the fair encompassed in its entertainment exhibitions, art and architectural surprises. One of these was a 43-story Tower of Jewels covered with colored glass jewels. 
 Mr. Tomasson has fused the exposition's ideas of hope and progress with the equally universal childhood hopes for happiness of Clara, the ballet's young heroine. The connection may seem something of a stretch. But Mr. Tomasson and his brilliant designers have made it work with taste and discretion. 
 Act I is a warm Christmas party given by a San Francisco family in 1915 that is well off but to which ''bourgeois'' would not apply. Clara's dream takes place not in the usual candyland but in a spacious crystal palace evoked almost abstractly by Michael Yeargan in a set design that changes colors and slide projections thematically with each danced entry. 
 For all these changes of locale and imagery, this ''Nutcracker'' is straightforward, traditional in tone and anything but a trendy irreverent remake. It is useful to recall that the first full-length ''Nutcracker'' in the United States was the 1944 San Francisco Ballet version choreographed by Willam Christensen, then the troupe's director. 
 Mr. Tomasson's ''Nutcracker'' is the fifth version for the company, and he does a striking job with choreography that has his trademark purity of classical style in Act II. There is a crystalline beauty to his changing patterns in the Snowflakes waltz (it is led by a Snow King and Queen), a shimmering grand pas de deux (danced by the Nutcracker Prince and a grown-up Clara rather than the Sugar Plum Fairy) and divertissements, mostly on toe or in bravura style. 
 Occasionally, the dazzle that should come from Tchaikovsky's musical climaxes is missing. The Waltz of the Flowers, led by the Sugar Plum Fairy, is subdued, although its circular patterns prettily suggest petals that open up repeatedly.
 The music itself is sensitively played but with understatement as conducted by Andrew Mogrelia. This is a choice, not necessarily a question of acoustics.
 Nonetheless, this is a ''Nutcracker'' on a grand scale, perfect for the company, which Mr. Tomasson has raised to international rank since he became artistic director in 1985 after leaving New York City Ballet. The opening on Friday was a festive gala: fake snow, a red carpet and costumed entertainers greeted viewers as they entered the opera house. 
 The production's strong suit is its visual impact, which comes from the dancing as well as Mr. Yeargan's decor, with its striking curved staircase; Wendall K. Harrington's slide projections in both acts; James F. Ingalls's lighting; and Martin Pakledinaz's fetching period costumes in Act I and fanciful costumes in Act II. 
 There are also a few changes in the scenario. Clara does not distract the Mouse King by throwing her slipper at him so that the Nutcracker can smite him dead. The mice are busy eating cheese, and the toy soldiers cheat. They bring in a giant mousetrap and capture the rodent monarch. 
 When Clara falls asleep on a divan, her dream journey, guided by her Uncle Drosselmeyer, is thus not the usual reward for a child's good deed. Instead, Mr. Tomasson has made Clara a 13-year-old. Catherine Hearst, a real teenager, was truly an adolescent poised between childhood and the adult happiness promised in her dream. By contrast, Django Allegretti, as her brother, Fritz, was a dynamic scamp. 
 Clara's dream relates not to the foodstuffs she ate at the party but to what she saw at the 1915 exhibition. In Act II, the Pavilion of Dreams, she is paired with Drosselmeyer. Ashley Wheater makes him a marvel of cape-swirling projection and anything but menacing in a version that plays down good versus evil. 
 The Nutcracker Prince meets Clara in Act I, dances a bit and visits the snow people with her. Essentially, he is held in reserve for the grand pas de deux at the end. Here, Ms. Hearst steps into a Chinese cabinet and is replaced by Tina LeBlanc, one of America's great classical ballerinas, as her adult idealized self. Gonzalo Garcia's prince had exceptional lightness and elegant style. Their adagio, with echoes of past versions, was a triumph. 
 More confusing is the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy, now a hostess who leads the Waltz of the Flowers. It is a role that the gracious Muriel Maffre could dance with more projection. But Ruben Martin and Yuan Yuan Tan are all strong technique and presence as the Snow King and Queen. 
 The exotic dances are witty and wittily danced: a Spanish quintet was followed by Sarah Van Patten, funny and sexy after she emerged from Aladdin's lamp, which was guarded by two hunks in harem pants, Moises Martin and Chidozie Nzerem. Pascal Molat, in amazing split jumps, was followed by dragon dancers. In a piquant French number, three showgirls twirled Chinese ribbons in the air (brilliantly choreographed). Child clowns cavorted with Madame Du Cirque and her circus-tent skirt. A showstopper was the Russian dance choreographed by Anatole Vilzak for a 1986 production. Mr. Tomasson was right to keep it, and Guennadi Nedviguine, Pablo Piantino and James Sofranko made the most of its bravura. 
 Happiness is the San Francisco Ballet's new ''Nutcracker.''

''Nutcracker'' runs through Dec. 31 at the San Francisco Ballet, War Memorial Opera House.

HEADLINE: West Side Plan Is Risky Effort, Forecasters Say

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration's $4.1 billion financial plan for transforming the West Side of Manhattan has run into increasing criticism from independent financial analysts as an expensive and risky strategy that may be impossible to pursue under current statutes.
 Critics are not opposed to the extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 34th Street and 11th Avenue, or the new streets, parks and other projects within the plan. But they say that the administration's method of paying for these projects, along with the city's $300 million share in a new football stadium for the Jets, will add an unnecessary $1.3 billion to the price tag and pose risks for the city budget.
 To provide financing for the project, the administration plans to create the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation, which would issue long-term bonds and short-term debt to pay for the parks, the streets, the subway and a deck over a railyard east of 11th Avenue, between 30th and 33rd Streets, where new development could take place. Using the corporation means the city's financial plan would not have to go through the normal budget process and avoids a potentially nettlesome vote by the City Council. 
 ''The city's proposed Hudson Yards financing scheme is fraught with several serious problems and, in my opinion, should be scrapped,'' James A. Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research group, told council members at a hearing last week. ''Instead, a plan of infrastructure improvements for the far West Side should be incorporated into the city's capital budget.''
 Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, told council members that the city's proposed plan would cost $1.3 billion more than if the city used conventional borrowing. 
 City officials do not deny the additional cost, but say that the projects, along with a rezoning of the West Side and the proposed 75,000-seat stadium, would catalyze residential and commercial development in the 59-block area, generating more than $60 billion in new tax revenues over the next 30 years. At the same hearing, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said that in an era of limited resources, the ''only alternative is to do nothing.'' He added, ''It's an investment we can't afford not to make.''
 The hearing before the City Council's finance committee did not have the raucous, carnival-like atmosphere of another forum the same week concerning the proposed $1.4 billion stadium over the West Side rail yards, where the chants of protesters collided with the boisterous roar of construction workers demanding jobs. 
 The finance hearing was conducted under the dim lighting of the Council chamber. There were no raised voices and the room began to empty after only 30 minutes. But with the Council expected to vote next month on rezoning the neighborhood, critics painted a dark picture in contrast to the administration's sunny view. 
 Mr. Doctoroff said the advantage of the plan is that it would pay for itself. The corporation, he said -- not the city -- would be responsible for paying off the bondholders, using tax revenues from new development on the West Side.
 ''We developed a creative financing plan that pays for itself with new revenues it will generate -- not with capital budget money,'' Mr. Doctoroff testified. ''That means the Hudson Yards plan won't compete for resources with other important capital projects.''
 In the early years, said Mr. Doctoroff and Mark Page, the city's budget director, new residential and commercial development would not generate enough revenue to pay the interest on the bonds. So under the city's plan, the corporation would issue about $1 billion in short-term debt backed by the city's Transitional Finance Authority and income tax revenues.
 But critics say the city would be on the hook for the short-term debt if West Side development did not occur quickly enough and investors failed to buy the corporation's short-term notes. They say the corporation would then be using income tax revenues that flow into the city budget.
 ''You're putting city income tax revenues in jeopardy,'' said Richard Ravitch, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and once the state's top economic development official. ''But the law is clear that T.F.A. can't be used for projects that don't go through the budgetary process.''
 Earlier in the hearing, Mr. Page insisted that the city was using the finance authority properly, although he acknowledged that the administration had not gotten a legal opinion to that effect.
 Mr. Ravitch added that the city's financial plan was vulnerable to a legal challenge. And both sides expect opponents of the stadium to file at least two lawsuits in the coming weeks, one challenging the adequacy of the environmental view for the stadium and one challenging the city's financial plan.
 In an October letter to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, also warned that his plan represented a substantial commitment of funds ''without the oversight protections inherent in the city's capital budgeting process.''
 Mr. Doctoroff did not dispute the extra cost, but he played down the risk that the finance authority would have to step in, saying, ''We don't expect it will ever get called on.'' 
 As for the long-term bonds issued by the development corporation, the deputy mayor said that bondholders, not the city, would be at risk if the tax revenues from new development failed to materialize and the corporation defaulted on its obligations.
 But some experts have questioned the city's estimate that 26 million square feet of office space and nearly 14,000 apartments would be built on the West Side over the next 30 years. While the city's demand for housing appears insatiable, economists like Rae Rosen at the Federal Reserve Bank, and James Diffley, a managing director of Global Insight, one of the nation's largest economic forecasting companies, say that the Bloomberg administration is being overly optimistic when it comes to office buildings.
 ''What's implausible is that one new, unproven district would capture all that demand,'' said another economic forecaster, Hugh Kelly of Real Estate Economics.
 Critics say that raises the possibility of a default by the development corporation. Although the corporation would be a legally separate entity from the city, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi warned in a July report that the bonds ''may be perceived by the financial community as a moral obligation of the City of New York and could adversely affect the city's credit rating.''
 Mr. Hevesi noted that the extension of the No. 7 subway line accounted for half the debt. He said major transportation projects have a history of large cost overruns and delays. 
 ''I know the bonds can't be sold just on the credit of the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation,'' Mr. Ravitch said at the hearing. ''Mr. Doctoroff may be sincere in saying that the city is not on the hook. But to suggest that a default wouldn't affect the credit of the city is silly.''

HEADLINE: Overdosed and Oversold

BYLINE: By Merrill Goozner. 
Merrill Goozner, director of the Integrity in Science project at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, is the author of ''The $800 Million Pill: The Truth Behind the Cost of New Drugs.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN the early 1960's, Congressional hearings on skyrocketing drug prices went nowhere. But the political logjam was broken when a eagle-eyed doctor at the Food and Drug Administration averted a potential disaster by advising the agency not to let thalidomide into the United States market. 
 While the final legislation back then had little to do with prices or safety, the new law ushered in efficacy testing and led to the withdrawal of hundreds of drugs of no medical benefit from the market.
 Once again, an agency badly in need of reform faces growing popular outrage over drug safety. The F.D.A.'s failure to spot the warning signs that popular painkillers like Pfizer's Celebrex or Merck's Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks, or its failure to warn doctors and parents about the risk of suicide among children taking antidepressants, has resulted in bipartisan anger on Capitol Hill. Prominent voices have joined the call for an independent drug safety board. 
 But reform at the F.D.A. needs to go much further if it is to once again become the gold standard of medical oversight not just for consumers but for providers and insurers. Only an updated regulatory system can provide them with the information they need to come up with the right answers.
 People confront dizzying choices in health care every day: are brand-name drugs better than generic versions? What are the real costs and benefits of a medical intervention? How serious are the side effects of a drug and how do its benefits compare to, say, losing 30 pounds or going for 10 sessions of therapy? Does an expensive new imaging system or test really provide doctors with critical information?
 To make rational choices, doctors and consumers need the F.D.A. and other agencies to be independent arbiters of not just the safety and efficacy of new drugs and devices, but of their relative medical usefulness and economic viability. Moreover, the medical oversight system needs a new ethic -- one that scrupulously adheres to a standard that says its studies and decisions have been made entirely free of commercial bias and conflicts of interest.
 Sadly, that is very far from the situation today. Drug and device companies sponsor most clinical trials; F.D.A. advisory panels are larded with scientists tied to private companies; corporate user fees help finance the F.D.A. that is conducting reviews; doctors get most of their medical information either from sales representatives of drug companies or corporate-sponsored continuing medical education; and the companies are given primary responsibility for post-marketing safety surveillance of their own products.
 To break these ties, there needs to be an independent arm of F.D.A. that contracts with independent clinicians and scientists for the final testing of all new drugs and medical devices. After a company submits its drug application based on safety and early efficacy trials, this arm would design the protocols to learn not just if the new drug is effective versus a placebo, but how it compares to other therapies and how it can be most effectively used. At the same time, the F.D.A. agency would need an adequately financed post-marketing system that would follow through on a drug's safety, using information and financing independent of the drug manufacturers. It should also reimpose the pre-1997 restrictions on direct advertising to consumers, one of the elements that led to vast popularity of Celebrex and Vioxx among arthritis patients. 
 Congress should also set up an independent agency for conducting comparative trials for thousands of existing therapies. This new center, perhaps housed at the National Institutes of Health, would also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of new technologies and finance the work of scientists who want to test older, off-patent medicines for new uses. And it could oversee the creation and updating of clinical practice guidelines free from commercial sponsorship so that hospitals and doctors can base their decisions on objective evidence. 
 This new center could also be the data bank for registration of all clinical trials, whether conducted by the public or private sector. This should include the trials' initial goals, the final results and reasons for stopping the trial if that occurred. 
 The medical profession also has to play a role. It should adopt strict ethics rules that limit the access of drug representatives to doctors' offices, and ban the growing practice by medical institutions of accepting donations from drug makers for continuing-education courses.
 Unless the entire oversight system is overhauled, there will be many more fiascos in which risks or long-term side effects are played down or ignored, as they were with Celebrex and Vioxx. Not until the system of medical approval and information is returned to objective hands will doctors and consumers be able to make the wisest and most cost-effective medical choices.

HEADLINE: Europe Ponders How Best to Trade Stocks

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
As a battle to merge the London Stock Exchange heats up, attention is focusing again on a hotly debated issue: How many stock exchanges does Europe really need? 
 Nearly every country in Europe has an independent stock exchange, but some bankers, politicians and academics have argued for years that these bourses would be better able to compete against their powerful peers in the United States, and offer improved service to European companies and banks, by joining forces. 
 On Monday, the London Stock Exchange said it had received an ''approach'' from the pan-European exchange Euronext, after days of speculation, and fast on the heels of a buyout offer from Deutsche Borse. No details were provided about any contacts with Euronext, and the London exchange said discussions were at an early stage and therefore did not require a response. 
 Euronext, which incorporated the Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels bourses in the only large-scale Continental merger so far, was expected to top the Deutsche Borse's $2.6 billion offer, but it was not expected to deliver a firm offer until after the first of the year. Executives from the London exchange said they were talking to both would-be buyers. 
 Some bankers are hoping that any deal could start a new wave of exchange alliances in the region. Analysts say there are compelling economic reasons for these deals, but no consensus on a preferred number of European exchanges has emerged.
 ''Anything less than a duopoly is bad, but how many more exchanges than two are necessary to ensure there is enough competition is an open question,'' said Richard Berliand, head of futures and options trading at J.P. Morgan Chase. Users of the London exchange, like J.P. Morgan, are hoping to find a balance between enough competition to keep their fees down, and enough consolidation to keep back-office costs down.
 Despite London's becoming the de facto banking capital of Europe, nearly every capital on the Continent, from Athens to Helsinki to Warsaw, is home to an independent stock exchange. Many of these use different, often local, clearing and settling procedures, causing the fees on stock transactions to be several times their United States' equivalents. 
 Nonetheless, companies in Europe are increasingly turning to equity issues for financing instead of bank loans, and retail investors are putting more of their savings into stocks. As of November, more than 9 trillion euros of stock had traded hands in 2004 on the European exchanges, according to the Federation of European Securities Exchanges. The London Exchange was by far the most active, with about 3.8 trillion euros ($5 trillion) worth of trading in that time frame, followed by Euronext and the Deutsche Borse.
 European stock exchanges are ''becoming more and more important to the economy as time goes by,'' said James McAndrews, a vice president for research at the New York Federal Reserve Bank who has looked closely at the issue of European exchange consolidation. These stock exchanges ''should have costs that are competitive with other institutions around the world,'' he said. 
 Four years ago, a merger between the London Stock Exchange and the German exchange was blocked by the investment banks and brokerage firms that owned the London bourse at that time, in part because of political concerns about Frankfurt's appearing more powerful than London. 
 Now, though, many of these investment banks and brokerage firms in London have less influence on the outcome of any consolidation talk, as many sold their stakes in the London Stock Exchange after it went public in 2001. 
 Instead, the asset managers and mutual fund shops that bought these shares may ultimately help decide what the exchange landscape will look like in Europe. And, so far, many of them are behind a deal. 
 To date, ''xenophobia and politics'' have prevented deals from getting done, said Bryan Johnston, director of investment management at Bell Lawrie White in Edinburgh, which has more than $:14 billion ($27 billion) in assets under management, including London Stock Exchange shares. 
 ''I don't give a damn what color the bus is, as long as it goes in the right direction,'' Mr. Johnston said about the ownership of any exchange on which he buys his shares. ''Efficiency of service and value for money are what we're concerned with.''

HEADLINE: Bank of America Creates $100 Million Housing Fund

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
In his latest appearance aimed at drumming up support among black voters as he heads into an election year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg chose a Harlem cooperative project yesterday as the backdrop to announce a $100 million initiative to create 3,000 apartments citywide over the next five years.
 The money is being made available through a revolving loan fund set up by the Bank of America, which said it would finance construction of cooperative apartments, typically priced from $120,000 to $250,000. The apartments will be sold to applicants with moderate incomes, generally $40,000 to $60,000 for a family of four, according to city officials.
 Emily A. Youssouf, president of the city's Housing Development Corporation, which is providing an additional $10 million for the initiative, said her agency had developed 8,000 moderately priced housing units since Mr. Bloomberg took office in January 2002, many of them with the help of private financing similar to that offered by Bank of America. 
 In making the announcement at Madison Plaza in Harlem, the site of a co-op project financed by the housing development agency, Mr. Bloomberg digressed from the theme of moderately priced homes for a moment to offer a paean to what he described as a renaissance in the unofficial capital of black America. 
 ''Harlem is one of the great success stories in this city,'' he said. ''There are two new hotels being built on 125th Street, there are stores opening all the time. This is a neighborhood where the schools are getting better and crime is coming down. The future for Harlem really is very bright.''
 It was one of about a half dozen appearances in Harlem by the mayor in recent weeks, and was part of a series of events intended to court middle-class voters throughout the city as Mr. Bloomberg begins his campaign for re-election in 2005.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican who garnered about 22 percent of the black vote in 2001, is seeking to enhance his standing among black voters to make inroads into this traditional Democratic base. Recent polls have shown that the mayor's approval rating among blacks continues to hover below 40 percent, but the two black candidates who have announced their intention to run for mayor, the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, and City Councilman Charles Barron, have lagged behind other Democratic hopefuls in terms of fund-raising.
 During an appearance this month at Memorial Baptist Church, Mr. Bloomberg was greeted with a chorus of ''amens'' after he talked tough about cracking down on disruptive students in city schools. 
 Yesterday, he sounded a variation of what has become his personal responsibility theme, saying, ''If you want to own a home, you're going to have to be responsible, you're going to work hard, you're going to save, just like everybody else in this country does that.'' 
 In promoting development in Harlem, however, the mayor has had to guard against being seen as a force of gentrification, which carries negative connotations for a community worried about losing its identity. Lucille L. McEwen, the president of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement, said it had become ''more and more difficult to create affordable housing because Harlem is hot.''
 ''A vacant lot is now $300,000 to $500,000,'' she said.
 Mr. Bloomberg sought to assuage concerns that rising real estate costs would disrupt the community, saying that the $100 million loan fund by Bank of America is intended to provide an affordable path to homeownership for current Harlem residents, upon whom he lavished praise.
 ''They're the ones that to a great extent have been improving the neighborhood,'' he said. ''Remember, they're the ones that are working with the police, they're the ones that are making their children go to school, they're the ones that are saying, 'I want a good neighborhood and I'm going to do something about it.'''

HEADLINE: Dollars for Democracy?: U.S. Aid to Ukraine Challenged

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Russian leaders, many Ukrainians and even some members of Congress are asking whether the $58 million the United States spent to promote democracy in Ukraine over the past two years was actually intended to oust the government there.
 The Bush administration insists that its effort to influence the conduct of the Ukrainian election is nonpartisan. Government officials say the political training programs Washington has sponsored in Ukraine are no different from those in a dozen other countries in recent years.
 But teaching the principles of democracy to citizens in a semi-authoritarian system may, on its face, work to empower the government's opponents. 
 Government officials and contractors working in Ukraine say the projects Washington subsidizes -- energizing disenfranchised voters, training student activists, setting up communication networks among nongovernmental organizations -- tend to educate and empower the opposition and work to the disadvantage of pro-government parties. 
 ''It has become particularly tricky to walk a very thin line,'' acknowledged Leslie J. McCuaig, Ukraine project director for the Institute for Sustainable Communities, a Vermont-based organization with branches in Russia and Ukraine. 
 The institute has an $11 million federal contract to help bring about a ''fundamental cultural shift'' in Ukraine, as the organization puts it, ''from a passive citizenry under an authoritarian regime to a thriving democracy with active citizen participation.''
 Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia charged that United States government contractors were meddling in Ukraine and had been involved in ''gross violations'' of Ukrainian law by working for the opposition candidate, Viktor A. Yushchenko -- even though Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, campaigned openly for the government-backed candidate, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich. 
 At the same time, two members of Congress, a Democrat and a Republican, are calling for a federal investigation of government spending in Ukraine, saying the money was spent for partisan purposes.
 Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, complained in a statement to the House International Relations Committee this month that the administration had ''sent U.S. taxpayer dollars into Ukraine to influence the outcome.''
 ''Much of that money was targeted to assist one particular candidate,'' Mr. Paul said, ''and through a series of cutout, nongovernment organizations -- both American and Ukrainian -- millions of dollars ended up in support of'' Mr. Yushchenko. 
 Mr. Paul called for an investigation, as did Rep. Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, who said he believed that government contractors had helped instigate the popular uprising that began on election day. 
 And Kent R. Hill, an assistant administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, the office that administers the political aid to Ukraine, said he believed that the emotionally charged period after the runoff election for president last month had a peculiar dynamic that made it appear that the United States had taken sides. 
 ''Our guidelines make it perfectly clear that we are not allowed to favor particular candidates,'' Mr. Hill said in an interview. 
 ''But during the election crisis our support for free and fair elections was twisted'' by others, he said, who implied that ''we must be partisan, for Mr. Yushchenko,'' because he, too, was calling for free and fair elections.
 Adrian Karatnycky, a Ukranian-American program officer for Freedom House, a government contractor that has been the specific object of Russian ire, says the problem runs deeper. 
 He said most of the people drawn to the organization's programs in Ukraine ''have liberal values, because they are fed up with corruption, fed up with intimidation and want to defeat them.''
 The federal government spent $97 million on aid to Ukraine in the fiscal year that ended Oct. 31 for a broad range of social and political projects. About $28 million of that was spent on what the agency calls democracy projects. 
 Some of that money was devoted to political-party development and was offered by the International Republican Institute and its Democratic counterpart, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, to any political party that showed an interest. Both government-financed institutes promote democracy worldwide.
 Kenneth Wollack, president of the Democratic Institute, said Ukrainian pro-government parties had availed themselves of the training, but ''not so much.'' They are ''more insular,'' he said. Opposition parties, he said, ''are more likely to seek assistance from international organizations.''
 Mr. Hill, the federal agency official, acknowledged that pro-government party officials who do show up at American-financed political seminars often come ''as much for intelligence-gathering purposes, to see what the West is doing.''
 A significant portion of the democracy money is being spent to train nongovernmental organizations ''to use election cycles to advocate their agendas,'' as a federal government document says. 
 Contractors say few if any government officials or pro-government party officials show up for such training sessions. In fact, the contractors acknowledged, nearly all of the seminars and programs are intended to train people outside the government to be more effective at dealing with a balky, sometimes autocratic government.
 ''Are we overtly partisan?'' Mr. Karatnycky asked. ''I would say no.''
 Aleksander Maric, who was a leader of a Serbian youth group that was involved in the popular uprising that helped drive Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, from power in 2000, worked with Ukrainians as part of a Freedom House program.
 Mr. Maric was quoted as saying in a Radio Free Europe report on Monday: ''We trained them to set up an organization, how to open local chapters, how to create a 'brand,' how to create a logo, symbols and key messages. We trained them how to identify the key weaknesses in society and what people's most pressing problems were.'' 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, responding to Mr. Lavrov's accusations against Freedom House and other contractors earlier this month, said the administration was ''pleased'' to pay for their work, ''for the purpose of making sure that all sides have an opportunity to express their view.''

HEADLINE: Yukos Sale Deepens Investor Doubts

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND and JAD MOUAWAD; Erin E. Arvedlund reported from Moscow for this article and Jad Mouawad from New York. Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Moscow.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
It took less than six minutes on Sunday to drive Russia back in time.
 After successfully luring billions of dollars from foreign investors who believed that capitalism was finally making strides in Russia, Moscow switched directions on Sunday with a snap auction to dismantle the oil giant Yukos that set off criticism both at home and abroad.
 The sale of the largest subsidiary of the country's top oil producer was hardly a fair and open process, some Russians said. Stanislav A. Belkovsky, president of the National Security Institute in Moscow, said on Monday that it was ''just a deal for the redistribution of property by a criminal group with a mission to get control over the basic financial flows of the country, just as in the 1990's.''
 Not long ago, Mr. Belkovsky was closely aligned with the Kremlin, but he has since turned into an ardent critic. As for President Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Belkovsky added, ''We should view him this way: as the chief of this criminal group.'' 
 Even state television mocked the proceedings, suggesting that the sale of the Yukos unit Yuganskneftegas to an unknown entity for $9.35 billion was stage-managed. Now, despite Mr. Putin's promise of a fair and transparent handling of the Yukos affair, the latest example of the Kremlin's strong-arm business tactics threatens to scare investors away.
 Russia has increasingly been seen as an alternative to Middle Eastern countries for new sources of crude oil. And the country has re-emerged from its post-cold-war slump as one of the world's top oil producers, running neck and neck with Saudi Arabia. Western companies like BP, ConocoPhillips and Total have all made significant investments to acquire a foothold.
 But as a result of the Kremlin's treatment of Yukos over the last 14 months, business sentiment toward Russia has been changing, with capital flows moving out of the country as the perception of the risk of doing business has increased. 
 J. Robinson West, the chairman of PFC Energy, a company based in Washington that advises oil companies, said the mystery shrouding the Yukos auction would add to malaise in the Russian business environment.
 ''Right now this whole business is causing alarm to investors,'' Mr. West said.
 The Yukos subsidiary auctioned on Sunday pumps a million barrels of oil a day, about 11 percent of the country's total production -- more than OPEC oil producers like Qatar or Indonesia. It was auctioned to pay for part of the $27.5 billion in taxes the government has claimed that Yukos owes. 
 Even on Monday, little information surfaced about the winning bidder, Baikal Finans Group, a company registered in a provincial Russian town. Meanwhile, the largest auction in the country's post-Soviet history has thrown Russia's commitment to transparency and legal due process into doubt.
 ''We think the case has eroded Russia's reputation as a place to do business and eroded confidence in Russia's legal and judicial institutions,'' a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, told reporters at a news conference on Monday.
 For some, the Kremlin is only stepping in to correct the chaotic privatization process of the 1990's, when important Russian industries were sold at discounted prices to politically connected groups under murky circumstances. Now, Mr. Putin is seeking to regain control over some of the assets.
 ''Russia is acting like any oil producer with a strong dependency to oil revenue,'' said Robert Mabro, chairman of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. ''You've got to compare Russia to other oil producers like Iran or Saudi Arabia, not democracies like Denmark or Holland. After 80 years of communism, you don't turn into a liberal democracy overnight. That's a romantic notion that has no historic foundation.'' 
 But in Russia, where criticism of Mr. Putin and the Kremlin is rare, the auction seemed so orchestrated that a lawmaker, Dmitri Rogozin, the leader of the nationalist Rodina Party, which has had close ties to the Kremlin, called on Monday for an investigation. 
 ''We suspect that the auction was not organized in a transparent manner,'' Mr. Rogozin said. 
 The latest twist in the Yukos affair cast in sharp relief all the contradictions of the country's transition to capitalism under Mr. Putin.
 ''It should be clear to even the most Pollyannaish analyst that this is not a one-off example of political deviance,'' said Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting company based in New York. ''There's no question that Russia has moved closer to the Saudi model than to the American model.''
 Despite the heavy-handed tactics, the Russian sale did not happen in an international void. A bankruptcy court in Houston last Thursday issued an injunction barring Gazprom, Russia's natural gas monopoly, and its lenders from participating in the auction.
 Gazprom, which was widely expected to snap up Yuganskneftegas, never even submitted a bid on Sunday, mainly because Deutsche Bank backed out at the last minute after the injunction. 
 Baikal applied as a bidder only on Friday -- a day after the injunction -- and it was not named in the Yukos petition.
 If Baikal does not pay, the government, by default, takes over Yuganskneftegas, according to Aleksander Buksman, head of the Moscow department of the Russian Justice Ministry. In addition, the payment day has become increasingly flexible: the buyers now have until Jan. 11, not Jan. 2, Interfax quoted Mr. Buksman as saying. 
 Oil industry analysts said Baikal was probably a shell company. In time, a Kremlin-approved energy company like Gazprom or Surgutneftegas, two of the few Russian oil companies with enough cash to venture a billion-dollar bid without outside financing or bankers, will emerge as the true owner. 
 In his second term, Mr. Putin has turned away from economic reforms such as deregulating energy prices and ridding business of endemic corruption. Instead, he has moved to consolidate the Kremlin's hold over strategic sectors like energy or telecommunications.
 ''Russia is one of the most gray countries in the world,'' Mr. Bremmer of Eurasia said. ''There are some sectors of the economy that are booming and you have this tremendous undermining of the rule of law impacting key industries like energy or telecoms. Even if you're a BP and you thought you were big enough, this is a problem. You can get hurt.''
 Until Sunday's bizarre auction, investors were looking forward to the end of the Yukos affair, hoping a state-run process would bring finality to the year-long prosecutorial attack against the company.
 Instead, new uncertainty looms about who owns some of the most valuable energy assets in Russia, and whether they will end up in the hands of new and powerful business elites or simply revert to the state, which could again try to fold the assets into Gazprom.
 ''We were hoping for unpleasant certainty, as opposed to what we have now, which is prolonged uncertainty,'' said William Browder, who runs the Hermitage Fund in Moscow.
 Now, Mr. Browder said, the Yukos assets could end up in the hands of Kremlin bureaucrats. ''That would the transfer of enormously valuable assets,'' he said, ''to another group of rich guys, which means Russia hasn't evolved from crony oligarch days of past. That would be a major step back for Russia.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Lobby Quietly Tackles Social Security

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
As President Bush prepares to disclose the details of his plan to funnel hundreds of billions of dollars of future Social Security funds into privately held investment accounts, Wall Street has begun a muted lobbying campaign, chastened by bolder forays that failed in years past.
 So far, the chief executives of most financial firms have refused to take a public stand in support of private accounts, wary of being seen as too eager to embrace a potential new revenue stream.
 At last week's White House economic meeting in Washington, they were conspicuous in their absence from the Social Security panel. Even in direct meetings with President Bush, who actively campaigned on the issue of Social Security, executives have shied away.
 There are signs, however, that the industry is becoming a little more aggressive in pushing for private accounts, through a loose assemblage of trade associations, business coalitions and conservative research centers. These groups have lately begun trying to raise money from business interests and to marshal support on Capitol Hill, while also seeking to deflect criticism that Wall Street is behind the move simply to reap rich rewards for administering the accounts. 
 The first salvo was fired by the Securities Industry Association, which recently issued a research report arguing that the private accounts would not be a financial bonanza for Wall Street. 
 In the paper, the association calculated that firms would collect at least $39 billion in fees, and perhaps considerably more, from managing such accounts over the next 75 years. 
 But the group noted that the fees charged would be significantly below the fees that investment firms receive these days from low-cost mutual funds.
 And even if the fees rose significantly as more people chose actively managed accounts, the association's report argued, they would still pale in comparison with the $3.3 trillion in revenues Wall Street firms are projected to earn from their core securities business over that period. 
 The Investment Company Institute, the lobbying arm for the mutual fund industry, has not endorsed private accounts nor has it lobbied Congress on the matter. But while its members are reluctant to speak out publicly on the topic, the institute recently hired as its communications director F. Gregory Ahern, a former executive at State Street Corporation in Boston who was involved in that firm's aggressive lobbying effort for private accounts during the late 1990's. 
 Behind the scenes, the Alliance for Worker Retirement Security, a business coalition advocating private accounts, has begun meeting with Congressional and White House staff members, pushing the idea that private accounts are not only good for the country but also good for business.
 In November, Derrick A. Max, the alliance's executive director, met with Charles P. Blahous, a special assistant to the president who has been at the forefront in the White House on Social Security. They have a strong connection, because Mr. Blahous preceded Mr. Max at the alliance.
 At the meeting were representatives from the Securities Industry Association, Charles Schwab & Company, and the United States Chamber of Commerce, all members of the alliance.
 The Club for Growth, a group financed largely by conservative business leaders that supports like-minded Congressional candidates, has also been active in the drive for privately held Social Security accounts. Members include Richard Gilder of Gilder Gagnon Howe & Company, a private investment firm, and Charles H. Brunie, the founder of Oppenheimer Capital.
 The club, which is run by Stephen Moore, who once served as economic adviser to the former House Republican Leader Dick Armey, recently sent out a memorandum to its backers proposing a $15 million public relations and grassroots campaign in favor of private accounts.
 This increase in activity is occurring against the backdrop of a long-running campaign by the Cato Institute, a Washington policy research and lobbying organization with libertarian leanings that has received financial support from, among others, American Express and the American International Group, the large insurance company. State Street also provided funds in the past to support the institute's efforts to persuade Congress of the merits of personal accounts. 
 Opponents of personal accounts, led by labor unions and some state pension funds, accuse these groups of acting as a stalking horse for the financial industry.
 ''Our sense is there is a lot of activity behind the curtain,'' said Bill Patterson, the director of the office of investment at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''There is a dangerous confluence between the industry and the ideologues of the right. These groups can't do it by themselves -- they need the covert and overt support of the financial services industry.''
 Faced with such criticism, the financial industry has become particularly sensitive about how it approaches the issue of allowing individuals to invest some of their Social Security contributions in private accounts. 
 Unlike dividend and capital-gains tax cuts -- White House policies that were loudly applauded by Wall Street -- personal accounts are expected to come with strings attached, requiring an industry that has always been skeptical of intervention in the markets to work under the supervision of government- appointed trustees. 
 Many top Wall Street executives are strong supporters of President Bush and are philosophically in agreement with the idea of applying the independence of the capital markets to the Social Security program. They have raised millions of dollars in campaign contributions: Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch were among the top corporate supporters of the president's re-election campaign, raising over $1 million combined, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks political contributions and campaign spending.
 Yet as executives of large and visible institutions, they are leery of attracting political criticism from opponents of the private accounts, and also are concerned that administering millions of small accounts may well be a money-losing proposition. 
 Indeed, when asked whether they support private accounts, officials from Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Vanguard and Fidelity all declined to discuss the issue.
 Under the most widely discussed plans under consideration, personal accounts would be created by allowing workers to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into investment accounts set aside in their name. At first, individuals would be offered a limited range of investment vehicles, mostly low-cost indexed funds. After a time, account holders would be given the option to upgrade to actively managed funds, which would invest in a more diverse range of assets with higher risk and potentially larger fees.
 Because Social Security taxes are used to pay benefits to current retirees, nearly all the plans envision the government borrowing as much as $2 trillion to fill the gap created by diversion of some payroll taxes. Proponents argue that the borrowing would pay for itself over the long run because the accounts, if they generated a higher return, would help reduce or eliminate the future obligations of the Social Security system.
 Some specialists on Wall Street, however, are worried that adding to the budget deficit by such a large amount over the next couple of decades might put upward pressure on interest rates, a move that would not be helpful to the stock market. And with tens of millions of small accounts to handle, industry executives say they see little room for profit after administrative costs are subtracted. 
 Whatever the ultimate benefit, Wall Street's top executives worry that any visible lobbying campaign on their part could well do more harm than good for President Bush's cause.
 ''There has been no lobbying because the industry knows it will be accused of making windfall profits,'' said Robert C. Pozen, the chairman of MFS Investment Management and a member of the White House-sponsored commission in 2001, led by the New York Senator Daniel P. Moynihan and Richard Parsons, chief executive of Time Warner, that developed several alternative plans for establishing private Social Security accounts.
 Despite that accusation, Mr. Pozen argued, the program will not be the windfall its critics claim.
 ''The accounts are so small,'' he said, ''that the vast majority of firms would not want to touch them. It's just not a bonanza for the industry.'' There are already signs that political opponents are lining up to tar the White House proposal by linking it to Wall Street greed. Last week, John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, sent a letter to 46 financial companies, including Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Fidelity, asking them to publicly disavow the creation of personal accounts. 
 In the letter, Mr. Sweeney cited the example of State Street, which in 2002, under pressure from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., reversed a position it long held that private accounts were the best means to address the long-run financing squeeze on Social Security. The firm changed its position after its former chief executive, Marshall Carter, retired. Mr. Carter had set himself apart from his peers by advocating the accounts through speeches and by co-writing a book supporting them with William G. Shipman, another former State Street executive.
 State Street's experience and the unsuccessful effort in 2002 by an industry group, the Coalition for American Financial Security, are among the main reasons Wall Street has been so reluctant to assume a bolder approach in pushing for the accounts. 
 ''I think the backlash occurred at two levels,'' said Sylvester Scheiber of Watson Wyatt, a corporate benefits and financial consulting firm that was a member of the coalition. ''There was pressure from clients and the press has been negative toward them. These folks are very image conscious and they don't want to be branded as 'make a buck at any price.''' 
 Still, while refraining from pushing the issue directly, firms like Merrill Lynch have taken a more oblique tack. For years now, Merrill Lynch has run ads about the virtues of retirement saving (with no mention of private accounts) in the back pages of Roll Call, a small newspaper that closely follows Congressional activities and is read avidly by members of Congress. 
 In keeping with their low profile, Wall Street executives have been wary about discussing the issue even in private. Last month, at a meeting with President Bush at the White House, Philip J. Purcell, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, and his counterparts, E. Stanley O'Neal of Merrill Lynch and Henry M. Paulson Jr. of Goldman Sachs, were among a group that discussed the state of the economy and the markets.
 But none of the participants, according to a person who was briefed on the session, opened the topic of private Social Security accounts.

HEADLINE: Corporate Misconduct vs. Criminal Behavior

BYLINE: By Leonard Orland. 
Leonard Orland, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, is the author, most recently, of ''Corporate Criminal Liability: Regulation and Compliance.''

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
ELIOT SPITZER'S ongoing investigation into wrongdoing in the insurance industry has had an undeniable impact. But as companies like Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance brokerage, struggle to satisfy the demands of Mr. Spitzer, the New York attorney general, it is worth asking whether his ends justify his means.
 In the case of Marsh, Mr. Spitzer essentially forced the board to dismiss its chief executive, Jeffrey Greenberg, to avoid corporate criminal indictment. The sequence of events raises serious questions about the use (and potential misuse) of prosecutorial threats to a corporation and whether Mr. Spitzer's powers should be curtailed. 
 In October, Mr. Spitzer filed a civil complaint that accused Marsh of securities fraud and bid rigging. Mr. Spitzer also hinted at the possibility of a criminal indictment for the company unless Marsh's board ousted Mr. Greenberg. 
 The hint could be perceived as a threat. At a news conference announcing the civil complaint against Marsh, Mr. Spitzer declared: ''The leadership of that company is not a leadership I will talk with. It is not a leadership I will negotiate with.'' In no uncertain terms, Mr. Spitzer advised the Marsh board to ''think long and hard, very long and hard, about the leadership of your company.''
 Less than two weeks later Marsh's chief executive resigned, and the board appointed a new one. Mr. Spitzer was pleased, declaring that the action ''permits Marsh and this office to move toward a civil resolution of our lawsuit.'' Mr. Spitzer reached this conclusion without the benefit of a comprehensive civil settlement, while the deposed Mr. Greenberg has not been charged with wrongdoing.
 Mr. Spitzer's tactics may be effective. The corporate community, chastened by the demise of Arthur Andersen after it was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2002, has shown itself to be willing to accede to prosecutorial demands to avoid indictment. But when a state prosecutor uses criminal law, enacted for far different objectives from corporate law, to institute corporate change, it should be cause for concern.
 That concern is increased when the prosecutor insists that a corporation change its management to avoid indictment. A system that leaves decisions about corporate management in the hands of prosecutors instead of shareholders is far from ideal.
 There are additional disquieting questions concerning Mr. Spitzer's methods. Apart from the question of whether a state attorney general should be asserting prosecutorial power over corporations with national and international operations, it is important to examine the array of legal doctrines asserted by Mr. Spitzer.
 In its complaint, the state declared that its enforcement power derived from its interest in ''the economic health and well-being of those who reside in or transact business'' in New York as well as its interest in upholding the rule of law. The suit also cites the doctrine of ''parens patriae'' (meaning ''parent of his country''), which asserts the power of the state to protect its citizens. Finally, the suit cites the authority derived from two New York statutes -- the state securities law and the state antitrust law. In the past, Mr. Spitzer has used these statutes in both criminal and civil enforcement actions.
 This use of criminal and broad civil enforcement power contrasts with more limited powers available to or asserted by Mr. Spitzer's counterparts in other states. Most attorneys general have or use only civil enforcement. If they uncover criminal wrongdoing, they refer the matter to state or federal criminal prosecutors.
 This prudent approach avoids the core problem underlying the Marsh case -- the unseemly threat of criminal prosecution to advance a civil litigation. Mr. Spitzer's conduct suggests that it is time to think about a legislative solution that would divest New York's attorney general of criminal enforcement power.
 There is no reason to believe that federal and state prosecutors would not vigorously pursue criminal wrongdoing uncovered by state attorneys general. The federal grand jury, in particular, is a powerful investigative resource.
 In addition, after the extraordinary episodes of corporate wrongdoing at Enron, Arthur Andersen, WorldCom and other companies two years ago, Congress enacted a broad range of reforms under the expansive reach of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The impact of that statute on corporate governance has been the subject of spirited public debate. But surely reliance on federal and state corporate law is preferable to forcing changes in the boardroom through the threat of corporate criminal indictment.

HEADLINE: A Comedians' Union? Imagine the Meetings

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
So a comic walks into a bar, does a set and still can't feed his kids. Or his pets. Or his pets' kids. So what does he do? He gets a lawyer, forms a coalition and threatens to strike. 
 Hello? Is this thing on? 
 Seriously, folks, you can't make this stuff up. Hardened by decades of low wages and even lower self-esteem, some 300 New York comedians have decided to unite to ask the city's comedy clubs for, well, a little respect. (Oh, and more pay.) 
 Two weeks ago, the group, the New York Comedians Coalition, sent a letter to the owners of 11 clubs around the city, asking for $120 for a 10 to 20 minute set on the weekends, up from the current average of $60. They are also seeking a small increase in weekday pay, which runs about $15 to $25 a set, as well as holiday pay for regulars. M.C.'s, who introduce acts and plug the audience for information (''So, where you from?''), would make upward of $200 for a weekend gig under the coalition's plans, as opposed to the current industry rate of $75 to $125. 
 ''Comics have been making the same wage essentially since 1985,'' said Ted Alexandro, one of the coalition's founders and a regular performer on the city's comedy circuit. ''And the revenue being created is outrageous.'' 
 In particular, Mr. Alexandro and his comedic colleagues point to the clubs' practice of charging covers and an enforced two-drink minimum, a policy that makes it almost impossible for weekend audiences to escape without spending at least $30 a head. Comedians say that when you add in lucrative special shows for corporate events, proms and bachelor parties, the clubs are killing (the comics' patois for doing well). 
 Club owners aren't so sure. ''It's an extremely competitive market,'' said Chris Mazzilli, the owner of the Gotham Comedy Club on West 22nd Street. ''You've got clubs in Midtown handing out free tickets and pulling people in off the street. We're charging $15. That can make it tough.'' 
 But workanight comedians say the rates in city clubs pale to what they can make doing longer sets on college campuses or headlining in other cities. ''I could do 30 shows in town and make $800,'' said Ben Bailey, a 34-year-old comic with a wife and a cat at home. ''Or I could work the road and do eight shows and make $2,000. There's no comparison.'' 
 Many club owners hope there's some room for compromise, especially in a close-knit industry where tough crowds have hardened owners and comedians alike. Mr. Mazzilli, a former comedian himself, has agreed to raise his weekend rate to $75 and will meet with the coalition after the New Year to see if a bigger raise can be arranged. The Comedy Cellar, the venerable club in Greenwich Village, has added acts and also raised its rate to $75. 
 Cary Hoffman, the owner of Stand Up New York, on West 78th Street, which pays $60 a set on the weekends, says he, too, will meet with the comedians, but says he isn't sure how much more he can pay. ''The economics are staring me in the face,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''My rent is up, my insurance is up, everything is up. The only thing I can do is try to find some way to raise the money so that I am viable.'' 
 For their part, the comedians say most of the city's club owners have offered to talk and Mr. Alexandro said plans for a possible work stoppage have been put on hold unless talks on pay break down. (Health insurance? No one's even going there.) 
 Russ Meneve, another coalition founder and a regular at clubs like Caroline's in Midtown and Comic Strip on the Upper East Side, said the increase in base pay is especially important for younger, less established comics for whom making an extra $10 an hour during the week is -- here comes the pun -- no laughing matter.
 ''For newer and development acts, that money means a lot to them,'' Mr. Meneve said. ''But believe me, it helps me as well.''

HEADLINE: Why the Fever in Ukraine? A Few Not-So-Easy Answers

BYLINE: By Steven Lee Myers

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Ukraine's ''orange revolution'' was either a mass outpouring of popular will or the collapse of an enfeebled authoritarian power.
 Or maybe it was the political and judicial maturation of a teenage democracy. Or it was a Western plot concocted in the corridors of American power and carried out with cunning by subversive forces like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. (The latter is the theory favored in parts north and east of here, particularly in the Kremlin.) 
 In reality, the political upheaval and mass demonstrations that ultimately overturned Ukraine's fraudulent presidential runoff last month probably resulted from a mixture of all those things. And by all accounts, Ukraine, alone among the former Soviet republics, had several essential ingredients for democracy that had managed to survive the turmoil of 13 years of halting transition: political competition, judicial independence and, of course, the political activism of voters in a vast swath of the world where apathy typically rules.
 For those optimists who would like to export Ukraine's experience -- and in Russia, Belarus and other former Soviet republics, there are many -- those conditions might take years to develop elsewhere, if ever.
 ''The political trend here is different than in Russia or Belarus,'' said Kalman Mizsei, regional director of the United Nations Development Program, who has worked extensively in Ukraine and other post-Communist nations in Eastern Europe. ''Maybe it's the difference in the fabric of civil society in different countries. Maybe it is hidden, and only emerges in times of extraordinary events.''
 Ukraine holds a new runoff on Sunday, and if the opposition leader, Viktor A. Yushchenko, wins, as expected, it might be tempting to view his triumph as simply the inexorable march of democracy. But there was nothing inevitable about what unfolded after two rounds of voting led to the disputed victory for Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich.
 It might well have turned out differently if President Leonid D. Kuchma, like Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Georgia a year before, had decided to risk bloodshed and international opprobrium by crushing the demonstrations. 
 Mr. Kuchma, whose popularity evaporated after 10 years of economic gains marred by scandal and, at the end, vote fraud, is unlikely to be seen as a hero by many here. Still, faced with protests and uncertain support among the security services, Mr. Kuchma gave up, negotiating a compromise that left Mr. Yanukovich isolated.
 ''I think the explanation is quite simple,'' Mikhail B. Pogrebinsky, the director of the Kiev Center for Political and Conflict Studies who has worked closely with Mr. Kuchma's government, said in an interview on Tuesday. ''A revolution like this would not happen if the power had not decided to leave.''
 The power, however, was given a shove. And the groundwork for that took shape years ago.
 Mr. Yushchenko, a former central banker, served as prime minister under Mr. Kuchma, but after breaking with him, found a political base from which to challenge him. Ukraine's Parliament is hardly a model of legislative ideals, but its rancorous sessions reflected the country's vigorous political blocs.
 The Parliaments in Russia and Belarus, by contrast, have turned into rubber stamps for the executive branch. And the lack of political competition in those countries extends to their presidencies, as well.
 President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus won the right to remain in power indefinitely in a referendum in October. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia won a second term in March against a diminished field of opponents who, like Mr. Yushchenko, faced the overwhelming resources of the state and suffered a lack of coverage on state television.
 The moral and financial support of Europe and the United States has become a lightning rod for criticism here and in Moscow (which spent much more than the Western nations, according to published accounts in Russian newspapers). The Bush administration spent $58 million during the past year on programs intended to cultivate democratic values, but not specifically, United States officials said, the candidacy of Mr. Yushchenko.
 How decisive those grants were is debatable, but one involved, indirectly, what was arguably the most pivotal event in the ''orange revolution,'' and one seemingly unlikely to be repeated in courts elsewhere in the former Soviet Union any time soon.
 The Central European and Eurasian Law Initiative of the American Bar Association, which trains lawyers and judges across the region, spent $400,000 of American money to conduct a series of sessions tutoring Ukraine's judges in election law.
 Among those who took part in the training program were five judges of the Supreme Court, including Anatoly Yarema, who presided over the extraordinary five days of hearings into Mr. Yushchenko's complaint of electoral fraud. On Dec. 3, the Supreme Court overturned Mr. Yanukovich's victory and ordered the new election.
 ''This is the most dramatic example of judicial independence that we've seen in the developing countries'' of Eastern Europe, Homer E. Moyer Jr., a senior partner in the law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington and a co-founder of the association's program, said in a telephone interview, referring to the court's ruling.
 Opposition leaders in Russia and Belarus, some of whom traveled to Kiev to witness the revolution, have looked at Ukraine's experience longingly, seeking lessons to adapt to their own struggle. Ultimately, however, beyond politics and the judiciary, everything depends on the people themselves.
 ''It is a ragged, uneven process,'' Mr. Moyer said when asked what was necessary for a revolution like Ukraine's. ''One of the things that becomes evident is that it's a lot more than adopting new laws and constitutions. We're talking about pretty basic changes in thinking, changes in public expectations, a decrease in public cynicism about its own role.''
 Sergei V. Mitrokhin, a leader of Russia's liberal party, Yabloko, said last week that while Mr. Putin's Kremlin was creating the conditions for a popular uprising, Russians might not yet be suited for a repeat of events here in Kiev.
 ''Instead of an organized protest,'' he said at a news conference in Moscow, ''we will get a traditional Russian riot.''

HEADLINE: More Luxury Apartments From Hotels As Money and Demand Flow Freely

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The 25-story building on Central Park South between Sixth and Seventh Avenues has been a Ritz-Carlton and, most recently, an InterContinental Hotel. Despite its coveted views of the park, though, it struggled as a hotel.
 ''There were problems with the building, and they usually could only rent the rooms with park views,'' said Stephen Glascock, an architect and developer who is the president of Anbau Enterprises, which now owns the structure.
 Mr. Glascock is in the process of converting the nearly 80-year-old building from a 200-room hotel into 65 apartments for permanent residents. 
 The transformation comes at a time when demand for housing in Manhattan is so strong that many owners of hotels are considering the conversion of all or part of their properties to residential use.
 This is happening even as the hotel business is having its best year since 2000. Indeed, so many hotel rooms are being converted that the number available for rent declined slightly in the first nine months of the year.
 According to figures compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm, six of the seven hotel sales in Manhattan this year involved buyers that plan to convert at least part of the buildings to residential use.
 ''It's as simple as the numbers,'' said Arthur Adler, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels, an affiliate of the brokerage and services company. ''In New York and other urban markets, when residential is hot, it is a higher and better use than a hotel.''
 The price for luxury apartments in Manhattan, defined as co-ops and condominiums with prices in the top 10 percent of such sales, reached a high of $1,415 a square foot in the third quarter, PricewaterhouseCoopers reported, citing data from the Douglas Elliman brokerage agency. In hotels -- where operating costs are higher than in residential properties -- the average value is typically less than $1,000 a square foot.
 ''Hotels offer luxury residential developers an attractive alternative to high development costs in prime locations, with zoning in place,'' the report said. ''As a result, many of the landmark hotels that are located on prime real estate are selling at record prices.''
 Among other New York hotels that have been sold in recent years and at least partly converted are the Plaza, Mayflower, Delmonico, Stanhope, Empire and Helmsley Windsor. Others are reported to be on the market.
 ''It is a trend, and it is accelerating because some of these hotels are in very prestigious locations,'' said Louise Sunshine, chief executive of the Sunshine Group, a real estate marketing company. 
 The conversions are occurring even as hotel occupancy has recovered and room rates have risen. The occupancy rate for the third quarter reached 83.5 percent, up 4.7 percentage points from a year earlier. 
 Room rates in the period averaged $191.06 a night, up 13.7 percent from the 2003 quarter, PricewaterhouseCoopers said. And revenue for each room available, an important economic measure in the hotel industry, was up 20.5 percent, to $159.56.
 ''The hotel market is excellent in terms of occupancy,'' said Cheryl Boyer, director of Pricewaterhouse's New York area hospitality practice. ''The business travelers are back, and so are tourists.''
 Nevertheless, the owners of hotels are getting purchase offers from residential developers higher than any hotel operator is likely to make. Ms. Boyer noted that the Plaza Hotel sold for $675 million, or $835,000 a room. Lesser-known properties fetch less lordly prices. The Helmsley Windsor, for example, sold for $225,410 a room.
 Not all owners of hotel properties are in a position to cash in on the conversion boom, said Kevin Mallory, senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis Hotels, a division of the big real estate brokerage and services business. With the exception of the InterContinental, he said, ''you will notice that all the hotels sold or said to be on the market are not branded'' -- not affiliated with a national chain. 
 ''It is much more difficult to convert a branded hotel,'' he said, ''because they have long-term management contracts.''
 The former InterContinental, now known as 110 Central Park South, is undergoing a full conversion to residential use. But in other cases, only parts of the buildings are being sold to individual buyers, leaving hotel operations intact but smaller. For example, the St. Regis plans to sell 31 of its 315 rooms as condo-hotel units to owners, who will occupy them when in New York City; when the owners are away, the rooms will be available to guests and the unit owners will share in the revenue.
 Because it is easier to finance hotel construction if part of a building is sold to apartment owners, the composition of some new projects has been altered. For example, the Ritz-Carlton projects built by Millennium Partners in Battery Park City and on Central Park South have residential units, whose owners can use hotel services. 
 A 19-story hotel building being planned by Thompson Hotels at Houston and Allen Streets on the Lower East Side will have three distinct zones. The lower levels will be a traditional transient hotel, the middle will be condo units for use both by the owners and transient guests, and the top floors will be for permanent residents -- people who want to live in an increasingly trendy part of Manhattan.
 Jason Pomeranc, one of three brothers who operate Thompson Hotels (named for the group's 60 Thompson Hotel in SoHo), said the condo units would be marketed to people who live elsewhere but want a place in the city for part-time use. When the owners are not occupying them, the rooms will go into the hotel pool for rental to decrease the cost of ownership.
 ''A hybrid project makes sense at a time when construction costs are out of hand,'' another brother, Michael Pomeranc, said. ''Selling the units is a subsidy for the hotel.''
 Some august Manhattan hotels -- the Pierre and the Sherry-Netherland, for instance -- have long had permanent residences, real estate executives said. But the appeal of living in a hotel, or at least a building with access to hotel services, seems to be increasing. At Columbus Circle, both the Trump International Hotel and Tower and the new Mandarin Oriental Hotel, part of the Time Warner Center, were developed as hotel-condominiums.
 ''It is a return to the lifestyle of the 1920's when people lived at hotels like the Algonquin and the Carlyle,'' Michael Pomeranc said. More recently, Salvador Dali lived at the St. Regis for the last 10 years of his life, executives there said, and Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio lived there during their brief marriage. And, of course, the fictional Eloise dwelled at the Plaza.
 The temptation to sell can be strong for owners of hotels that are in areas that are already residential or are older and in need of rehabilitation, said Thomas McConnell, a senior managing director of Cushman & Wakefield's hotel group. ''The owners can get a premium of 10 to 20 percent from residential converters,'' he said.
 The building that housed the InterContinental was one that needed rehabilitation, according to Mr. Glascock, who acquired it for $63.5 million. It was completed in 1927 as a residential apartment-hotel known as the Navarro.
 One reason it had not already been converted to residences, like the Essex House and the Hampshire House nearby, is that it sits on land leased from an owner not interested in selling. As a result it will be developed as a co-op, rather than a condominium. Because a co-op owner purchases shares in a building, rather than the apartment itself, as condo buyers do, condominiums command higher prices and are usually more desirable from a developer's point of view.
 In this case, Mr. Glascock said, the co-op rules will be made as much like condo rules as possible, with no board review of sales or sublets.
 ''We establish the co-op board and write the bylaws,'' he said. ''A lot of co-op restrictions will not apply to this building.''
 Mr. Glascock said he was not specifically looking for a hotel to convert when he came across the Central Park South property, but instead for a well-situated building in need of improvement, as he has sought out in other parts of Manhattan. One attraction of the property was that it could be rapidly emptied out for reconstruction. ''A hotel can wind down over 30 days,'' he said. 
 He said the building was being gutted to the frame and outer walls, and new mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems are being installed, along with new elevators. ''We will put it in good shape for the next 100 years,'' Mr. Glascock said. 
 Typical floors will have a mixture of one, two and three-bedroom apartments, with full-floor units on the top three floors. He is adding a floor to have a duplex apartment on the top. A model apartment is expected to be ready in January. One feature of the renovation, he said, would be large kitchens, in contrast to the small kitchens in older conversions.

HEADLINE: Travel Plans

BYLINE: By Patrick Smith. 
Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and a columnist for Salon, is the author of ''Ask the Pilot: Everything You Need to Know About Air Travel.''

DATELINE: Somerville, Mass. 

 BODY:
FROM now until just after New Year's Day, according to the Air Transport Association, almost two million people are expected to travel by plane each day in America. It is fair to say that almost all of them will approach their journey with a measure of angst and trepidation.
 This has always been true of flying, but more so in recent years. The affronts of the typical airplane cabin require little elaboration, from knee-crushing legroom to the indignities of plastic cutlery (that is, if galley service is even available). Meanwhile, the ramifications of war and terrorism, compounded by the spectacle of airport security, spark a fuse of fear in even the most savvy global travelers. 
 Some facts may allay their anxieties. First and foremost, flying is safer than ever. The past three years have been the safest in civil aviation history, with the last serious accident in North America occurring in November 2001. Combined, the 15 largest carriers have more than 14,000 daily departures. Virtually every one of them arrives without incident.
 Such statistics may induce boredom, but they may provide some comfort to the passenger wedged into the middle seat in Row 39, elbow to elbow with a pair of unshowered strangers while a harried flight attendant, her wages halved by a bankrupt airline, explains she's out of orange juice. He may also be consoled by the knowledge that his ticket was a bargain. Average prices in 2004, in present-day dollars, are the cheapest they have been since 1987. Adjusted for inflation, they are the cheapest in history.
 Driving this reality are carriers like JetBlue, AirTran and Southwest -- streamlined companies whose low operating costs hold fares down. Such airlines are closing in on 30 percent of the domestic market. For employees at the embattled majors, this trend has been excruciating -- a tailspin of furloughs, bankruptcies and eviscerated labor contracts while the upstart opportunists capitalize on the willingness of their young, energetic employees to work for less. Starting pay for pilots at many regional feeders is less than $20,000 per year.
 Few will argue the benefits of inexpensive tickets, but while fares and costs have fallen, so have flyers' expectations. Service standards on American airlines are arguably the worst in the world, though at long last the industry is beginning to realize that profits and an enjoyable flight experience needn't be mutually exclusive. Some low-cost carriers offer innovative perks like organic food. 
 Whether flying has reached its nadir or apex is a matter of perspective. But air travelers might find their experience more pleasurable -- or at least less painful -- if they take a moment to appreciate the opportunities and options at hand. In terms of technology, civil aviation has come magnificently of age, with nearly every major city on earth connected to another in a single swoop (Newark to Singapore, for example, in 18 hours nonstop). At the same time, flying is more egalitarian and affordable than ever.
 The airlines may not lavish their customers with hot towels and a complimentary shoeshine. What they will do, however, is carry them to Atlanta, Charlotte and Denver, to Singapore, Bangkok and Istanbul, at pennies per mile and in close to absolute safety.

HEADLINE: Support for U.S. in Food Dispute

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization ruled yesterday that the European Union's system of registering and protecting regional food names was exclusionary, backing complaints by the United States and Australia and opening the door for growers of Idaho potatoes and Florida oranges to register products in the European Union. 
 A World Trade Organization panel agreed that Europe's ''geographical indications'' regulation discriminates against foreign products, violating global trade rules, United States trade officials said in a statement. 
The European Union, which includes 450 million consumers, will be allowed to keep protections on existing regional and traditional names, including feta cheese, Champagne and Parma ham.
 The ruling means that the Anheuser-Busch Budweiser or Bud beer names, registered in 20 of the 25 European Union nations, cannot be challenged by Budejovicky Budvar, a Czech brewer that claims the name as a translation of Budvar, Anheuser-Busch said. 
 It will also allow United States companies like Kraft Foods and General Mills to market trademarked foods that have names identical to the European Union's geographical indications.
 ''This is a big win for American farmers and food processors,'' the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, said in a statement. ''We brought this case because we believed that, under W.T.O. rules, U.S. farmers, ranchers and other food producers should have the same access to protection for 'geographical indications' as European food producers.''
 In another ruling yesterday, the W.T.O. backed a complaint by the South Korean government that American tariffs on Hynix Semiconductor computer chips violated global trade rules.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. HEAD SAYS EXPANSION PLANS ARE IN JEOPARDY

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said yesterday that he would be willing to jettison ambitious expansion projects, like the Second Avenue subway, if doing so was necessary to save a $17.2 billion plan to keep the existing transit system running in good repair. 
 The chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, said he hoped that state legislators and Gov. George E. Pataki would realize the need to maintain the current system as well as to pay for expansion projects, including the new subway line and a link between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal, but acknowledged that achieving both goals may be impossible.
 In an interview his staff arranged with reporters at the authority's headquarters in Midtown, Mr. Kalikow made clear that his top priority is the authority's five-year core capital program to keep the city's subways, buses and commuter railroads in good condition, particularly if state leaders refuse to raise taxes and fees to support the authority. 
 ''I'm O.K. with that, $17 billion for the state of good repair,'' Mr. Kalikow said. ''I'll accept that. I think they're wrong. I think it's foolhardy and shortsighted, but I would accept that.'' 
 Mr. Kalikow also said that if the state government did not act by early March, $4 billion in federal support for the Second Avenue subway and Long Island Rail Road projects would be jeopardized. 
 While Governor Pataki was on vacation and not available for comment, a spokeswoman, Lynn Rasic, repeated his opposition to raising taxes. ''The governor is an ardent opponent of tax increases and would like to explore other ways of meeting the M.T.A.'s capital needs,'' said Ms. Rasic, declining to discuss what those other ways may be.
 The comments by Mr. Kalikow, the chairman since 2001, were a striking acknowledgment of the political realities facing the authority, which is asking Albany for new revenues to fill a $16 billion gap in the authority's next capital plan, totaling $27.7 billion. They also reflected a new level of urgency from the chairman, who has been pressing for more state help for the system, toward the governor, who controls the authority and appointed Mr. Kalikow.
 Mr. Pataki has declared his support for various capital plans, including a rail link connecting Kennedy International Airport to Lower Manhattan, but neither the governor nor the leaders of the Legislature have gone along with a package of tax increases that Mr. Kalikow proposed. The proposed expansion projects account for about $10 billion in the capital plan. The core capital program would pay for new subway and railroad cars, station maintenance and rehabilitation and other continuing improvements.
 Mr. Kalikow's comments were the latest twist in the tortured history of the Second Avenue subway, a dream of urban planners ever since the same avenue's elevated line was demolished in 1942. Construction on the line was abandoned during the city's financial crisis in the mid-1970's.
 To pay for the authority's capital needs, Mr. Kalikow has proposed tax increases that would provide the authority with about $850 million a year, enough to pay annual debt service on new bonds that would be issued to fill the capital financing gap. But those business, real estate, motor vehicle and fuel taxes could be increased only with authorization from the state. 
 The authority's current five-year capital plan expires next week, on Dec. 31. The proposed plan for 2005 to 2009 is now before the Capital Program Review Board, which includes representatives of the governor, the leaders of the two chambers of the Legislature and the mayor of New York City. 
 Mr. Kalikow has warned that the next year could be similar to 1975, when a financial crisis forced the authority to halt spending on basic maintenance. The system hit its nadir in the winter of 1980-81, when subway service was crippled by widespread equipment failures. 
 ''If we don't have the full $17 billion core program, you can write down, '2005 is the day the system reached its zenith, and is now starting its descent,''' Mr. Kalikow said.
 The person given the most credit for the system's recovery is Richard Ravitch, the authority's chairman from 1979 to 1983, who persuaded Gov. Hugh L. Carey and state lawmakers to pay for a general revitalization of the system. 
 ''Everybody in government in the early 80's had lived through the 70's and knew how really bad it was,'' Mr. Kalikow recalled. ''Our problem is that there's a whole generation of New Yorkers that has now grown up and used the system that don't remember when it was horrible.'' 
 He said that increasing taxes, as the state faces major increases in education and health care spending, would require political will. ''We need to remember that the leaders we have today are no less able, are no less bright, are no less visionary,'' Mr. Kalikow said. ''We need to get them to say, 'Not only do we think it needs to be done, but if there's political capital to be expended, we're willing to expend it.''' 
 The authority's board approved a package of fare and toll increases last week, but that measure affects only the system's operating budget, which is projected to run large deficits starting in 2006. The authority has mounting debt obligations because of a wave of borrowing for capital projects from the 1990's, when the state and city all but eliminated their contributions to the capital budget. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's four representatives on the board voted against the increases. 
 Mr. Kalikow suggested that he was frustrated when Mr. Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said they were unwilling to raise taxes to pay for the authority's capital program. ''I was disappointed, but not surprised,'' Mr. Kalikow said, ''because I know the governor pretty well and I know his abhorrence of taxes.''
 Mr. Kalikow said he and the authority's executive director, Katherine N. Lapp, had been meeting with business leaders to explain the importance of the transit network to the regional economy. ''The system is very delicate, and if we don't support it with these capital plans, it will deteriorate, and it will deteriorate very quickly,'' he said. ''A result of deterioration is rider falloff, and rider falloff in a city of this economic vibrancy will cause havoc on the streets.'' 
 Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban planning group that supports expansion of the region's transportation network, said he was struck by the forcefulness of Mr. Kalikow's remarks about the mass transit system's needs. ''This is a cri de coeur from Peter,'' Mr. Yaro said. ''He came forward with a very bold financing strategy, and he hasn't heard a response from Albany, which isn't atypical.''

HEADLINE: Now Is the Time to Give

 BODY:
Throughout the world, the same tributaries feed national identity -- language, culture, history, institutions. But in the United States, belonging is also nourished by a shared dream, a construct that is central to our politics and collective imagination, to our deepest strivings and most improbable achievements. 
 The American dream is not merely American. It is a dream of immigrants, for whom America is not a birthright but a choice, an often painful one driven by poverty, war or other human tragedy. 
 Nowhere is that choice lived more intensely than in New York City. And nowhere else do dream and reality clash more often and more poignantly. 
 Studies suggest that 40 of every 100 New Yorkers are foreign born. That's the highest figure since the heyday of Ellis Island, and indicates profound challenges -- learning English; accessing medical care; providing housing, education and income; and reuniting families separated not only by oceans but also by impenetrable bureaucracies. Adversity builds character, and the new immigrants evince that. But too much adversity can cause irreparable damage to the human spirit and physical health. New Yorkers must not let that happen to their fellow New Yorkers.
 Since 1912, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has been helping the neediest New Yorkers -- immigrants who might otherwise lose their way, as well as single mothers, the forgotten elderly, the ill and injured and unemployed. The humblest aid, well timed, can make the difference. This year so far, the fund has raised $3.9 million, some half a million dollars less than at this point in last year's drive. The shortfall is that much starker in a year when New York City feasts on high-end giving, like the renovation of the Museum of Modern Art, and when the financial business, the city's signature industry, doles out fat bonuses. To us, it's painful. The central figures of the Christmas story were strangers, in need of shelter, in need of care, in need of baby clothes, even. Now is the time to give to people like that.
 Every cent that is donated to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is distributed to one of seven local charities: the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; the Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; the Children's Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and the UJA-Federation of New York. The Times pays the fund's administrative costs. 
 Please send your check to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245. You may also contribute by using a credit card and calling (212) 556-5851 (Extension 7), or by going online at www.nytimes.com/neediest.

HEADLINE: Administration Offers a Mixed View on Drug Imports

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said Tuesday that commercial importation of some low-cost prescription drugs from Canada might be feasible. But the savings to consumers would be small, it said, and the federal government would have to spend hundreds of million dollars a year to ensure the drugs' safety.
 The administration said in a report to Congress that legalizing imports would probably hurt the development of new drugs for Americans. 
 The report was released amid growing support for laws on importing drugs. Republican proponents include Senators Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Trent Lott of Mississippi; Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota; and Representative Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri, as well as several newly elected members of Congress. 
 Sponsors of bills to legalize drug imports said they would keep pushing for it in the new Congress. 
 ''I never had much confidence that this study was going to be objective,'' said the sponsor of one bill, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota.
 Ms. Snowe said the administration had ''failed to provide any meaningful recommendations'' to Congress.
 The conclusions of the report are generally consistent with studies by the drug industry, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Congressional Budget Office. Many economists and health care experts say importing drugs from countries that control their prices would do little to solve the problem of expensive drugs here. 
 On the other hand, consumer groups like AARP and some drugstore executives, including the chairman of CVS, have said commercial imports would be much safer than the current flood of largely unregulated imports by individuals.
 Even though President Bush, whose administration resisted the idea during his first term, hinted in the presidential campaign that he might soon allow imports from Canada, the report cataloged many reasons they would be risky. Americans could save more, it said, by increasing the use of generic drugs.
 The report, by a 13-member federal panel, ruled out legalizing individual imports of drugs for personal use as unworkable. But it said that commercial imports by wholesalers and pharmacies, under strict regulation, might be feasible.
 ''A commercial importation scheme could be feasible with adequate resources and authorities,'' said the panel, headed by Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona. ''However, it would be extraordinarily difficult to achieve this result if personal importation were legalized.'' 
 Regulating personal imports would cost $3 billion a year, whereas commercial imports could be regulated at an annual cost of several hundred million dollars, Dr. Carmona said.
 The report, from the Health and Human Services Department, said new technology, including tiny radio frequency identification tags, could enhance safety by tracking imports as they moved from overseas to American pharmacies. Some means of importing, like going to Canada to buy drugs, ''may be relatively safe in specific instances,'' and, ''Some individuals may enjoy significant savings,'' the report said.
 But administration officials said the United States must not allow two tiers of regulation, with lower standards for imports than for drugs made here.
 ''Safety should not be sacrificed for affordability,'' said the report, which Congress required in the new Medicare law.
 In a letter sending the report to Congress on Tuesday, the administration said that any legalization plan ''must be limited to commercial importation of a discrete number of high-volume, high-cost prescription drugs'' and that ''Canada is the only country from which importation should be considered at this point.''
 The report provides authoritative estimates of the volume of imports.
 ''Nearly five million shipments, comprising about 12 million prescription drug products with a value of approximately $700 million, entered the United States from Canada alone in 2003,'' it said. The report said that a similar quantity of drugs was coming from the rest of the world, through the mail and couriers.
 In a study this year, the Congressional Budget Office said prices for brand-name prescriptions were, on average, 35 percent to 55 percent lower in other industrialized countries. On Tuesday, the administration said that total savings to consumers from legalizing commercial imports ''would be a small percentage relative to total drug spending in the United States -- about 1 to 2 percent.'' The savings, it said, would be $2 billion to $4 billion a year.
 Generic drugs, which account for slightly more than half of all prescriptions filled in the United States, are less expensive here than in Canada and other countries, the report said. Wholesalers and other middlemen, it added, would mark up prices on imports, so American consumers would not receive the full benefit of differences between the United States and other countries.
 The Commerce Department on Tuesday issued a separate report saying price controls in other countries hurt consumers by reducing the revenues that drug companies need to finance research. The industry has long made similar arguments.
 In the letter to Congress, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans said these safeguards would be needed in any import program:
 Importers must establish pedigrees for imports, documenting the ''chain of custody'' and identifying everyone who handled the drugs. 
 The government should limit ports of entry and distribution channels and should test a sample of imported drugs to confirm safety. 
 Imports should be allowed only from foreign suppliers and wholesalers licensed by the United States.
 The government must not compel drug companies to ship products to the United States from abroad. Without such compulsion, ''drug companies and even foreign governments may decide to restrict exports to the United States.''
 Kathleen D. Jaeger, president of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said of the reports, ''They confirm our view that increasing the use of generic drugs would provide greater savings than importing drugs from foreign countries with price controls.'' 
 Dr. Carmona's report said, ''If consumers were to buy generic products whenever possible and no brand-name equivalents, we estimate savings to be approximately $17 billion'' a year.

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae Shake-Up Puts 2 Board Members in Top Posts

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
For the last two months, Franklin D. Raines and J. Timothy Howard have been the public face of Fannie Mae, testifying before Congress that they thought the company's accounting methods were sound. Now, their jobs are taken over by a team of executives who are respected within the company but who are not well known to outsiders.
 Mr. Raines, who was chief executive and chairman, has been succeeded by two members of the company's board. Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie Mae's vice chairman and chief operating officer, will become the company's acting chief executive. Stephen B. Ashley, a former president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, will become Fannie Mae's acting chairman. 
 Fannie Mae also named another executive, Robert Levin, as its interim chief financial officer, to succeed Mr. Howard, who, like Mr. Raines, was forced out yesterday. 
 ''We are confident in the leadership ability of Dan Mudd and Rob Levin to work with the board,'' said Ann Korogolos, the presiding director of the board's independent members. 
 While the board has retained Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm, to find permanent replacements, industry specialists say that the members of Fannie's interim management team bring different skills to guide the company through perhaps its most challenging period.
 Mr. Mudd joined Fannie Mae in February 2000 after nearly a decade at GE Capital, where he rose through the management ranks. He is known as a straight shooter with in-depth knowledge of Fannie Mae's business. What he lacks, however, are the strong political connections that made Mr. Raines such a powerful force on Capitol Hill. 
 ''Political savvy has not been his expertise. He's basically been invisible at Fannie,'' said Bert Ely, a financial industry consultant who is a critic of the company. ''He's what I call the chief inside guy -- the guy who makes things run every day.
 ''A lot of Fannie's challenge right now is keeping the ship afloat and moving ahead,'' Mr. Ely added, ''and he's better positioned than anybody on the board.''
 Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, added that Mr. Mudd could be effective before Congress. ''He's a very strong, solid player. He knows his stuff.'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said. ''He is also known for being more direct. You don't want any ambiguity as to what is known and what is not known.''
 Mr. Mudd has provided leadership amid economic turmoil before, managing GE Capital's Asia-Pacific division through the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990's. He also was an officer in the United States Marines and was decorated for combat service in Beirut, Lebanon.
 Mr. Ashley, who founded the Ashley Group, a large commercial and residential real estate company with properties in New York and Connecticut, has had significant experience both in mortgage lending and in Washington politics. A former president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group, he testified before a Congressional subcommittee on housing in 1991 in support of Fannie Mae.
 Mr. Levin joined Fannie Mae in 1981 and has spent almost 15 years as an executive vice president, overseeing several of the mortgage company's significant divisions. He also served as a senior vice president for corporate finance.
 Mr. Mudd and Mr. Ashley have contributed to many political candidates, including several Republicans, according to federal election filings. 
 ''It can hardly be overlooked,'' said Jonathan G.S. Koppell, a professor at Yale University who has studied the politics of Fannie Mae, ''that as a Republican Congress is about to undertake a harsh inspection of the company, Fannie Mae is removing Raines and Howard, two men with an apparent preference for Democratic politicians, and elevating Mudd and Ashley, two men who support Republicans.''
 Mr. Ely, the financial industry consultant, said: ''This is just the start of a process of cleaning things up. Fannie Mae has a lot of work ahead.''
 The announcement late last night came after a series of discussions over the last few days as board members debated Mr. Raines's future at Fannie Mae. It came after the company's main regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, demanded significant changes to the company's senior management and threatened to declare that Fannie Mae had failed to meet its capital requirements, people close to the process said.
 Still many said the board should have acted sooner. ''The board rallied around a troubled leader too long instead of moving on,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said. ''Franklin Raines is a very decent human being, but he has lost the legitimacy to lead.''

HEADLINE: Wave Of The Future

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I now admit to having expected the war in Iraq to be won in a matter of months, not years. Saddam's plan to disperse his forces and conduct a murderous insurgency, abetted by his terrorist allies, was a surprise.
 This by no means suggests that President Bush's decision to overthrow a dangerous despotism was a mistake. On the contrary, it was and is the right war (against a genocidal maniac who was gaining strength) in the right place (the Middle East cradle of terror) for the right purpose (to get the Arab street out of the rut of hatred and onto a path to freedom). 
 In return for today's grudging concession of tactical misjudgment, however, I claim this expectation: When and if we discover hidden supplies of germ weapons in Iraq or Syria, and as future confessions reveal the extent of connections between Al Qaeda and Saddam, the legion of war critics will forthrightly admit their certitude was misplaced.
 But more to today's point is our difference of opinion about strategy: I stand with those who believe this war was right and that its sacrifices will be justified by lives saved and tyranny diminished. I disagree with those who opposed the pre-emptive fight from the start or who have lost heart when it dragged on too long and are casting about for scapegoats.
 Here are criteria to measure success or failure in the battle for democracy in the region and the struggles for freedom around the world:
 First, will Iraq stay whole and its people free? 
 The present answer is: We'll see. The only debate in the U.S. now seems to be about whether to raise the number of our troops there to help finish the job; only a small minority is calling for a pullout. We are committed, as we should be, to success; so are the Iraqi Kurds; we'll see how eager the Shiite majority is to end its long Sunni Baathist subjugation.
 Next, has America's huge military engagement in the Middle East helped produce progress toward democracy in Muslim countries where monarchs and dictators now rule?
 Signs are that the answer is yes. At a conference last week in Dubai, Gulf states spoke openly of economic reform and a campaign against corruption, which must have worried oppressive theocrats in Iran. Egypt, Jordan and Morocco are beginning to see glimmers of liberty's light, which embarrasses reactionary Saudis and terrorist Syrians. The groundswell is felt in Asia, where populous Indonesia and Malaysia are showing how Islamic nations can prosper by combating medieval fundamentalism.
 On top of that, America's decision to stay the course after its overthrow of Saddam -- a financial backer of suicide bombers and hero of Palestinian jihadists -- has helped revivify the prospect of peace in the Holy Land after the death of Arafat. Our military activism emboldened Israel to risk withdrawal from Gaza, and should encourage Palestinians to elect a rational state maker next month.
 A final criterion: Is our confidence in the desire of 20 million literate Iraqis to live in relative liberty being reflected in the recent run of elections in the world?
 Australians voted to remain our stalwart ally in Iraq. Afghanistan's voters took their lives in their hands to blaze their trail to a democratic government. Americans voted decisively to endorse our hopes rather than our fears in Iraq. Ukrainian voters refused to let a corrupt regime backed by the power of Russia's Putin deny them their democratic rights; they will most likely assert their independence this weekend. 
 That will mark four straight victories for those we Wilsonian idealists consider the good guys, with two to go next month in Palestine and in Iraq. One election may be sensibly peaceful and the other bloodily courageous, but our Iraqi commitment has strengthened the trend. 
 In 1940, Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote a provocative apologia for fascism titled ''The Wave of the Future.'' President Franklin Roosevelt answered those who believed ''that, for some unexplained reason, tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future -- and that freedom is an ebbing tide. But we Americans know that this is not true.'' 
 Less true now than ever. Once again, America and its allies ensure that freedom is the wave of the future.

HEADLINE: Putin Sheds Some Light on Buyer of a Yukos Unit

BYLINE: By C.J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin offered the first official insight on Tuesday into purchasers of the largest subsidiary of the oil giant Yukos, and suggested that these secretive buyers, as had been suspected, might transfer the assets to other owners.
 ''The shareholders of that company are exclusively private individuals,'' Mr. Putin said in remarks broadcast from Germany, where he is on an official visit. ''But they are individuals who have for many years engaged in the energy business.'' 
 Mr. Putin further hinted that the new owners would not have, or maintain, exclusive control over their rich new holding, as analysts had said. ''As far as I know, they intend to establish certain relationships with other Russian energy companies, which may be interested in this asset,'' he said.
 Speculation has swirled around the identity of the buyers of Yuganskneftegaz, Yukos's top-producing subsidiary, since it was bought Sunday in a six-minute auction by the Baikal Finans Group, a company not heard of until just before the sale. 
 Analysts had almost uniformly said that Baikal, an entity with so little apparent infrastructure that were it not for the two bidders at the auction, it would seem not to exist, was probably a shell company that would be only a temporary owner. 
 They also predicted that Yuganskneftegaz, which pumps about a million barrels of oil a day, would soon be resold in a Kremlin-managed transfer to one of Russia's other energy giants. 
 Elements of this theory were further advanced Tuesday by Mr. Putin's somewhat elliptical confirmation that the Kremlin was aware of the identity of the buyers and of their intentions. 
 Two Russian newspapers, Gazeta and Vedomosti, reported Tuesday that Baikal appeared to be connected to Surgutneftegaz, Russia's fourth-largest oil producer. The two representatives for Baikal who appeared at the auction were both high-level managers at Surgutneftegaz, Vedomosti said.
 Surgutneftegaz, which is regarded as a conservative oil company that does not seek acquisitions, did not answer several phone calls on Tuesday.
 Ronald P. Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital who has covered Surgutneftegaz, said a bid of $9.35 billion ''would go completely against their character.'' He said any role company officials might play would more likely be bidding and then briefly holding the company, to give the Kremlin or other companies time to arrange a final transfer.
 In Washington, the White House expressed disappointment that Russia had proceeded with the auction. ''We had hoped for a solution that would allow for the legitimate enforcement of tax laws, but avoid harming investors, especially American investors,'' said Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman. ''And we have communicated to the Russian government repeatedly that its handling of the Yukos matter could have a chilling effect on the foreign investment in Russia, and affect its role in the global economy.''
 Taken together, the reported role of Surgutneftegaz officials and Mr. Putin's remarks provided a small degree of clarity to a mystery that has sent chills through business circles, and renewed worries about the rule of law and property rights in Russia. I
 Aside from the two representatives at the auction, neither the principals nor the managers of Baikal have shown themselves in public. Claire Davidson, a Yukos spokeswoman, said Yukos had not heard from Baikal. ''We have had no direct contact from the company that apparently won the auction,'' she said. 
 Yukos appeared to have gained traction against the sale last week, when the United States Bankruptcy Court in Houston issued an injunction barring Gazprom, Russia's natural gas giant, from participating in the auction, which it had been expected to do though its own shell subsidiary, Gazpromneft. 
 In a related development, Gazprom announced late Tuesday night that it had approved the sale of Gazpromneft. Analysts read that as a concession that Gazprom's bidding tactic had failed, and that after the court order in Houston, the company realized that it would be vulnerable to legal action that could expose its extensive gas exports to Europe.
 Analysts said Baikal was a back-up holding company whose ownership remained unclear, but the eventual owner of Yukos's subsidiary would still probably be Gazprom, a Kremlin favorite. This view was strengthened when Mr. Putin said China may have a future role in Yuganskneftegaz; China, through a government-controlled petroleum concern, has been collaborating with Gazprom on energy projects.
 Yukos continued to examine its options for challenging the auction, among them suing third parties to the auction for $20 billion in damages. ''We believe the auction should never have taken place,'' Ms. Davidson said. ''We believe the auction is illegal.''
 Russia's legal actions against Yukos include tax cases that have billed the company for billions of dollars and a criminal case against its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. They are widely regarded as driven by a personal animus Mr. Putin feels for Mr. Khodorkovsky, who became politically active after becoming Russia's richest man. 
 Mr. Putin played down the significance of the sale on Tuesday, and said that in his meetings with Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, the subject had not come up. ''This is above all an internal Russian problem,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Sad New Carol: Go Ye From Bethlehem

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, West Bank, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
In the town where Christians believe Christ was born, the Christians are leaving.
 Four years of violence, an economic free fall and the Israeli separation barrier have all contributed to the hardships facing Palestinian Christians in Bethlehem, one of the largest concentrations of Christians in the region.
 An estimated 3,000 Christians in the Bethlehem area have moved abroad since the Palestinian uprising began in 2000, according to Bernard Sabella, an associate professor of sociology at Bethlehem University who has tracked the issue. While some others put the number a bit lower, there is a consensus that 10 percent or more of the Christian population in Bethlehem and two adjoining towns has departed. 
 The continuing exodus has left Christians accounting for only about 21,500 of the 60,000 Palestinian residents in the area, or about 35 percent, according to Mr. Sabella. ''Christians all over the world need to know this reality,'' said Hanna Nasser, a Christian who is the mayor of Bethlehem. ''If there is not a breakthrough in the peace process, this trend will continue. Imagine the town of Bethlehem without Christians.''
 Bethlehem's central square should be packed for Christmas celebrations, but the tourists and pilgrims stopped coming when the fighting began.
 ''For four years there has been no business, no way to earn a living,'' said Saleh Michel, 88, a Catholic.
 For decades Mr. Michel ran a recession-proof family business. His musty souvenir shop, the Bethlehem Oriental Store, is less than 10 paces from one of Christendom's most important shrines, the Church of the Nativity, built on the site where tradition holds that Jesus was born.
 Yet Mr. Michel rarely opens these days, and one of his adult sons has moved to Italy. ''I asked him to stay,'' Mr. Michel recalled. ''He said, 'Then feed me.' He had no choice but to leave and find work elsewhere.''
 The gloom stands in stark contrast to the mood five years ago. Back then, the stone square outside the Church of the Nativity was overflowing with tourists for Christmas and New Year's celebrations. Palestinians were talking up the possibility of statehood in 2000. Pope John Paul II visited in March 2000, helping to fuel a surge in visitors. New hotels were rising to accommodate the crowds.
 ''We all had high hopes,'' said Fayez Khano, 58, who carves olive wood souvenirs in a workshop dusted with flakes of blond wood.
 But today Mr. Khano, a father of three, has a son and a daughter in Dublin, and another daughter who is about to move to the United States.
 ''We depend on our kids to send us money,'' said Mr. Khano, who along with his brother has been crafting Jesus figures and manger scenes at his shop for a quarter-century. ''I want to stay, because I was born here, but my wife is pushing me to leave. If the situation continues I will have to consider it.''
 Arab Christians have been a relatively prosperous minority within Israel and the West Bank, generally well educated and middle class. Many have the advantage of having relatives or other connections abroad, enabling them to move with ease to the United States, Europe or Latin America.
 The Christian emigrants tend to be quite successful and rarely look back. In one striking example, the two main candidates in El Salvador's presidential election in March, the winner, Tony Saca, and the runner-up, Schafik Handal, were both descendants of Catholic Arab families that came from here.
 Bethlehem was more than 90 percent Christian until the middle of the last century. Then the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, begun by Arab states in response to the founding of Israel, brought an influx of Muslim refugees to the Bethlehem area and signaled the start of a demographic shift. But what began as a steady emigration of Christians accelerated into a relative flood with the onset of violence four years ago.
 The Christians, most of them Greek Orthodox or Catholic, have not been directly involved in the fighting but have suffered the consequences.
 In the early days of the uprising, Muslim gunmen in the Bethlehem area took hilltop positions in Beit Jala, which is predominantly Christian. That afforded them a clear firing line at the southernmost part of Jerusalem. When the Israeli military responded, Beit Jala residents found themselves on the front lines of the conflict, and occasionally among its casualties.
 In addition, Israel's separation barrier, a network of concrete walls and electronic fences, is a hulking presence on the edges of Bethlehem, isolating the town from Jerusalem and further choking off the economy and driving people away. 
 Trying to stem the outflow of Christians, the Rev. Amjad Sabarra, the Catholic pastor of Bethlehem, has begun a job program for young men. In the past year more than 400 Bethlehem residents have received at least some part-time work, mostly in housing restoration.
 Father Sabarra is also working with recent university graduates, finding them internships and counseling them on the historic role of Christians in the Holy Land.
 ''I used to have one person working in my office,'' he said, laughing. ''Now I have 20.''

HEADLINE: Holidays Inspire a Rush to the Border

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Every year at this time, the restaurant kitchens and vegetable fields of California empty out. Prayers are said to San Cristofo, money is removed from mattresses, and Mexicans head home.
 The United States-Mexico border is broken, say United States immigration and customs officials. And at no time is the stress on the border more visible than the holidays, when immigration and customs officials say they are most overwhelmed.
 At the San Ysidro crossing here, on one side of the toll gates, immigrants head back to Mexico for the holidays, their pickup trucks and vans packed with washing machines, teddy bears and cheap lawn furniture. On the other side, customs agents probe gasoline tanks and dashboards with mirrors on sticks, while drug-sniffing dogs ferret through the upholstery in search of drugs bound for American cities like Los Angeles and New York to fill the New Year's Eve demand. 
 More than one million Mexicans will go south for the holidays, about half of them exiting through San Diego into Tijuana, officials say. Some are legal residents, but most, border officials say, are illegal immigrants, who in a month's time will pay thousands of dollars to have smugglers sneak them back to their jobs in the United States.
 ''It's like the salmon going home,'' said Mike Unzueta, the acting special agent in charge of the San Diego sector for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. ''Come January, we'll get killed with illegal immigration back from Mexico.''
 The torrent of travel that began in mid-December on the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe will peak just before Christmas. Then the travel will reverse back into the United States in mid-January after Dia de los Reyes, or Three Kings Day.
 In the days leading up to Christmas, an average of 180,000 cars will cross the border daily at San Diego, up from a normal day of 140,000, making it the busiest land border in the world.
 When immigrants make their way to Mexico, they must contend with corrupt Mexican police officers and border guards, who extort, harass and often demand a little Christmas gratuity from those returning home with cash and gifts.
 ''The Mexican system is corrupt,'' said Gilberto Serrano-Contreras, 40, who keeps a home in Tijuana and has been working intermittently in Los Angeles for the past 20 years. ''That's why so many go north. You can't get ahead here.''
 Rodrigo Salinas-Marquez, 37, a gardener in Orange County, shrugged as Mexican customs officials rooted through his pickup truck. ''You pay going in, you pay going out,'' he said. ''That's the life of the Mexican.''
 The shakedown is so widespread that 15 years ago the Mexican government began something called the Paisano Program in which customs officials guide Mexicans through the repatriation process and field their complaints about corrupt officials.
 ''It is supposed to be the only place where you pay customs fees,'' said Renaldo Rojo, a Mexican immigration official in Tijuana. ''It is supposed to keep the cops' hand out of their pockets.'' Several traveling Mexicans with newly acquired American tastes complain that they have to wait in long lines to register their vehicles at the Mexican checkpoints, enduring a disorganized and unfriendly bureaucracy.
 And then there is the problem of the freelance criminal. Confusion provides cover, and so the holiday season is also the season for drug smugglers, money launderers, even peddlers of knockoff Coach bags.
 United States customs officials say the holiday is a peak for drug smuggling into the United States as crops ripen and drug cartels from Colombia to Mexico rush to get marijuana and cocaine to market. The drug traffic doubles at this time of year, officials say. A ton of marijuana has been confiscated each of the last two weeks in San Diego, along with sundry amounts of cocaine and methamphetamine. Though the street value of the drugs seized is estimated at several million dollars, it is a pittance in a transnational industry pegged at more than $20 billion a year. United States agents say they are simply outmanned.
 ''During the holidays, people up north want their dope,'' said Dan Burke, a United States customs investigator. ''Down south, people want their money. There are employees to pay in Mexico. It's Christmas time, and people have presents to buy.''
 Consequently, as much as $5 million a day flows into Mexico at this time of year through San Diego alone, Mr. Burke said. The cash is carried not only by Mexican smugglers but also by desperate American gamblers who are recruited from local casinos after blowing the Christmas money at the slot machines. Once in Mexico, the money is deposited in local banks or funneled into currency exchange offices established solely to launder the money and wire it back into the United States.
 Along the 1,951 miles of the border, through cities like Laredo, Tex., Nogales, Ariz., and San Diego, the Christmas hustles are limited only by one's imagination. Stolen washing machines and televisions that are too hot to sell in the United States are simply driven into Tijuana one or two at a time and sold there.
 Knockoff designer handbags are smuggled from Asia to the United States and finally exported into Mexican border towns where American shoppers expect to find them. United States customs officials seized 1,000 knockoff bags last week in San Diego en route to Mexico.
 Border patrol agents contend that the Mexicans themselves are the biggest problem, and though Christmas is a slow season for human trafficking, it never really stops. A toddler was found last month stuffed in a pinata. The smugglers were let go, border patrol agents said.
 ''The border is broken, Mexico is broken, the immigration policy is broken, and you can see it right now at Christmas time on the border,'' said George E. McCubbin, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing 10,000 border patrol agents.
 ''These people you see now going home, we'll be chasing in a month,'' Mr. McCubbin said. ''And the smuggling business has gotten so lucrative and ruthless it puts our agents at risk of being killed.'' 
 Though 2,000 border patrol agents will be added over the next five years, they do not address the reason immigrants come illegally, he said, adding, ''We have to have the will to go after the employers.''
 With the Mexican economy faltering and Mexicans believing that the Bush administration will offer blanket amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people entered the United States illegally last year than any other since Sept. 11, 2001. Officials estimate that three million people entered the United States illegally last year, a majority of them Mexican.
 The business of smuggling people has become so lucrative that drug-style cartels are in the game. As a consequence, murder and kidnapping have skyrocketed in Phoenix, the main hub of the smuggling business. An illegal crossing costs upward of $2,000.
 ''Stand on the border around Christmas and you'll see what a joke the immigration policy is,'' Mr. McCubbin said.
 Not all news is bad on the border. In a ceremony on Monday, 90 wild parrots smuggled into the United States were repatriated to Mexico, a gift from the American government.
 One cynical border official sniffed that the parrots, too, would probably make their way back to Los Angeles after Three Kings Day.

HEADLINE: Growth Pace Is Revised Up a Notch

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
The economy headed to the end of the year with good momentum as it expanded at an annual rate of 4 percent in the third quarter, a faster clip than previously thought.
 A new reading on the gross domestic product, released Wednesday by the Commerce Department, exceeded the previous estimate of 3.9 percent growth for the quarter from July to September. The performance was the best since the opening quarter of this year and was up from a 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter. 
 ''Things are shaping up,'' said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank.
 Gross domestic product measures the value of all goods and services produced within the United States and is the broadest barometer of the country's economic health.
 Brisk spending by consumers and businesses helped the economy expand nicely in the third quarter. The slight upward revision of the gross domestic product in the quarter mostly reflected the fact that the trade deficit was less of a drag on the economy than previously forecast.
 ''The magnitude of the adjustment was trivial, but the handle change may provide a psychological boost,'' said Steve Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.
 Analysts are optimistic the fourth quarter will have a solid performance, with estimates ranging from a growth rate of 3.5 percent to as high as 4.5 percent. 
 For all of 2004, the economy is expected to grow by more than 4 percent, which would be an improvement from 2003, when gross domestic product rose by 3 percent. Economists foresee slower -- but still healthy -- economic growth for 2005.
 The updated gross domestic product figure for the third quarter, based on more data, was better than economists forecast. They were predicting growth would remain at the pace estimated a month ago.
 After adjusting for inflation, the economy grew to $10.9 trillion, annualized, in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 5.1 percent, the fastest pace since the end of 2001.

HEADLINE: Light to Soften the Suburbs

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
MANY of the subdivisions in northwest Arkansas have confusingly similar names: Creekstone and Creekwood; Bordeaux and Chardonnay. And many of the homes offer similar features, like stainless steel appliances and lofty foyers with what brokers call ''volume ceilings.'' So a few developers, intent on differentiating their properties from the pack, have begun resorting to an exotic amenity: 18th-century gaslighting.
 Hundreds of gaslights, with cubic or hexagonal copper lanterns on green or black fiberglass posts, now cast soft glows on newly seeded lawns around the region, where the presence of Wal-Mart's headquarters has contributed to an explosion in development. ''It sets an ambience, it adds a personal touch to the subdivision,'' said Carole Ferguson, an owner of Atlas Construction of Arkansas, which has used gaslights in a community of 30 brick-gabled homes in Rogers, Ark., called Emerald Heights. ''Gaslights are big time out here.'' 
 Gaslights, which once graced the boulevards of Paris and the streets of New York but disappeared by the middle of the last century, are becoming more popular in suburban subdivisions, high-end resort communities and downtown renewal projects all over the United States. They are being promoted by an odd mix -- preservationists, architects and energy executives -- as a design detail that can soften the mood of a place and make it significantly more inviting. And consumers seem to be buying it. 
 ''It's a human, maybe a primal thing, that we are attracted to flame,'' said Jim Ragan, the sales manager of Legendary Lighting in Jackson, Miss., which manufactures and sells many of lamps used in the Arkansas subdivisions (at prices starting around $500 each), and which has seen his business more than double in the last two years. 
 Dr. David Allison, an endodontist in Columbus, Ga., said the gas lamps that he and his wife, Julie, installed at their vacation house in Rosemary Beach, on the Florida panhandle, give the house a ''romantic, New Orleans feel.'' The Allisons' architect, Mike Waller of Mandeville, La., outfitted their stucco residence with gaslighting from the entryway through the courtyard and guest house, creating an effect of flickering light that Dr. Allison described as magical.
 At Palmetto Bluff, a new upscale resort on the South Carolina coast with a hotel and houses, gaslight was used ''to create a sense of calm and age,'' said the project's designer, Anne Haley Howerton, a principal in the San Francisco firm Hart Howerton. 
 She placed copper gaslights, made by Bevolo Gas and Electric Lights in New Orleans, on pedestrian bridges and alongside homeowners' yards in the resort community, where empty lots cost up to $4.3 million. The gaslight shines on Palmetto Bluff's many live oak trees, creating eerie, shimmering reflections, Ms. Howerton said, though it does not compete with the night sky: ''In a full moon, the effect is just amazing.''
 The renewed interest in gas lamps is keeping manufacturers busy. Last year Lars Dahlhaus opened a loft showroom for antique lamp reproductions -- an American outpost of his family's 36-year-old lighting business in Germany -- in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Much to his surprise, gas lamps, including replicas of Victorian fixtures, have been a big seller for him and now account for about 15 percent of his business. His customers vary widely, from a California horse rancher to a New Jersey malpractice lawyer, but Mr. Dahlhaus said they share a desire for relief from an overlit world.
 ''People have so much area lighting and floodlighting,'' he said. ''Gas lamps are a welcome accent light.''
 Power companies across the country have been taking notice of the gas lamp boom, and recognizing in it an opportunity to increase profits. Gas suppliers like the municipal gas department in Corpus Christi, Tex., and KeySpan Corporation in the Northeast encourage consumers to switch to gas for their exterior lighting with incentives like rebates, loans and maintenance contracts for the fixtures. 
 Web sites and salespeople list the advantages of gaslights: they are safe, relatively cheap and attract fewer insects than electric lights. If there is a power outage, gas continues to flow. (As for safety, in the event that a fire fizzled out and gas began leaking, ''you'd smell it,'' said Ed Yutkowitz, a spokesman for KeySpan. ''You call us, we fix it.'')
 In northwest Arkansas, as the subdivisions proliferate, the gas company is gearing up to light the corridors of still more developments, while keeping its customers' sensibilities in mind. 
 ''We won't put up identical posts in subdivisions right next to each other, and the owners appreciate that,'' said Rick Evans, a marketing representative for the Arkansas Western Gas Company. ''Everybody wants their neighborhood to look a little different, a little classier.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Export Growth Rises 13.4%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Japanese export growth accelerated to 13.4 percent in November, led by autos and steel, easing concern that overseas demand for goods is faltering. 
 Export growth from a year earlier exceeded October's revised 11.7 percent gain, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. 
On higher oil prices, imports rose 28 percent to a record, reducing the trade surplus to 602 billion yen ($5.77 billion) from 1.16 trillion yen. 
 Japanese shipping companies are predicting record sales as orders from the United States and China surge. A revival in exports, which had the slowest growth in more than a year in the third quarter, may help manufacturers reduce unsold stockpiles and support an economic recovery. 
 Higher prices of goods including steel offset the effect of a stronger currency, which reduces the value of exports in yen terms. Steel exports rose 50.1 percent in terms of value and just 18.5 percent by volume. The yen averaged 106.61 to the dollar in November, rising 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the finance ministry said. 
 ''Exports are recovering because the U.S. emerged from its soft patch,'' said Azusa Kato, an economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo. ''The rise in export demand is positive for manufacturers who are trying to reduce inventories.'' 
 Seasonally adjusted, exports in November rose 1 percent from October, the third gain in four months, and imports fell 1.9 percent. The trade surplus grew 16.2 percent to 990.5 billion yen.

HEADLINE: For the 1,200th Time: The Fellow Is Fond of Opera

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
The world of grand opera is abuzz. In the last two months, two of the world's most famous houses, La Scala in Milan and La Fenice in Venice, have opened after major reconstruction. London and Barcelona have new houses. The Bastille Opera in Paris has a new and daring director, Gerard Mortier, and City Opera, New York's second company, is busy seeking a new and larger home.
 At the same time, almost unnoticed except among dedicated fans, New York is losing one of the oldest and best-loved facets of its opera life: after some 36 years, George Jellinek's weekly radio program, ''The Vocal Scene,'' is going off the air. The final broadcast is tonight at 10 on WQXR-FM, where the show originated in October 1969. The first program was titled ''Love in Opera.'' Tonight's finale will be called, appropriately enough, ''Leave Taking'' and will be devoted to operatic farewells and Mr. Jellinek's own. 
 ''QXR wanted me to stay on for another year,'' he said, ''but I am 84, and I don't have the energy I once had. It was time.'' WQXR is owned by The New York Times Company. 
 ''The Vocal Scene'' began as an experiment. ''I was musical director of the station at the time,'' Mr. Jellinek said. ''I had this vast record collection, and it just seemed to make sense. Management gave me a green light, and with absolutely no broadcasting experience, I went on. Thank God, the pros around the station, people like Duncan Pirnie, were patient with me. They taught me how to breathe, how to modulate my voice.''
 A perfectionist, Mr. Jellinek, who was born in Budapest and still speaks with a soft, elegant Mitteleuropean accent, worked hard on his presentation. Over the years, he has rerun many of his shows, all of which are recorded in advance. ''But never any of the first 60,'' he said. ''I was still learning the job.'' As of tonight, he will have broadcast ''The Vocal Scene'' 1,878 times. ''About 1,200 were original,'' he said. ''In recent years I've done a lot of reruns.''
 No mere spinner of records, Mr. Jellinek has always taken a thematic approach: 10 basses singing Boris Godunov, for example, or eight sopranos interpreting Carmen. An evening might be devoted to the art of Kiri Te Kanawa, or of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf or Joseph Schmidt. One program was called ''Nine Ways to Sing an Aria,'' another ''The Songs of Tchaikovsky.''
 Mr. Jellinek's record collection is understandably immense; the walls of his apartment in Hastings-on-Hudson, in Westchester County, N.Y., are lined with CD's; how many even he doesn't know. He hangs on to quite a few vinyl LP's like many audiophiles, he still enjoys the rich sounds of the old 33's, but his once-impressive collection of old 78's -- he calls them ''shellacs'' -- is gone.
 ''In 1980, when I was recuperating from my first bypass, a friend visited me in the hospital and offered to buy them all,'' Mr. Jellinek said. ''I let him take them. Subsequently, he gave them to Brown University, where they still are. When I go, Brown will get the rest of my collection, too.''
 George Jellinek was born in the waning days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a moderately prosperous restaurateur, so, like most middle-class Jewish children in that world, George took up an instrument -- in his case, the violin. Then, in his teens, he discovered opera, and fiddling soon lost whatever attraction it may have had. A providentially broken wrist saved him from any later notions about becoming a second Kreisler or Szigeti.
 In 1939, with war imminent, the Jellineks determined to send George, their only son, out of the country to avoid military service. At 19 he traveled to Hamburg, Germany, and then to Cuba, where he waited two years for a visa to the United States. His parents and sister remained behind. His sister survived and escaped Hungary in the 1950's, but his mother and father were swallowed up in the Holocaust; he never saw them again. Arriving in New York in 1941, he was soon drafted into the Army. Commissioned a lieutenant, he found himself once again in Europe, fighting the forces that had destroyed his family only a few years earlier. In 1942, he married Hedy Dicker, a young economist who had recently come to the United States from Austria. 
 Back in civilian life, he took jobs on the fringe of the music world, including clerking in a record shop and even programming elevator music for the Muzak Corporation. He wrote record reviews, taught music appreciation courses and in 1960 published his first book, ''Callas: Portrait of a Prima Donna, '' which is still in print. From 1968 to 1984, he was the music director for WQXR.
 ''The Vocal Scene'' started slowly but soon found an audience. ''At its peak, it was syndicated in 75 cities,'' Mr. Jellinek said. Only WQXR has carried the show in recent years. Not surprisingly, Mr. Jellinek is pessimistic about opera and, indeed, about all classical music on radio. ''A few years ago,'' he said, ''polls showed that only about 7 percent of the radio audience ever listened to classical music. Recently it was down to 3 percent.''
 His own enthusiasm has diminished not at all since his first ''Traviata'' in Budapest in 1936. Nor have his preferences changed much; ''Verdi is my idol,'' Mr. Jellinek said. His favorite opera? '''Don Carlo.' 'Otello' may be a better opera, but my favorite has always been 'Don Carlo.''' 
 And singers? There must have been a few favorites through the years. No hesitation. ''Titta Ruffo among the tenors, and Victoria de Los Angeles among the sopranos,'' he said. Ruffo was a contemporary of Caruso, but some of his records have been preserved on admittedly hard-to-find CD's. ''No full operas, but plenty of arias,'' Mr. Jellinek said. ''He could do anything -- Rigoletto, Andre Chenier.
 ''De Los Angeles, who is in her 80's now and retired, is still well represented on records,'' Mr. Jellinek said. 
 ''She did two magnificent Butterflies,'' he said. ''I prefer the version with Giuseppe di Stefano. It captures her at her youthful best.''
 He has favorites among contemporary singers but is reluctant to name names. ''I will say this,'' he offered: ''Careers don't last as long as they did. Once singers traveled at a slower place; they took ships, they rested. Now they sing, jump on a plane and sing somewhere else. They have computers. They are businessmen as well as singers. The pace is frenetic. They burn out.'' 
 His own pace is more measured. Once an opera regular, he goes rarely now. ''I have been doing about eight matinees a year at the Met,'' he said, ''but this year I think perhaps four. I like to get back home before the crazy drivers take over the roads.'' 
 At home he and his wife live amid vestiges of his past: his records, their paintings -- including some good ones by her father, Charles Dicker -- and dozens of photographs of himself with famous singers and conductors of a bygone age. One of his favorites is of him and Martti Talvela, the Finnish bass (''What a magnificent Boris'') who died in 1989. The Jellineks used to travel to Finland to visit with Talvela and his family.
 And then there is the watch. High on a shelf it sits, up above the hi-fi equipment; a gold pocket watch in a small glass case. ''I see it every day,'' he said, suddenly growing pensive. ''It was made in Schaffhausen, probably in the 1930's. The hands are stopped at 6:40. It was probably p.m. because I don't remember ever winding it since it passed into my hands at the railroad station in Budapest on that April day in 1939.''
 It was a last-minute gift from his father. Which makes tonight's program especially poignant, dedicated as it is to farewells.


CORRECTION-DATE: December 29, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts on Thursday about the final broadcast of the weekly WXQR-FM radio program ''The Vocal Scene'' and its host, George Jellinek, included a quotation with an erroneous reference to the operatic voice of Titta Ruffo. He was a baritone, not a tenor. The article also referred incorrectly to the rarity of his recordings. CD's are readily available. The article misstated the number of stations that have carried the program in recent years. There were several; WQXR was not the only one.

HEADLINE: The Fields Of Pedro's Dreams

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

DATELINE: MANOGUAYABO, Dominican Republic, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
An hour after sunset, Pedro Martinez is walking along the main street of his neighborhood, a group of barefoot children in threadbare clothing following him, moonlight casting a blue glow.
 Calle San Miguel, once a treacherous combination of dirt, rocks and potholes, was paved only two years ago. These days, people walk without fear of losing shoes in the mud, although they still have to avoid the garbage in the gutters. Now they can easily make it to the Parroquia Inmaculada Concepcion de Maria, a simple teal church with 17 rows of movable pews.
 Martinez was born here 33 years ago, grew up here and still lives on the land where his first home stood. All around him, he sees the world of his childhood transformed. He raises his chest and sighs, proud of what he has accomplished here since he became a major league pitcher in 1992. He helped pave the road and build the church, and he paid for homes for his family and friends. 
 On this night, he stops by the school he helped pay for. The new three-story yellow building sits in the corner of a field recently bulldozed for his latest construction project. 
 ''We call him our angel,'' said Francisca de la Cruz, who once taught Martinez and is now the new school's director. ''Without Pedro Martinez, we'd be in lots of trouble.''
 Baseball fans know Martinez as the Mets' newest star, a quirky personality and a merciless pitcher unafraid to aim a fastball under a hitter's chin. He is cliche-free, witty, insightful and, as often as not, controversial.
 He once said that the Yankees should wake up Babe Ruth so he could drill him. During a brawl in the 2003 American League Championship Series, Martinez pushed the Yankee coach Don Zimmer, then 72 years old, to the ground, solidifying his position as a devil in the eyes of Yankee fans.
 But here in his neighborhood, a half-hour drive from downtown Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, Martinez is no devil. He is more a patron saint.
 Stores lining the road into town are rickety kiosks painted in pastels, pink, mint green, sea blue and neon. Signs cry out: Salon! (one on nearly every corner); Cervezas el Presidente! (Dominican-made beer); Colmado! (a small bodega).
 Trumpet-heavy merengue music is blasting, often trumped, however, by the roar of motorbikes. The scent of gasoline lingers as those motorbikes zip by, sometimes carrying as many as five people. Some are taxis, a short ride costing about 37 cents.
 On a lively Sunday, women stroll along Calle San Miguel with their hair in fat curlers. Men play dominoes while stray dogs nap under their tables. Youngsters practice baseball swings in the street.
 Many houses have one room and dirt floors, some have no doors or windows. But others stand out. They are newly painted in muted colors and have windows and doors protected by white wrought-iron bars. Some have two stories and marble floors. Those houses carry Martinez's stamp.
 ''He built my house for me because he found out I was still renting,'' de la Cruz said, her eyes filling with tears. ''And he built at least 30 or 40 other houses for people here. You can say that everything nice here is because of him.''

Sleeping Two to a Mattress
 When Martinez was young, everything was different. At 5, he was a featherweight, the fifth of six children born to Pablo Jaime Abreu and Leopoldina Martinez. His father worked odd jobs, his mother washed clothes for wealthier families.
 Like most houses in Manoguayabo, theirs was built with palm wood and had dirt floors and a tin roof. Sheets separated the interior into rooms. The family slept on the floor, at least two to a mattress. 
 The young Pedro Martinez -- inexplicably nicknamed Enyo by his older brother Ramon -- had a lot of friends. Elvira Trinidad remembers Martinez being ''very bad but very original,'' once encouraging her to climb high into a mango tree, then laughing because he had put her in a spot where he could see her underwear.
 Trinidad said she always thought Martinez would be a doctor; he was that smart. Though he worked as a mechanic as a teenager, baseball was in his blood.
 Like nearly every Dominican boy, Martinez's father played the game. His claim to island fame: he could pitch two games in a day. 
 The youngsters played ball using broomsticks and tree branches for bats and makeshift balls made of fruit, rolled-up socks and the heads of their sisters' dolls.
 Eventually, Ramon Martinez signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers and began his 14-year major league pitching career in 1988. Four years later, Pedro Martinez joined him on the Dodgers. And when he left for the United States, he took his hometown with him.
 ''The whole village was on my shoulders, and I knew that,'' Martinez said, lifting his arms to the sky. ''So when I went on the mound, I felt like a lion fighting for my food because I wasn't fighting for myself. I was fighting for everyone in Manoguayabo.''
 Though Martinez left Manoguayabo, he could have chosen to live anywhere, including one of the island's resort towns. But he stayed in his hometown and improved it.
 Soon after signing a $75 million contract with Boston, Martinez began to build here. With help from Ramon, he acquired the land around his family's old home and built residences for his family members.
 Then he built the church, used his island-hero influence to persuade the government to pave the main road, and bought the land where the school was raised.
 Now nearly all his family members and friends -- hundreds, he says -- live in small houses abutting his property. A security gate separates them from the main road.
 Florida Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo recently moved into a large house in the ritzy section of Manoguayabo. But Martinez's house is near the end of Calle San Miguel, hidden behind a white concrete block wall topped with barbed wire. 
 When visitors arrive, one of his many workers slides open a hulking green gate to the driveway. Inside are two modest homes. One is a three-bedroom, single-story house where Martinez, who is single, lives alone; the other is a guest house.
 Roosters walk the property. A sausage-shaped Doberman pinscher lounges near one of the two small pools. There are lime, hibiscus and mango trees, which Martinez used to climb, ones he hopes to ''sit under in a hammock someday when I retire.''
 The most striking feature of his home is a covered terrace at the edge of a hill. There he holds parties for nearly everyone in the neighborhood, roasting a pig on a spit and serving typical Dominican food like red beans and rice with meat.
 ''It's like he never left here,'' Eduardo Abreu Martinez, a lawyer, who is no relation, said. ''During the All-Star break, he was pitching in the street here. No matter how rich he gets, he's still one of us.''
 Martinez's friends are his bodyguards, chauffeurs and public relations people. He rewards them with homes, cars and gifts. But one person Martinez trusts is not Dominican: his agent, Fernando Cuza, is of Cuban descent.

'It's My Soul Talking'
 ''Winning the World Series is low on the things that make me happy,'' Martinez said. ''What I really enjoy is giving back to the people here and giving them hope. I want them to use me now while I have this fame.''
 He grows quiet and looks at the sky. ''At my mom's house on the farm, it gets so dark, you look at the stars and you feel like you can just reach out and grab them,'' he said. ''I love her so much and I love this place so much, it hurts. I stay here because I need to find myself again after playing in the States. Here, it's me talking. It's my soul talking.''
 When Martinez pitches, nearly everyone in town tunes in. Hundreds of pro players have come out of this country that breathes baseball. Last weekend, boys in Manoguayabo gathered at a dirt field to play, though only two had gloves and most had no shoes. Home plate was a green button-down shirt. The bases were soggy shreds of cardboard. Left field was a pond of stagnant water.
 ''Run! Get the ball!'' some yelled in Spanish as the outfielder furiously chased a small rubber ball headed for the water. It rolled into its watery grave and the youngsters howled, ''Now what?''
 For many boys in the Dominican Republic, there are reminders that major league baseball can lead to a better life. Martinez owns a Ferrari, a Hummer and a Mercedes. The Cubs' Sammy Sosa lives in a mansion and invited more than 300 people to his wedding reception last weekend. When Anaheim's Vladimir Guerrero played his first winter league game with the Licey Tigers, the crowd erupted when he made a diving catch in right field, causing the cheerleaders to dance wildly atop the dugouts.
 Still, Martinez encourages young players to stay in school and learn English.
 For the players who do make it, Martinez offers advice. Denny Bautista, who lives a few houses from Martinez, was called up to the Kansas City Royals last September. On his first day, a new glove stitched with the name Pavo Bautista was in his locker.
 ''I knew it was from Pedro because he calls me Pavo, which means turkey, because I guess I look like a turkey,'' Bautista said, laughing. ''But really, I thank God every day for Pedro Martinez. If I have a family problem, I can talk to him and he can tell me what to do. He's everybody's counselor.''
 With the Red Sox, Martinez made $90 million. He will make $53 million over four years with the Mets. That kind of money makes it easy for him to be charitable, especially in the Dominican Republic, where 25 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Cuza, his agent, said Martinez had spent $20,000 to $80,000 on each house he built. ''The problem is, he just can't say no,'' Cuza said. 
 Sitting on plastic chairs in a small patio next to a bodega near his house, Martinez listened to a man describe how his house had deteriorated.
 ''It needs to be fixed,'' Manuel Abreu, 72, said while sipping Brugal rum from a bottle and clutching his new Mets shirt with his other hand. 
 Martinez looked into Abreu's eyes and nodded, ''O.K., I'll do it.'' 
 Then Martinez said: ''I build houses and build houses. It's still not enough. There's so much to do here.''
 Pedro and Ramon Martinez started a window company in town to generate jobs, in a country where the unemployment rate this year is 16.5 percent. But his biggest project is yet to come.
 On the grounds behind the new school, Martinez plans to build a high school, playing fields, a police station, a library and a health clinic.
 Martinez's hands shook as he held a model for the project. When he retires, he said, he wants to work at the school, maybe as a child psychologist, definitely as the baseball coach. 
 He walks down the stairs that lead from the school to the construction site.
 ''In my life, there are ups and downs, and I know one day I'm going I'm going to be down here,'' he said at the bottom of the stairs. ''All I want is to be loved and respected, so I hope that when I am down here, people here will still be at my sides.''

Spreading the Wealth
 Martinez plans to move into a quiet suburb of New York for the season. Before the season, he plans to stay in the Dominican Republic, working on his projects and fishing on his boat in the Caribbean Sea. 
 He also often visits his mother, who lives in the mountains, where he likes to garden and ''clean up the flowers and make them pretty.'' 
 From time to time, he goes to discos with his longtime girlfriend, Carolina Cruz, and dances salsa, merengue and the bacchata, a Dominican dance. But he guards his privacy, balking when anyone asks about his immediate family, which includes his two children.
 ''I'm a wealthy man in a poor country, so that makes me a target for lots of things,'' he said. ''My family shouldn't suffer just because I'm famous.''
 What should happen, he said, is that other people benefit from his fame, like the three chopstick-thin shoeshine boys who caught Martinez's attention last week at a restaurant. From the sidewalk, they asked for money, and Martinez obliged. 
 When he returned to his table, the boys were dancing and singing, the money held tightly. ''Con Pedro se come!'' they chanted, meaning ''With Pedro we can eat!''
 Martinez said that was ''the best sentence'' he had ever heard.
 ''I don't want to ever forget where I came from,'' he said back in Manoguayabo, as he walked off the school's property and into the moonlit street.
 Then he quickly turned to one of the boys gathering around his feet and grabbed the 5-year-old's tiny hands. The quiet boy, named Argemi, was wearing a dingy tank top with shorts and no shoes.
 ''See, that's me,'' Martinez said, pulling the boy close to him. ''This is pretty much a picture of me when I was little, like how I was when I climbed those mango trees. 
 ''I know exactly who I am when I look into the faces of these kids.''

HEADLINE: Students to Bear More of the Cost of College

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
College students in virtually every state will be required to shoulder more of the cost of their education under new federal rules that govern most of the nation's financial aid.
 Because of the changes, which take effect next fall and are expected to save the government $300 million in the 2005-6 academic year, at least 1.3 million students will receive smaller Pell Grants, the nation's primary scholarship for those of low income, according to two analyses of the new rules.
 In addition, 89,000 students or so who would otherwise be getting some Pell Grant money will get none, the analyses found. 
 ''Season's greetings from Uncle Sam,'' said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, which conducted one of the analyses and represents about 1,800 colleges and universities. ''Your student aid stocking is going to be a little thinner next year.'' 
 Beyond the implications for Pell Grants, the new rules are expected to have a domino effect across almost every type of financial aid, tightening access to billions of dollars in state and institutional grants and, in turn, increasing the reliance on loans to pay for college. Taken together, many education experts say, the consequences for the nation's core financial aid programs are among the most substantial in a decade.
 ''This is the first time in at least 10 years where there's been a significant reduction for this magnitude of students,'' said Brian K. Fitzgerald, director of the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, which was created by Congress to advise the lawmakers on financial aid. It was this committee that performed the other analysis. 
 The changes are the denouement of a fight that has roiled Congress for more than 18 months. When the Bush administration first proposed altering financial aid rules last year, legislators stopped the revisions from taking hold, arguing that tough economic times meant students needed more help to attend college, not less. 
 But this year the administration found support from Congressional leaders seeking to constrain the cost of Pell Grants, an expense that has steadily increased as more low-income students go to college. 
 Even with the new rules, spending on Pell Grants, which could easily surpass $12 billion this fiscal year, may continue to increase, and the ranks of recipients will probably grow as well, because so many new students are applying for aid.
 Without the changes, though, Pell Grant costs would be about $300 million higher than with them, according to figures from the White House Office of Management and Budget, since tens of thousands of additional students would be eligible for aid and hundreds of thousands more would receive larger awards.
 Exactly how individual families will be affected depends greatly on their financial circumstances and on where they live. Parents who earn at least $15,000 will be negatively affected in every state except New Jersey and Connecticut. Those in states including New York, Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin will be among the hardest hit.
 Many may see their federal grants decline by only a few hundred dollars, or not at all, some financial aid experts estimate. Others can be expected to contribute significantly more.
 Painful though it may be, supporters of the new rules say, trimming back on awards has its benefits, especially for future students. 
 Educators and lawmakers on all sides have long agreed that the maximum Pell Grant, currently set at $4,050 a year, is wholly inadequate given today's college costs. But, those supporting the changes say, unless there is a serious effort to scale back the program, whose costs have been exceeding lawmakers' appropriations for it, Congress may never be in a position to give larger awards to the poorest of students, who need them the most.
 ''There aren't any easy answers, and there are consequences for wrongly adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the current budget shortfall,'' said David Schnittger, spokesman for the Republican majority on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. ''The shortfall is the main impediment to increasing the maximum Pell Grant.''
 The debate stems from a seemingly small alteration to the federal financial aid formula, a complicated equation that either directly governs or heavily influences distribution of federal, state and institutional financial aid. Its purpose is to determine how much of a family's income is truly discretionary and therefore fair game for covering college expenses. 
 Much as with the federal income tax, the formula allows families to deduct some of what they pay in state and local taxes. This year the administration gained enough Congressional backing to reduce that amount significantly, in some cases cutting it by half or more. On paper, at least, that leaves families with more money left over to pay for college, even though state and local taxes have gone up in the last few years, not down. 
 The Department of Education, which issues the financial aid formula, says it has no choice but to update the deductions periodically.
 ''We're required by law to do this, and we can't pick and choose which parts of the law to follow,'' said Susan Aspey, a department spokeswoman.
 Ms. Aspey said by e-mail yesterday that about 80,000 additional students -- not 89,000 as the two analyses determined -- would be receiving grants if the changes had not been made. She also said that nearly half of the nation's 5.3 million Pell recipients would not be affected, though that would appear to leave the possibility that the number affected will be even more than the 1.4 million estimated in the two analyses. Ms. Aspey could not be reached last night for elaboration.
 In adjusting the formula, the department is relying on data from 2002, which may not fully reflect the economic difficulties that many families have faced since then. Department officials, however, say the new formula is a lot more accurate than the previous one, which was at least a decade old. 
 The enormous University of California, with campuses scattered across the state, estimates that at least half of its 46,000 Pell Grant recipients will face some sort of reduction as a result of the changes. At the other end of the spectrum, Knox College, a small liberal arts institution in Illinois, says the changes will most likely reach upward to affect the middle class as well. 
 ''Of course we focus on the students who have the greatest need, but these families are needy, too,'' said Teresa Jackson, Knox's director of financial aid. ''They can't just sit down and write a check for $30,000 a year. I can appreciate the difficulty with the budget, but my gosh, to cut back on financial aid given the times doesn't make a lot of sense.''

HEADLINE: As an era of soaring prices appears to fade, health care analysts see a bleak outlook for hospitals.

BYLINE: By Reed Abelson

 BODY:
A CHILL is in the air for hospitals accustomed to having insurers -- both public programs like Medicare and private health plans -- pay ever higher prices for hospital services. That era appears to be ending, some analysts say. 
 For companies like HCA, Tenet Healthcare and other hospital chains, the outlook for the future is largely negative, said Gary Taylor, an analyst who follows for-profit hospitals for Banc of America Securities. ''I think it's a big risk,'' he said. For example, Mr. Taylor noted, growing Medicare costs may well force the Bush administration to insist that hospitals bear the brunt of any future efforts to reduce the program's costs. 
 Hospital stocks have had a lackluster year, largely because of slow growth in patient admissions and a rise in unpaid bills, or bad debt, from people without enough insurance coverage or any coverage at all. 
 ''The stocks underperformed the market,'' said John Ransom, director of health care research for Raymond James & Associates, who follows many hospital companies. Unless a better economy in 2005 leads more people to use hospital services and to pay their bills, he says he thinks the stocks will continue to suffer. 
 The shares of HCA, which is the largest for-profit chain, for example, have fallen by about 9 percent since January. Shares closed yesterday at $39.10. 
 And Tenet has said it does not expect to do more than break even in 2005. Shares in Tenet are down about a third this year and closed yesterday at $10.68. Tenet announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to settle, for $395 million, patient lawsuits stemming from accusations of unnecessary heart surgeries at one of its California hospitals. The company still faces numerous other lawsuits as well as significant operational challenges.
 The financial outlook for next year may be even worse, said Mr. Taylor, who recommends selling Tenet stock and is neutral on HCA. 
 The hospital industry's weak prospects for the coming years have much to do with the Medicare bill enacted last year, which for the first time committed the federal government to help pay for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients. As part of that reform, the federal program says it will increase the participation of preferred-provider plans in delivering care. For most people, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals directly without making use of a managed-care plan. 
 Expanding the use of preferred-provider plans, Mr. Taylor said, ''would be a huge negative for the hospitals'' because those plans are better able to negotiate lower prices with hospitals and to restrict hospital admissions.
 While Medicare hospital payments are relatively generous under the reform bill, analysts say, those rates may be cut if the cost of drugs for the elderly soars and the federal budget deficit grows. Many say they believe federal policy makers will look to hospitals as a place where they can save money, as they did in the mid-1990's when they substantially reduced payments to balance the federal budget. 
 Early next year, the Medicare trustees will issue their annual report on the financial health of the program. Mr. Taylor predicts that pressures from the new drug benefit will force a rethinking of hospital payments under Medicare. 
 Mr. Ransom also said investors should keep an eye on Medicare discussions early in 2005, but he added that Congress might instead turn its attention to overhauling Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for the poor. 
 In any case, hospitals cannot count on growth in overnight admissions to rescue them. As Mr. Taylor said, ''You've got a very mature industry.''
 In recent years, hospitals have raised prices aggressively, a strategy they used in negotiating contracts with private insurers and in seeking reimbursement under a special provision of Medicare that paid them for unusually expensive cases. But publicity over soaring charges -- and the failure of a growing number of uninsured patients to pay those charges -- are likely to reduce aggressive pricing, Mr. Taylor said. 
 In the meantime, specialty hospitals, which cater to the most profitable areas of medicine like cardiac care, are siphoning off patients from community hospitals that provide a full range of services. The Medicare law included an 18-month provision to discourage new construction of specialty hospitals owned by doctors. 
 Congress must decide by the middle of next year whether to extend the provision to protect community hospitals, which say they need to retain specialty care to subsidize medical services that do not make money. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the group that advises Congress on these issues, recommended this month that doctors not be allowed to send Medicare patients to new hospitals in which they have an ownership stake. It will issue a formal report in early 2005.
 ''Hospitals really don't compete that well,'' said Mr. Ransom, who added that Medicare might also review its payments for services like cardiac care to try to reduce the profitability of those services. 
 What the industry may experience is a variety of deal making, as some of the publicly held hospital companies merge or are bought or taken private, Mr. Ransom said. 
 Martin D. Arrick, a managing director for Standard & Poor's who specializes in not-for-profit hospitals that issue tax-exempt bonds, said ''2005 is going to be the year that the sector outlook really begins to shift.'' He predicts that a widening divide between wealthy hospitals and weaker ones that cannot raise money could lead to more hospital mergers. 
 ''There has been a slow but steady decrease in the hospitals, and that will continue,'' Mr. Arrick said. 
 But the real question facing investors in 2005, Mr. Ransom said, is whether hospitals are simply suffering through a down part of a cycle or whether the industry is facing fundamental changes as specialty hospitals and outpatient centers take away more of their business.

HEADLINE: Even in E-Mail Age, Mailbags Bulge

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: SOMERSET, N.J. 

 BODY:
As the United States Postal Service struggles through the holiday season and its busiest time of the year, John V. Jose, like many mail carriers around the country, has noticed a difference in his deliveries. December always meant heavy loads, but in the last few years, the burden has not necessarily been because of Christmas cards.
 ''It's all Victoria's Secret catalogs and Macy's and ShopRite advertisements these days,'' said Mr. Jose, who has been a carrier in Somerset for 11 years. ''Personal letters and greeting cards get less every year.'' 
 The heavier loads may make life tougher for the carriers, but they don't necessarily mean more money for the Postal Service.
 Catalogs and similar forms of advertising generate much less revenue per delivery than personal mail. And on the flip side, more people are turning to e-mail for personal correspondence, depriving the Postal Service of its traditional main source of cash, first-class mail.
 This trend, which has recently accelerated, worries the Postal Service, which earns about 14 cents less per delivery than it did in 2000. And in 2003, for the first time in Postal Service history, first-class mail, whose revenues traditionally make up about two-thirds of the postal service's operating budget, dropped below 50 percent of the total mail volume. But standard mail, which includes catalogs and other types of advertising mail, keeps growing, postal officials say, and next year it is expected to become the largest portion of mail volume.
 The trend grew after June 2003, when the ''Do Not Call'' list was created to halt many calls from telemarketers.
 ''E-mail has certainly put a crunch on the Postal Service's bottom line,'' said George B. Gould, legislative director of the National Association of Letter Carriers. ''But I think everyone is learning to do a lot more with less as we adjust for the new type of mail stream.''
 The burden is being felt by the carriers, particularly in cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas, where there has been huge population growth. Mail deliverers there have seen a near doubling in the number of addresses per route, postal officials say. And at the same time, the service has also cut more than 12,000 carriers since 2000, bringing the total to about 291,500 full-time city and rural carriers. 
 With nearly 800,000 full and part-time employees, the Postal Service has a $67 billion annual budget and is one of the nation's largest employers. Its mission is to deliver mail to all addresses in the United States, while relying mostly on revenues from operations rather than taxpayer funding. It delivers to 142 million addresses and it adds about 1.8 million new addresses yearly.
 Robert Cohen, director of the Office of Rates, Analysis and Planning at the Postal Rate Commission, the agency that decides when postage may be raised, said the shift in mail content was not necessarily bad news.
 ''It simply means the Postal Service will have to keep becoming more efficient like it has been in recent years,'' he said. By trimming its work force and automating its sorting and delivery processes, the service has already saved more than $6 billion since 2000, he said. ''So don't count them out just yet,'' he added.
 Still, the challenges are steep, postal officials said. Gas prices have caused skyrocketing transportation costs. Private delivery companies pose fierce competition. Increasingly, people are paying their bills online, depriving the service of that revenue. 
 And postal officials say that despite the more than $500 million that Congress recently provided to safeguard against bioterrorism, the Postal Service is still short by about $500 million to take all the needed precautions for threats like the anthrax attacks of October 2001. The service is also in a fight with Congress over $3 billion in savings in the fund for postal workers' pensions. Postal officials say they need the money to cover current costs, but Congress says the Postal Service should save the money for future expenses.
 But the biggest financial drain is caused by e-mail. While citing inefficiency as a factor, a presidential commission formed to study postal operations concluded in a 2003 study that e-mail was the ''most significant threat'' and that ''unless the Postal Service's expenses can be reduced correspondingly, it is questionable whether affordable universal mail service via a self-financing public institution is sustainable.''
 This is exactly what has Representative John M. McHugh, Republican of New York, worried. Mr. McHugh, who represents upstate New York, is chairman of a special House committee on postal reform and oversight, and he has been pushing Congress since 1995 to make the mail service more competitive and efficient. In 2001, the Government Accounting Office put the service on a ''high risk'' list of government agencies in financial jeopardy.
 ''If the Postal Service falters in its commitment to universal coverage, it would probably most affect districts like ours,'' said Mr. McHugh, referring to areas where post offices serve as community meeting points and where other mail distributors are few. ''In our district you don't measure driving distances in minutes but hours, and closing a post office can really create a problem.'' Mr. McHugh's district stretches from Oswego to Plattsburgh and includes much of the Adirondack Mountains.
 To help offset its disappearing revenue, postal officials plan to raise the price of sending all mail in 2006. Ralph Moden, senior vice president of government relations for the service, said that the percent increase would probably be in the single digits unless Congress fails to provide the financial help needed. ''It is really out of our hands at this point,'' he said. Postage rates were last raised in 2002.
 This is unwelcome news for Nina Link, president and chief economic officer of the Magazine Publishers of America, based in New York City. Ms. Link said that for every 1 percent increase in postage rates, magazines incur $30 million in costs.
 ''It's not just the mailing of the magazines themselves but also the cost of renewal notices, solicitations for subscriptions, and bills,'' she said. ''Everything moving to the Internet is really hurting the Postal Service, which ends up hurting us too.''
 Out on the delivery routes, the transformation of the service's mission is having a real impact on carriers like Eady M.C. Rodriguez, whose ZIP code in Somerset has more than 800 new addresses in the last nine months, because of a building boom in the area. 
 ''It's my lower back that feels it,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, a petite Staten Island native who said that she lost more than 35 pounds in the last six months, largely due to the expanded workload. 
 ''But everyone is working harder to keep up,'' she said as she loaded her truck for her delivery route, which takes her six and one half hours. ''I just wonder when we will catch up.''

HEADLINE: New Help for the Black Entrepreneur

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
At first blush, the figures are bleak. African-Americans account for 12 percent of the nation's population, but own only 4 percent of the small businesses. And the revenues of their businesses are on average less than one-tenth those of nonminority companies, according to the Census Bureau.
 Other statistics, however, suggest that black Americans are more caught up in the entrepreneurial spirit than those numbers suggest, and even that they feel the entrepreneurial impulse more keenly than other ethnic groups. 
 According to federal government figures, the number of African-American businesses grew 26 percent in the 1990's, almost four times the growth rate for all small businesses in that period. A Small Business Administration study released last month showed that African-American self-employment increased 37 percent over the last quarter-century, far outpacing the 15 percent growth rate for Hispanics and 10 percent for whites. 
 While many African-Americans go into business, government indicators show that they often struggle not only because of low revenues but also because the smallness of their companies -- they often employ only themselves -- hinders growth potential. 
 What holds them back is usually lack of access to capital. African-Americans often do not have personal wealth to use or borrow against, and lack a network of contacts to help them overcome the hurdles of getting a business off the ground.
 Those are gaps that a new coalition of business leaders, government agencies and philanthropic and community groups say they are determined to help close. The coalition -- led by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, a group in Kansas City, Mo., dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship, and the National Urban League -- plans to set up one-stop shops, initially in five cities, to offer an array of services, from financial assistance to mentoring, to help minorities meet the challenges of expanding their businesses.
 The organization, called the Urban Entrepreneur Partnership, said its centers would provide one location where entrepreneurs could receive training in how to plan and set up a business and get coaching and mentoring help, advice on formulating a business plan, technical expertise, assistance in landing contracts, access to bank loans and venture capital, and regular evaluations of their businesses.
 Ideally, the program, which will start April 1, will aim at companies that have the potential to lift their revenues by $25 million to $100 million a year, thereby creating more jobs, and wealth, in urban areas. Rather than concentrating on a specific type of business, the coalition plans to recruit companies with promising prospects and give them the tools they need to prosper.
 ''We are not seeking to boost cold starts, but aiming at getting existing minority-owned companies to the next level,'' said Carl Schramm, president of the Kauffman Foundation. 
 Most of the coalition partners already have contacts with minority companies. Kermit Thomas, a consultant to the coalition, estimates that it will be able to help up to 800 businesses next year in the five cities where the first centers will open: Atlanta; Cincinnati; Cleveland; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Kansas City, Mo. 
 The National Urban League plans to advertise the project in local newspapers and magazines and on radio spots. Each center will have a director and at least five coaches, some of them to be hired under contracts. Others may be retired executives volunteering their time, and yet others may be lent by local banks or corporations.
 The Business Roundtable, a group of 150 chief executives of major corporations and another partner in the initiative, will make the resources of its BusinessLINC program available. BusinessLINC, started in 1999 to help stimulate economic growth in inner cities and rural areas, fosters alliances between small businesses and corporations to help entrepreneurs gain access to technical assistance and business opportunities. In the past, BusinessLINC has arranged for corporate executives to coach small businesses, and its director, Don Graves, said he expected that would happen again in the cities where the centers are opening. 
 The coalition has developed a model for training coaches and then matches them with a small business that can best use the expertise, Mr. Thomas said. Coaches will be expected to spend 10 to 20 hours a week with a small business, and will help set out a plan of action. They will also assist entrepreneurs with finances, analysis and improvement of the business plan and evaluations, he said.
 The coalition will also be helped by the Financial Services Roundtable, an association of the 100 largest financial services organizations in the United States.
 The Kauffman Foundation, which is providing $2 million in financing, hopes that with the backing of the White House -- President Bush announced the initiative last July and it was formally begun in October -- it will be able to expand it to 18 additional cities. They would include Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York in addition to Milwaukee, Houston, Nashville, Washington and Richmond, Va.
 The coalition is emphasizing coaching and mentoring, Mr. Schramm said, because ''people tend to network with people like themselves.
 ''But the risks are much lower if you can work with people who have already taken the big steps,'' he said.
 Terence Clark, for one, plans to turn to the program for help with his company, the Clarktel Communications Corporation, based in Akron, Ohio, which installs business telephone and security systems.
 Drawing on his training in the Army and in two communications companies, Mr. Clark, 44, decided to go into business himself in 1996. Like many entrepreneurs, he had problems at first getting financing, but when his original bank balked, he switched to another bank. It has been smooth sailing financially ever since, he says, and his eight-person company has increased revenues in all but one year.
 Mr. Clark said he wanted the Urban Entrepreneur Partnership to help him find two more communications specialists for his advisory board, to expand it to eight people. And he is looking for an adviser.
 ''What I would like to have is a mentor, someone with experience in the technical aspects who would have insight into the obstacles in the field,'' he said.
 Tony Harrison, an African-American businessman in Canton, Ga., said he also hoped to make use of the new program. After 16 years running a chemical operation for Procter & Gamble, Mr. Harrison decided in 2003 to set up his own business producing surface-acting agents, specialty chemicals used in personal-care products like soap and shampoos.
 Mr. Harrison, 42, said he had once hoped that his business could tap into contracts set aside for minorities, but he quickly realized that he did not have access to enough capital to get his business, which was based on part ownership of an existing chemical manufacturing plant, off the ground.
 He says he needs less than $5 million to enhance his existing plant in Dalton, Ga., or as much as $100 million to build a state-of-the-art plant in the Atlanta metropolitan area that would be large enough for orders from Fortune 500 companies.
 So, he will be looking for some experienced counsel, and he said that connecting with some corporate leaders who could serve on his board would be particularly helpful.
 ''But, quite frankly,'' he said, ''the biggest hurdle is the financial side.'' The coordinated services brought together by federal, state and local agencies under the umbrella of Urban Entrepreneur Partnership, he said, could ''help overcome those funding barriers.''

HEADLINE: The bottom line on overhauling Social Security: Most privatization plans involve a decided cut in average benefits.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick. 
Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine, and he teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His most recent book is ''Why Economies Grow'' (Basic Books/Century Foundation). E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
HOW can Americans be anything but confused by the complex debate over the privatization of Social Security? Investing part of the payroll taxes we pay in stocks and bonds to produce a personal nest egg is alluring. But until there is a detailed plan to analyze, we cannot know the true consequences. 
 At last week's economic summit meeting, the Bush administration began to give clues as to its plan. The administration appears to be leaning toward the Reform Model 2 proposed in December 2001 by its Commission to Strengthen Social Security, which was under the direction of former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner. 
 The plan is disheartening. Based on an analysis done by the Social Security Administration and the Congressional Budget Office, it will result in significant benefit reductions from the levels promised under the present system. 
 But is this still better than the present system, which as baby boomers retire may not be able to meet all its future promises? Here is the heart of the matter. Even if benefits must be reduced under the current system, many retirees will still do better than they would in a privatized system. Or so an analysis of Reform Model 2 suggests. 
 The Bush privatization plan coming into view would work as follows. Workers now pay to Social Security 6.25 percent of their wages up to $87,900, matched equally by their employer. Workers would be allowed to divert four percentage points, up to a maximum of $1,000 a year, to private investments in stocks and bonds. The investment accounts would be limited to highly diversified mutual funds, or even index funds, and the transactions costs would be kept to a minimal 0.3 percent. 
 So far so good.
 But to make sure there is enough incoming payroll tax to support promised benefits, Social Security benefits guaranteed under the present system would be cut slightly for each dollar the individual worker diverts to his or her private accounts. More important, future benefits would also be cut by indexing them to the rise in consumer prices rather than, as is now done, to rising wages, which tend, over time, to outpace inflation by a significant margin. 
 Indexing to prices may look sensible to Americans, but the reduction in future benefits from the present plan is likely to be severe. By 2075, under the most commonly accepted economic assumptions, indexing benefits to prices rather than wages would mean that benefits would be nearly 50 percent lower than under the current system. Many privatization plans call for such an adjustment. 
 Will the magic of private investment accounts make up for the reductions? The answer is no. We can compute how retirees fare if they earned the historical average of 4.6 percent a year (after transaction costs) on a portfolio of stocks and bonds. William Dudley, chief economist of Goldman Sachs, has calculated that benefits for a typical retired one-earner family would come to about 93 percent of the projected benefits from the present Social Security system in 2022. In 2075, the benefits would fall to only 77 percent of present-system benefits.
 So Americans who think privatization will necessarily preserve their retirement incomes should think again. Most privatization plans involve a decided cut in average benefits. 
 Still, advocates of privatization correctly point out, these cuts may be less over time than the cuts required to make the present system solvent. Based on the Social Security Administration projections, monthly benefits may have to be reduced to around 67 percent to 75 percent of projected levels. 
 But by no means is everyone going to earn the 4.6 percent average. The history of private investment unmistakably shows that there is a wide dispersion of results. Some will invest only in bonds, others may choose the wrong mutual fund, or switch from one to another at exactly the wrong times. And some will have the bad luck of retiring in the midst of a bear market. Many workers will therefore inevitably earn less, and some considerably less. 
 To determine how sensitive retirement income is to the rate of investment return, Mr. Dudley worked out some calculations under Reform Model 2. The results are stunning.
 If a worker earns just the respectable expected bond rate of 3 percent a year, or 2.7 percent after transactions costs, then the typical one-earner family will retire on only about 58 percent of the projected benefits under current law. If the investor earns zero over time, which may well occur for some investors, the projected retirement benefit is only a little more than 38 percent of the current benefit. These are considerably worse than the projected adjustments needed to bring the present system into balance. 
 And there are other costs to privatization. Consider the potential impact from borrowing as much as $2 trillion, which many experts see as the projected transition costs to cover the gap that would arise in payments to current retirees and those retiring soon once workers started diverting into private accounts some of the payroll taxes used to pay benefits. Financial markets may not absorb that debt without interest rates rising and the dollar falling. 
 As the privatization arguments are clarified, the ultimate decision Americans will have to make is over the purpose of the public pension system. Social Security was originally intended to guarantee a minimum retirement income for workers. For all the alarm over Social Security, the present guaranteed system can be fixed with only moderate tax increases and through less harsh benefit reductions, particularly if Americans are prepared to raise the official retirement age slightly to reflect generally longer life spans.
 The privatization plan the Bush administration is leaning toward, in contrast, will divide people into winners and losers. It may make some workers better off in retirement, and may well reduce costs somewhat to government, if all goes well. But a significant number of American retirees will do poorly.

HEADLINE: America, the Indifferent

 BODY:
It was with great fanfare that the United States and 188 other countries signed the United Nations Millennium Declaration, a manifesto to eradicate extreme poverty, hunger and disease among the one billion people in the world who subsist on barely anything. The project set a deadline of 2015 to achieve its goals. Chief among them was the goal for developed countries, like America, Britain and France, to work toward giving 0.7 percent of their national incomes for development aid for poor countries.
 Almost a third of the way into the program, the latest available figures show that the percentage of United States income going to poor countries remains near rock bottom: 0.14 percent. Britain is at 0.34 percent, and France at 0.41 percent. (Norway and Sweden, to no one's surprise, are already exceeding the goal, at 0.92 percent and 0.79 percent.) 
 And we learned this week that in the last two months, the Bush administration has reduced its contributions to global food aid programs aimed at helping hungry nations become self-sufficient, and it has told charities like Save the Children and Catholic Relief Services that it won't honor earlier promises. Instead, administration officials said that most of the country's emergency food aid would go to places where there were immediate crises.
 Something's not right here. The United States is the world's richest nation. Washington is quick to say that it contributes more money to foreign aid than any other country. But no one is impressed when a billionaire writes a $50 check for a needy family. The test is the percentage of national income we give to the poor, and on that basis this country is the stingiest in the Group of Seven industrialized nations. 
 The administration has cited the federal budget deficit as the reason for its cutback in donations to help the hungry feed themselves. In fact, the amount involved is a pittance within the federal budget when compared with our $412 billion deficit, which has been fueled by war and tax cuts. The administration can conjure up $87 billion for the fighting in Iraq, but can it really not come up with more than $15.6 billion -- our overall spending on development assistance in 2002 -- to help stop an 8-year-old AIDS orphan in Cameroon from drinking sewer water or to buy a mosquito net for an infant in Sierra Leone?
 There is a very real belief abroad that the United States, which gave 2 percent of its national income to rebuild Europe after World War II, now engages with the rest of the world only when it perceives that its own immediate interests are at stake. If that is unfair, it's certainly true that American attention is mainly drawn to international hot spots. After the Sept. 11 bombings, Washington ratcheted up aid to Pakistan to help fight the war on terror. Just last week, it began talks aimed at contributing more aid to the Palestinians to encourage them to stop launching suicide bombers at Israel.
 Here's a novel idea: how about giving aid before the explosion, not just after? 
 At the Monterey summit meeting on poverty in 2002, President Bush announced the Millennium Challenge Account, which was supposed to increase the United States' assistance to poor countries that are committed to policies promoting development. Mr. Bush said his government would donate $1.7 billion the first year, $3.3 billion the second and $5 billion the third. That $5 billion amount would have been just 0.04 percent of America's national income, but the administration still failed to match its promise with action.
 Back in Washington and away from the spotlight of the summit meeting, the administration didn't even ask Congress for the full $1.7 billion the first year; it asked for $1.3 billion, which Congress cut to $1 billion. The next year, the administration asked for $2.5 billion and got $1.5 billion. 
 Worst of all, the account has yet to disperse a single dollar, while every year in Africa, one in 16 pregnant women still die in childbirth, 2.2 million die of AIDS, and 2 million children die from malaria. 
 Jeffrey Sachs, the economist appointed by Kofi Annan to direct the Millennium Project, puts the gap between what America is capable of doing and what it actually does into stark relief.
 The government spends $450 billion annually on the military, and $15 billion on development help for poor countries, a 30-to-1 ratio that, as Mr. Sachs puts it, shows how the nation has become ''all war and no peace in our foreign policy.'' Next month, he will present his report on how America and the world can actually cut global poverty in half by 2015. He says that if the Millennium Project has any chance of success, America must lead the donors.
 Washington has to step up to the plate soon. At the risk of mixing metaphors, it is nowhere even near the table now, and the world knows it.

HEADLINE: Leave No Truffle Behind?

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
At Le Bernardin, the four-star Manhattan seafood restaurant, the prix fixe menu these days runs a hefty $92. But Eric Ripert, the owner and chef, winces every time a customer orders the wild salmon on a bed of asparagus. 
 ''If you choose the salmon you kill us,'' Mr. Ripert said. ''We are losing money every time we sell a portion.''
 Mr. Ripert is not used to worrying about the value of the dollar in foreign currency markets but it is much on his mind lately. That's because one of the prime ingredients in the dish is black winter truffles imported from France's Perigord region. 
 With the value of the dollar down by roughly 35 percent against the euro since the beginning of 2002, the preserved truffles Mr. Ripert imports to use in his sauce have risen sharply in price lately. Today, a seven-ounce tin costs him about $280, up from $200 a year ago.
 The dollar's weakness, Mr. Ripert said, ''is a real disaster at the level of the truffles.''
 Truffle inflation should come as no surprise. The devaluation of the dollar against the euro and some other currencies like the British pound and the Swiss franc forces American importers of goods from Europe to raise prices or accept sharply lower profits because they must spend more, in dollars, to buy products priced in European currencies. On things like truffles and caviar, where few equally good domestic substitutes exist and where aficionados can afford the best, there is little incentive to keep prices from rising in the United States. 
 But apart from truffles, a variety of other imported foods and a handful of specialized European products, the sinking dollar has so far had a relatively modest impact on the prices paid by American consumers. Excluding oil, import prices rose by 0.7 percent in November, the fastest pace since January. The average price American importers pay for nonoil foreign goods has increased 3.4 percent over the last 12 months.
 That is significantly above the 2.3 percent rise in the general price index, excluding energy, but still quite modest. And most consumers have not yet felt much of a pinch. While the prices of commodities like steel and plastic have risen sharply, the products they go into have not become much more costly.
 Imported automotive vehicles and parts, for instance, inched up merely 2.1 percent over the last 12 months. As a whole, the consumer prices of all imported manufactured durable goods, excluding cars, actually fell 0.1 percent.
 ''Price trends have remained generally the same as in the past few years,'' said Abe Brown, a spokesman for J&R Music and Computer World, which runs a suite of stores in downtown Manhattan. That is, electronic gadgets are either cheaper or they cost the same but have more bells and whistles. 
 The main reason for this moderation is that while the dollar has declined substantially against several major currencies -- besides European currencies, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen have also strengthened considerably -- it has depreciated much less against the currencies of the Asian countries from which the United States imports many popular consumer items.
 ''In most consumer goods categories, China is the top supplier to the U.S.,'' said Erik Autor, international trade counsel for the National Federation of Retailers. The price of the PC's, DVD players and sneakers imported from China and other low-wage countries in Asia are not rising because the yuan has been kept fixed against the dollar by the Chinese government. Countries that compete with China also tend to keep their currencies relatively stable against the dollar.
 Where China has not kept a lid on prices, fear of competition has. Even European exporters, which have suffered most from the dollar's downward spiral, have been reluctant to increase prices -- choosing instead to absorb much of the impact on their bottom line -- to protect their market share in the United States.
 ''From our standpoint here, our priority is to maintain competitive pricing,'' said Donna Boland, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz USA, which imports most of its line-up from Germany. Indeed, even though the dollar fell by about 17 percent against the euro in 2003, early this year Mercedes-Benz only increased its prices by an average 1.2 percent across the range of models. 
 The same dynamic applies in a multitude of goods, even foods like cookies and fine wine. In Berkeley, Calif., Kermit Lynch, an importer of French and Italian wine, has cut his margins to absorb some of the impact of a declining dollar, limiting price increases to some 20 percent over the last three years. ''We are still competitive against California and other countries,'' Mr. Lynch said.
 At Dean & DeLuca, the specialty food stores in Manhattan, some French Hediard preserves have increased to $12 a jar, from $10, over the last year. But the Nunez de Prado olive oil still costs $38 a bottle, the same as last year. 
 ''My guess is that distributors are absorbing a lot of this'' fall in the dollar, said Dane J. Neller, Dean & DeLuca's chief executive. ''But if the dollar continues to be so weak, the pressure will be such that there will be price increases.''
 Importers are not the only ones being squeezed by rising costs. Many American manufacturers have been strained by soaring prices of imported commodities, which they have been forced to absorb in large part because of the inability to raise prices to their customers. 
 This helps explain why the fall in the dollar's value, while likely to eventually put a brake on imports, so far has generally failed to even break the stride of most imports. The decline, by helping make American exporters more competitive abroad, has helped push United States' exports up 13.6 percent in the first 10 months of the year. But imports of goods, excluding oil, also expanded sharply, by 14.5 percent. 
 Food and beverage imports, calculated in dollars, rose 11 percent in the first 10 months of 2004. Over the same period, Americans bought $21.8 billion worth of German cars -- almost 9 percent more than in the period of 2003. 
 But if the dollar continues to fall, some of those numbers might start turning around as importers and distributors find they can no longer hold the line and start increasing prices more broadly. In that sense, the prized truffles from Europe, which are generally dug up individually using dogs or trained pigs with sensitive snouts, may be leading the way.
 ''The dollar clobbered us,'' said Lee Urbani, president of Urbani Truffles USA. ''It increased the prices to the point where people are not willing to try the product.''
 Fresh winter truffles from Europe are actually less expensive this year than last, when a heat wave devastated harvests. But they are still much more costly than they were two years ago. Restaurants will pay some $1,600 to $1,800 for a pound of white Alba truffles from Italy and some $600 to $800 for a pound of black truffles from France's Perigord. 
 And the price of preserved truffles has been increasing over the last few months with the speed of currency futures. ''I am raising prices every two weeks,'' said Christopher Poron, the president of Plantin USA -- a New Jersey importer and distributor of canned and fresh truffles.
 The trend is already eating into demand in New York's $7.5 million market -- the nation's biggest. Truffle products are ''harder and harder to sell,'' said Mr. Poron, noting that his business in truffles has contracted by 25 percent compared with 2002.
 Unlike Mr. Ripert at Le Bernardin, Michael Cetrulo, owner and chef of Scalini Fedeli, an upscale Manhattan Italian restaurant, has imposed surcharges of $35 to $40 for each truffle dish on his prix fixe menu -- up from $20 a couple of years ago.
 ''Customers are a little more hesitant to order truffles,'' Mr. Cetrulo said. ''It used to be that 10 percent of the customers had them. Now it's only three to five customers out of 100 tables.'' 
 The dollar's slide might have another lasting impact on American truffle lovers, opening wide the door for cheaper competitors in America's truffle market, including one from Oregon and another-- no surprise -- from China. 
 Top chefs tend to dislike the Asian version. ''It has no aromatic quality,'' Mr. Cetrulo said, a view echoed by Mr. Ripert, who flatly stated that ''it has no flavor.'' 
 But Connie Green, who owns Wine Forest, a distributor of mushrooms and other wild foods in the San Francisco Bay area, noted that this year she had sold 1,000 pounds of Chinese truffles.
 ''Restaurants and even my exceptionally affluent clientele,'' she said, ''are considering things they might have pooh-poohed before.''

HEADLINE: Christmas Past and Presents

BYLINE: By William B. Waits. 
William B. Waits is the author of ''The Modern Christmas in America: A Cultural History of Gift Giving.''

 BODY:
FINDING the perfect gift has long been a national pastime. But the celebration of Christmas, and the culture of gift giving that accompanies the holiday, have changed significantly in America over the years. Economic and social pressures have transformed how, and with whom, we celebrate Christmas, altering it from a holiday that was at times illegal, or limited to adult parties, or a gift-giving child-centered extravaganza like today's. 
 There are several popular misconceptions about the origins of the American version of the holiday. To start, Christmas was actually suppressed in New England's colonial days. The Puritans found no affirmative command to celebrate Christmas in the Bible and, being good Calvinists, frowned on the celebration. They even outlawed it for a time during the 17th century. Opposition to the holiday lingered well into the 19th century, when many New England children were required to attend school on Christmas Day. So take down your Currier & Ives prints of winter sleigh rides to Grandma's house in New England. True New England grandmas disdained Christmas -- well into the 1800's. 
 In contrast, the colonial South provided fruitful soil for importing the traditional English Christmas celebration to this continent. It was a festive and sometimes boisterous adult affair characterized by the Yule log, boar's head and wassail bowl. Southerners put the kids to bed and passed the bowl. During the 19th century, much of the revelry was gradually moved to New Year's Eve, so now it's put the kids to bed and pass the champagne flute. 
 The symbols of Christmas that we know today -- St. Nicholas, the Christmas tree and the wonderment of the holiday among children -- were brought from the old country by people living in the Middle Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Dutch, the Swedes of New Jersey and particularly the ''true Dutch'' of New York shared with their neighbors the traditions of their Northern European heritage, practices that have endured. 
 As the importance of New York City in national life increased with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, New Yorkers' ideas on celebrating Christmas circulated widely. Washington Irving made frequent use of New York settings and Christmas themes in his writings. Clement Clarke Moore supposedly wrote ''A Visit from St. Nicholas'' (which begins '' 'Twas the night before Christmas'') while a professor at General Theological Seminary. Beginning in the 1860's, the drawings of Santa Claus by Thomas Nast of New York firmly established the appearance of the Jolly Saint as a cultural icon. In 1912, New York City, along with Boston and Hartford, put up the nation's first community Christmas trees.
 Large New York area department stores, like Macy's and Bamberger's, played their part in particularly innovative ways. They Bambegan by hiring Santas for their stores throughout the season. Fittingly, the first school to train professional Santas was established in Albion, N.Y. in 1937. 
 Although the Christmas celebration existed in America from the settlers' earliest times, the holiday remained small in scale until the 19th century, when it began to play a larger role in national culture, building on the work of Moore, Nast, Irving and others. It achieved its much larger and truly modern scale only after the transformation of the holiday between 1880 and 1910.
 Before 1880, American culture was predominantly rural, including the way it celebrated Christmas. Rural Americans gave many Christmas gifts to their families and neighbors. Food, small pieces of woodwork and sewed items were the most popular. Gifts to the immediate family were more substantial than those given to friends, but they remained modest by later standards. While almost all of these gifts were handmade, that imposed no heavy burden on givers because, in a farm economy, they had several months of free time after the harvest to make them. 
 When rural Americans moved to the cities in pursuit of employment and the other attractions of urban life, they brought along their rural habits of gift giving. But their new jobs in factories or offices -- unrelated to the agricultural cycle -- left them with no off season to fashion presents. As a consequence, they bought small, inexpensive manufactured items to give to their families and their new urban friends. 
 Figurines and other ceramic pieces were typical, as were wall hangings, inexpensive jewelry and small craft pieces like a framed ''Home Sweet Home'' sampler. A magazine writer in 1913 described them as ''tawdry and gaudy gimcracks, flimsy gewgaws, ephemeral and unbeautiful; purchased often with lassitude, received with distaste, and soon relegated to the limbo of attic or ash heap.'''
 While gimcracks were most associated with gifts to friends, many gifts to relatives also qualified for this category. Spending differed little between gifts for friends or those for family. 
 In the first decade of the 20th century, people and organizations began to criticize this new pattern of gift-giving that had emerged in America's cities. Given the poor quality of the gimcracks and the considerable time that it took to purchase, wrap and deliver them, no wonder Progressive Era reformers looked for alternative ways to celebrate the holiday that were less burdensome and more gratifying. 
 That paved the way for Christmas cards, which became the ideal small gift for acquaintances and business associates. A survey of the mail system in 1911 reflected the shift, showing that the total number of items posted had increased while their total weight had dropped significantly. 
 Several other changes helped make the holiday less burdensome for workers. In 1906, the Consumer's League formed the Shop Early Campaign to discourage last-minute purchasing, a practice that strained everyone in the retail trade. The league also pressured stores to maintain regular store hours throughout the holiday season so that their employees could fully enjoy the celebration. They maintained and publicized a list of stores that complied in the hope of encouraging shoppers to choose them over stores that placed more burdens on their employees. 
 In 1912, Progressives also established the Society for the Prevention of Useless Giving (known as SPUG). Its goals were to curtail the presentation of gimcracks (which they regarded as inappropriate as expressions of mere acquaintanceship), and to curb the practice of store clerks giving presents to their supervisors ( the gifts were ''extorted'' rather than heartfelt). 
 The general success of the Progressives in reforming Christmas, as well as previous efforts to mold the festivities, supports the notion that the celebration can be changed, just like any other cultural phenomenon. So don't accept current complaints that Christmas has spun out of control and dictates our holiday behavior, driving us to ever-higher levels of spending. People can and should run the celebration, not the other way around.

HEADLINE: Europe's Moral Deficit

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Timothy Garton Ash rightly points out the growing power of the European Union in contrast to the United States, especially as it continues to add new members to its federation (''The Great Powers of Europe, Redefined,'' Op-Ed, Dec. 17). But unless the European Union finds an alternative underlying moral principle to its existence, its long-term success stands in danger of not surviving.
 History has shown that a moral or religious code respected by all is necessary for the long-term survival of a culture or civilization. In its Constitution, the European Union rejected the Christian moral code of its past, instead choosing as its underlying basis the sandy foundations of economics and of a conception of human dignity subject to the ever-changing demands of the will of the people. 
 As a result, while the European Union may grow more powerful in the immediate future, its long-term success hangs in jeopardy without a solid moral code in which it can root itself.

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae, After the Battle of Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
A measure of how deftly powerful people and institutions in Washington and on Wall Street wield their might is whether anyone catches them when they fall.
 On Tuesday evening, no one was there to catch Franklin D. Raines. Undone by outsize bookkeeping violations and years of jousting with regulators and legislators, Mr. Raines was forced aside as the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, the mortgage financing behemoth.
 Now, amid the wreckage of Mr. Raines's tenure, the question is how well the company itself can weather the storm. Its struggle will be played out in the halls of Congress as well as in corporate boardrooms. 
 As an institution, Fannie Mae provides much of the glue that helps hold the American mortgage market together. Rather than lending money to prospective homeowners, it buys mortgages from issuers, allowing the lenders to make further mortgages. 
 Fannie Mae's breadth has helped keep interest rates low, and its perceived stability has allowed home buyers to lock in rates for as long as 30 years -- something unheard of in most other countries.
 So Fannie Mae's fate, and any reorienting of the way it conducts business, will have effects on homeowners and world financial markets.
 Fannie Mae still faces a Department of Justice inquiry that raises the possibility of criminal charges against the company and its current or former executives.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission -- which ordered Fannie Mae to restate its earnings for the last four years, carrying the risk of capital reduction as great as $9 billion -- continues to investigate its business practices. 
 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, known as Ofheo, said Fannie Mae remained undercapitalized by almost $3 billion. And the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other Washington power brokers have underlined the threats that Fannie Mae and other government-sponsored entities pose to the well-being of the financial system, given how large and influential they have become.
 Josh Rosner, an analyst with Medley Advisors, a New York research firm, said: ''It is important to consider that there is not likely to be a 'global settlement' of Fannie's outstanding problems. We expect nothing to derail the ongoing Ofheo special examination, the D.O.J. investigations, the S.E.C. investigation,'' or the changes expected to slow the growth of government agency debt markets ''over the medium term.'' 
 ''It will likely be years,'' Mr. Rosner added, ''before the company has current financial statements.''
 Any company that may need years to generate reliable financial statements will face enormous challenges raising funds to maintain its market position, let alone to expand, be competitive and fulfill strategic goals.
 Investors, however, seemed to shrug off the possibility of further setbacks at the company yesterday. Fannie Mae's stock price rose $1.57, or more than 2 percent, to $71.92, and the spread between the yields on the company's debt and 10-year Treasury notes narrowed slightly.
 The tug of war that has gripped Fannie Mae in the last several months was political as much as financial. Behind concerns about its size and the burden that would be placed on taxpayers and the government, should it ever need to be bailed out, is a gritty reality: For years, Fannie Mae has fielded an armada of lobbyists and legislative aides that effectively crushed opposition to its business practices and silenced critics on Capitol Hill. 
 The accounting scandal at the company has given its critics in Congress and in the White House an opportunity to focus attention on Fannie Mae's overall structure and mission. 
 And these are issues that Mr. Raines's departure, and the resignation of his chief financial officer, J. Timothy Howard, do not resolve. 
 Among the most contentious issues likely to be addressed will be the creation of a new regulatory agency that will be empowered to monitor Fannie Mae more closely, and a longtime question about fully privatizing the company. 
 Fannie Mae enjoys an advantage in the mortgage market and in raising money because many investors think the federal government will provide financial support to the company if its viability is ever threatened.
 Also at issue will be Mr. Raines's past compensation and his severance pay. Ofheo and members of Congress have called for a review of his pay package. Mr. Raines's total compensation last year was $20 million. According to Fannie Mae's federal securities filings, he is eligible to receive a $1.1 million annual pension and can immediately be vested in stock options that were valued around $11 million at the end of last year. 
 ''Raines has been the very visible face of the company to Congress,'' said Bert Ely, a banking analyst in Alexandria, Va., and Fannie Mae critic, ''and Howard has been the face to the financial community, but getting rid of just two people doesn't change the culture. These departures are like amputating someone's leg at the ankle. There need to be more serious cultural changes, and Congress is likely to get much more serious about privatizing Fannie Mae.''
 Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has announced plans to hold hearings early next year about a new federal regulator for Fannie Mae. But, Mr. Ely said, it's ''not a slam dunk that we will get a new regulator, because, unlike the savings and loan problems in the late 80's, this is not a crisis.''
 The accounting problems that have tied Fannie Mae into a financial and regulatory knot are not likely to be limited to the company. Every financial services firm that uses the arcane, complex products known as derivatives to hedge the risks inherent in large mortgage portfolios is now subject to some of the same regulatory and accounting rebukes that the S.E.C. gave Fannie Mae.
 In particular, an obscure, complex accounting rule known as FAS 133, which governs hedging on mortgages, is open to widely divergent interpretations. It has proved unwieldy for financial managers of all stripes to put into practice.
 ''You've got a major loose cannon in the financial system,'' said Jonathan E. Gray, a financial analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, about FAS 133. ''Clearly, Raines did not comply with the accounting rule, not because he didn't try. What kind of an accounting rule is it when management tries to comply for a year and a half, and can't?
 ''It's an accounting rule that can't be met,'' added Mr. Gray, who personally owns Fannie Mae shares. ''It's too complicated. It's 200 pages long.''
 Other accounting issues at Fannie Mae may come to the surface as the various investigations of the company continue, so its bookkeeping problems may not be limited to FAS 133. 
 Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie Mae's acting chief executive and former chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview yesterday that in the near term his priorities would include the following:
 $(6$)Improving Fannie Mae's relationship with regulators, particularly Ofheo, by applying new capital requirements, changing auditors and restating earnings.
 $(6$)Making sure that Fannie Mae's board supports company goals.
 $(6$)Listening to and gauging investor, shareholder and customer concerns about the company.
 $(6$)Communicating effectively with Fannie Mae's 5,300 employees and improving morale as the company works through its problems.
 Mr. Mudd said he met with Armando Falcon Jr., Ofheo's director, yesterday morning. ''I promised him that we would do whatever we could to move that relationship in the right direction,'' he said. 
 To be sure, Fannie Mae appears to remain a financial powerhouse despite the prospective earnings restatements. It had income of $7.9 billion last year -- an increase of more than 70 percent from $4.6 billion in 2002. Its loan losses have plunged in the last decade, and its mortgage portfolio has expanded to about $900 billion last year from about $200 billion in 1993. 
 Mr. Howard is responsible for much of this record, and his departure from Fannie Mae clouds what many in the financial industries regard as a stellar performance in managing a very complicated business.
 Mr. Mudd declined to characterize how he views Fannie Mae's future.
 ''These are all big issues that we have to work on,'' he said. ''I would say that I've been doing this for 24 hours, and you'll need to follow up with me in the new year.''

HEADLINE: Tally for Washington Governor Tips to Democrat

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW; Eli Sanders contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
After a bitter and protracted recount fight in the Washington governor's race, elections officials announced Wednesday that the Democratic candidate, Christine O. Gregoire, was leading her Republican opponent by 10 votes -- a minuscule margin but a stunning reversal of the Nov. 2 election results. 
 The preliminary results elated Democratic Party officials and came only hours after the party scored another victory, when the State Supreme Court agreed with the Democrats' contention that more than 700 newly discovered and erroneously disqualified ballots in heavily Democratic King County should now be considered. 
 Since those ballots came from a county where Ms. Gregoire, 57, already had a solid lead, the ruling could allow her to increase her extraordinarily tiny edge in a race that is the closest in state history and one of the closest in the nation's history. 
 The day's events dealt a serious blow to state Republicans and Dino Rossi, 45, a businessman and former state senator, who had been certified the winner of the Nov. 2 vote after eking out a margin of 261 votes out of almost three million cast. He later won a machine recount by 42 votes. 
 Official results from the manual recount will not be announced until Thursday, after King County, which includes Seattle, reviews up to 735 disputed ballots. Republicans, who fought hard to keep those ballots out of the tally, were already vowing Wednesday to press election officials to consider several hundred other disqualified ballots cast in other counties. 
 Whatever the final results, they are almost certain to be contested. 
 ''This count, this election, is not over,'' said Chris Vance, the chairman of the state Republican Party. The Supreme Court, he said, ''basically threw the door open to start all over again. I think that's crazy.''
 He said Republicans planned to ''show up at 9 a.m.'' on Thursday ''on the doorstep of every county auditor with people whose votes weren't counted for Dino Rossi.''
 But the Democrats, who have waged an all-out war for their candidate in a state known more for politeness in politics than for the kind of partisan brawling that has dominated this contest, said they were confident that the recount had changed the outcome of a statewide election for the first time in state history. 
 ''We are confident that she has been elected governor,'' said Paul Berendt, chairman of the state Democratic Party, who has encouraged Mr. Rossi to concede. 
 At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Gregoire, looking upbeat for the first time since before the election, said she was not personally asking Mr. Rossi to concede. ''I leave the decision about conceding to Mr. Rossi,'' she said.
 Ms. Gregoire, the state attorney general, steered clear of proclaiming victory. ''It is too early to declare victory; although we are ahead right now, there are still hundreds of votes left to be counted,'' she said. 
 Mr. Rossi did not comment on Wednesday, but a spokeswoman, Mary Lane, said, ''Knowing how King County operates, it really is not over until the fat lady sings.''
 Under state law, if a second recount reverses the outcome of an election, the cost -- in this case $730,000 -- is then covered by the state. But the Democrats had raised almost $2 million from across the country to finance the effort, with help from Senator John Kerry and Howard Dean. 
 And in an election year that delivered Democrats so many bruising losses, the potential fall and rise of a Democrat in Washington would be a deliciously hard-won aberration. 
 Such an outcome would also be a personal victory for Mr. Berendt, the state party chairman.
 For the last few weeks, he has begun each morning with hard-charging confrontations on a 6 a.m. talk radio show with Mr. Vance, the Republican chairman, whom he described as a ''friend'' before the election. 
 ''It's time for Democrats somewhere to draw a line in the sand and say we are not going to let bully Republican tactics determine who our governor is or how an election is going to be determined,'' he said.
 Until the final days of the election, Ms. Gregoire had been favored to win easily in a state that has not elected a Republican governor since 1980. But Mr. Rossi, hammering the state's struggling economy, burst into the lead and ultimately won by 261 votes, such a slim margin that it triggered an automatic recount. 
 Mr. Berendt said Washington Democrats had decided from the start that what he described as Al Gore's ''nice guy'' approach was not to be the tactic here. 
 ''I don't think there's any doubt that people are empowered by this whole thing,'' said Representative Jim McDermott, one of the state's most prominent Democrats. ''The feeling of many of us is they quit too soon in Ohio. We don't know what happened there, but we said, 'By God, they're not going to do that in Washington.'''
 The Democrats repeatedly went to court to challenge the Republicans. The party's communications director, Kirstin Brost, fired off a daily stream of news releases with biting words for Mr. Rossi, calling him a thief and the ''accidental governor-elect'' and deriding him for his ''HypocRossi.''
 Meanwhile, the Republicans were accusing Democrats of doing the bullying, of refusing to accept Mr. Rossi's two victories and of stopping at nothing to turn the election around. 
 ''I think what's going on more than anything is the realization that they could actually lose this race and that we would change what is happening in this state,'' said Diane Tebelius, a lawyer for the Washington Republican Party. 
 Mr. Vance said he thought Democrats, licking their wounds, were trying to make an example of Washington. ''The Democrats have this perception that they didn't fight hard enough in Florida, they didn't fight hard enough in Ohio, and by God, this time they're going to go down fighting,'' he said. 
 But he said he thought the fight here would backfire. 
 ''I think what they've done is they've alienated people in the state of Washington, and I think it's going to do long-term damage to the Democratic Party,'' he said.
 The State Supreme Court, hearing an appeal of a case decided last week by a lower court, on Wednesday ruled that ballots that had been disqualified in King County because election workers initially found no matching signatures on voter registration cards in their files were not ''fully examined.'' Republicans argued that King County was trying to ''expand the universe of ballots'' after the election and that it was too late to go back and correct errors. But the justices, who ruled for the Republicans in another case last week, this time threw tough questions at them.
 ''You're looking at it from the point of view of the winner or the loser,'' Justice Susan Owens said. ''Shouldn't we be looking at it from the point of view of the voter?'' 
 Caught in the middle of the fight was the secretary of state, Sam Reed, a Republican who went through his own recount in his re-election in 2000. 
 Mr. Reed's office sided with the Democrats and argued before the Supreme Court that the King County ballots should be reviewed, irking other members of his party. But the Democrats often said he would potentially be too sympathetic to the Republicans because of his party affiliation, he said.
 Mr. Reed, who is expected to certify the results soon, said he fully expected them to be contested. 
 He added, ''Election administrators often say, 'I don't care who wins, as long as someone wins.'''

HEADLINE: Republican Plans Challenge To Bloomberg in Primary

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
Steve Shaw was once the president of his co-op board, the only elected office he said he had ever held, and now he wants to be mayor of New York City.
 Mr. Shaw, 30, an investment banker with a Canadian firm in Midtown Manhattan, is planning to run in a Republican primary against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
 Mr. Shaw is young, a relative newcomer to the city, having moved here eight years ago, and is low on campaign money, but he does have a Web site, a few thousand dollars in his campaign account and the conviction that he may just beat the mayor.
 ''I believe this is a very winnable election,'' said Mr. Shaw, who lives with his wife in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ''If you are a Republican voter, you want to support the people who believe in what you do.''
 Mr. Shaw may be a dreamer, but he does have a rationale. New York Republican primaries draw very few voters. In 2001, when Mr. Bloomberg was challenged by Herman Badillo, 66,531 Republicans, about 14.4 percent of registered Republicans, actually cast a ballot in that primary race. So by Mr. Shaw's calculation, he has to reach out to only a relatively small group of people, and win them over, to knock Mr. Bloomberg off the Republican line. And he figures that the party faithful who turn out to vote in a primary will support him because ''I'm the only Republican in the race.''
 While Mr. Bloomberg's Democratic rivals are beating him up for being a Republican, Mr. Shaw plans to try to attack him for being too much like a Democrat, which Mr. Bloomberg was before switching parties to run for mayor in the 2001 race.
 Then, when he is heralded as a David for slaying Goliath, Mr. Shaw figures, he will have enough momentum to carry him past a Democratic nominee and into City Hall.
 ''After I defeat Mayor Bloomberg in the Republican primary, I will show people I have the characteristics that people want, to accomplish the unaccomplishable,'' Mr. Shaw said. His ideas include making the city more hospitable to business, reducing its tax burden and relaxing the smoking ban in some bars.
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides said they had not heard of Mr. Shaw, but did not take the opportunity, as they so often do with those who challenge them, to insult or dismiss him. Whether Mr. Bloomberg likes it or not, he may find himself forced into a primary, no matter how mismatched the competition. It takes just 7,500 signatures on a petition to get on the ballot.
 Kevin Sheekey, a close adviser to the mayor who is expected to take over as Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, said, ''New York is at a population all-time high, and crime is at a 40-year low,'' and added that the unemployment rate is also relatively low. 
 ''Anyone that wants to improve on the record is welcome to try,'' he said.
 But even if the mayor should lose a Republican primary, he will probably remain on the ballot because he has courted the Independence Party, on whose ballot line he received 59,000 votes in 2001.
 Mr. Shaw says he is undeterred by the financial resources of Mr. Bloomberg, who spent $20 million to win the Republican primary in 2001. 
 ''To print out about 1,500 palm cards cost me about $279,'' Mr. Shaw said.

HEADLINE: No Price Too High For a Lap of Luxury

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
IN a city where the price of luxury seems to march inexorably upward, wealthy apartment buyers are showing they are just as prone to the herd mentality as mere mortals rushing to buy the same iPod or pair of Diesel jeans.
 Last week the media billionaire Rupert Murdoch agreed to pay $44 million for a co-op on Fifth Avenue. It turns out that sale was no fluke. From Manhattan to Woodside, Calif., the market for multimillion-dollar properties is increasingly buoyant. 
 In October, Ronald O. Perelman, the Revlon chairman, sold his Mediterranean-style house on seven acres in Palm Beach for $70 million. That same month, a 16-room triplex penthouse at the Pierre hotel in New York went on the market, also for $70 million. 
 In Manhattan the number of sales of condos or co-ops at $5 million or more rose to 163 in 2004, a record number, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a New York real estate appraiser. Brokers say that since Thanksgiving apartments selling for more than $10 million have ignited bidding wars and frantic showings.
 ''It's a peculiar behavior,'' said Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage in Manhattan. ''It's as if they all go to the same cocktail party and say 'Are we going to shop tomorrow?' ''
 Because the stock market has been more volatile than real estate in recent years, ''people feel more comfortable than ever before having a higher percentage of their portfolio than ever before in their home,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of the real estate firm Brown Harris Stevens in Manhattan.
 According to a survey by Capgemini, a consulting company, and Merrill Lynch, high net worth individuals -- those with assets of $1 million or more -- put 17 percent of their portfolios in real estate in 2003, up from 15 percent in 2002.
 Louise Sunshine, president of the Sunshine Group, a luxury condominium marketing company, said she was locked to the phone all of Sunday, negotiating with three bidders vying for a penthouse condominium atop the new Bloomberg Tower on 58th Street with an asking price of $26 million.
 While low interest rates have kept the market for one- and two-bedroom apartments humming for four years, the highest reaches of New York's rarefied real estate market softened after the Sept. 11 attacks, the dot-com bust and a string of accounting scandals that sent the stock market spiraling. 
 At a time of relentless speculation over whether a bubble in real estate prices could be ready to pop, the wealthiest buyers are shopping for living space again, lured by the general pattern of rising sales prices over the last four years. 
 Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, the New York real estate company, said more than 20 people had asked to see a $30 million six-story town house on 64th Street near Fifth Avenue. ''Normally we would get half that,'' she said. ''In my 20 years in the business, I've never seen as many qualified buyers for $20 million apartments as I'm seeing now.'' 
 Michele Kleier, a co-president of Gumley Haft Kleier, a real estate brokerage firm in New York, said what many people are thinking: ''There seem to be more and more rich people. Where are they all coming from?'' Successful hedge fund managers, bankers who expect huge Wall Street bonuses and Europeans capitalizing on the weak dollar, other brokers say.
 The revived market seems to have motivated the seller of the penthouse at the Pierre. The apartment features a living room, once a ballroom, with 23-foot ceilings; five wood-burning fireplaces; and four corner terraces. Oh, and did someone mention monthly maintenance fees of $47,767? 
 In the Hamptons, said Diane Saatchi, a broker in the East Hampton, N.Y., office of Corcoran, buyers snapped up 37 homes priced at $5 million or above through October, compared with 29 during all of last year. 
 In Northern California, where the bursting of the tech bubble in early 2000 humbled the real estate market, high rollers are back. ''A lot of people who were sitting on the sidelines after 2000 now have the confidence to buy in that price range,'' said Avram Goldman, president of Coldwell Banker San Francisco Bay Area. He pointed to the initial public offering at Google this fall, a bonanza for about 1,000 employees who are now millionaires. In just the last month, Mr. Goldman said, two homes sold in Woodside, south of San Francisco, for close to $10 million each. ''We haven't seen a lot of those sales in a while,'' he noted. 
 Gregory Weadock, a managing partner of Barclays International Realty in Palm Beach, Fla., said a house there sold this year for $30 million. At the time it was deemed the peak. But then several other houses sold for even more. Now, Mr. Weadock said, ''$30 million doesn't seem that prohibitive.''
 Donald Trump paid $41.4 million this month for the Gosman estate in Palm Beach, six acres with a 7-bedroom, 16-bath main house and three guesthouses along 475 feet of ocean frontage. Mr. Trump said he hoped to renovate the main house and sell it for $100 million within a year.
 ''There's nothing like real estate,'' he said with characteristic bravado.
 Mr. Trump, who is still trying to sell apartments at Trump World Tower in Manhattan, four years after they went on the market, added, ''No matter what you paid for the best, it's always worth more money the following year.''
 Perhaps. One broker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying she did not want to be barred from selling in Trump buildings, handled the sale of an apartment last month in Trump World Tower that went for less than the owner had paid for it. She blamed a surplus of available apartments in the building. 
 Mr. Trump acknowledged that there are a ''very few'' apartments for sale in the building, but, he said, ''I've sold $600 million worth of apartments in that building. That building has been a spectacular success.'' He added that, overall, apartments in Trump World Tower have escalated in value by about 50 percent since it opened in early 2001.
 Deluxe apartments are also still for sale at the Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle, Trump Park Avenue and the St. Regis hotel on 55th Street.
 Yet developers in New York are rushing to build lavish condominiums. Just recently a condo conversion was undertaken at the former Helmsley Windsor Hotel on 58th Street.
 One broker wondered out loud if a glut was looming. According to his survey of recent real estate listings, there are currently 262 condos priced at $5 million or more for sale in New York. 
 But for some buyers the hunt is on. A few weeks ago Ms. Kleier, of Gumley Haft Kleier, helped a buyer topple the competition in a battle for a town house in the Carnegie Hill neighborhood. Two weeks later, she said, the broker representing the losing bidder called to offer Ms. Kleier's client the winning bid plus $500,000. Ms. Kleier's client declined. The losing bidder then offered to pay $1 million more than Ms. Kleier's client had paid. 
 ''Something is always that much more desirable because you know someone else wants it,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Congress May Seek Tougher Regulatory Limits

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
The ouster of Franklin D. Raines as chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, the mortgage finance giant, might provide an opening for long-time critics to impose regulatory restrictions or even push the government-sponsored company toward full privatization, analysts said.
 Senator Richard K. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the banking committee, said on Wednesday that Mr. Raines's departure would almost certainly give Congress renewed impetus to crack down on Fannie Mae, the nation's largest source of financing for home mortgages.
 The dismissal ''does not obviate the need for enhanced regulation,'' he said in a statement, adding that ''if anything, this change in management reinforces the need for comprehensive regulatory reform.'' 
 Similarly in the House, Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican and member of the financial services committee, said he would reintroduce legislation early next year to create a new regulatory agency for government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and its smaller brother, Freddie Mac.
 The legislation, expected to have the strong backing of the Bush administration, would grant the agency the power to bar such companies from creating new lines of business, a move that Mr. Raines has opposed, saying it could raise the cost of borrowing money for new homeowners.
 Mr. Baker said that Mr. Raines's departure was an implicit acknowledgement that ''things are not well.'' The management shake-up, following a finding last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company had violated two accounting rules, raised such serious questions about the company's safety and soundness, Mr. Baker said, that critics ''won't argue with us anymore.''
 ''This is very instructional for Congress,'' he said. ''The system has not worked, we need to change it dramatically, and we can do it now while interest rates are still extraordinarily low.''
 Indeed, the day after the departures of Mr. Raines and J. Timothy Howard, the company's chief financial officer, even Fannie Mae allies like Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, were calling for tougher regulations, though not if they impinged on helping low-income Americans acquire mortgages.
 ''I want them to be better regulated, but not at the expense of housing,'' Mr. Frank said. ''I'm afraid that the right wing will use Frank Raines's mistakes and inappropriate actions to go after housing and to restrict Fannie Mae over all in the amount of activity it engages in.''
 The biggest legislative battles ahead will probably focus on the extent to which it can branch out into new areas of business, how much capital it is required to keep as a reserve against potential losses and the extent to which it will continue to enjoy government-granted advantages. There are also questions over the scope and powers of any new regulatory agency.
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which operate two of the most powerful and sophisticated lobbying organizations in the capital, have successfully beaten back previous attempts at tighter regulation. Together, they spent $11.7 million during the first half of this year lobbying against further control, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign finance and lobbying.
 The companies' influence stems largely from the perception that, with their billions of dollars of credit with the Treasury, the government would bail them out if they became insolvent. 
 Created by the federal government in the 1938, Fannie Mae become a private company in 1968. Once the Federal National Mortgage Association, it is now formally known by its nickname and its shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Today, Fannie Mae, based in Washington, is the nation's second-biggest borrower of money, after the United States government. This advantage has been a huge source of resentment by the nation's other big mortgage, banking and savings institutions.
 ''The fear among other mortgage industry players is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to keep up with their promised growth, will creep into different aspects of originating loans,'' said Jonathan G.S. Koppell, a professor at the Yale School of Management who has studied quasi-governmental financial institutions.
 ''The banking industry has a lot to lose if Fannie starts picking off its business, and it's hard to compete with them because Fannie can borrow money more cheaply.''
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said that Fannie Mae should be privatized, a move strongly opposed by housing advocates like Mr. Frank, who fear that the loan money would dry up and leave thousands of Americans unable to afford housing. The question is whether the recent spate of bad news has made Fannie Mae more vulnerable to regulation, and how far the ouster of top officials will go to appease its critics.
 Mr. Koppell, who is the author of ''The Politics of Quasi-Government'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), said he expected change of some sort, but he would not predict how radical it might be.
 ''Some say that these recent events open the door to full privatization, but that seems highly unlikely, in part because of the political power that Fannie Mae still wields,'' he said. ''But something is likely to happen. Fannie Mae is quite powerful, but it's not omnipotent. While it has a lot of political juice, the reality staring Congress in the face is that this is potentially a multitrillion-dollar problem.''

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Waterfront Park Inches Closer

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
After several false starts, state and city officials are set to sign off on a new, final master plan for the Downtown Brooklyn waterfront that would include playing fields, a marina, stores and a new residential and commercial hub at the foot of Atlantic Avenue.
 The plan for the 1.3-mile shoreline park from Dumbo to Cobble Hill is a crucial step forward for an often contentious decade-long effort to develop the area, an effort that has frequently fallen victim to community disagreements and bureaucratic delays. This time around, officials believe that they have broken the logjam and can finally move ahead with the park.
 The design scheme, by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, calls for a succession of hills, open plazas and recreation zones snaking along the water and a series of canals and boardwalks winding around and above the piers. The development would include shaded sports fields atop existing piers, 10 acres of water for kayakers, marshland habitats, playgrounds, restaurants and stores. A new hotel with housing would go up near the Brooklyn Bridge, as well as residential developments in Dumbo and on Atlantic Avenue. 
 The plans being prepared by the Brooklyn Bridge Park Development Corporation will open the formal design phase and allow an environmental review to be completed, which would, officials hope, enable the corporation to take possession of land for the project by sometime next year. Then, construction could begin.
 ''It represents a lot,'' Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said of this latest phase. ''We had to figure out what we could build with the money that we had available, and then we had to know how much revenue we would be getting'' from the restaurants and other retail outlets. 
 Officials at the development corporation ''not only want to have a park that people will like, but they want to use this unusual occasion to also build a great park,'' said Mr. Van Valkenburgh, whose firm is also working on part of Hudson River Park on the West Side of Manhattan. To create something ''like the romantic parks of Olmsted and Vaux'' meant thinking about how to make a great park that reflects ''what's different about the time we live in and who we are.''
 To that end, Mr. Van Valkenburgh and his team have planned a park that could easily accommodate several kinds of activities, he said, while overcoming the physical limitations of the long, skinny space and its marginal location under the roaring Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
 Some of the new buildings and structures, for instance, would function as landmarks that, like the bridges, would help orient visitors in the park and draw them through it. Walkways that run below the piers would bring people down to the water and away from the noise of the highway. The businesses associated with the park would cover the costs of maintaining it, officials said, as well as make it into an all-weather attraction.
 ''We see building a spectacular park there as having tremendous economic value,'' said Joshua J. Sirefman, director of the mayor's office of economic development and rebuilding. ''This is a critical piece of making it a great destination,'' he added, calling it a ''major driver for activity'' on the waterfront.
 Several times since the completion of the first master plan, in 2000, construction seemed to be about to start. On a raw spring day in 2002, for example, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg joined a bevy of other officials on an East River pier in Brooklyn to announce the formation of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Development Corporation and the commitment of $85 million in state funds and $65 million from the city to build the park.
 Groundbreaking was to begin in a year, they said then, and the park would take eight more years to complete. A little more than a year later, the development corporation released a design scheme, called the Concept Plan, which built on the first master plan.
 Within a few months, a parking lot where the city built a playground in 2001 was transformed into a park, and it seemed that a ribbon of green snaking from Jay Street to Atlantic Avenue would soon come into view.
 Officials concede that there have been delays and point to the complications of acquiring the land for the park. They say things have progressed more quickly since Wendy Leventer quietly replaced James Moogan as president of the development corporation in March. Still, speed in creating an 80-acre waterfront park is a relative concept.
 ''Because we're government, we don't do anything in under a year,'' Ms. Leventer said. Once the environmental study is completed, probably by next fall, officials said, the corporation can begin identifying developers and making deals.
 ''We're thinking that if we're lucky there's not going to be a shovel in the ground until '08, just because that's the way the timing goes,'' Ms. Leventer said, adding that construction would take another three to four years.
 ''Which,'' Mr. Van Valkenburgh added, ''is pretty fast.''

HEADLINE: In Roaring China, Sweaters Are West of Socks City

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: DATANG, China 

 BODY:
You probably have never heard of this factory town in coastal China, and there is no reason why you should have. But it fills your sock drawer. 
 Datang produces an astounding nine billion pairs of socks each year -- more than one set for every person on the planet. People here fondly call it Socks City, and its annual socks festival attracts 100,000 buyers from around the world.
 Southeast from here is Shenzhou, which is the world's necktie capital. To the west is Sweater City and Kid's Clothing City. To the south, in the low-rent district, is Underwear City. 
 This remarkable specialization, one city for each drawer in your bureau, reflects the economies of scale and intense concentration that have helped turn China into a garment behemoth. On Jan. 1, a new trade regime will end the decades-old system of country-by-country quotas that divide the world's exports among roughly 150 countries. Now, China is banking on its immense size and efficient operators to grab an even larger share of the world's clothing orders. 
 Neither Adam Smith nor Karl Marx could possibly have imagined that this kind of capitalism would evolve from a communist system in quite this way, with an obscure town in the middle of nowhere becoming the world's socks capital. But these days, buyers from New York to Tokyo want to be able to buy 500,000 pairs of socks all at once, or 300,000 neckties, 100,000 children's jackets, or 50,000 size 36B bras. And increasingly, the places that best accommodate those kinds of orders are China's giant new specialty cities. 
 The abolition of quotas is expected to accelerate this trend over the next decade or so, particularly under the guidance of China's visible hand. The niche cities reflect China's ability to form ''lump'' economies, where clusters or networks of businesses feed off each other, building technologies and enjoying the benefits of concentrated support centers -- like the button capital nearby, which furnishes most of the buttons on the world's shirts, pants and jackets. 
 The new era, thus, offers a glimpse into how China's fast-paced economy is developing into more than just a beehive of individual private enterprises. Beyond the entrepreneurial vigor so palpable here, the textile business is a prime example of how the Chinese government's attempt to guide development more indirectly through local planning instead of outright state ownership is starting to pay off in a big way. 
 China is not just becoming the leader of the pack. In many ways, it hopes to run away with as much of the market as possible.
 New import limits by the United States, along with other external and internal forces, are expected to hamper China's progress in apparel and textiles for several years, if not longer. That should allow several other countries to maintain vigorous garment industries as well. But there is little question that China will ultimately be the dominant force in the business, and the growth of its industrial enclaves here highlights just how powerful a force China's industries are becoming in almost every sector they have entered.
 In the late 1970's, Datang was little more than a rice farming village with 1,000 people, who gathered in small groups and stitched socks together at home, and then sold them in baskets along the highway.
 Back then, government officials branded Datang's sock makers as capitalists and ordered them to stop selling socks. Now, they produce over a third of the world's output, and the government has nothing but praise for such entrepreneurs and their domination of the sock business.
 ''If the restrictions are dropped, there'll be even more production here,'' says one government official, Weiming Feng, the town's deputy party secretary and an official at the city's sock market.
 Signs of Datang's rise as a socks capital are everywhere. The center of town is filled with a huge government-financed marketplace for socks. The rice paddies have given way to rows of paved streets lined with cookie-cutter factories. Banners promoting socks are draped across buildings. And each year, Datang is decorated with balloons and flags for the annual sock fair. 
 And rags-to-riches tales abound in Datang. Just ask Dong Ying Hong, who in the 1970's gave up a $9-a-month job as an elementary-school teacher to make socks at home. Now, she is the owner of Zhejiang Socks -- and a sock millionaire.
 Hai Yun Shi, the 41-year-old founder of Hongyun Socks, has a similar tale.
 ''I started out making socks by hand when I was 18,'' he said at the company's headquarters. ''In '96 we founded this company. Now, we have a contract with Wal-Mart.''
 These kinds of gains have sharply eroded America's old sock-making might. American textile companies filed a petition earlier this year asking Washington to place limits on Chinese sock imports. Hoping to ease trade tensions, the Chinese government said in early December that it would voluntarily add tariffs on some of its own textile and apparel exports to reduce their competitive thrust. 
 That is one reason, among others, why many specialists believe that China's wallop will not come all at once. 
 ''It won't happen overnight,'' said Bruce Rockowitz, president of Li & Fung, a Hong Kong company that is one of the world's largest apparel distributors. ''It's not a big movement to China right now for retailers. There's too much uncertainty.''
 Smaller countries, like Bangladesh and Cambodia -- which feared they could not keep up with China -- are breathing easier. At least for now.
 Still, China already accounts for about 16 percent of all apparel imports into the United States. And several studies project that in the next few years, once all the limits are lifted, that figure could soar to 50 percent to 70 percent. 
 ''There's no question, at the end of the day, China ends up a much bigger player in the global apparel business,'' said David Weil, an associate professor of economics at Boston University. 
 Textile and apparel makers in China have long been preparing for the coming boom. In recent years, they have invested billions of dollars in new factories along the country's eastern seaboard, particularly here in the Yangtze River Delta. 
 Many of the old government-owned operations are gone. Private enterprises are importing high-end machinery and luring millions of peasants from the countryside.
 Since the early 1980's, when China began moving to a market economy, much of its competitive advantage was built on low-cost labor. Companies spend about 92 cents an hour for each worker in China, versus $1.20 in Thailand, $1.70 in Mexico and about $21.80 in the United States, according to a study by Goldman Sachs. Among big exporters, only India, at about 70 cents an hour, is cheaper. 
 Investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea were among the first to come. But in recent years, Chinese entrepreneurs set up their own shops, starting out with small stitching operations and quickly expanding into gigantic factories.
 For instance, Shengzhou, now popularly known in Chinese as International Necktie City, developed after a Hong Kong investor moved his necktie operations there in 1985 and brought modern tie-making techniques to the city. That was only a few years after China opened itself to capitalism when Deng Xiaoping in 1978 declared, ''To get rich is glorious.''
 Later, some of the company's managers broke away to start their own tie companies. And within a decade, Shengzhou was awash in tie makers and suppliers. 
 Similar stories can be heard throughout the province of Zhejiang, which is considered one of this country's most enterprising regions.
 But textile specialists say China's boom is not simply the product of the newfound entrepreneurialism that is sweeping this country; it is also the nation's ability to form what are called lump economies, focused on one product.
 Savvy entrepreneurs started out by luring suppliers, like fabric, dye or tool makers, to their cities, and as these clusters grew, they attracted more local investors who competed by trying to further specialize in socks or jeans production.
 ''The clusters are getting more and more specialized,'' says Qingliang Gu, a professor of textile economics at Donghua University in Shanghai. ''It's a little like Italy, where you have the city of Como making silk fabric, Vicenza with fine wool and Veneto for knitting.''
 The Chinese government has also played a crucial role, opening huge swaths of land for development, forming giant industrial parks, doling out tax benefits and developing the infrastructure and transportation networks needed to move products quickly to market. 
 ''The textile cities started initially from the spontaneous development of private companies,'' said Chunyi Xie, an economist at the Shanghai Garment Trade Association. ''But when it reached certain dimensions it drew attention from the government.'' 
 Private companies, with the support of the government, now build huge textile factory complexes, complete with dormitories, hospitals and even curfews to replace the state role in providing food, shelter and health care, along with close supervision. Many textile companies in the province of Jiangsu house and feed thousands of migrant workers who are bused in from the countryside, often for three- or four-year factory stints.
 The campus of the Huafang Group, one of China's largest textile companies, has over 100 factory buildings, 30,000 employees and round-the-clock operations.
 On any day, it teems with more than 20,000 workers, who live free of charge in Huafang's dormitories. Conditions are hardly heavenly, but they are often a step up for these workers, who are mostly young women from poorer inland provinces like Anhui or Henan. Many of them come here after high school, intending to stay for a few years before returning home to be married.
 Then, after those women return home, another 10,000 or so are bused in from the countryside, beginning yet another cycle in the pool of migrant labor that perpetually feeds China's bustling mills.
 ''When we need new workers,'' said Wei Xin Shi, a Huafang Group executive, ''we just announce it and people here call home and tell their friends to come to work at our factories.''
 Yun Liu, 23, is one of those workers. She left a small town in northern Jiangsu four years ago. Now, she makes $130 a month in Huafang's cotton spinning mill, where she spins raw cotton into fine threads eight hours a day.
 ''I really like being here,'' she said one afternoon outside the factory. ''It's a stable job, and I like the environment.''
 Few places on earth can match the sheer scale and variety of textile and apparel companies clustering in this region.
 ''In terms of vertical supply chain, China has no competition,'' says Ruizhe Sun, president of the China Textile Information Center, a government-sponsored agency in Beijing. ''We have button makers, fabric makers, thread makers, zipper makers, you name it.''
 That situation is luring investors and competitors from other parts of the world.
 ''A few years ago, when I came here there were no Italians,'' said Ellen Zhou, a Chinese citizen now working for a textile company based in Thiene, Italy. ''Now they're everywhere, in the hotels, at the cafes.''
 Chinese textile executives, however, are well aware of the risks of overexpansion. And there are other problems looming as well. The market for labor has tightened in the past year, pushing up wages.
 Companies and even government officials have long ferried migrant workers into Zhangjiagang from the nearby province of Anhui, many of whom were willing to work for $4 a day. But recently some factories have been struggling to find workers, and many executives say they expect wages to rise.
 ''We feel labor costs are going up,'' Jianhong Gu, vice general manager of Pukun Textile, a Zhangjiagang suit maker whose factories operate 24 hours a day. ''There's tremendous competition.''
 Moreover, foreign designers and retailers are keen to keep a network of business ties with other countries with relatively modern factories, like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
 Fred Abernathy, a researcher at the Center for Textile and Apparel Research at Harvard, says retailers in the United States will continue to buy quantities of textiles and apparel close to home, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, because of the need for ''just in time'' delivery for some items. 
 He also expects specialty clothing and textiles operations to continue to survive in New York, North Carolina, France and Italy. But, he concedes, ''China will gain over the long run.''
 Jinfei Wang, the chairman of the Jiangsu Diao Garment factory in Tongzhou, just outside Nantong, says there's no doubt about that.
 ''I've been to factories all over the world,'' he said in a recent interview while walking his own bustling factory floor, observing women's suits destined for J.C. Penney stores. ''And we can compete with any of them. Without restrictions, certainly China is going to be No.1.''

HEADLINE: Murder Toll In New York Declines Again

BYLINE: By SHAILA K. DEWAN

 BODY:
Homicides in New York City are down more than 5 percent as the year draws to a close, continuing a remarkable 14-year decline that has long confounded experts. Five of the other six major crime categories have also dropped. 
 As of yesterday morning, with barely more than a week to go in 2004, there had been 549 slayings in the city, down from 579 in the same period last year and from 2,245 in all of 1990, at the height of the crack epidemic. In all, 597 people were slain in the city in 2003. 
 A few of the country's largest cities have improved on New York's decline, notably Chicago, with a stunning 25 percent decrease in homicides from last year to this year. In the first six months of the year, cities with populations over a million drove their homicide rate down an average of 8.7 percent, according to F.B.I. statistics. But experts say that those cities, many of which have adopted New York's crime-fighting strategies, are playing catch-up, while New York is trimming the fat ever closer to the bone.
 ''When you lose weight, it's always easier to lose the first pounds than the latter pounds,'' said Eli Silverman, a professor of police studies at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ''What other cities have done is quite remarkable, but on the other hand it has to be taken into consideration where they were before. The fact that New York still went down is even more remarkable.''
 In the country's 10 largest cities, the homicide rate (the number of murders per 100,000 people each year) was 12.4, according to the F.B.I.'s most recent data. In New York, it was 6.8.
 New York's overall number of serious crimes also declined, by 4.6 percent, with only one category, grand larceny, increasing. The drop in crime has defied the expectations of criminologists, many of whom warned of an uptick as the economy slowed after 1999. 
 The numbers are a boon for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is likely to point to them as one of the concrete achievements of his administration as he runs for re-election next year, and for his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly.
 The drop comes despite the fact that the New York City Police Department is somewhat smaller than it was at times during the last 10 years, down to 37,000 from roughly 40,000, and the fact that the department is focused on preventing terrorism in addition to fighting crime.
 Still, some say New Yorkers have come to expect an ever-safer city even as that becomes harder to provide. The declines are inevitably slowing, and Compstat, the Police Department's vaunted and imitated accountability system, has in effect made the department a victim of its own success by focusing on percentage drops from one year to the next. 
 In 2001, the newspaper columnist Jack Newfield suggested that a homicide count below 600 would be worth a ticker tape parade. If things stay on course, 2004 will be the third year in a row that the city has met that goal.
 ''The good news is how far we've come, and the disappointing part is that we can't seem to go much lower than this number,'' said Andrew Karmen, a sociologist who has extensively analyzed the factors affecting New York's crime rate, from drug use and unemployment to the size of the police force.
 Even Commissioner Kelly acknowledged yesterday that there was a limit to crime reduction. 
 ''There's always unfortunately going to be a core number of homicides that law enforcement can't do very much about,'' he said.
 The numbers bear this out -- the percentage of killings that happen on the street has gone down, to 33 percent from 40 percent last year, while the percentage in homes and housing projects has increased slightly, according to a new Police Department homicide and shooting database maintained by the Deputy Commissioner of Operations, Garry F. McCarthy.
 Mr. Kelly attributes much of the decline in homicide to the increasingly precise deployment of resources. Operation Impact, for example, pinpoints the city's most troubled blocks and floods them with uniformed officers and anticrime squads. 
 ''Our homicides are down in the domestic violence area, down as far as gang-related incidents are concerned,'' he said yesterday. ''Impact focuses on those areas where you have that gang activity.''

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Rebounded in November

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods rebounded in November and last week's jobless claims rose by 17,000, to 333,000, which was less than expected, according to reports yesterday from the Commerce and Labor Departments. Consumer confidence reached its highest level in 11 months in a survey by the University of Michigan.
 In addition, Americans spent and earned more money in November. Commerce Department figures for November showed gains of 0.2 percent in personal spending, 0.3 percent in incomes and 1.6 percent in orders for durable goods like aircraft, computers and other products made to last three years or more. 
 Another Commerce Department report was less optimistic: new-home sales declined 12 percent in November, to a rate of 1.125 million, after reaching a record in October.
 ''The basic message of all these reports today is that the economy is in line for solid, above-average growth,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio.
 ''The housing sector has probably peaked, but the level of activity is still extremely high and other sectors such as capital spending will pick up the slack,'' Mr. Mayland said. ''That will provide the juice for continued above-average growth.''
 The percentage of decline in sales of new homes was the steepest in more than a decade, in part reflecting October figures that had been adjusted higher by more than 50,000 homes, economists said. The median price dropped to $206,300 from $224,700.
 Consumer confidence rose to 97.1 this month from 92.8 in November in the University of Michigan's survey. December's figure was the highest since last January.
 The rise in confidence and the fifth consecutive increase in spending suggest consumers are comforted by job growth and rising incomes. There are 2.7 million people on unemployment rolls, close to the lowest levels since 2001, the Labor Department said. 
 The gain in personal spending came after a 0.8 percent increase in October that was larger than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said. Economists predicted gains of 0.3 percent for spending and 0.2 percent for incomes.
 The increase in orders for durable goods, to $198.9 billion, came after a 0.9 percent decline in October that was smaller than first reported. After the October adjustment, orders exceeded the median forecast of about $197.5 billion. Excluding transportation equipment, orders for durable goods fell 0.8 percent after a decline of 1.3 percent. The increase in spending suggests income growth is enough to fuel demand.
 Retail sales unexpectedly rose in November, the Commerce Department said on Dec. 13, helping allay concern about a slow start to the holiday shopping season. The year-end pace may hinge on what shoppers do this week and next.
 Many retailers, however, are not taking any chances, cutting prices by half on some items.
 ''There's a little heftier economy,'' Maureen Bausch, vice president for business development at the largest United States shopping center, the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., said. ''People are more comfortable. Retailers are buying right, and they are pricing right.''
 The increases in interest rates that the Federal Reserve began in June may be starting to slow sales of new and existing homes late in this record-setting year, economists said. The supply of unsold homes was the highest since February 2003, the Commerce Department said. November's drop in housing starts was the most in almost 11 years, the government said last week.
 The prospect of ''steadily rising rates has already begun to chill the housing sector,'' Anthony Chan, an economist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio, said. ''Many prospective homebuyers who are taking on adjustable-rate mortgages are pausing at the thought that, even if they borrow at low rates, those rates won't last forever.''

HEADLINE: U.S.-Bahrain Accord Stirs Persian Gulf Trade Partners

BYLINE: By MICHELLE WALLIN

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
A free trade agreement between the United States and Bahrain is creating ripples in the Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia objecting to closer commercial ties between its neighbors and Washington. 
 At the root of the dispute is a free trade agreement that the United States and Bahrain signed in September. Under the pact, the United States and Bahrain would eliminate tariffs on most consumer, industrial and farm products, and open markets for services. The agreement requires approval from the legislatures of both countries. 
 But Saudi officials in recent weeks have complained that unilateral agreements violate the rules of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a customs union that groups Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Tariffs on goods traded among the member countries were eliminated at the start of 2003, and a common external tariff of 5 percent was imposed on products from outside the bloc. At its most ambitious, the council envisions a monetary union that would adopt a common currency by 2010.
 The trade scuffle became public in an unusual way this week at a council meeting in Manama, Bahrain. The regional press reported that Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia shunned the gathering because of the trade pact, instead sending the second deputy premier, Sultan bin Abdulaziz al-Saud.
 Although the final statement from the Manama meeting made only brief mention of such trade agreements, Bahrain's foreign minister, Mohammed bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, said at a news conference that the pact had been examined in detail at the meeting, the Bahrain News Agency reported. Other agencies said the issue simmered throughout the gathering.
 The Bahrainis have insisted that they will push ahead with the trade pact, and the United States ambassador to Bahrain, William T. Monroe, said in a recent interview that he was hopeful it would be approved. ''This is a positive step for Bahrain and the region,'' he said.
 Most trade analysts, many of whom agree with the Saudi position, nonetheless say they expect the smaller council countries to follow through with plans to sign their own agreements with the United States, though the spat may slow the process down. 
 But just below the surface of the conflict is the competition between Saudi Arabia and the United States for influence in the region, trade analysts say.
 ''Saudi Arabia used to be the most stable, most powerful country in the region. Now it has economic problems, political problems,'' said N. Janardhan, a specialist in Gulf politics at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai. ''There's a process where the status of Saudi Arabia is being limited. And the U.S. is trying to exert its influence.''
 Once viewed by its neighbors as rock-solid economically and politically, Saudi Arabia has been rent by bloody terrorist attacks. Unemployment is estimated at around 20 percent and the country is trying to develop its own industries, an effort that could be hurt by an influx of American goods from a neighboring country.
 At the same time, some of the tiny Gulf monarchies have made big economic strides, giving them a newfound confidence and eagerness to tighten trade ties with the United States. Saudi Arabia is the only council country not in the World Trade Organization, and the United States is aiding its entry.
 ''There is no question about the fact that these agreements are a leading edge for expanding U.S. influence,'' said Sherman Katz of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''For Saudi Arabia to be rattling sabers in relation to what other G.C.C. countries should do is in no way surprising.''
 To be sure, Bahrain is a tiny part of the United States trade equation. American exports to Bahrain totaled $509 million in 2003; imports from Bahrain were $378 million.
 An archipelago with a population under 700,000, Bahrain does not have the energy wealth of its Gulf neighbors and has relied on Saudi oil in the past. Home to the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet, Bahrain is also connected to mainland Saudi Arabia by a 16-mile causeway.
 Bahrain is the first Gulf country to sign a free trade agreement after the Bush administration laid out its vision for reaching such accords with some of the more reform-minded countries in the region, with an eye toward creating a so-called Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013. The United States Trade Representative's office has told Congress it will seek similar agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
 ''We also look forward to further agreements in support of the president's vision of establishing a U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013. The free trade area would reignite economic growth and expand opportunity in the Middle East,'' Ambassador Monroe said. 
 While many of Saudi Arabia's concerns may be political, there is cause for economic worries as well, analysts say. ''Saudi Arabia fears for itself,'' Mr. Janardhan said. ''It fears a lot of the goods that come in through Bahrain will end up in Saudi Arabia.''
 Earlier this week, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, attempted to calm spirits. ''It's wrong to see the case as personal,'' he said to Reuters. ''We didn't do this out of selfishness, but out of concern for the council's integrity.''

HEADLINE: 12 Days of Christmas? This Year, Workers Demand a Recount

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Christmas and New Year's haven't exactly been stolen this year; it's more like they've been tucked away. With both holidays falling on a Saturday, creating bookends around a single week, the cheer and leisure time may seem just a bit truncated. And the little extras that usually surround them have been changed in ways both obvious and surprising.
 For many New Yorkers who work Monday through Friday, the five days preceding each holiday this year seem like, well, a regular workweek. And for business owners who rely on a throng of weekend customers, the Friday-Saturday interruptions are nothing to be merry about. 
 ''It feels like you are just squeezing the holidays in,'' said Sharon Douglas, an account representative at a financial services firm who was smoking a cigarette on Wall Street on Wednesday afternoon. ''It doesn't feel like the holidays.''
 Arlene's Grocery, a bodega-turned-club on the Lower East Side, will be shuttered on Christmas night. Toni Debuono, the regular Saturday night bartender, will lose $500 in wages and tips, at a time of the year when she is buying tons of presents. ''I'm losing out on Saturday and I'm spending all this extra money,'' she said. 
 One area in which employers and institutions show their true colors: how they choose to observe a holiday that falls on a Saturday. For those who operate on a six- or seven-day week, it's on Saturday. For others, on Friday. A handful generously observe both days. And a Scroogish few, neither.
 Ms. Douglas's employer falls into the last category, as she will be among those working five-day weeks until the end of the year. ''Just in your mind, you think, 'No, you should have Christmas and a weekend,''' she said.
 ''I feel cheated,'' said Anjanette Gonzalez, a clerk for New York City Off-Track Betting who will also be working her regular Monday-through-Friday schedule. ''I feel bamboozled. I feel hoodwinked. It's not fair. I'm not getting my days off.''
 On Wall Street, New Year's has simply evaporated. The New York Stock Exchange, normally closed on the first of the year, is not observing New Year's in 2005.
 A spokeswoman gave a long explanation of how the holiday disappeared. 
 Ordinarily, if a holiday is on Sunday, the market is closed on Monday. If a holiday falls on a Saturday, the market is shut on Friday (as it is this year for Christmas Eve). But a Saturday New Year's Day doesn't kick in a Friday substitute, because there is another stock market rule that overrides it: the market must be open on the last trading day of each month. ''We have to have a full session for tax purposes,'' said the spokeswoman. And December 31, obviously, is a last day of the month. Thus, no day off.
 Got that?
 The New York Public School system is giving two fewer days of vacation -- six days -- this year than in the past two years. Of course, teachers concede that their yearly schedules hardly make them sympathetic characters over two lost days. ''We have a week off in February, a week off in April and 10 weeks in the summer,'' said Kate Callaghan, a high school teacher in the Bronx. ''I can't complain.''
 Among those who feel they do deserve to complain are overstressed and underpaid medical residents, who are assigned 24-hour hospital shifts, work six days a week, and get only one weekend off per month. The fact that they get either Christmas or New Year's off is a highlight of a dreary schedule, something they look forward to with Bob Cratchit fervor. But this year, hospitals are taking advantage of the fact that the holidays and weekends overlap.
 ''There is nothing special about this holiday season for you,'' said Ray Liu, a second-year resident at Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian Medical Center. ''It's like, 'We have given you a weekend off, which you deserve. We have given you a holiday off, which you deserve. The fact that they happen to be the same weekend is kind of tough luck for you.'''
 Based on past experience, movie studios are shuffling premieres to avoid the dreaded Friday Christmas Eve, when one of the biggest stay-at-home nights of the year collides with one of the top movie-going nights of the week. ''Phantom of the Opera,'' ''Meet the Fockers,'' ''In the Realms of the Unreal'' and ''Hotel Rwanda'' all opened on Wednesday, while ''The Darkness,'' ''Fat Albert,'' ''The Life Aquatic'' and ''The Aviator'' are waiting until Saturday. Only ''The Woodsman'' will have a Friday opening -- but a limited one.
 ''No question that it definitely hurts,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, the president of Exhibitor Relations Company, which tracks box office receipts. Christmas weekend is normally one of the biggest weekends of the year, but during the Saturday Christmas weekend of 1999, the box receipts were only $100 million, compared with $147 million in 1998. ''Usually the last two weeks of the year are big in overall revenues, but it's definitely going to be dialed back both for Christmas weekend and New Year's weekend,'' Mr. Dergarabedian said.
 New York's Chinese restaurants, which usually enjoy their busiest day of the year on Christmas, in large part because of the large number of Jewish customers, will suffer, too.
 ''You go and catch a movie and then you go and catch Chinese food: that's the tradition,'' said Henry Nuesch, manager of Shun Lee West, the Chinese restaurant on West 65th Street. He seats twice as many customers on Christmas as on some of his busiest days. ''Economically it's much better if Christmas falls on a Monday or Tuesday. I would do the Saturday business anyway.''
 Still, there are a few out there who welcome the scrunched schedule, precisely because it shortens the holiday languor that settles in at the end of the year.
 ''It's good for us as limousine drivers,'' said Patrick French, whose income waxes and wanes with business activity. ''If Christmas falls on a weekday, then that whole week is almost gone, but if it falls on a Saturday I get to work all week.'' There is only one week of slow business, as opposed to the occasional one and a half, or two.
 He paused before he stepped into his long black car and thought for a moment. ''Yeah,'' he said. ''The weekend is the best.''

HEADLINE: The Kindness of Strangers

BYLINE: By Ruben Martinez. 
Ruben Martinez, an associate professor of creative writing at the University of Houston, is the author of ''The New Americans'' and ''Crossing Over: A Mexican Family on the Migrant Trail.''

DATELINE: Velarde, N.M. 

 BODY:
THE young couple knocks on the heavy wooden door. They are weary and the hour is late; it is bitterly cold. 
 The husband says: ''En nombre del cielo, os pido posada,'' in the name of heaven, I ask thee for lodging. 
 From behind the door comes the answer: ''Este no es meson, sigan adelante, yo no debo abrir, sea algun tunante,'' this is not an inn, move along, I shouldn't open up, it may be a thief. 
 The centuries-old tradition of las posadas is celebrated throughout Mexico and in practically every Mexican neighborhood in America in the days before Christmas. Jose and Maria trudge from door to door, turned away again and again until they are finally allowed to bed down in the humble manger where the Christ child is born. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a part in the play. 
 Like many traditions, this one can resonate with different tones according to the political tenor of the times. And with the immigration debate on the national agenda -- President Bush is once again promoting ''guest worker'' legislation -- this Christmas parable asks us to step inside the shoes of both the protagonists and antagonists, the migrant couple seeking shelter and the innkeepers who, momentarily, hold such power over the couple's fate. 
 Las posadas is a story about hospitality, certainly a ''moral value,'' but not one pollsters ask about. Based on the notion of pilgrimage, a spiritual journey undertaken through the flesh, it is present in practically all the world's religions. Without the hospitality of those who live along the roads of one's pilgrimage -- be it the hajj of Islam or a Catholic penitent's journey to a shrine -- one would never arrive at one's destination. Hospitality implies reciprocity: the pilgrim received with generosity will one day have the occasion to return the favor. To shut the door on the wayfaring stranger would be to negate the possibility of one's own journey. 
 Of course, we shut the door all the time. We conclude, as the innkeepers do in the posada play, that Jose and Maria aren't pilgrims at all; they are ''thieves'' intent on taking from us and giving nothing in return. That is precisely what a strong majority of voters in Arizona apparently believed in November when they passed Proposition 200, which denies most public benefits to illegal migrants; on Wednesday, a federal judge cleared the way for the proposition to become law. ''They'' have come here merely to feed off America's welfare state -- to take something for nothing. We do not extend hospitality to thieves. 
 Philosophers have long debated the ethics of hospitality, which raises a series of existential, legal and moral questions. Is pure hospitality practicable in a world of human unpredictability? Or is hospitality an indispensable practice precisely because of human unpredictability? In the post-9/11 world, we ponder the question more in terms of national security. How does one discern between the stranger to whom hospitality should be extended, and the stranger who poses a threat? Does war automatically exempt us from showing hospitality? Does a ''war without end'' permanently suspend such values? 
 Americans have long had a troubled, contradictory relationship with immigrants. We famously say that we are immigrants, indeed a ''land of immigrants,'' and just as famously render them ''them.'' While Liberty opens her arms to the tired, poor and huddled masses, we also greet the immigrant with ethnic slurs and sweatshop wages, with savage and simplistic representations on our movie and TV screens. We are immigrants who despise immigrants. To enact hospitality in this context is a radical act: it automatically erases the border between us and them. To open one's door to the stranger is to recognize that he no longer is one. 
 The nativist reacts against the immigrant with prosaic notions of ''law and order.'' Jose has broken the law by crossing the river without the proper documents. Maria breaks the law by baby-sitting for money under the table. (The nativist has little to say about the natives who also break the law by hiring illegal aliens; he gains nothing politically by implicating himself in the crime.) But immigration codes are very human laws, born of economic and political realities -- laws that blind us from perceiving the migrants for who they really are. 
 This notion of the foreigner as an economic mercenary has no relation whatsoever to the way migrants regard themselves. Ask Mexicans why they cross the Rio Grande and they will invariably say, ''to seek a better life.'' They do not mean only material gain. Migrants travel through space and time, and are transformed by their encounter with the newness of the landscape, beginning with language. They are changed by their encounter with their other, with us. 
 Anyone who has grown up with more than one culture knows that to switch between languages is more than a matter of grammar and accent; meaning itself shifts, sometimes subtly, sometimes profoundly. To travel from one country to another, one language to another, is a journey of both spirit and flesh. The migrants sense this. In America, they are among our most fervently religious communities. In the barrio storefront church, they meditate on and give meaning to their passage -- their sacrifice, their yearning for the transcendent, their crossing of the river. 
 And so now it is time again to face our contradictions head-on. The Bush administration is pushing an immigration agenda that is questioned from both the right and the left. The proposal offers documentation to immigrants who can prove gainful employment in the form of ''contracts'' of up to three years. President Bush on Monday repeated that the program would not be an amnesty (like that granted several million illegal immigrants in 1986). Nevertheless, conservatives argue that the program would reward criminals and pose a threat to national security. Liberals complain about institutionalizing the exploitation of foreign labor and the impact on native workers. Both sides reduce the immigrant to caricature. And both still imagine -- in their rhetoric, at least -- that the broken border between the United States and Mexico can be fixed. 
 But there was never enough of a border between us for it to have come undone. Immigration laws have always been enforced selectively, largely according to the needs of the labor economy. To a great extent, there is no functioning border, but we insist on believing there is one: imagining a borderless world is a leap into unfamiliar territory, a place where, in a sense, we would all be strangers.
 Yet perhaps it is only in such a place where we might begin to offer genuine hospitality. At the very moment one opens the door to the stranger, one also crosses a border and sees not an immigrant, not an illegal alien, not a Mexican, but a face -- a human face. 
 TONIGHT, in the final representation of the posada, Jose and Maria will wearily walk from door to door seeking shelter in the barrios, even as thousands of Joses and Marias arrive at the shore of the Rio Grande, the river they dream of as Jordan. They look to the other side, imagining la vida mejor. The Border Patrol stops some of them. Other migrants, in distress, find doors shut to them when they seek help. But most find a bed to sleep in. With family, with friends, even with strangers -- that is the story of immigration in America these days. Perhaps we are a hospitable land, after all. How else could we have become this ''land of immigrants''? 
 In New Mexico, one of the most lyrical metaphors in the posada tradition is that of the farolitos, votive candles that glow inside paper sacks weighed down by sand. These light the path toward that place where Jose and Maria will finally be recognized for who they are: pilgrims seeking shelter on the road, faces that serve as mirrors to our own.

HEADLINE: ROWLAND ADMITS FELONY IN OFFICE

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN; Avi Salzman, Alison Leigh Cowan and Stacey Stowe contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Former Gov. John G. Rowland, once the proud darling of Connecticut Republicans, completed his fall from grace yesterday by pleading guilty to a single federal charge of corruption in office, acknowledging that he had accepted $107,000 in gratuities and failed to pay taxes on them.
 The plea, given in an unexpected appearance in Federal District Court in New Haven, sent reverberations through a state still trying to cope with the disgrace of Mr. Rowland's scandal-tainted life as governor and now his likely imprisonment.
 ''Today the State of Connecticut was humiliated, and I, as John Rowland's former running mate and colleague, feel personally betrayed,'' Gov. M. Jodi Rell declared in Hartford. ''When I first heard the news, I felt like I was punched in the gut.'' 
 Mr. Rowland, 47, who resigned on July 1 in the face of almost certain impeachment and a federal inquiry that had engulfed his third term, admitted conspiring with subordinates and state contractors to ''deprive the State of Connecticut and its citizens of the intangible right to the honest services of its governor.'' Mr. Rowland had not been formally charged but arranged the plea deal after negotiations with prosecutors this week, ending a grand jury investigation of his actions.
 Specifically, Mr. Rowland acknowledged accepting free vacations in Florida and Vermont, and renovation work on his lakeside cottage in Litchfield, mostly arranged and paid for by William A. Tomasso, a contractor who earned millions doing business with the state. He also admitted giving his consent, or tacit approval, to state contracts that benefited Mr. Tomasso.
 He also admitted taking free flights to Las Vegas and Philadelphia aboard private executive jets owned by Key Air Inc. in return for helping lower the company's taxes.
 The charge to which Mr. Rowland pleaded guilty is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But prosecutors, citing federal guidelines, called for a prison sentence of 15 to 21 months. Peter C. Dorsey, the senior United States district judge who accepted the plea, will impose the sentence on March 11.
 Standing before Judge Dorsey in a tight-fitting dark blue suit over a powder blue tie, Mr. Rowland, who had insisted for months that he had done nothing for the many gifts he received, responded to dozens of questions -- mostly about whether he understood the implications of his plea -- before getting to the anticlimactic question: ''How do you plead?'' 
 ''Guilty,'' he said.
 He then put his signature on a detailed agreement stipulating his criminal actions and acknowledging that he owed $35,459 in taxes for unreported gratuities over four years. It was also signed by Assistant United States Attorney Nora R. Dannehy. Mr. Rowland then smiled, turned to hug his wife, Patricia, and left the courtroom with his lawyer, William F. Dow III, who noted that going to trial would have exposed his client to ''a devastating amount of time'' in prison. He was released on a $10,000 bond.
 ''Obviously, mistakes have been made throughout the last few years and I accept responsibility for those,'' Mr. Rowland told reporters on the courthouse steps. ''But I also ask that the people of this state appreciate and understand what we have tried to do over the last 25 years in public service.'' 
 As he left the courthouse, Mr. Rowland was confronted by a small group of demonstrators. ''Come on, Johnny Rowland, tell us how you stole the money,'' one shouted. ''We are the citizens of Connecticut and we want to know why you stole our money.''
 By entering his plea, Mr. Rowland extricated himself from the tangles of a two-year-long federal investigation, which led to the indictment of Mr. Tomasso and a former Rowland subordinate in September on charges of bribery conspiracy, racketeering and mail and wire fraud. Another subordinate pleaded guilty to corruption charges in March 2003.
 And if there had been any doubts over the past year, since Mr. Rowland first admitted that he lied about accepting gifts from state employees and from friends who did business with the state, the plea, which stripped him of his right to vote or to hold public office, brought to a dramatic close a remarkable political career that had begun nearly 25 years ago in a burst of charm and electability.
 Lauded as a boy wonder of American politics, Mr. Rowland won a seat in the Connecticut legislature in 1980 at the age of 23, and became the youngest member of Congress four years later. The three-term representative was elected governor in 1994, the first Republican in 30 years to hold the office in heavily Democratic Connecticut. He was only 37, the nation's youngest governor.
 Enormously popular, he won re-election in 1998 and again by a landslide in 2002, despite numerous questions surrounding his administration. But along with his considerable political gifts, even many of his supporters said, Mr. Rowland was possessed of a kind of blindness, an inability to separate the political from the personal in his life.
 There were financial strains, including substantial deferred debt imposed in a divorce from his first wife, Deborah, and, after his second marriage, to Patricia Rowland, the expenses of a family that included five children from both of their previous marriages.
 In 1996 and 1997, according to investigators working for the legislative impeachment committee, a businessman, Robert V. Matthews, arranged the rental and then the sale of the governor's Washington condominium at prices far above the prevailing market as the Connecticut Development Authority approved millions of dollars of loan guarantees for companies he owned.
 In 1997, Mr. Rowland became the first governor to be fined by the state's Ethics Commission, which found he had accepted free concert tickets. He paid a $2,000 penalty. He also bought the Bantam Lake cottage in Litchfield for $110,000 -- said to be below its market value -- with a $5,000 down payment.
 The federal inquiry that led to Mr. Rowland's political demise began in 1999, when investigators accused Paul J. Silvester, a state treasurer named by Mr. Rowland, of arranging kickbacks for placing millions in state pension investments with certain equity funds.
 The expanding federal investigation then focused on Peter N. Ellef, an insurance executive who had been hired by Mr. Rowland in 1995 to head the state's economic development office. Mr. Rowland named Mr. Ellef as his co-chief of staff in 1997. Mr. Ellef, in turn, brought in a former colleague, Lawrence Alibozek, as the governor's deputy chief of staff. 
 Almost from the moment Mr. Ellef assumed his position at the governor's side, federal investigators said, he began conspiring with Mr. Tomasso, the head of two family-owned construction and property management companies, Tomasso Brothers and Tunxis Management Company, to steer state business to the companies. 
 Investigators charged that the Tomasso companies sealed the arrangement by giving $1.6 million to a landscaping company owned by Mr. Ellef's son, Peter Jr., and his wife. In return, the investigators charged, Mr. Ellef and Mr. Alibozek arranged to steer a series of state contracts, with Mr. Rowland's explicit or tacit approval, to the Tomasso companies. 
 Development of the new Connecticut Juvenile Training School at Middletown became a priority for the Rowland administration in 1998. Mr. Ellef helped persuade the legislature to expedite the project, and Tomasso Brothers, of New Britain, was awarded the $53 million contract, state investigators said.
 Mr. Rowland, in his plea yesterday, admitted that Tomasso Brothers had been given the inside track on the training school with confidential information, and that he knew about it and did nothing. The design was so poor that the state has been forced to spend $1 million for renovations.
 Mr. Rowland also admitted that in 1999 he gave his consent as governor to a $2.1 million contract by the state's Department of Public Works, without competitive bidding, for renovation work by Tunxis Management at Long Lane School, also in Middletown.
 He also admitted that in 2000 he directed the commissioner of the Department of Transportation to sign a $37 million contract to build and operate a parking garage at Bradley International Airport to benefit a Tomasso company, and from 1998 to 2000 approved bond agendas and voted for various other projects to benefit Tomasso companies.
 Mr. Tomasso and the two Ellefs pleaded not guilty in September. Their cases are pending.
 In another quid pro quo, Mr. Rowland said he helped an executive charter plane company, Key Air of Oxford, Conn., gain retroactive tax relief in 2002, after he had accepted free flights to Las Vegas and Philadelphia aboard private chartered planes provided by Key Air in 1999 and 2000. 
 Many details of the other gratuities Mr. Rowland accepted -- and failed to pay taxes on -- emerged yesterday in the plea agreement he signed. Between 1998 and 2000, it stipulated, Mr. Rowland vacationed alone or with his family at no charge three times at Mr. Tomasso's Vermont home. In 1999, Mr. Rowland and his wife vacationed at Mr. Tomasso's Florida home at a nominal charge.
 In 1998, Mr. Rowland admitted, a Tomasso company performed free construction work at his cottage. And a year later, he admitted, Mr. Ellef and Mr. Alibozek, together with a Tomasso company, installed a heating system at the cottage for free.

HEADLINE: Positive Economic Reports Push Share Prices Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as reports on personal income, consumer confidence and durable goods suggested the economy may sustain above-average growth through next year.
 ''The trends supporting growth in the economy remain sound,'' said John Lynch, chief market strategist at Evergreen Investment in Charlotte, N.C., which manages $250 billion. ''We will probably see stocks gain into January.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 0.56 of a point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,210.13. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11.23 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,827.12. The Nasdaq composite index added 3.59 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,160.62.
 Trading slowed as some investors left for the Christmas holiday. United States exchanges are closed today. For the week, the S.&P. 500 gained 1.3 percent. The Dow average climbed 1.7 percent, while the Nasdaq increased 1.2 percent.
 Personal incomes rose 0.3 percent last month, beating the 0.2 percent median estimate of economists. An index of consumer confidence jumped to an 11-month high of 97.1 in December, from 92.8 last month, according to the University of Michigan. Durable goods orders in November climbed 1.6 percent, more than the 0.6 percent economists expected. 
 Industrial companies, whose earnings are more closely tied to economic growth, gained in response to the data.
 3M, the maker of Scotch tape and films used on liquid-crystal displays, increased $1.04, to $82.55. United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, climbed 51 cents, to $105.52.
 Robert Half rallied $2.13, or 7.8 percent, to $29.38. A Morgan Stanley analyst, Christopher Gutek, raised his rating on the company to overweight from equal-weight, citing increasing demand for its services.
 Resources Connection jumped $6.50, to $53.10. The provider of temporary personnel had fiscal second-quarter profit of 62 cents a share, beating the 45-cent estimate of analysts.
 Monster Worldwide, the owner of the most-used Internet site for employment advertising, increased 40 cents, to $33.30. 
 KB Home led a drop in homebuilders' shares after a government report showed sales of new homes fell 12 percent in November, the sharpest decline in more than a decade, suggesting that the round of interest-rate increases the Federal Reserve began in June has tempered demand.
 KB Home slumped $2.06, to $101.75. Standard Pacific, which builds homes in the western and southwestern United States, slid $1.15, to $62.52.
 Fannie Mae, the largest source of money for the nation's mortgage industry, dropped $2.30, to $69.62. Regulators are reviewing the severance packages of two top executives who were ousted this week after the Securities and Exchange Commission found the company broke accounting rules.
 Network Appliance lost $1.02, to $32.05. The maker of data storage equipment and software may face competition from a plan by Cisco Systems to add data storage features to its equipment, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Montague. He cut the stock to sector perform from outperform.
 Red Hat, the distributor of the Linux computer operating system, tumbled $2.04, to $13.03. The company said fiscal third-quarter revenue was $50.9 million, less than the $51.8 million expected by analysts.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32, to a price of 100 6/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.22 percent from 4.20 percent on Wednesday.

+ 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories, from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45).

'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES.' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St.-Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using girly men as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., Monday at 2 and 8 p.m. and Thursday at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.

*+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

* 'DEMOCRACY.' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Holiday performances have been added on Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. and Monday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.

+ 'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays that chronicles the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. This week, performances will be added on Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. and Thursday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.

+ 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. This week, a performance has been added on Sunday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25.

+ ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER.' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother.'' Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. This week, a performance has been added on Sunday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25.

+ 'THE RIVALS' Here she is at last! Dear old Mrs. Malaprop! The delightful Mrs. M, who, with a disdainful nod to Richard Brinsley Sheridan, misspoke her way to immortality in the pages of the Oxford English Dictionary. You know the word, you've probably made the mistake, and now, courtesy of the new Broadway revival of ''The Rivals,'' Sheridan's celebrated 1775 comedy of manners, you can finally make the acquaintance of the famous dame who generously bequeathed her name to a linguistic error. As personified by Dana Ivey, an actress of blissfully well-honed comic instincts, Mrs. Malaprop is indeed the main event in Mark Lamos plumply upholstered production. But despite a largely zesty cast and a first-class production from Lincoln Center Theater, the uncomfortable truth is Sheridan's comedy is one of those approved-and-certified classics that require unexpected reserves of patience and fortitude. Intermittently adorable, it is also, and not infrequently, tedious (2:30). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $70.

'700 SUNDAYS.' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. This week, performances will be added on Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.

* 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, all of whom manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. and Monday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.

+ 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she has met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. This movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49 Ms. Goldberg is an established performer and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. and Wednesday and Thursday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $76.25.

Off Broadway

+ 'THE BALTIMORE WALTZ.' Paula Vogel is indisputably the author of ''The Baltimore Waltz,'' but a decade of collective grief, rage and confusion surely played a part in its authorship, too. Ms. Vogel began work on the play shortly after her brother's death from AIDS in 1988. It was a deeply personal, even idiosyncratic expression of sorrow and love. But in the dozen years since its premiere at Circle Repertory, emotion surrounding the AIDS epidemic has inevitably cooled, and the play now must stand up to less emotionally inflected scrutiny. Sadly, on the evidence of Mark Brokaw's smart but dry production, the second in the Signature Theater's season devoted to Ms. Vogel's work, it mostly sags. This is partly due to a crucial piece of miscasting. Kristen Johnston is a talented actress, but she doesn't do poignancy convincingly. She makes all the right noises, but the submerged emotional charge that should bind the jumbled comic gambits of Ms. Vogel's comedy never fully emerges (1:25). Signature's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.

+ 'BELLE EPOQUE.' The epoque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle Epoque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. This week, an additional performance has been added on Sunday at 7 p.m. Tickets: $70.
ISHERWOOD

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE.' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.

'FAT PIG.' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. This week, a performance has been added on Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $50.

*+++ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti Lupone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''Everything old is old again'' (1:45).'' Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdaysat 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m.This week, a performance has been added on Wednesday at 8:15 p.m. Tickets: $60.

'THE FOREIGNER.' Matthew Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There is no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday and Monday at 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.

++ 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. and Monday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.

+'MODERN ORTHODOX.' It is said that God works in mysterious ways. Daniel Goldfarb's new play suggests the Lord is not above employing obnoxious ones, too. In this snappy if superficial romantic comedy with a glossy cast (Molly Ringwald, Jason Biggs and Craig Bierko), Hannah and Ben, a young Jewish couple comfortably ensconced on Manhattan's Upper West Side, are provoked to question their commitment to each other -- and the depth of their religious feeling -- when Hershel Klein, an ill-mannered interloper from another borough and another sect, arrives on their doorstep demanding to be given harbor. Since the abrasive behavior of Hershel, played by Mr. Biggs, tends to indicate colossal bad manners more powerfully than spiritual enlightenment, the character's deployment as a catalyst is more than a little specious. But the soul-searching is primarily filler supplementing Mr. Goldfarb's bright comic swipes at intrafaith cultural clashes (1:30). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 7 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m. and Thursday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46 to $66.

* 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE.' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1900. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 7 p.m. and Monday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at box office one hour before the show.

* 'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Sam Shepard (yep,that one) and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Monday at 8 p.m. and Wednesdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $65.
BRANTLEY

'A SECOND HAND MEMORY.' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Amid the pervasive aura of doom, Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors, who include Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos'' and a particularly fine Beth Fowler, provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences before our eyes, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Monday at 8 p.m. and Wednesday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60.

*+ 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 505-0700. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Monday at 4 and 8 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 4 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90.
LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

+ 'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the United States attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here depicted as a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is continually affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver a veteran of more than 50 years on the stage, gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogey. The actor also allows the audience to take note of the declining powers of a once-powerful intellect, but he never strains for pathos. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 7 p.m. and Monday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $66.25.
ISHERWOOD

+ 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed by David Schweizer as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 7 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m. and Thursday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.

Now Playing

'ALEXANDER' Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 173 minutes). There comes the moment in the career of many directors when they are compelled to tell the story of a great man in whose life they seem to see a glimmer of their own image. Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson each had Jesus. Now Oliver Stone has Alexander the Great, the Macedonian tyrant who cut a bloody swath through the ancient world to no obvious end other than, if Mr. Stone's big, blowsy movie is to believed, to get away from his kvetch of a mother. Olympias, played with nose-flaring gusto by Ms. Jolie, was the mother of all monstrous mothers, a literal snake charmer whose love for her only son had the stench of incestuous passion. For Alexander (Mr. Farrell, upstaged by an epically bad dye job), the Oedipal plot would only thicken because he also loved Olympias's most loathed enemy, her husband and his father, Philip, the King of Macedon (Mr. Kilmer). The struggle between Olympias and Philip, these primordial warring female and male forces, would be reproduced in Alexander's bisexual desires and his rapacious conquest of the feminized East. In other words, Alexander became his dad to waylay his mom.
MANOHLA DARGIS

'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.
DARGIS

* 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael Garcia Bernal, Fele Martinez and Javier Camara. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). This Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless filmmakers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almodovar, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grace of ''Bad Education'' is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair, the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core. But Ms. Bening lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.
A. O.SCOTT

'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelganger, Mr. Spacey (now 45) sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax Yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz,'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams and line their pocketbooks.
HOLDEN

'BLADE: TRINITY' Starring Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson and Jessica Biel. Directed by David S. Goyer (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Snipes may have achieved the Hollywood dream of starring in a comic-book franchise that doesn't require real acting, but he doesn't seem to appreciate his good fortune in the disjointed, overlong ''Blade: Trinity,'' which bills itself as the series finale. The ''Blade'' movies demand only that the 42-year-old actor stay pumped up and ready for kung-fu action. But the only emotion his character, a glowering half-human, half-vampire hunter of the undead, can muster in the third installment is a sense of mild irritation at having to go through the hassle. This episode is a choppy, forgetful, suspense-free romp that substitutes campy humor for chills.
HOLDEN

'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of charm and obvious intelligence? Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck.
DARGIS

'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy. The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community.
HOLDEN

'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.
SCOTT

'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan'' has been revisited numerous times. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. The film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote.

'FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX' Starring Dennis Quaid, Tyrese Gibson and Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by John Moore (PG-13, 115 minutes). The moth-eaten plane-crash-in-the-desert yarn, a cynical update of the far superior 1965 movie, directed by Robert Aldrich and starring James Stewart and Richard Attenborough, throws in every cheap trick in the manual to pump up your heartbeat. Watching it is the equivalent of having the soles your feet tickled; you react, but involuntarily. The setting has been moved from the Sahara to the Gobi Desert and the revamped characters make up a cunningly chosen and unlikely mosaic of types that include a pretty woman, a one-eyed African-American guitarist, a Mexican-American chef and a Saudi. Mr. Quaid is the brawny, hard-bitten pilot and Mr. Ribisi the brainy airplane designer who, against all odds, supervises the reconstruction of the downed plane into an aeronautical phoenix.

* 'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS' Starring Zhang Ziyi. Directed by Zhang Yimou (PG-13, 119 minutes; in Mandarin, with English subtitles). In the latest chapter of Mr. Zhang's triumphant reinvention as an action filmmaker, Ms. Zhang plays Mei, a blind courtesan who turns out to be a member of the Flying Daggers, a shadowy squad of assassins waging a guerrilla insurgency against the corrupt and decadent government. She is pursued by two government deputies, Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), whose loyalties come into question as the chase turns into a love triangle. Everyone is engaged in several layers of deceit, and some of the third-act revelations are more likely to provoke laughter than gasps of amazement. But realism is as irrelevant a criterion here as it would be in an Italian opera. The movie is about color, kineticism and the kind of heavy-breathing, decorous sensuality that went out of American movies when sexual candor came in. Though it is in constant, breathtaking motion, the picture is not especially moving. Unlike the greatest operas (in whatever medium), it inspires you to gasp, but not to weep.

* 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes tries to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced superheroes into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Mr. Bird uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world in which ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology.
SCOTT

* 'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost naive belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging Kinsey's personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight.

'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (a k a Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.
DARGIS

'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Aquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their reveries and fantasies.
SCOTT

* MILLION DOLLAR BABY Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliche, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.
SCOTT

* 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Garcia Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture, a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography.
SCOTT

* 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in the enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick ''Ocean's Twelve,'' a trio of crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean -- played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box-office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack, Mr. Pitt plays his second-in-command Rusty Ryan and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.

'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year-old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine.
HOLDEN

'THE POLAR EXPRESS' With the voices of Tom Hanks, Michael Jeter, Peter Scolare, Nona Gaye, Eddie Deezen and Charles Fleischer. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (G, 97 minutes). Based on the 32-page children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, this new animated feature has received attention for the advanced technology used to make the film and the heart-skipping amount of money reportedly spent to transpose the story from page to screen. I suspect that most moviegoers care more about stories and characters than how much money it took for a digitally rendered strand of hair to flutter persuasively in the wind. Nor will they care that to make ''Polar Express'' Mr. Hanks wore a little cap that transmitted a record of his movements to a computer, creating templates for five animated characters. It's likely, I imagine, that most moviegoers will be more concerned by the eerie listlessness of those characters' faces and the grim vision of Santa Claus's North Pole compound.
DARGIS

* 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out.
SCOTT

* 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future.
DARGIS

'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni andPaz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles -- all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all of them treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni) a thoroughgoing monster -- irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.
SCOTT

'THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE' With the voices of Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and Rodger Bumpass. Directed by Steven Hillenburg (PG, 88 minutes). If nautical nonsense is something you wish for, then this big-screen expansion of the popular Nickelodeon show will be just the ticket. SpongeBob and his best pal Patrick set off on a rambling quest to recover a stolen crown and prevent Plankton from taking over Bikini Bottom and driving poor Mr. Krabs out of business. If none of this makes sense to you, fear not; it won't necessarily make any more after the movie is done. In any case, the point of ''SpongeBob'' is not sense but nonsense, and the film, like the series, is a giddy celebration of pure childishness, which makes it a refreshing antidote to the glowering machismo that dominates so much pop culture.
SCOTT

* 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.
DARGIS

'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiance will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to do them part, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amelie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F. A. O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.

JON PARELES

FALLOUT BOY, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. This likable Chicago emo band specializes in songs so flamboyantly miserable they're self-defeating. The group's debut album, ''Take This to Your Grave'' (Fueled by Ramen), is full of primary-color chord progressions and gruesome goodbyes; many of the songs conjure up a form of self-pity that's indistinguishable from glee. Tomorrow at 1 and 8:30 p.m., with the Academy Is . . . and Gym Class Heroes; tickets are $16.75.

BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blase but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

* MICHAEL FEINSTEIN, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. The smoothest crooner in show business and one of the most dedicated archivists of popular song salutes Christmas, Hanukkah and the classic ballad in his show, ''Holiday Heart Songs.'' Mr. Feinstein has developed into such an accomplished stand-up entertainer that if it were 1965, he would be the host of his own network variety show. The ballads at which he excels include ''Two for the Road,'' ''I Concentrate on You,'' and John Bucchino's semiclassical ''Grateful.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $60; $40 minimum for the early shows and $30 minimum for the late shows.

* ANDREA MARCOVICCI, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Authentic glamour may be an oxymoron. But Ms. Marcovicci becomes its embodiment when she performs. In her new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire,'' she suggests a latter-day hybrid of Audrey Hepburn, the most gracious, elegant and beautifully spoken of Hollywood princesses, and Mabel Mercer, that ruefully witty, all-wise, healing muse of a thousand romantic sorrows. Like Mercer's, her singing is really speech-song executed with an elocutionary flourish and stylized acting. The show weaves music, biography and analysis of Astaire iconography into a definitive career summary. It focuses, in particular, on his relationships with the composers who wrote for him. Tonight, tomorrow and Monday nights she offers a slightly expanded version of her show for the holidays, with 8 p.m. shows only. Cover: $60, with a $55 dinner required.

* 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue, ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $40.

Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his signature songs -- ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark'' -- along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon).

BRUCE BARTH TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7000. Bruce Barth, who has made a series of fine, if overlooked, records since leaving Terence Blanchard's group a decade ago, is a reliable index of what the best of modern, mainstream jazz piano playing sounds like. He swings as much as possible and doesn't let the music get away from him. But he also brings a degree of percussive aggression to the music that sounds even more powerful inside these boundaries. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; no cover, but a $10 minimum for each set.

CYRUS CHESTNUT TRIO, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, fifth floor, (212) 258-9595. The pianist Cyrus Chestnut swings the way the old guard used to; that's why he was so dazzling when he came on the scene in the early 1990's. But he is also a sentimentalist. Trios happen to be his best setting: they discourage his excesses and push him to his rhythmic limits. Tonight and tomorrow, sets at 7:30, 9:30 and 11 p.m.; Sunday sets at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. Cover charge is $30 plus a $10 minimum at a table or a $5 minimum at the bar.

This group presents music associated with Davis through the fingers of George Coleman (saxophonist in Davis's early-60's band), Buster Williams (briefly the bassist with his quartet in 1967), Mike Stern (guitarist in his late-80's band) and Jimmy Cobb (drummer in his late-50's and early-60's band, and on the album ''Kind of Blue.'')

Opera

'KATYA KABANOVA' Fresh from her triumph as Strauss's Salome last season, the radiant soprano Karita Mattila is back at the Metropolitan Opera in another riveting portrayal: the title role of Janacek's great 1921 opera ''Katya Kabanova,'' a revival of Jonathan Miller's starkly powerful 1991 production. The tragic story tells of a winsome young woman in a 19th-century rural Russian town and her decent but weak-willed husband, who lets his reproachful widowed mother rule his life. Desperately lonely, Katya commits adultery and is driven by her guilt to drown herself in the Volga. Janacek's haunting, harmonically restless music takes you to the core of the story. So does Ms. Mattila, who sings with an affecting blend of cool Nordic sound and gleaming power. Jorma Silvasti as her lover Boris, Chris Merritt as her blustery husband and Judith Forst as her withering mother-in-law give strong performances. Jiri Belohlavek conducts a stylistically authoritative and rhapsodic performance. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.

LES BALLETS TROCKADERO DE MONTE CARLO The belles are back, and all is right with the world. Ida (Nevasaynevea) and Margeaux (Mundeyn) lead the troops, along with Yuriko Sakitumi (say it fast) and William Vanilla, in two different programs that pay loving and knowledgeable tribute to the art of classical ballet. For all the cavorting of this all-male company, the technical level is high and the atmosphere one that recalls the days when ballet was an exotic spectacle. The company will present a surprise Christmas Eve show tonight, followed by a program that includes versions of ''Swan Lake''(Act II), ''Dying Swan'' and a Pina Bausch sendup (Sunday). The repertory doesn't really matter, though. These girls are a guaranteed anti-depressant.

Museums

* 'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This enlightening, quietly excellent show is the first to juxtapose the design efforts -- his furniture, her textiles -- of two remarkable artists who happened to be married to each other. Instead of Josef's paintings of glowing nesting squares, which presage Minimalism, we get his 1927 nesting tables with the same meticulous sense of color, proportion and geometry that he would later apply to canvas. Anni brought a similarly intelligent structure to fabrics and tapestries that make every thread, texture and color count, at once exposing and exalting her medium's basic grid. She was the Sol LeWitt of weaving. Reflecting design moving toward art by dint of formidable concentration on its own purposes and potentials, this show may rearrange some ideas about early modernist design as well as Minimalist art and furniture. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7.
ROBERTA SMITH

* 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined elements of East and West, high and low, old and new: African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Literature and music shaped the work no less than Picasso, George Grosz and Vermeer did. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.

'ASIAN GAMES: THE ART OF CONTEST,' Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 327-9211, through Jan. 16. What's your game? Chess, go, pachisi, polo? These and many other recreational pursuits are saluted in a jampacked but beguiling show that pegs Asia as the continent of origin for more than a few of the sophisticated games we play today. On view are 200 games and game-related objects covering 2,000 years. They involve games of chance; memory and matching; strategy and physical skill. Elaborate boards for dice-propelled contests like pachisi, backgammon and snakes and ladders; different varieties of dice; intricately carved chessmen; lively examples of playing cards; and intriguing paraphernalia for outdoor sports like polo, are all part of this sumptuous display, enhanced by paintings, prints, sculptures and decorative accessories. A playground for the eye, even a non-gamesman's. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, 65+; $5, students.

* 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.
HOLLAND COTTER

* 'THE CASTELLANI AND ITALIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL JEWELRY,' Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, through Feb. 6. A dazzling look at the redoubtable Castellani jewelry firm that lasted in Rome from 1814 to 1927 and its production of exquisitely wrought jewelry modeled on the Etruscan, Greek and Roman relics being dug up all over Italy. The more than 250 objects on view include examples of one of the firm's specialties, micromosaics: minuscule, highly labor-intensive mosaic insets on gold that depicted classical, religious and other motifs; carved gems like cameos and intaglios, and stagey productions of shimmering gems in ornate, drop-dead settings for its really privileged clients. This is not a show for dilettantes, requiring strength of eye and the patience of Job for exquisite detail. How much you enjoy it depends on your appetite for jewelry in depth. But it's a spectacular, even for over-the-top, bling-bling-y New York. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $3; students and 65+, $2.

* 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.

* 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with inspiring the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold Bocklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield, and places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context, and includes reconstructions of puppets made and used in performance by Heartfield, George Grosz and Hannah Hoch. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.

* MARK DION: 'RESCUE ARCHAEOLOGY, A PROJECT FOR THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART,' the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through March 14. Mark Dion's installation piece, commissioned by the museum four years ago, is a site-specific faux-archeological roots tour that resonates well with the Modern's historic reopening. Displaying detritus unearthed and salvaged during the renovation, it mixes together bits and pieces of the Rockefeller brownstone that originally housed the museum on West 53rd Street with scraps of wallpaper from the recently demised Dorset Hotel. The presents continual erasure of the past is poignantly illustrated, as is the rather startling contrast the museums modest beginnings with its current mega-corporate dominance of the block. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.

'EUROPEAN BRONZES FROM THE QUENTIN COLLECTION,' the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, through Jan. 2. During the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in the collection and technical exploration of small-scale bronzes from the Renaissance, depicting gods, goddesses, religious figures, nymphs, fauns, satyrs, animals and simple folk. About 35 of these 15th-to-mid-18th-century statuettes, from the 15th to the mid-18th century and assembled by an Argentine collector, star in this lively show. Originally inspired by mythological themes or classical marble statuary, and often reconstructed in innovative ways by well-known artists, the statuettes were eagerly sought by European connoisseurs, who admired their masterly modeling, subtle surfacing and elegant finishes. A wonderful example here is a rendition -- by an unknown 16th-century Italian sculptor -- of Hercules's victory over the Libyan giant Anataeus, a 16th-century bronze that shows the Greek hero vanquishing the monster, who was dependent for his strength on contact with his mother, the Earth, by holding him up in the air away from her. The action is portrayed with exquisite care and in such detail that you can see Antaeus's tongue as it cleaves agonizedly to his mouth. Yet the sculpture is a mere 10 inches high. Happily, these bronzes are displayed without vitrines, so they can be examined closely from every angle. Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for 62+; $5 for students.

'MANNY FARBER: ABOUT FACE,' AND 'KATHARINA SIEVERDING: CLOSE UP,' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; through Jan. 10 and Feb. 7, respectively. P.S. 1's two major fall shows are about identity defined through two different approaches to self-portraiture. Mr. Farber's show is a 40-year retrospective of work by a California artist well known as a film critic, who since the 1970's has been producing large, highly detailed still lifes. The pictures are dense with autobiographical data, from images of movie-house candy bars to handwritten notes-to-self to flowers picked fresh from the garden. The work of Ms. Sieverding of Germany could hardly be a greater visual contrast. Her series of colossal head shots suggesting film advertisements are mostly of her own face. The results are both an exercise in self-celebration, and the simultaneous creation and undermining of a personal-is-political icon. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+.

* 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection. Masks, baskets, pots, clothing, baby carriers, painted hides, drawings and other treasures are displayed here not as ethnological artifacts, but as objects of art. The works are as beautiful as any you are likely to find in a private holding. The show affirms the distance achieved in allotting American Indian art a worthy aesthetic place in world culture. Hours: daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free.
GLUECK

* 'FORM FOLLOWS FASHION,' Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street (212) 217-7999, through Dec. 31. This ravishing show stresses fashion as a formal, abstract art, implicitly geometric, architectural, even in moments of excess. So its not surprising in this context formal also means evening wear, the genre in which garments are freed most decisively from function, or that couture gowns by designers from Charles James to Ralph Rucci, enhanced by the invisible mannequins , make this show a garden of unearthly capricious, silken delights. The art of the times is also startlingly palpable, notably in the pyramidal black and white gown that Michel Goma designed for Patou in the early 60's, which is a near knockoff of a motif used by Myron Stout and Ellsworth Kelly. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, noon to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.
SMITH

'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. This show, presenting about 40 works, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. But not always. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.

* 'IN THE REALM OF GODS AND KINGS: ARTS OF INDIA SELECTIONS FROM THE POLSKY COLLECTIONS AND THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 2, and 'WHEN GOLD BLOSSOMS: INDIAN JEWELRY FROM THE COLLECTION OF SUSAN L. BENINGSON,' through Jan. 30, Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. Of these two collection shows, ''In the Realm of Gods and Kings'' is the more varied. Made up mostly of small, precious objects, it leaps from ancient sculpture to contemporary photography, but concentrates on miniature paintings from the 16th through the 19th century. It's a visually stunning, speeded-up trip through a high-end version of Indian art, and intellectually stimulating as a demonstration of how social and spiritual worlds can reflect each other. The jewelry in the Beningson show furthers this idea with lots of razzle and dazzle. Hours and admission: see above.

KERRY JAMES MARSHALL, 'ONE TRUE THING: MEDITATIONS ON BLACK AESTHETICS,' the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through Jan. 9. Partly to provoke a discussion about freedom and ''Black Aesthetics,'' the MacArthur Prize-winning, Chicago-based Mr. Marshall is exhibiting recent works in a variety of media, including photographs, videos and installation. Painting is still his strong suit, however. Among the exhibition's high points are a huge, Hopperesque street scene in which a few people seem to waiting for a warehouse-size liquor store to open; and a satiric vision of ecstatic Afro-centrism featuring a black couple running joyfully naked through a pastoral landscape. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission, $7; 65+ and students, $3.
KEN JOHNSON

* 'RALPH EUGENE MEATYARD,' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Feb. 27. Maybe the most oddball of all the photographers of the ordinary, Meatyard gives reality a flip that often puts it into the realm of surreality. His creepy, staged shots of family and friends in strange masks but homey settings, or unmasked in derelict places that turn spooky, are weirdly unsettling while at the same time involved with the familiar actions of everyday life. His idea of family photographs was to take his wife and three children to broken-down houses around Lexington, Ky., the town they lived in, and depict them playing, jumping and rolling around, wearing masks or making faces, in dank interiors with broken windows or standing aimlessly in front of ruined facades. Wanting to convey the mysterious, inexpressible ties among people, Meatyard did not coax smiles or pleasing body language or any sentiment at all from his subjects. Vacant stares and brooding countenances are more the rule. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 65+.

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. There are problems with the new Museum of Modern Art, starting with its egregious $20 ticket price. The fairly inchoate assemblage of paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films from the last 30 years in the suite of double-height galleries for contemporary art on the second floor spells trouble, too. The Modern clearly still has to deal with the conflict between its historic authority when it comes to art of the first 60 or so years of the 20th century and the indeterminacy of its taste in recent art. But the building is exquisite, a great gift to the city, and you would have to be either comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that the Modern virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., now retold in an installation that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. Hours and admission: see above.

'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 16. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. Cut mostly from thin slabs of marble or wood, the cleverly joined parts are notched to fit into each other without benefit of glue, nails or other fixatives. They form a quintessentially Noguchi synthesis of the human and totemic. But the show highlights other important areas of his achievement, not least of them the products of his early days in Paris (1927-28) where he turned out a wonderful series of abstract drawings that integrate biomorphic and geometric shapes with line, signaling his embrace of modernist art. A small gallery displays the quirky abstract sculptures he called ''Lunars'' that, rigged out with light bulbs in odd places, made lamps of a fine, goofy sci-fi quality that must have seemed off the wall in 1943. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, which solar discs in stone; low-lying carved stone landscapes, and the sleek ''Bow'' of 1970, an elegantly bent tube composed of alternate bands of black granite and yellow marble, are displayed in the last gallery. Hours and admission: see above.

JENNIFER PASTOR: 'THE PERFECT RIDE,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 16. ''The Perfect Ride'' is a trio of works displayed in the Whitney's small first-floor gallery: a three-minute, slow-motion animated cartoon of a cowboy riding a bucking bull; a model of the human ear; and a large, semi-abstract sculpture of aluminum and clear plastic that represents Hoover Dam. All three involved the flow and circulation of energy, but beyond that it is hard to say what Ms. Pastor has in mind with this exceedingly cool and cerebral exhibition. Hours and admission: see above.

* 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours and admission: see above.

'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL,' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, through Feb. 6. The 40 artists here are all residents of the city's most cosmopolitan borough, though nearly a third were born outside the United States. In line with current curatorial trends, overt displays of ethnicity are played down and a certain blandness prevails. But there is some interesting work, including paintings by the Japanese-American Hideo Date, now 97 and a Queens citizen for more than half a century. His two soft-grained figurative paintings from the 1930's and 40's emanate from a distant stylistic world, one that looks fine right now. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+.

'GILBERT STUART,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 16. Known today mostly for his multiple images of George Washington, 14 of which are shown here, Stuart (1755-1828) painted many other faces, famous and not, as seen in this full-blown retrospective. Among them were Thomas Jefferson; John and Abigail Adams; the fur magnate John Jacob Astor; and doctors, lawyers, clergymen and countless British and American blueboods, their wives, children and dogs. Possessed of a penetrating talent augmented by a knowledge of physiognomy, Stuart apparently sussed out his subjects in lively conversation as he worked. Among the impressive results are the wonderful ''Catherine Brass Yates,'' an exquisite likeness of a middle-aged woman elegantly plying a needle as her long, narrow face regards the viewer with a cool stare. ''The Skater (William Grant),'' done in 1782, is a stunning full-length figure of an acquaintance from Stuart's London days performing a graceful maneuver on the ice. The last Stuart retrospective was held nearly 40 years ago; this one reveals for a new generation that he was and remains one of our greatest American painters. Hours and admission: see above.

* 'RETRATOS: 2,000 YEARS OF LATIN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through March 20. Two millenniums is a lot of terrain for even a survey cover, and this one moves from pre-Columbian sculpture to contemporary painting. But what is in between is so interesting and so unfamiliar that the trip is a pleasure. Art from the Spanish and Portuguese colonial era makes up the bulk of the work. It starts with a 16th-century portrait of three dark-skinned men, descendants of Indians and African slaves, wearing European ruffed collars, silks and distinctly un-European gold lip-rings and nose plugs. It continues with images of bewigged colonial officials, flower-crowned nuns and everyday people. Hours: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5, students and 65+; free for members; Thursdays free from 4 t 8 p.m.; 65+ free all day Thursdays.

* 'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. Hmmm. Hours and admission: see above.

'ART IN A MIRROR: COUNTERPROOFS OF MARY CASSATT,' Adelson Galleries, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 439-6800, through Jan. 14. These recently discovered counterproofs would seem to be of more interest to Cassatt scholars than to the general public. Like some of her Impressionist colleagues, Cassatt (1844-1926) made them by the simple method of pressing a damp sheet of paper on the face of existing work -- here, pastels -- transferring a mirror image of the original, but faded and softened. The 48 shown, sweet portraits of mothers with infants, children alone or posing with pets, pale by comparison with the sharp chromatics of Cassatt's wonderful prints.

ROGER BROWN, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338, through Jan. 15. Roger Brown (1941-1997) was one of the most original artists to emerge from Chicago after World War II. He blended influences from Indian miniature painting, Giorgio DiChirico, Grant Wood, Outsider Art and old comics to create mysteriously enchanting landscapes and cityscapes populated by tiny, silhouetted people. The nine canvases dating from 1968 to 1982 on view here are the first Brown exhibition to be presented in New York in 10 years.

CHARLES DE WOLF BROWNELL: 'A DECADE OF TRAVEL, 1856-66,' Hirschl & Adler Galleries, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, through Feb. 5. Brownell (1822-1909), a New England-born landscapist, did watercolors in Cuba over a 10-year period, while wintering on sugar and coffee plantations owned by his family there. His detailed record of the Cuban landscape, said to be the most comprehensive visual account of that country by an American artist up to that time, ranges from close-up renditions of plants and foliage to a panoramic view -- the largest work in the show -- of the Bay of Matanzas, the region that was the center of the sugar industry. But most of these images are small, taken from a visual diary he kept of his travels. After his intensive Cuban period, he turned to views of the New England region where he grew up, especially Hartford, site of his family home, and the Connecticut River Valley. Like his Cuban work, these are delicately painted, pleasant views that capture the flavor of the New England countryside, its mountains, trees, rivers and farms.

* BILL BRANDT: 'THE NUDE: A CENTENARY EXHIBITION,' Edwynn Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 750-7070, through Jan. 8. Though he earned enormous respect as a photojournalist, making memorable studies of British life and class contrasts among other achievements, Brandt (1904-1983) liked to say that his photographs of nudes were the works by which he wanted to be remembered. This show pays tribute to his quirky, not conventionally erotic nude images from the early post-World War II days in which he photographed them melodramatically in dark, sparsely furnished interiors to later 1950's studies that were near abstractions. In these he closed in on parts, distorted or exaggerated by odd angles of focus and perspective and lighted for sharp contrasts of black and white. They often took on a surreally sensuous quality remote from everyday.
GLUECK

JULIO LARRAZ, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900, through Jan. 8. Mr. Larraz, who came to the United States from Cuba as a teenager in 1961, produces a generously painterly realism that often veers into surrealistic fantasy. His canvases record scenes of ordinary beauty, like the images of a melting block of ice or potted bougainvilleas for sale on a sunlighted boat deck. Then there is Vincent van Gogh visiting a modern aquarium in which a big shark hovers behind the thick glass.

'FLIPSIDE,' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, through Jan. 8. This lively and messy group show presents artists who have participated in programs organized by Artslink, which has worked to promote contemporary art in Eastern Europe. It includes a few Americans, but the interest is mainly in the Eastern Europeans, who employ conceptualist and often sardonically ironic strategies to address the ''flipside'' of history: a post-Soviet time of declining hope for socialist and utopian possibilities.

Galleries: Chelsea

MARGARITA CABRERA: 'VOCHO,' Sara Meltzer, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 727-9330, through Jan. 15. The one work in this exhibition is a full-size 1970's-era Volkswagen Beetle replicated almost entirely in yellow, black and gray vinyl. The El Paso-based Ms. Cabrera dismantled an actual car and used the parts as patterns to cut her material, which she stitched together on a sewing machine. Claes Oldenberg's soft sculpture comes to mind, but Ms. Cabrera's work addresses more specific political and economic issues having to do with relations between Mexico and the United States.
JOHNSON

KEITH EDMIER, Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467, through Jan. 15. The main attraction of this exceptionally inventive sculptor's exhibition is a pair of plants resembling palm trees cast from life in gray polyurethane. The plastic trees emerge from mounds of artificially produced lava, and from the top of each apparently dead tree emerges a bright yellow reproductive organ -- a female pod on one and an erect, pinecone-like element from the other. The symbolism is hackneyed but the spotlighted installation is effectively weird.
JOHNSON

AMY ELLINGSON: 'SEMPER AUGUSTUS,' Charles Cowles, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-8999, through Jan. 15. This California-based artist's first New York solo show presents paintings that are optically enthralling and sensuously tactile. Ms. Ellingson generates complex, layered patterns of gridded ovals on a computer, and converts them into satiny, subtly color-coordinated oil-painted fields on top of which she applies grids of thick, white or black ovals made in encaustic.
JOHNSON

'MATERIAL AS METAPHOR,' Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, through Jan. 15. An exhibition of works that are emphatically physical yet poetic includes comically anthropomorphic sculptures by Miroslaw Balka; a darkly surrealistic sculptural landscape by Mark Manders; an arrangement of mostly yellow found and hand-made objects by Ian Kiaer; roses wrapped in spirals of puffy white cotton by Valeska Soares; elegantly spare fabric works by Helen Mirra; and lumps of fat in a cardboard box by Joseph Beuys.

ODILI DONALD ODITA: 'NOTES FROM PARADISE,' Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Dec. 31. The Nigerian-born, Tallahassee, Fla.-based Mr. Odita paints hard-edged, gridded, beautifully color-coordinated abstractions with intimations of landscape and African textile design. They are a pleasure to view, and the wedding of Modernism and traditionalism is something to ponder.

ANDERS PETERSEN, Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363, through Jan. 31. Gritty, bleak and often darkly humorous black-and-white photographs by this Swedish photographer variously call to mind Robert Frank, Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin, but Mr. Petersen's work has its own raw pungency. This exhibition includes a series from 1978 documenting social life in a grungy bar; a series from 1995 shot in a psychiatric clinic; and recent diaristic works, often blurred and shot at oblique angles, recording what seems a life of volatile moodiness.
JOHNSON

JOEL-PETER WITKIN: 'HEART BEATS DUST,' Ricco-Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through Dec. 31. This pioneer of high-art, gross-out, postmodernist photography continues to produce faux-antique pictures of amputees, hermaphrodites, severed body parts and absurdly overwrought erotic tableaus. He has also ventured, unconvincingly, into Surrealistic collage, and he has applied paint by hand to some of his prints. A good title for this exhibition would be ''Lost in Transition.''
JOHNSON

Other Galleries

'FIGHT OR FLIGHT,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453. Through Feb. 18. Six artists were asked to make works about fear and anxiety. Excepting Rico Gatson's kaleidoscopic video punctuated by exploding bombs, none directly address war or terrorism. Amy Gartrell's psychedelic felt banners spoof self-affirmation mantras, Kristin Baker's semiabstract paintings evoke car crashes and Marc Swanson's ship mast with a square sail of stitched-together T-shirts encourages a spirit of adventure. Little carnivorous horses graze on the flesh of a fallen dragon in Ivan Witenstein's large fantasy sculpture and an installation by Wangechi Mutu stages a surrealistic shootout.
JOHNSON

'IN THIS PLACE,' Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473, through Jan. 22. This exhibition of photographs and videos by 15 artists includes works that evoke specific places, like Claudio Nolasco's street-level views of Williamsburg and Francesca Romeo's powerful video record of life in a Lower East Side bar. But too many others look like they could have been made just about anywhere -- Clifford Owens's sadomasochistic video performance piece set in an empty studio, for example -- and that undermines the thesis of the show's curator, Allen Frame.
JOHNSON

JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE,' City Hall Park, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 14, 2005. Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style by this British artist include cartoon fashion models painted on freestanding sheets of glass; life-size enamel-on-steel representations of new cars; a quartet of playhouse-scale, 19th-century-style buildings of painted plywood entitled ''Village?''; and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows.
JOHNSON

Last Chance

'ART OF THE DEFINITE'; ALEXI WORTH: 'ONLY CONNECT,' DC Moore, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-2111, through Thursday. Organized by the painter Helen Miranda Wilson, ''The Art of the Definite'' is a beautiful show of paintings by 14 artists devoted to the Modernist fundamentals of flatness and compositional order. It includes ancestors like Myron Stout and Paul Feeley, mid-career painters like Stephen Westfall and Thomas Nozkowski and newcomers like Karen Dow and Chuck Webster. Mr. Worth's series of small paintings of the rear view of a balding businessman being punched by a colleague toys cannily with flatness and illusionism.
JOHNSON

YOAN CAPOTE: 'ANIMICA,' George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665, through Thursday. Works by this Havana-based Surrealist include a suitcase containing a brick wall; a stack of concrete blocks separated by rows of clenched, polished bronze teeth called ''Stress''; a faux-classical Greek male torso with a brain replacing its genitalia; and real leather shoes that have weirdly merged at the toes.

HEADLINE: In N.F.L., Players Have a Voice That Even the Owners Listen To

BYLINE: By DAMON HACK

 BODY:
The cotton was always waiting for him, exploding in tufts of white. Eugene Upshaw would go to the field every day and work his way up and down the stalks, filling his bags with the lifeblood of Robstown, Tex. For 100 pounds, he made $1.25. On good days, he pulled in $5.
 He was 7 years old when he started.
 ''The bush had cotton bolls, and the bolls would burst when you pulled the cotton,'' Upshaw, now the executive director of the National Football League Players Association, said in a recent interview in his office in Washington. ''When I was a teenager, I could carry three sacks at a time. I was picking 300 or 400 pounds a day. It was required. It was how we bought clothes for school.'' 
 It was there, in the segregated South of his youth, where Upshaw's sensibilities about employment were born, sensibilities that would follow him as he became a guard with the Oakland Raiders, a union player representative and, today, one of the most prominent figures in professional sports.
 In the coming months, Upshaw's visibility will increase as the union continues to engage the N.F.L. in collective bargaining that will either extend the longest current run of labor peace among the four major professional sports or end in strife. The current agreement expires in the spring of 2008. But if the two sides fail to extend the deal before 2007, that season will be played without a salary cap, a situation the owners want to avoid. 
 Both sides have called the negotiation the most difficult in a decade; at its heart is a tussle over which side controls the flow of certain unshared revenue. 
 Upshaw, as much as anyone over the past two decades, has been central to the league's issues with drugs, health care and player salaries. In the union's most notable achievement, he also spearheaded the players' fight for free agency, which the N.F.L instituted along with a salary cap in 1994.
 But Michael Irvin, the former Dallas Cowboys receiver, once criticized Upshaw for making poor business decisions that he felt left the players underpaid. At times during his leadership, Upshaw has been called many things, including bull-headed. 
 ''I've found him tough, stubborn and dogmatic, but also reasonable, fair and respectful,'' said Harold Henderson, the chairman of the N.F.L. management council who has worked opposite Upshaw for 13 years. ''Over time we have become friendly. We are not enemies, and we don't act like that in any way.''
 Upshaw, who does not have a law degree, has been an interesting case study for legal scholars who have watched his stewardship in a time when labor issues are paramount in professional sports. 
 ''Among sports law people, there is no question that Don Fehr and Bob Goodenow have a higher reputation than Gene Upshaw because they are seen as cerebral lawyers,'' said Stephen F. Ross, a professor of law at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, referring to the executive directors of the Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League players unions. ''Lawyers respond to lawyers. But given that he doesn't have formal legal training, I think he has done an impressive job on details in negotiations. The union he inherited is very weak and it's harder to keep together.''
 Upshaw, whose office shelves are filled with business books, has a refrain for those who question his lack of legal training. ''With all due respect to attorneys, when God issued brains, they weren't the only ones that got them,'' he said.

Healthy After Football
 At 59, Upshaw maintains the confidence of a former athlete and the feistiness of a member of the Oakland Raiders, the team he played for from 1967 through 1981, winning two Super Bowls and forging a Hall of Fame career. At 6 feet 5 inches, he played at 255 pounds and still appears rock solid. 
 Upshaw spends nearly every lunch hour running on a treadmill, setting the pace from 7.0 to 7.2 miles an hour. His body, he says, is free of the aches and pains that follow many former football players to the grave. Upshaw wears his dress shirts snug.
 He is paid well for his job, for which he traveled to all 32 N.F.L. cities this season to address players about his negotiations with the league. According to the Department of Labor, Upshaw received a $2,559,615 salary in the 12-month period ended March 1. Five years ago, his salary was $900,000.
 ''It's not a small number, but it doesn't bother me that people know,'' Upshaw said. ''It is what it is. This is a $6 billion industry, not a small endeavor. What we do affects players in the long run, coming in and going out. When you drive to a stadium, someone has to tell you where to park, someone has to serve food, there is security; all of these things happen around this crazy ball.''

Good Rapport With Owners
 According to the union, the average N.F.L. player salary is $1.3 million, trailing the average salaries in the National Hockey League ($1.8 million), Major League Baseball ($2.3 million) and the National Basketball Association ($4.9 million).
 Still, the N.F.L. players voted Upshaw to his eighth three-year term as executive director in March 2003.
 ''Gene does a great job of listening to the players and knowing what we're looking for,'' said David Akers, the Philadelphia Eagles' kicker and player representative. ''It's just a matter of how good he is negotiating. In the past, he's done a good job. Right now, our future is in his hands.''
 Upshaw has overseen the extension of retired players' health-care benefits (to five years from less than one year) and instituted a drug policy with Henderson and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue that is held up as a model in professional sports.
 The amicable relationship between the N.F.L. and the union has helped keep labor peace since 1987, while Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League have been shut down by strikes and lockouts. The N.F.L. and its players association have, in a way, become partners. 
 ''The beauty of the relationship is that we have a common interest in getting it out of the game, whether it's Balco, steroids, whatever,'' Upshaw said of his work with Tagliabue.
 ''We understand how delicate it is for our product to be in a situation where the fans don't show up because they have no confidence in the game. When you look at the drug policy, our players don't want it in the game. When the baseball players don't want it in the game, it will get out. That's what happened with us. This is the only area in which the football players basically gave the owners the right for random testing because they wanted it out of the game.''
 Upshaw said he and Tagliabue speak on the telephone almost every day.
 ''Part of it is who Gene is and what his character is,'' Tagliabue said of his relationship with Upshaw. ''Part of it is his immersion in the collective bargaining process, his understanding of the specifics of the game and what it takes to play the game. 
 ''He's a hard-nosed realist who represents his people well, and he knows that bargaining is a process of give and take and that it has to do with the realities of the economics of the business and what's in the mutual best interest of the employers and, in this context, the players.''
 Dan Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, said of Upshaw: ''The biggest impression that I get, and the reason that I have so much respect for him, is he likes the game, he understands the game and he played the game. When we're talking about players being on injured reserve and getting them off of it, he totally understands the implications. He represents the players extremely well.''

A Stinging Defeat
 The collegial atmosphere between Upshaw and the ownership did not always exist. 
 During the 1987 strike, owners briefly fielded replacements, and the players ultimately crossed the picket line as the union sustained a debilitating defeat. The bitterness lasted well into the 1990's.
 Neal Olkewicz, a Washington Redskins linebacker and player representative during the 1987 strike, recalled the sinking feeling players felt as the strike crumbled.
 ''I thought we got our butts kicked,'' Olkewicz said from Brookville, Md., where he owns a vending-machine business. ''When the owners put on replacement games, it basically broke our backs.''
 Of the strike's fallout, Henderson said: ''They were nasty times. There was a lot of suspicion and distrust. There was a lot of resentment from the owners, a feeling that 'We showed them' by breaking the strike. The players had to struggle through that.
 ''They lost big time, and they hung on long enough to bounce back. It wasn't instantaneous, but over the course of the years, you could see a sense of trust building. Gene distinguished himself from other union leaders in other sports by recognizing the advantages of a cap deal and a partnership where players got a share of the money. It has worked to everybody's advantage.''
 Upshaw says he remembers the bad times, too. Some of those early years, he says, were tinged by racial bigotry.
 ''It's hard for people to understand, unless you're black, that they don't have to hold a sign up to say that they don't want you in the room and they don't want to talk to you,'' Upshaw said. ''We had a bunch of guys who grew up in a different time and place. Fortunately, ownership changed during the 1990's.
 ''But I was always aware, I knew about it, and I knew how to react to it. I would not let it be a reason to not do what was best on behalf of the players. You have to remember, it's about them, it's not about me.''
 Upshaw's wife, Terri, said: ''Early in the 80's, I think things were tough, but he either masks it very well or doesn't let it get to him. You would think he'd be gray and have ulcers, but he doesn't. There are very few people cut from the same cloth Gene is cut from. He has some really strong basic morals.''
 Upshaw never expected to be a union leader when he entered the N.F.L. But circumstances kept steering him that way.
 Playing in the Bay Area during the early 1970's, Upshaw became involved with the Democratic Party. He started attending speeches by California political leaders like Jerry Brown and Ron Dellums. Soon, Upshaw's teammates were calling him Governor.
 ''I'll never forget a speech Ron Dellums made at a convention about dignity,'' Upshaw said. ''That stuck with me as if they had painted it on my skin. As I go through what I do now, I look at the aspects of how it can help players have a better station in life when it's all over.''
 Upshaw makes his own speeches now, many of them to players. Though long retired, he says he feels a kinship with them. He contends that the players should earn a larger share of the money teams generate through their local ventures. 
 ''When they stop asking me, 'Gene, what should we do?' then there will be somebody else doing this job,'' Upshaw said. ''But they always trust me to come back with a good package. I don't want them to limp out, I want them to leave when they want to leave; I want them to have some choices, and that's why free agency was so important, because you can decide, not just them. We have to have dignity, and then the economics will take care of itself.''

HEADLINE: A Racing Life: Plenty of Men And Fast Cars

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

'Bugatti Queen'
'In Search of a French Racing Legend'
By Miranda Seymour
Illustrated. 323 pages. Random House. $24.95.
 When Helene Delangle died in 1984, in a tiny unheated apartment in Nice, the event passed unremarked. The theatrical charity that had supported her in her final years placed a small obituary notice in Le Figaro. Her landlord, keen to rent the premises, cleared out her belongings, giving away two boxes filled with old clippings, letters and photographs. And that was that.
 It was a sad end to a brilliant life. Few of the neighbors had any idea that the frail old woman with no teeth had once set speed record after speed record driving for Bugatti in the 1930's. Racing under the name Helle Nice, she was the world's undisputed female champion, and a top competitor against the best male drivers of the era. 
 Miranda Seymour became fascinated by Helle Nice after an antiques dealer showed her a curious collection of papers that he had acquired at a flea market in the South of France. These were Delangle's scrapbooks and clippings, and they told a wondrous tale, the story of a small-town postmaster's daughter who gained a small measure of fame as a showgirl in Paris's music halls and then soared to racing stardom when she slipped behind the wheel of a Bugatti 35C and broke the track record at Montlhery, the French Indianapolis. Only when a tire exploded did she take her foot off the accelerator. ''The girl has guts,'' the French papers would later say.
 Ms. Seymour, who has written biographies of Mary Shelley and Robert Graves, found Delangle's story irresistible, and no wonder. It has everything: a beautiful woman, Paris when it sizzled, fast cars and a tragic denouement. The only things missing, for long stretches, are the facts, but Ms. Seymour did not let that stop her in writing this fast-paced, frothy biography.
 Taking a novelist's free license, she simply filled in the gaps with imagined scenes, speculating on what Delangle must have been feeling in various situations, and wondering if she might have met this one or that one -- say, Maurice Chevalier, a fellow performer at the Casino de Paris in the 1920's. It's simply too delicious not to imagine that the notoriously promiscuous Chevalier did not have ''a brief affair with the pretty, newly blond dancer who was given star billing in his show.'' 
 The dashing Philippe de Rothschild requires special treatment, a fantasy sequence in which Delangle recalls their first meeting: ''Smiling, he lifted her hand to his mouth and, looking into her eyes, touched the tiny area of revealed skin with his mouth and, very lightly, the tip of his tongue. It was the most delicate of gestures. She knew at once that the experience of being made love to by this man would give her pleasure.'' 
 If the writing is ripe, so is the subject. Not too many French girls made the leap from a one-horse town like Ste. Mesme to the footlights of Paris and the arms of a Rothschild, not to mention the Grand Prix circuit. Delangle did it with ease. Arriving in Paris as a teenager, she rented a room and, for a short spell, posed in the nude for the kinds of naughty photographs sold to tourists.
 For reasons unknown, she adopted the name Helle Nice. Her looks, and the ballet training that she seems to have picked up along the way, landed her a spot in a chorus line, which paid for her first car, a Citroen that she bought in 1920 and nicknamed Maisie.
 It was a glamour era for racing. In France, the sport was dominated by former flying aces and socially prominent amateurs, the sorts of men who stared death in the face and laughed. They had to. Long-distance races, run on rutted dirt roads, routinely involved multiple fatalities, as drivers lost control and skidded into trees, often taking spectators with them. Regardless, women like Delangle caught the racing fever, too.
 It is not at all clear how Delangle picked up her racing skills. Perhaps the ballet training had something to do with her vaunted finesse and control. She was an avid skier and mountain climber, pursuits that may explain her remarkable powers of endurance in grueling long-distance races. Whatever the reason, she soon made a name for herself in celebrity charity rallies, and Ettore Bugatti, quick to see a promotional opportunity for his automobiles, signed her up as a driver. She repaid his faith by winning race after race, breaking dozens of speed records along the way. Fame and fortune followed.
 Delangle loved the spotlight. She also loved the company of men -- many men. ''The list of lovers, aristocrat and otherwise, who became involved with Helle Nice during the 1930's is almost as long as the list of races in which she took part,'' Ms. Seymour observes. ''Fortunately for us,'' she adds, ''she had the helpful habit of marking their names with an X in her new black address book.''
 Her luck turned in 1936. After a quick American tour that took her deep into the heart of future Nascar territory, she suffered a near-fatal crash in Sao Paulo after hitting an errant bale of hay in the middle of the track. She recovered, setting 10 world records the next year, but the German occupation effectively ended her career.
 When a fellow driver, after the war, publicly accused her of being a Gestapo agent, a charge that Ms. Seymour rebuts, she became unemployable. Bad investments and untrustworthy boyfriends did the rest.
 In a dark decade, Helle Nice shone with a bright light. Perhaps a little too bright for some. ''It was ridiculous, the way she went on,'' a female competitor tells the author. ''Frankly, I don't think she ever thought about anything but sex and showing off.'' That's one way of putting it. Or you could say the girl had guts.

HEADLINE: If Home Prices Plunge, Will Damage Be Worst in Democratic States?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
NO boom lasts forever, and in countries like Britain and Australia, the housing market has suddenly turned lower, leading to discussions of how a plunge can be avoided and what will happen if it is not.
 The American housing market received a scare yesterday, with a report that the pace of new-home sales slipped in November as the median price of a new home fell to the lowest level in a year. But mortgage applications indicate that a rebound has begun, and in any case, prices of new homes can fail to capture price trends for existing homes in areas without new construction.
 A more reliable measure, albeit one that is reported more slowly, is an index that compares prices over time on the same house and is put together by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Even though the index excludes many higher-priced homes, and thus probably understates house price inflation, it is booming like never before. 
 Through the third quarter, it showed prices up 13 percent over the previous 12 months. The index, which dates to 1980, had never before recorded even a 10 percent annual gain. In the last five years, the index shows a gain of 48.5 percent, while consumer prices for things other than housing have risen 11.8 percent. The absolute gain and the spread over inflation are records. The only time that was even close was the period through 1989, which was followed by a housing bust in 1990 that caused prices to plunge in some areas.
 If this is a bubble, its creation can be traced in no small part to the Federal Reserve's efforts to deal with the bursting of the stock market bubble. It cut rates aggressively and the 2001 recession was a mild one. The very low cost of borrowing, coming at a time when alternative investments seemed less desirable, encouraged a big run in home prices, whose growth outstripped both personal income and rental prices.
 There are indications that speculation is rising. Patrick Lawler, the chief economist of the agency that compiles the index, reports that the popularity of interest-only and adjustable rate mortgages is rising. That would indicate more and more buyers are straining to qualify for loans -- and would be vulnerable if interest rates rose.
 The housing market would not have to collapse to have a negative impact on the economy. Even a lack of appreciation could put a damper on consumer spending by depressing sentiment and the volume of refinancings.
 House prices vary significantly by market, of course, and it is reasonable to think that a decline in prices would be most likely in areas that have had the strongest gains. And those areas are concentrated in states that voted Democratic in the last election. Of the 12 states with the fastest-rising home prices in the last four years, only Nevada and Florida voted for President Bush. The 12 states with the smallest gains all backed Mr. Bush. 
 Over all, states that supported Senator John Kerry averaged a 47 percent rise, while prices in Bush states climbed 24 percent. Rhode Island and California led the list of states, although neither could match the 80 percent rise in the District of Columbia. In California, the median-price home costs $460,000, and the state association of Realtors says only 19 percent of the state's residents earn enough to afford to buy such a home. 
 With the trade deficit hitting records, the American government seems to welcome a weak dollar. But there are surely limits to that. A nightmare for the Fed would be that it finds itself under pressure to raise rates to support the dollar, just at the time that a weakening housing market needs lower rates to avoid big declines. If that were to happen, the Fed might regret having done so much to encourage the boom in home prices.

HEADLINE: Growing Global Unease Over Ballooning Deficits

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
The dollar hit another record low against the euro on Thursday, and sank against other major currencies, in what analysts said was a growing unease about the ballooning trade and budget deficits in the United States.
 The euro briefly traded at $1.35 against the dollar, with traders around the world betting that the dollar would fall further next year. 
 The dollar has fallen about 7 percent against the euro since President Bush won re-election on Nov. 2 and is down about a third in the last two years.
 Mr. Bush has essentially brushed off concerns about the dollar's decline, declaring this month that he favored a ''strong dollar'' but that ''markets should make the decision'' about its value. A declining dollar benefits the American economy in the short term by making exports cheaper overseas, and manufacturers have already expanded as a result. The decline should also help to reduce the trade deficit by making imports more expensive. 
 But in recent weeks global investors have become more anxious about the trade deficit, which is likely to exceed $600 billion this year, as well as the federal government's need to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars a year for the foreseeable future.
 Foreign capital inflows into the United States have slowed significantly in the last year, and much of the money has come from Asian central banks, seeking to prop up the dollar, rather than from foreign private investors.
 An abrupt fall in the dollar could lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates, creating potentially serious problems for Mr. Bush next year.
 White House officials are already trying to assuage bond investors about the administration's attempt to overhaul Social Security, a project that is likely to require the government to borrow as much as $2 trillion over the next decade or two. 
 Anxiety about a potentially steep fall in the dollar could prompt foreign investors to demand higher interest rates on Treasury bonds to compensate for the risk of a plunge in the value of those bonds.
 But the more immediate pressure, and potentially a greater danger for Mr. Bush, is that foreign investors may be losing their appetite for the flood of Treasury bonds being sold to finance the federal budget deficit.
 Foreign capital inflows to the United States, which finance the trade deficit and to some extent the budget deficit, have slowed significantly.
 Ashraf Laidi, currency strategist at M.G. Financial, noted that net foreign investment into the United States last January was nearly twice as large as the nation's trade deficit in goods and services.
 But that investment flow has declined in almost every month since. In October, the most recent month with data available, net investment flows into the United States were lower than the monthly trade deficit.
 ''This is a reminder that the macroeconomic structural concerns about the dollar are here to stay,'' Mr. Laidi said. ''What is really a concern is the fast pace of increase in the trade deficit, compared to the rate at which foreign money is coming into the U.S.''
 Analysts say there has been a major shift in attitudes among foreign investors. During the boom of the late 1990's, investors poured trillions of dollars into the United States, much of it by buying companies and real estate, because the returns seemed higher than those available in most other regions of the world.
 Now the opposite is happening: the dollar is declining even though the economic news has been fairly good. The economy has expanded about 4 percent this year, with growth rebounding after a summer slowdown caused in part by rising oil prices.
 On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods jumped 1.6 percent in November, the biggest monthly increase since July. Consumer confidence climbed last month, according to the University of Michigan's latest survey of consumers, though consumer spending was almost flat.
 Anthony Chan, senior economist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, said the dollar's decline was primarily a result of foreign anxiety about the United States' growing indebtedness.
 He said that a nation's currency can weaken because its growth is slower than elsewhere, but growth in the United States is much faster than that of Europe and Japan. 
 A currency can also weaken because a nation's interest rates are lower. But interest rates are now higher in the United States than in Europe. 
 ''I really think the current-account deficit is one of the driving factors behind the weakness of the dollar,'' Mr. Chan said. ''It's obviously not because of our growth, which is higher than in Europe. And our interest rates are higher. That leaves the current-account deficit.''
 A continued fall in the dollar, but especially a sharp and disruptive fall, would pose unpleasant choices for President Bush.
 Intervening to prop up the dollar would be a major policy reversal, and it would almost certainly require him to seek coordinated assistance from Canada, Europe and Japan. 
 A stronger dollar could also slow the growth of American exports, prompting complaints from many American manufacturers. Indeed, manufacturing companies were furious because Mr. Bush and his first Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, turned a deaf ear to their pleas for a weaker dollar.
 But a continued fall in the dollar could drive up interest rates, because foreign investors would start demanding higher yields to offset the risk of a declining dollar. Because a falling dollar could fuel inflation, the Federal Reserve would come under greater pressure to fight inflation with higher interest rates.
 Thus far, the dollar's decline has had surprisingly little impact on consumer prices. 
 But long-term interest rates, even though they remain extremely low, have been affected by the dollar's decline.
 Analysts note that investors are now demanding higher yields from 10-year Treasury bonds than from comparable European bonds. 
 In a recent report entitled ''Sell U.S., Buy Europe,'' Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley, predicted that the gap was likely to widen in part because of the growing risk to foreign investors of a further decline in the dollar's value.

HEADLINE: Getting Personal, Putin Voices Defiance of Critics Abroad

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday strongly defended Russia's takeover of the main subsidiary of the Yukos oil company by a state oil company. He also expressed deep irritation at the West's support for popular uprisings in post-Soviet states and what he described as Western double standards for elections. 
 Mr. Putin's remarks, made at an annual holiday-season news conference in the Kremlin, amounted to a forceful restatement of widely known positions and a sometimes layered explanation of the views driving Russia in an increasingly autocratic direction this year. But even as Mr. Putin maintained a calm demeanor, at times speaking softly, his statements were notable for their sharp tone.
 The fate of Yukos was a clear example. The main subsidiary of Yukos, once Russia's largest and most profitable company, was auctioned on Sunday for a fraction of its estimated value to a previously unheard-of shell company, and later resold to Rosneft, a company owned by the state. No final sale price has been disclosed, and the process remains cloaked in mystery. Industry analysts have characterized the transfers as Kremlin-rigged farces. 
 Mr. Putin said the sales were perfectly justified and suggested they righted past wrongs. He neglected to mention that as recently as late September, he said Russia had no intention of nationalizing the oil giant and had vowed transparency since then.
 ''You all know very well how privatization took place here in the early 1990's, and how, using various tricks and sometimes violating the laws that were in effect at that time, many market participants got hold of state property worth many billions,'' he said. ''Today the state, using absolutely legal market mechanisms, is securing its interests. I consider this to be quite normal.''
 But later, Washington criticized the sale of the oil giant. 
 ''We certainly don't think it's been disposed of in a transparent or open way,'' a State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli, said, according to Agence France-Presse. ''We think this sends the wrong signals to foreign investors and could negatively impact Russia's role in the global economy.''
 He added that the case ''raises serious concerns about the rule of law as applied in Russia and the way that justice is perhaps politically or selectively applied.''
 Mr. Putin also engaged in personal attacks in his comments. Speaking of a United States Bankruptcy Court judge in Texas, who issued an injunction last week trying to block the auction of Yuganskneftegaz, the Yukos subsidiary that now belongs to Rosneft, he set aside any pretense of tact. 
 ''I am not even sure that the judge knows where Russia is,'' he said. Then, even as he insulted the judge, he added that her work ''fails to comply with international politeness.''
 Mr. Putin was also personally dismissive of President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland, who helped mediate the impasse in Ukraine after the fraudulent president election there on Nov. 21, and who recently said in an interview that a Ukraine free of Russia's sway was better for the world's leading countries. 
 Assuming a biting tone, he suggested that Mr. Kwasniewski was an opportunist who was playing to the West. He noted that the Polish leader in his youth worked for Soviet interests as a member of the Communist Party's youth wing, the Komsomol. 
 ''We in Russia, though not I personally, know him from the times he was working with the Komsomol with us,'' said Mr. Putin, who served with the K.G.B. ''I get the impression that this is not a statement by an incumbent president, but a statement by an individual who is seeking employment in connection with the end of his term of office.''
 Mr. Kwasniewski later released a statement that called Mr. Putin remarks ''unjust.''
 ''This is the price Poland and I personally pay for participation in the settlement of the political crisis in Ukraine,'' his statement said.
 In all, it was an afternoon of practiced defiance of Western critics. Mr. Putin expressed irritation over what he called double standards in Western assessments of elections in troubled states -- with critics pointing out, for instance, that the recent presidential elections in Chechnya were unsound in part because of the continuing conflict there, and yet the United States intends to continue with elections in occupied Iraq.
 He also criticized the continuation of revolution in post-Soviet nations, as occurred in Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine this fall. ''The most dangerous thing is creating a system of permanent revolutions,'' he said. ''One should get used to living in line with the law.''
 Yet at moments, the display was carefully calibrated, showing signs that he has apparently decided whom he should avoid confronting head-on. Many Russian politicians, including several close to him, have accused the United States of underwriting and encouraging the mass demonstrations in Ukraine. But Mr. Putin signaled a general satisfaction with Russia's relationship with the United States, saying the two nations are cooperating in fighting terrorism and in nuclear nonproliferation.
 ''I would say, without any exaggeration, that our relations are not those of partners, but of allies,'' he said. ''Behind all of these current things of the here and now, semi-scandalous things or simply things that attract public attention because of tactical reasons, I would urge you not to forget these fundamental things that lie at the basis of our relations with the United States.''
 And he pointedly expressed his own satisfaction with his relationship with President Bush. ''Bush himself, in my view, is a very decent man and a consistent man,'' he said. ''We have said repeatedly in public that our opinions do not always coincide, but I fully trust him as a partner.''
 Mr. Putin rarely appears for extended periods in public, and journalists' access to him is limited; on Thursday, he seemed at times to enjoy this unusual bit of give-and-take. Even when expressing irritation or disgust, or when offering straight-faced comparisons that strained credulity -- for example, drawing a parallel between the election abuses in Ukraine and what he called intimidation of voters in the presidential election in the United States -- he appeared comfortable and relaxed. 
 After an hour and 45 minutes, an aide tried to stop the news conference, but Mr. Putin continued, calling on journalists himself. After two-and-a-half hours, he said he would take five last questions. He then took 11 more.
 His body language throughout spoke of someone eager for a bit of sparring. When he was asked questions, he often leaned far back in his chair and rolled his shoulders or adjusted his spine, an athletic gesture vaguely suggestive of a man between weight-lifting sets, except that sometimes as he repositioned his frame, he sipped tea from a fine china cup. 
 When each question ended, he pushed himself forward to the desktop in front of him, rested his weight onto his forearms and offered long, detailed answers. Working without notes, his command of the finer points of obscure areas of public policy -- the monthly wage of a private serving in Chechnya, the percentage of cargo carried by rail in Germany, the clauses of a 1956 declaration between the Soviet Union and Japan over the fate of four islands -- suggested a busy micromanager.
 ''I have tried to read documents I have to deal with,'' he said.
 He also indulged in jokes. By law Mr. Putin is limited to two consecutive terms, and he is serving the first year of his second term now. The possibility of a third term, either through a change in Russia's Constitution for the 2008 race or a return to politics in 2012, has been a source of steady speculation. Asked directly whether he would run again in 2012, he said: ''Why not in 2016? I still hope to be fit.''
 He added, somewhat cryptically, ''I do think about how we will negotiate the landmark of 2008.''

PERSON: Pamulaparthi Venkata Narasimha Rao

HEADLINE: P.V. Narasimha Rao Dies; Indian Premier, 83

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Pamulaparthi Venkata Narasimha Rao, who as prime minister in the early 1990's oversaw the initiation of India's economic reforms, died Thursday at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. He was 83.
 The cause of death was cardiac arrest, the hospital said in a statement.
 Mr. Rao, who was born in Andhra Pradesh, was the first prime minister to come from India's south, and the first from outside the family of Jawaharlal Nehru to complete a five-year term. 
 But he will be remembered most for joining his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, now the prime minister, to introduce reforms to open India's closed economy to the world and free it from stifling state control.
 Mr. Rao took this path under duress: When he took power in 1991 as leader of a minority government, the economy was ailing, and India was facing a balance-of-payments crisis.
 ''Logically we had come up against a blank wall,'' he said in an interview broadcast on New Delhi Television earlier this year. ''There was nothing more to do.'' 
 With its foreign exchange reserves depleted, India was weeks away from defaulting on its payments.
 Had that happened, he said in the interview, ''your entire economy, your honor, your place in the comity of nations, everything goes haywire.'' 
 With Mr. Rao's backing, Mr. Singh, an economist, devalued the rupee and began lifting controls and easing regulations that had hamstrung the quasi-socialist economy since independence. The government also revamped policy to promote exports.
 Mr. Rao's term in office also saw the growth of Hindu nationalism as a political force in India, highlighted by the nationalists' destruction of a 16th-century mosque at Ayodhya in December 1992. Hindu-Muslim riots followed. Critics said Mr. Rao could have done more to stop the demolition, a charge he denied.
 He also oversaw India's efforts to reposition itself in a post-cold-war world, strengthening relations with the United States and renewing ties with Israel and South Africa.
 Mr. Rao, a lawyer and scholar, served as a minister and as chief minister of Andhra Pradesh before being elected to the Indian Parliament in 1972. He held several cabinet posts under Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, and Rajiv Gandhi, her son, including foreign minister from 1980 to 1984.
 He returned from the political margins to take over the Congress Party after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. Not known for his charisma, and loath to give interviews, Mr. Rao was a wily, even ruthless politician capable of outfoxing rivals in a faction-riddled party.
 Reforms slowed significantly after 1993 as Mr. Rao became embroiled in fighting for his political survival. He was accused of corruption both while prime minister and afterward, in part because of his devotion to a Hindu guru, Chandraswami, who was implicated in multiple scandals. A lower court convicted him in one bribery case, but it was later overturned by a higher court. From the time he left office in 1996, after the Congress Party's defeat, virtually until his death, Mr. Rao was fighting to clear his name.
 He was also a poet and wrote fiction. In 1998 he published ''The Insider,'' which melded autobiography and sometimes saucy fiction to tell the story of a village boy who rises to become prime minister. It reflects, along with an acute understanding of his party and its flaws, a preoccupation with how power -- ''maddening, intoxicating, distracting, exciting'' -- changes those who hold it.
 A widower, Mr. Rao is survived by three sons and five daughters. 
 He told an interviewer in 1996 that he wanted to go down in history ''as a humble servant of the country.''

HEADLINE: Voting Problems in Ohio Spur Call for Overhaul

BYLINE: This article is by James Dao, Ford Fessenden and Tom Zeller Jr.; James Dao reported from Columbus for this article, Ford Fessenden from New York and Tom Zeller Jr. from Cleveland.

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
William Shambora, 53, is the kind of diligent voter who once assumed that his ballot always counted. He got a rude awakening this year. 
 Mr. Shambora, an economics professor at Ohio University, moved during the summer but failed to notify the Athens County Board of Elections until the day before the presidential election. An official told him to use a provisional ballot.
 But under Ohio law, provisional ballots are valid only when cast from a voter's correct precinct. Mr. Shambora was given a ballot for the wrong precinct, a fact he did not learn until after the election. Two weeks later, the board discarded his vote, adding him to a list of more than 300 provisional ballots that were rejected in that heavily Democratic county. 
 ''It seems like such a confused system,'' said Mr. Shambora, a John Kerry supporter who blames himself for the mistake. ''Maybe if enough people's votes had counted, the election might have turned out differently.''
 From seven-hour lines that drove voters away to malfunctioning machines to poorly trained poll workers who directed people to the wrong polling places to uneven policies about the use of provisional ballots, Ohio has become this year's example for every ailment in the United States' electoral process.
 With a state recount expected to be completed next week, few experts think the problems were enough to overturn President Bush's victory here. And many of the shortcomings have plagued elections for decades.
 But with the 36-day Florida recount of 2000 proving that every vote counts and with the two major parties near parity, the electoral system is being scrutinized more closely than ever. Election lawyers and academics say Ohio is providing a roadmap to a second generation of issues about the way the nation votes. 
 Congressional passage of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 -- which mandated the provisional ballot as a failsafe and provided states money to update voting technology -- was considered a landmark overhaul that would help prevent another Florida. 
 But an array of voting rights groups contend that Ohio has underscored shortcomings in the law, including one of its centerpieces, the provisional ballot. Now those groups are pushing for a re-examination not only of the law, but also of other voting issues, including the role of partisan secretaries of state in overseeing elections, electronic voting and the elimination of the Electoral College.
 ''We're in an environment where people believe that even the tiniest number of votes can have a huge impact,'' said Doug Chapin, director of Electionline.org, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for voting information. 
 Ohio is emblematic of that attitude. 
 In the two weeks since Mr. Bush was certified the winner here by 118,000 votes out of 5.7 million cast, watchdog groups have filed lawsuits contesting the outcome and questioning the counting of provisional ballots. The state has nearly completed a recount, at the request of the Green and Independent Parties. Liberal Democrats have demanded investigations into whether there was voter fraud, tampering and intimidation in urban districts. 
 ''This has fundamentally shocked people's sense of whether any election can be accurately counted,'' said Daniel Hoffheimer, counsel to Mr. Kerry's Ohio campaign.
 It is far from clear that Republicans in Congress will have any appetite to revisit voting issues, and many Republicans here argue that the system suffered only minor glitches, even with high voter turnout. ''There are no error-free elections,'' said Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican whom Democrats have accused of worsening the state's voting problems in the way he interpreted state law. 
 But Mr. Blackwell acknowledged that the election spotlighted the state's outdated voting system, with 68 of 88 counties still relying on punch cards. In an interview, he called for updating voting machines, and also for early voting, multiple-day voting and other changes that he said would shorten lines and encourage people to vote. 
 ''I don't think it's wrong to have high expectations,'' he said. 
 Certainly there were problems on Election Day.
 In Franklin County, a computing error initially awarded nearly 4,000 extra votes to President Bush. In Mahoning County, improperly calibrated touch screens resulted in an unknown number of votes incorrectly going to President Bush before the problem was caught. 
 And most recently, election challengers in various Ohio counties have said that the tabulators used to count punch cards may have been tampered with before the recount.
 But experts in election law say little clear evidence of fraud has emerged. Democratic officials have joined Republicans in arguing that any conspiracy to deny Mr. Kerry votes would have required Democratic complicity, because each of Ohio's 88 county election boards has two Democrats and two Republicans.
 Yet there were widespread problems, many of which point to defects in the election rules, experts say. 
 ''I think the problems weren't sufficient to cast doubt on the results,'' said Edward B. Foley, director of the Election Law Program at Ohio State University's law school. ''But I do think there were more problems than usual in Ohio.''
 Provisional ballots are a prime example. In 2002, Congress authorized using the ballots in federal elections for voters whose names do not appear on registration rolls. The ballots are sealed and held until after an election, so a voter's eligibility can be checked. Valid ballots are then counted, others discarded. 
 But Congress largely left it to the states to promulgate rules for provisional ballots, resulting in a hodgepodge of policies. In Ohio, Mr. Blackwell, who was co-chairman of Mr. Bush's state campaign, ruled that provisional ballots would be counted only when cast from a voter's proper precinct. (At least 26 other states followed the same practice.) Democrats challenged the ruling, but a federal court upheld Mr. Blackwell. 
 Rules for reviewing provisional ballots also vary widely within the state. Some counties checked voter registration records dating back several years to validate ballots; others searched only recent records. Cuyahoga County, a Democratic bastion that includes Cleveland, did not check older records, and its rejection rate for provisional ballots was about 35 percent. The state average was 23 percent. 
 Mr. Blackwell says that despite the complaints, Ohio had one of the country's highest acceptance rates for provisional ballots: 77 percent of its 155,000 provisional ballots were counted, the highest in a 16-state survey by Electionline.org. Illinois and Pennsylvania, which went for Mr. Kerry, accepted only about half of their provisional ballots. 
 Perhaps the most visible of Ohio's problems were its long lines. Christopher McQuoid reached his polling place in Columbus at 4:30 p.m., congratulating himself for beating the after-work rush. By 7:30, he was getting impatient. And when he finally voted at 9:30, there were 150 people in line behind him. 
 ''I was lucky,'' said Mr. McQuoid, a radio announcer. ''I had the day off.''
 But how many people decided not to vote because of long lines, and was it enough to make a difference? No one has been able to say with authority. Much attention has focused on whether elections officials served one constituency better than another.
 Among the 464 complaints about long lines in Ohio collected by the Election Protection Coalition, a loose alliance of voting rights advocates and legal organizations, nearly 400 came from Columbus and Cleveland, where a huge proportion of the state's Democratic voters live. 
 ''It's possible that it made a difference in the outcome but unlikely,'' said Dan Tokaji, an assistant professor of law at Ohio State, where academics plan a voter survey to test whether large numbers were discouraged. 
 In Columbus, Franklin County election officials reduced the number of electronic voting machines assigned to downtown precincts and added them in the suburbs. They used a formula based not on the number of registered voters, but on past turnout in each precinct and on the number of so-called active voters -- a smaller universe.
 By contrast, the state's most populous county, Cuyahoga, allocated machines based on the total number of voters, a move that the county's election director, Michael Vu, said helped stave off even bigger lines.
 In the Columbus area, the result was that suburban precincts that supported Mr. Bush tended to have more machines per registered voter than center-city precincts that supported Mr. Kerry -- 4.6 machines per 1,000 voters in Mr. Bush's 50 strongest precincts, compared with 3.9 in Mr. Kerry's 50 best. Mr. McQuoid's precinct, a Kerry stronghold, lost one of the four machines it had in 2000, despite an increase in registration.
 ''Somebody came up with a very sophisticated plan for machine distribution which, either by accident or design, greatly enhanced the president,'' said Robert Fitrakis of Columbus, who is part of a group that has contested the election results in court.
 Matthew Damschroder, a Republican who is the director of elections in Franklin County, said the urban precincts lost machines because many of their voters had not voted recently and because those precincts historically had had low turnout.
 Indeed, election results show that a much higher suburban turnout on Nov. 2 meant that machines in Bush areas were more heavily used on average, although whether that was because their voters were less easily discouraged by long lines or simply more efficient in voting is unclear. 
 ''Most of the precincts that stayed open late because of long lines were in the suburbs,'' said William Anthony Jr., a Democrat who is chairman of the Franklin County election board. 
 Another area of contention is the large number of ballots -- 96,000 by recent counts -- that registered no vote for president. Known as ''residual'' or ''lost'' votes, they involve cases where no candidate for president appeared to have been selected or where multiple candidates were chosen, rendering the ballot invalid for that race. 
 The problem was pronounced in minority areas, typically Kerry strongholds. In Cleveland ZIP codes where at least 85 percent of the population is black, precinct results show that one in 31 ballots registered no vote for president, more than twice the rate of largely white ZIP codes, where one in 75 registered no vote for president. 
 Experts say punch cards contributed to the problem, because the ballots, which require voters to punch a hole through a heavy-stock paper, are prone to partial perforations, or the buildup of chads. Election officials say that nearly 77,000 of the 96,000 residual ballots in Ohio were punch cards.
 But Mr. Foley, the election expert at Ohio State, noted that some people consciously withhold their votes for president and that 77,000 residual punch cards is in keeping with failure rates for punch cards nationwide. 
 Mr. Blackwell said Ohio's residual votes actually declined this year from 2000. Of the 4.8 million votes cast in 2000, about 90,000 -- 1.9 percent -- registered no vote for president. This year, 96,000 of 5.7 million votes cast -- 1.7 percent -- did so. 
 Mr. Blackwell favors changing to a system that uses an optical scanner to read a paper ballot, which, he said, meets federal requirements, is less expensive than other machines and can handle more voters. But he said groups who say that just about every electronic voting system can be hacked are not helping things.
 ''There is still evidence out there that we need to transform the machinery,'' he said. ''But it will be harder to do now.''
 When the recount is completed next week, no one expects the questions about the election to die, with several groups poised to challenge the recount.
 ''I think the majority of Democrats feel that the election was more or less accurate,'' said Dan Trevas, the spokesman for the Ohio Democratic Party. ''But others are suspicious. Irregularities that are normally overlooked have become the focal point of attention this year. I just can't see those people walking away satisfied.''


CORRECTION-DATE: February 22, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 24 about voting problems in the presidential election in Ohio misattributed a request for a recount in that state. It was sought by candidates of the Green and Libertarian parties, not the Green and Independent parties. The error was pointed out on Dec. 27 in an e-mail message from a reader, which was misplaced at The Times.

HEADLINE: The Hookie Awards

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS; Nicholas D. Kristof is on vacation.. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Some people say that the age of the public intellectuals is over, that there are no longer many grand thinkers like Lionel Trilling or Reinhold Neibuhr, writing ambitious essays for the educated reader. It's true that there are fewer philosophes writing about the nature and destiny of man, but there are still hundreds of amazing essays written every year.
 In celebration of that fact, and in case you're looking for some mind-expanding holiday reading, I've decided to create the Hookie Awards. Named after the great public intellectual Sidney Hook, they go to the authors of some of the most important essays written in 2004. 
 I should mention that essays for The New York Times and other newspapers are not eligible for these prizes, and that if you go to the Web site version of this column, at www.nytimes.com, you will find links to the winning essays. 
 Here is the first batch of Hookie Laureates:
 ''When Islam Breaks Down,'' by Theodore Dalrymple. City Journal. A British prison doctor analyzes radical Islam. A typical passage: ''Their problem, and ours, is that they want the power that free inquiry confers, without either the free inquiry or the philosophy and institutions that guarantee that free inquiry. They are faced with a dilemma: either they can abandon their cherished religion, or they can remain forever in the rear of human technical advance. Neither alternative is very appealing; and the tension between their desire for power and success in the modern world on the one hand, and their desire not to abandon their religion on the other, is resolvable for some only by exploding themselves as bombs.''
 ''The Other Sixties,'' by Bruce Bawer. The Wilson Quarterly. When we think of the 60's, we think of Vietnam and Woodstock, but Bawer revives the early 60's, the era of Jack Paar, David Susskind and Sammy Davis Jr. -- people who were too hip for the 50's but not hip enough for the late 60's.
 Bawer writes: ''In 1950's America, middle-class values often seemed to be sacrosanct, while in 'The Sixties' they would be dismissed condescendingly by some Americans and defended fiercely by others. In the early 1960's, Americans still respected these values but responded open-mindedly, even enthusiastically, to irreverent humor at their own expense.''
 ''Faculty Clubs and Church Pews,'' by William J. Stuntz. Tech Central Station. This is an online essay by a Harvard Law professor who is also a member of an evangelical church. Harvard and the evangelicals are supposed to be on the opposite side of the red-blue divide, but Stuntz says the institutions have a lot in common. People in both places study texts, and spend their time thinking about how to help the poor.
 They also have much to learn from one another. Evangelicals can learn intellectual rigor. Academics can learn a little humility. 
 The Iraq imbroglio has produced some amazing and, for war supporters, painful essays. James Fallows published ''Blind Into Baghdad'' in The Atlantic Monthly, which showed that most of what happened in postwar Iraq was predicted prewar by government analysts. It's just that their reports were suppressed or ignored by the people making the decisions. Seymour Hersh's work on Abu Ghraib for The New Yorker is closer to reportage than essay writing, but it was the most discussed body of magazine writing this year. 
 The global decline in fertility rates has likewise prompted some astonishing essays. Phillip Longman published ''The Global Baby Bust'' in Foreign Affairs, noting that while we have images in our heads of throngs of unemployed young people in the Middle East, fertility rates are falling faster there than anywhere else on earth. Over the next half-century, Mexico's median age will rise by an astounding 20 years. By 2050, Mexico will be an older society than the United States. 
 Nicholas Eberstadt writes about what the graying population means for Asia in ''Power and Population in Asia'' in Policy Review. Eberstadt argues that it is better to get rich and then get old than it is to get old first. Thus, while Japan should be able to adjust to the new demographics, China will face huge problems. In China, the pension system is the family, but nearly a quarter of seniors will have no living son to rely on for sustenance. 
 On Tuesday, I'll announce the second batch of the uncoveted Hookies. In the meantime, download some of these. You'll be smarter for 2005.

HEADLINE: In One Kansas Town, the End of the Year Game Is Chess

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: LINDSBORG, Kan., Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Fifteen chess grandmasters, including present or former national champions from five European countries, are spending the last days of December in a windswept Kansas town that has suddenly become a world chess center.
 ''I never thought it would go this far or get this big,'' said Mikhail Korenman, a Russian emigre who has brought his passion for chess to a most unlikely place.
 Like countless other small towns across the Midwest, Lindsborg, which has a population of 3,500, is struggling to survive as rural life becomes more difficult and people move to cities or suburbs. Until a few years ago, it relied on its niche as Little Sweden, a place where tourists could buy Swedish crafts and eat pancakes with lingonberry sauce.
 Swedish flags are still visible around town, but now the banners along Main Street say, ''Welcome Anatoly Karpov School of Chess.'' 
 The school, which Mr. Korenman runs, opened last year, paid for with donations from local business people and a $216,000 economic development grant from the Kansas Department of Commerce and Housing. It has already staged several important competitions. This year, both the United States junior championship and the Final Four collegiate championship were held here.
 Mr. Korenman has brought Mr. Karpov, a former world champion from Russia who is considered one of the best players of the last century, to Lindsborg three times. Mr. Karpov has given the school his official sanction, something he has previously done only for schools in big cities like Damascus and Istanbul. 
 In September, Mr. Karpov played an exhibition match here against Susan Polgar, the first ever between former male and female world champions. For that event, which he billed as ''Clash of the Titans,'' Mr. Korenman staged a parade through the center of town, complete with floats and a marching band. Both players spent hours signing autographs and posing for pictures, he proudly recalled.
 ''If a kid here is interested in football, what he really wants is to see the Kansas City Chiefs or maybe Denver Broncos in real life,'' Mr. Korenman said. ''The chance to meet and talk to a world champion in chess is also something special. It has an effect on these kids, believe me.''
 Mr. Korenman's enthusiasm, imagination and web of contacts have been crucial to the burgeoning appeal of chess here, but this is also a town that was ready to accept what he had to offer. Lindsborg's Swedish heritage has given it a cosmopolitan identity. It stages several festivals every year, and people here are used to welcoming outsiders. 
 Mr. Korenman arrived in 1999 to teach chemistry at Bethany College here. His interest in chess has overtaken his interest in chemistry, and he recently quit the college faculty to devote his full time to it.
 This month Mr. Korenman is staging three tournaments in succession, with the last ending on Dec. 30. A grandmaster who is playing, Anna Zatonskih, 26, a former women's champion in her native Ukraine who is now one of the top-ranked American women players, said Lindsborg had ''a great reputation'' among chess players.
 ''It's amazing what has happened here,'' Ms. Zatonskih said. ''You can understand this kind of enthusiasm in New York, because there are 20 grandmasters living there. But even in New York, there isn't this kind of huge attention to us and what we do.''
 Some local people are amazed, too.
 ''Here's a guy who lands here with his wife and starts this chess thing,'' said Jim Richardson, a local photographer. ''We're all going, 'Right, sure.' Next thing you know, Anatoly Karpov is in town.''
 ''The Midwest still does have this inferiority complex,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''We really do think that things happen somewhere else. Now they're happening here. A world champion is coming down the street, and we're part of the bigger world.''
 This year the United States Chess Federation named Lindsborg as its ''chess city of the year,'' a title that in past years it has given to large cities like New York, Seattle and Miami. It also chose Mr. Korenman, who is 44, as its ''chess organizer of the year.''
 Mr. Korenman began staging tournaments soon after he arrived in Lindsborg, and at one of them he met a player who knew Mr. Karpov. That gave him the connection that turned this town into an elite chess center.
 The tournaments have an important economic impact. Kathy Malm, executive director of the Lindsborg Chamber of Commerce, estimated that about 1,000 people will attend the three this month.
 Becky Anderson, owner of the Swedish Country Inn, where several grandmasters are staying this month, said chess was good for business and also good for the town's young people.
 ''The best impact I see is the number of people from abroad, especially from the former Soviet Union, that chess has brought here,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''When you're as far from the coasts as we are, that's wonderful. I employ a lot of high school and college kids at the inn, and it's a great experience for them to meet people, often very young, who have distinguished themselves so much.''
 More than 100 local schoolchildren take regular chess lessons from Mr. Korenman, who is a serious player, though not a grandmaster. On one recent afternoon, he hovered above half a dozen of them as they clustered around a table. Several mothers sat nearby and watched. 
 ''How can black protect, and not let white take this little pawn?'' Mr. Korenman asked with a distinct Slavic accent, which seemed to add to his authority the way a Viennese accent suits a psychoanalyst.
 There was a long silence as the boys and girls concentrated. Suddenly, 9-year-old Christian Hansen broke it. ''I know!'' he cried out. ''I see it! Rook to G-6.''
 ''Excellent,'' Mr. Korenman replied with a satisfied smile.
 There was a brief interruption as a visitor brought Mr. Korenman up to date on plans to bring a Brazilian exchange student to the high school -- a chess champion, needless to say. Then it was back to the children.
 ''Now white has to come up with an idea,'' he told them. ''Let's try not to make a move without an idea. You want to create something. What can you create?''
 Mr. Korenman built on the work of Wes Fisk, a Lindsborg chess fan who started a club in 1997. Their work has already shown results in local schools.
 ''If you go to our trophy cabinet at the middle school, you'll see four trophies, two for basketball and two for chess,'' said Bill Nelson, a former assistant principal of the local high school. ''Has it caught on in every family? No, it hasn't. But there does seem to be an academic advantage for many of those who play. It helps kids learn how to think.''
 The success of chess here has also changed some views of how small towns can improve their economies.
 ''It's taught us something about growth,'' Mayor Ron Rolander said. ''We can't compete with towns that are offering tax breaks and utilities and everything else to attract some company to come here and bring us jobs. What we should try to do instead is look around, find people who are already here who have interesting ideas and support them.''
 Among the happiest tournament participants was Azeez Sanusi, a 19-year-old Nigerian who came from Louisiana, where he attends college, to compete. He said he had played chess ''since I was me.''
 ''In the last couple of days, I got to play two grandmasters,'' Mr. Sanusi said with an air of wonder. ''I lost, of course, but how often do you get to do that? Only in Lindsborg.''

HEADLINE: China's Elite Learn to Flaunt It While the New Landless Weep

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Chateau Zhang Laffitte is no ordinary imitation. It is the oriental twin of Chateau Maisons-Laffitte, the French architect Francois Mansart's 1650 landmark on the Seine. Its symmetrical facade and soaring slate roof were crafted using the historic blueprints, 10,000 photographs and the same white Chantilly stone.
 Yet its Chinese proprietor, a Beijing real estate developer named Zhang Yuchen, wanted more. He added a manicured sculpture garden and two wings, copying the palace at Fontainebleau. He even dug a deep, broad moat, though uniformed guards and a spiked fence also defend the castle.
 ''It cost me $50 million,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''But that's because we made so many improvements compared with the original.'' 
 Rising out of the parched winter landscape of suburban Beijing, like a Gallic apparition, the chateau is a quirky extravagance intended to catch the eye of China's new rich. They can rent its rooms and, later, buy homes amid the ponds, equestrian trails and golf course on Mr. Zhang's 1.5-square-mile estate.
 It is even more conspicuous to its nearest neighbors, 800 now landless peasants who used to grow wheat on its expansive lawns.
 In a generation, China's ascetic, egalitarian society has acquired the trappings and the tensions of America in the age of the robber barons. A rough-and-tumble form of capitalism is eclipsing the remnants of socialism. Those who have made the transition live side by side with those who have not, separated by serrated fences and the Communist Party.
 The party's Central Committee conducted a survey of party officials in November in which the widening income gap ranked as the biggest concern, mainly because it stirs social unrest. Farm incomes were raised this year after emergency rural tax cuts. The government has tried to slow land confiscations.
 But officials have chosen not to give peasants control over the land they farm, effectively denying them a share in the new market economy.
 Meanwhile, the fleet footed and well connected have profited from surging exports, a bubbly urban real estate market and, occasionally, government boosterism. A wide income gap, like that in Britain and the United States at the end of the 19th century, is viewed by some officials as inevitable, even a rite of passage.
 China now has tens of thousands of multimillionaires, some of whom do not follow Confucian or Communist codes of austerity. In fact, pressure to stand out may be overtaking an earlier impulse to lie low.
 Mr. Zhang, 57, is a Communist Party member and former senior official at Beijing's municipal construction bureau. He made a fortune building private homes before he secured rights to a sprawling parcel of wheat fields. As the first step in his next project, he cloned the palace and named it after himself.
 He is wary of the political symbolism. His mirthful confidence gives way to bureaucratic hedging when he is asked to discuss the wealth gap. But he defends his indulgence as an excellent investment.
 ''Beijing is so crowded with luxury real estate projects that you need to do something special now,'' he said one afternoon while leading visitors through the marble atrium of the chateau. ''Buyers want the right environment so they feel they are fully realizing their identity.''
 The bold display does attract attention, some of it unwelcome to Mr. Zhang. The residents of Yangge Village, who farmed the land as a collective until Mr. Zhang persuaded local leaders to let him develop the property, have led a tireless campaign for higher compensation.
 As part of a complex arrangement to use the land, Mr. Zhang's company gives the village's elderly a $45 monthly stipend. The able-bodied young can apply for jobs maintaining the grounds and waterways of the estate, or crushing grapes from its vineyard. They get $2 a day.
 For them, Mr. Zhang's French revival smacks of a retreat to feudalism.
 ''It was once our land, and now we have to apply to work there,'' says Li Chang, a local peasant activist. ''To look at the place brings tears to my eyes.''

Sudden Wealth
 The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that at least 10,000 businessmen in China have net assets that exceed $10 million. Some of them are peasants or migrant workers who saved every penny, devoted endless hours to their jobs and got rich despite overwhelming odds.
 Many others are like Mr. Zhang. He grew up in a peasant household in Shandong Province, in northeast China. But his prospects brightened at an early age, courtesy of the Communist Party.
 His older brother, then a young worker in a state factory, was transferred to Beijing, bringing along his whole family. Mr. Zhang attended school in the capital.
 He got a second break in the late 1960's, during the Cultural Revolution. Others were sent down to farms to work in the fields as part of Mao's effort to inculcate revolutionary enthusiasm among the urban elite. Mr. Zhang joined a construction brigade, quickly becoming a manager. After attending college, he rose to the top ranks of the construction bureau, which oversees major building projects in the capital.
 Mr. Zhang ''plunged into the sea'' of commerce in 1991. He found a wealthy southern partner who needed help breaking into Beijing's real estate market, then just shaking off the shackles of state control. Mr. Zhang was an insider who could navigate the opaque bureaucracy.
 Their first project, called Baxian Villas, was not without risk. They found a plot of farmland surrounded by villages near the northern tip of the city. The secondary roads leading there passed through street-side markets that filled up with produce vendors by day. The trip could take 90 minutes.
 Yet at the time Beijing had few other California-style single-family houses like the ones Mr. Zhang built. By the late 1990's, Baxian had sold 500 homes, many of them spacious weekend retreats priced in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. They had acquired the land for a tiny fraction of that amount. To use a popular Chinese term, Mr. Zhang was a baofa hu. He had hit the jackpot.
 In 1995, he commissioned a Chinese artist to paint him together with his wife, son and daughter. Mr. Zhang told the painter to copy a style he had seen on a tour of Europe. It resembles a court portrait by Velazquez. The Zhang family poses casually in the center of a neo-Classical reception hall, whose walls are hung with other paintings -- each one depicting a villa designed by Mr. Zhang. It covers an entire wall in the ballroom of his Baxian home. 
 His fortunes improved further as the city expanded to meet him. His retreat became a bedroom community with its own highway exit.
 So Mr. Zhang set his sights on a much larger slice of land -- nearly 1,000 acres -- used as a mechanized wheat farm by Yangge Village and its 800 farmers. A river ran through part of the property, which abuts a forest preservation district. By Beijing standards, the setting was bucolic.
 Beijing's city government has tried to slow the loss of rural land. But Changping District struck an unusual deal with Mr. Zhang. The area he coveted would be converted from farmland to a conservation zone. He could then lease the land for an annual rent of $300 per acre, provided it mostly remained green space, according to villagers briefed on the arrangement by local officials.
 He was later granted an easement for the palace and a second one for a community of 1,000 luxury homes covering 170 acres. For that change in the contract he paid a lump sum of $9.7 million, or about $57,000 per acre, according to villagers. He declined to discuss the figures.
 Mr. Zhang is not one of China's richest men. Lists of the wealthy elite compiled by Forbes and Asiamoney do not mention him. Beijing alone has dozens of real estate companies that control more land.
 But the property gave Mr. Zhang a vast canvas to achieve something outstanding, he said.
 ''I wanted to show how Beijing was rushing out to meet the world,'' he said. ''We have the Forbidden City. We have courtyard homes. I wanted something universal.''

French Connection
 As he pondered his new project, Mr. Zhang developed wanderlust. He visited Australia, where his son was studying. There he researched the wine-making industry and decided to go to France.
 At a conference in Beijing, he met Francoise Onillon, a Paris-based architectural expert, and hired her as an adviser. In the summer of 2000, she planned a two-week trip through Bordeaux, Burgundy and Beaujolais to see historic chateaux. But the day Mr. Zhang arrived he wanted to begin immediately. So she took him first to Chateau Maisons-Laffitte, just 12 miles outside Paris. 
 Rene de Longueil, a wealthy nobleman, built the castle as a royal hunting lodge in the mid-17th century. He hired Mansart, later the architect of Versailles, who designed the central building with pyramidal symmetry that became a benchmark of French classical architecture.
 ''He spent five minutes staring at it in silence,'' Ms. Onillon recalled of Mr. Zhang's visit. ''Then he said, 'I've seen enough. This is it.'''
 Mr. Zhang used the chateau's blueprints and took some 10,000 photos. For the facade, they even found blond Chantilly stone of the type used in the original.
 Ultimately, Mr. Zhang decided he wanted something grander. So he returned several times to France. He designed a garden to resemble the one in Versailles, with its statues of Greek mythological figures. Two wings he built to house hotel guests were copies of the royal apartments at Fontainebleau. After a visit to Rome, he added a semicircular colonnade to enclose the courtyard.
 Mr. Zhang says he reveled in the details. He furnished his security guards with French-style uniforms complete with capes and kepis. He chose Bacchus as the chateau's artistic theme, making bacchanal the subject of the giant fountain in the garden, frescoes on the facade and the painting covering the dome inside the atrium. 
 Commercially, it appears to be a hit. Since its formal opening in October, a major fashion show was staged in its gilded ballroom. The Special Olympics held a black-tie fund-raiser there. Even China Central Television, the state's leading propaganda arm, recorded a New Year's Eve special inside the chateau.
 When important people visit, Mr. Zhang is driven to the chateau from his office at nearby Baxian Villas in a 12-cylinder Mercedes limousine. He wears his hair in a slick pompadour and smiles in a detached way, affecting the formal cordiality of official protocol.
 The big test comes next summer, when Mr. Zhang begins advance sales on his 1,000 upscale homes. The suburbs of northern Beijing are now crowded with high-end developments, some offering American-style single-family houses for $1 million or more. Mr. Zhang says he is confident that his will fetch the highest prices. ''No one can match our environment,'' he said.

Across the Moat
 Aside from Mr. Zhang himself, perhaps no one knows the surroundings as well as Li Chang. A lifelong resident of Yangge Village, he farmed the land under Chateau Zhang Laffitte for most of his 77 years.
 When Mr. Zhang took over the property, an iron fence was erected around the perimeter, barring access to all but authorized workers and guests. Mr. Li is too old be to hired as a worker, but not to pose as one. He sneaks onto the property to chart its dimensions.
 He has filled every page in a soft-cloth notebook with tiny black characters and sketches. The chateau sits on 156,895 square feet, triple the size permitted in Mr. Zhang's contract, Mr. Li says. No moat was ever authorized, he claims, but Mr. Zhang's waterway stretches for just over a mile. To level the land and dig the moat, Mr. Zhang removed nearly 24 million cubic feet of dirt, Mr. Li calculated. He called this a enormous loss of fertile soil.
 Mr. Li and other villagers argue that Mr. Zhang has reduced the property's usefulness as farmland, violating the agreement that specified it was to be maintained for agriculture and conservation.
 ''This is a big violation of state land policy,'' Mr. Li says, growing animated despite the frigid temperatures in his unheated village home. ''And it is happening right here in Beijing.''
 Mr. Zhang disputes Mr. Li's claims and says he has abided by his contract. Mr. Li has no evidence beyond his amateur surveys. 
 Mr. Li and other villagers appealed to officials in the village, the town, the district, the city and even the national land bureau, so far without eliciting a reply, much less an investigation. They are focused on technical violations they see as likely to draw official scrutiny. But their concerns are broader.
 ''They took away our land,'' says Li Youqing, a 68-year-old housewife in Yangge, who is not related to Mr. Li. ''That was our only guarantee in life.''
 Farmland cannot be bought or sold in China, only leased. To be converted to commercial use, it must be reclaimed by the government and rezoned. Officials then oversee the development or sale of the property. Though the terms of such transactions vary, peasants rarely have any say -- or share any profits -- when their land is developed.
 Yangge residents said the only compensation they have received is the $45 monthly stipend Mr. Zhang agreed to pay the elderly, as well as his promise to employ local workers to maintain and farm the estate. 
 The money helps. But residents say they are poorer than before. They used to have their own grain, vegetables and farm animals. Now they have to buy all their food in market stalls that line the street outside the village.
 ''We have to pay city prices for our food but still live on farm incomes,'' Ms. Li said.
 The bigger frustration is the spectacle of riches across the moat. The $9.7 million villagers say Mr. Zhang paid to build private villas understated the land's market value, they argue. They say there should have been no special deal for him.
 They also claim that the money he paid vanished. Local leaders promised that the money would be used to start companies, shares in which would be distributed to all who had farmed the land. But the villagers say that no such companies exist and that no shares were issued.
 Village, township and district land officials declined repeated requests to discuss the chateau.
 ''Maybe the Central Committee knows what happened to the money,'' Mr. Li said, making a joke referring to a top decision-making body of the Communist Party. ''No one tells us anything.''

An Official Embrace
 Even when he discusses his chateau, Mr. Zhang's manner is reserved. When asked to discuss China's wealth gap -- and the complaints of his neighbors -- he turns icy. During an interview in a yellow-and-gold reception room on the top floor of the chateau, he declared that such issues were too sensitive to discuss and that any article mentioning him should include no references to social tensions.
 He then offered that he, unlike his neighbors, puts full faith in the government.
 ''My basic thinking is that, as a private company, I must absolutely embrace the government policies of the day,'' he said. ''Today's leaders have exactly the right kind of thinking about how to handle these issues.''
 He said local peasants who complained were not representative. He said he would create 600 farming jobs on the estate, which would eventually have an organic vegetable garden and an orchard as well as the vineyard.
 ''This will be a boon for the farmers, who will make more money than if they tilled the land themselves,'' he said. ''The whole project is exactly in line with Beijing's policy -- to maintain the land as green space.''
 To date, the government appears to have offered strong backing. Beyond converting a large swath of farmland into a semiprotected conservation zone with easements for property development, Changping District made the chateau part of its annual plan. That minimized cumbersome red tape.
 His ties reach higher still. After the chateau opened, Mr. Zhang was host to Jia Qingling, a member of the standing committee of the ruling Politburo and the fourth most powerful man in China by rank. Two poster-sized color photos of Mr. Jia touring the castle hang in the wine bar.
 Some people, Mr. Zhang said, might misunderstand his project. It is not designed as a playground for the rich, but as a museum for the masses.
 ''It is for all the Beijing people, including the common people who do not have the opportunity to visit Europe themselves,'' he said. ''I wanted everyone to get a taste of the finest world culture.''

The Great Divide
 Articles in this series are examining the widening gap between the rural poor and urban rich that has made China, the world's fastest-growing economy, also one of its most unequal societies. The first six articles and an audio report by Joseph Kahn are online at nytimes.com/world.

HEADLINE: Convinced the Eel Is in Trouble, 2 Brothers Try to Save It

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HADLEY, Mass., Dec. 24 

 BODY:
It is one of the creepier of creatures: a squirming, snakelike fish, good mostly for sushi or bait.
 Nevertheless, Tim Watts is taking a stand to protect the American eel, which he says is in dangerous decline.
 ''The eel is one of those species that seems to fall through the cracks because it isn't so pretty,'' Mr. Watts said. ''They don't have a voice. They don't have anyone to speak for them.'' 
 For now, the eels have him.
 Along with his brother Doug, Mr. Watts, who works as a janitor, has filed a petition with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to get the American eel, the Western Hemisphere's only freshwater eel, protected as an endangered species.
 The brothers grew up fishing Massachusetts rivers and streams, and for decades Tim Watts took eels for granted. They were always easily available to catch and use as bait for striped bass.
 But a few years ago, he took his children fishing and saw a gaggle of eels stuck at the bottom of a dam.
 ''For every one that gets over a dam, thousands aren't making it,'' Mr. Watts said. ''And if they don't make it, they're not getting back to the Sargasso.''
 Eels spawn in just one place: the Sargasso Sea, an expanse of warm, algae-filled water in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. After hatching in those still waters east of Bermuda, they are carried by currents that deposit them at the mouths of rivers from South America to Greenland. They then swim upstream into fresh water, making their way as far inland as Wisconsin.
 When they mature, the eels swim back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn and die. The entire journey can take 7 to 30 years.
 Having become alarmed over the condition of the American eel, the Watts brothers searched the Internet for everything they could find about it. 
 What they have come up with is not far off the mark, experts say. According to a 2000 report by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, the amount of eel caught for bait dropped 76 percent, to about 50,000 pounds, from 1985 to 1995.
 Most of the commercially caught American eels are sold to Asia, where they are predominantly used as sushi.
 ''It's definitely not a warm, fuzzy species that people might instantly get excited about,'' said Heather Bell, a Fish and Wildlife fisheries biologist in this western Massachusetts community. ''But there is a big economic interest in eels, because the Asian markets don't have enough Asian eel to support their demand.''
 Though Mr. Watts and Ms. Bell suspect that dams are interfering with the American eel's travel, they also say that the reason for the decline in its numbers has not been fully determined.
 By Feb. 18, the Fish and Wildlife Service will have reviewed the Watts brothers' petition to determine if there is enough evidence to warrant an investigation. If so, a nine-month study will be conducted so the agency can decide whether the American eel deserves protection.

HEADLINE: Program Coaxes Hospitals to See Treatments Under Their Noses

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
The federal government is now telling patients whether their local hospitals are doing what they should. 
 For now, the effort involves three common and deadly afflictions of the elderly -- heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia -- and asks about lifesaving treatments that everyone agrees should be given but that hospitals and doctors often forget to give. 
 The expectation, though, is that this is just the beginning; other diseases, other treatments and surgery are next. Within a few years, individual doctors will be rated as well. 
 Using incentives like bonus pay and deterrents like public humiliation, it is a bold new effort by the federal government, along with organizations of hospitals, doctors, nurses, and health researchers, to push providers to use proven remedies for common ailments. 
 And it is a response to a sobering reality: lifesaving treatments often are forgotten while doctors and hospitals lavish patients with an abundance of care, which can involve expensive procedures of questionable value. The results are high costs, unnecessary medicine and wasted opportunities to save lives and improve health.
 Simple things can fall through the cracks. 
 ''In some ways, it's kind of scary,'' said Dr. Peter Gross, the chief of the department of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. ''The doctor today is much too busy and has too much to remember.''
 The hospital ratings are being done by Medicare and posted on the Internet (www.cms.hhs.gov/quality/hospital/). 
 And already, hospitals are responding, often with shock, when they discover they have been forgetting some of the very treatments that can make a difference between life and death, or sickness and health.
 At Duke University's hospital, for example, when patients arrived short of breath, feverish and suffering from pneumonia, their doctors monitored their blood oxygen levels and put them on ventilators, if necessary, to help them breathe.
 But they forgot something: patients who were elderly or had a chronic illness like emphysema or heart disease should have been given a pneumonia vaccine to protect them against future bouts with bacterial pneumonia, a major killer. None were.
 All bacterial pneumonia patients should also get antibiotics within four hours of admission. But at Duke, fewer than half did.
 The doctors learned about their lapses when the hospital sent its data to Medicare. And they were aghast. They had neglected -- in most cases simply forgotten -- the very simple treatments that can make the biggest difference in how patients feel or how long they live.
 ''It's like the Elisabeth Kubler-Ross stages of grief,'' said Dr. Robert Califf, a professor of medicine at Duke. ''First you're in shock, then denial, and then you gradually come to terms with what needs to be done.''
 Now, Dr. Califf said, the hospital is scrambling to make sure such treatments are not neglected again.
 Department of Veterans Affairs doctors had also been forgetting treatments like the pneumonia vaccine, said Dr. Jonathan Perlin, the agency's acting under secretary for health. ''Everyone knows who should get the vaccine,'' Dr. Perlin said. ''They can recite chapter and verse.'' 
 But not long ago, only 30 percent of V.A. patients who should get the vaccine received it (the national average is 50 percent). The rude awakening came when the department showed individual teams of doctors and individual clinics and hospitals how often they were vaccinating and how their rates compared with those of other medical teams. ''It's pretty revealing to have the data,'' Dr. Perlin said. ''Absent the data, you think you are doing a pretty good job.''
 Now 90 percent of V.A. patients who should get the vaccine do.
 ''By increasing the rate of pneumonia vaccination just for patients with emphysema, the V.A. saved 6,000 lives,'' Dr. Perlin said.
 The same strategy worked with beta blockers -- drugs, costing pennies a day, that should be given to nearly all heart attack patients within 24 hours of arriving at the hospital and should be prescribed when they leave. Nationwide, less than half who need these drugs get them. Yet beta blockers, which slow the heart rate, can prevent hospitalizations, prolong lives and save more than $6,000 per patient in hospitalization over five years. 
 The Department of Veterans Affairs has gone from giving beta blockers to about 60 percent of its heart attack patients to giving them to 98 percent.
 Sometimes, disclosure of lapses in one area can elicit changes in a hospital's entire system, saving patients' lives across the board. 
 That happened when Duke researchers asked 315 hospitals for data on nine drugs that everyone agrees should be provided to heart attack patients. 
 For example, the hospitals were asked how often their heart attack patients got aspirin when they arrived (that alone can cut the death rate by 23 percent). When they were discharged, did they also get a statin to lower cholesterol levels? Nearly all should, with the exception of patients who have had a bad reaction to a statin and those rare patients with very low cholesterol levels. Did they get a beta blocker? 
 Once hospitals learned their score, it was up to them what to do. Over the next year, ones that improved in these measures saw their patient mortality from all causes fall by 40 percent. Those whose compliance scores did not change had no change in their mortality rate, and those whose performance fell had increases in their mortality rates.
 ''Those are the most remarkable data I have ever seen,'' said Dr. Eric Peterson, the Duke researcher who directed the study and has reported on it at medical meetings. 
 The new efforts to improve care came about because the time was right, health care researchers say. ''It's really an accumulation of scientific knowledge about what quality means,'' Dr. Califf said. And there was a growing realization that quality care was not always being provided.
 But when it comes to improving care, there is always the contentious issue of deciding what is good medicine. 
 ''Most of what we do has a modest effect, and that means, by the very nature of the effects, that you can't tell whether what you are doing is effective unless you do a study,'' Dr. Califf said.
 But that takes time, money, and often thousands or tens of thousands of patients. In most cases, such studies have not been done.
 Dr. Califf and others cited bed sores as an example. The nation spends billions of dollars a year on special bandages and beds and treatments. ''None of these is proven,'' Dr. Califf said. ''But if you are making a ton of money being reimbursed by Medicare, the last thing you want to do is put your treatment to a test.''
 So, at Medicare, administrators decided to focus on just a few treatments at first, for a few common diseases -- pneumonia, heart attacks and heart failure -- where there was little controversy about whether those treatments worked and an abundance of data showing that doctors and hospitals often did not provide them.
 ''We made an initial decision, which was very political,'' said Dr. Stephen Jencks, Medicare's director of quality coordination. ''We were going after things where there was complete agreement that a service was not being provided.'' 
 They are only a start. ''Almost everyone would agree they are a very narrow slice of the health care pie.''
 So the agency asked the nation's hospitals to report how well they did in providing these treatments if they wanted this year's cost-of-living increase in Medicare payments. Ninety-eight percent complied. 
 Medicare expects that now that the hospitals' performances are public, many will try to improve. ''People will begin to feel a little awkward if everyone else is doing better and they're not,'' Dr. Jencks said.
 The next step, Dr. Jencks said, is ''aligning payment with what you want people to do.''
 To that end, Medicare has a pilot program to pay hospitals for improving on a number of quality measures, including mortality rates and readmission rates for hip or knee surgery. Hospitals in the top 10 percent for a given condition, for example, will be paid an extra 2 percent. The agency will pay less if performance deteriorates. The project involves 278 hospitals affiliated with Premier, a nationwide organization of nonprofit hospitals.
 The new initiatives have one thing in common -- they abandoned the traditional assumption that if doctors know what works, they will provide it. 
 Doctors do know what works, said Dr. Steven M. Asch, a health care researcher at the V.A. Greater Los Angeles Health Care System and the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica. But, he found, Americans got just half the tests and treatments they should be getting.
 ''Basically, it was a flip of coin, whether you got good medical care or you didn't,'' Dr. Asch said. ''It didn't matter where you lived. The shortfalls were constant.'' 
 ''That challenged us to ask why these medical care problems were so pervasive,'' he said.
 At least part of the answer, he and others say, is that doctors are unaware of their shortfalls and are rewarded no matter how well they do.
 ''Medical care is one of those very strange parts of the economy where you get paid no matter what the quality of the service you provide,'' Dr. Asch said. ''It is like you went to a car dealership and your Mercedes is going to cost you the same as your Yugo.''
 Administrators at Medicare are well aware of the problem, Dr. Jencks said.
 ''We've reached a conclusion,'' he said. ''We have to change the system.''
 Dr. Jencks said he expected that in the future hospitals and doctors would be paid according to whether they gave patients treatments that worked. ''It is very clear that we are moving toward pay-for-performance,'' he said.
 Change, though, will require fundamental alterations in how hospitals and doctors' offices operate, health care researchers say. And it is not so easy to change a medical system, as Hackensack University Medical Center discovered. 
 ''We tried to come up with a standardized order set,'' with all the measures that Medicare was asking about, Dr. Gross said. ''But the doctors didn't want to use the sheet,'' insisting they would just remember those items. Then they forgot.
 The solution, Dr. Gross said, was to assign specially trained nurses to see what care was provided and remind doctors when important steps were omitted. The result was immediate improvement, Dr. Gross said, even in items not on Medicare's list.
 For example, doctors at Hackensack were keeping pneumonia patients in the hospital, receiving intravenous antibiotics, for one to two weeks when many could go home within days with antibiotic pills, avoiding the discomfort from the intravenous lines and the ensuing risk of infection. By putting a nurse on the case, patients were sent home sooner. The hospital saved $500,000 a year by refilling its beds with other patients. Medicare, which pays most of the bill for pneumonia patients, reimburses for a diagnosis -- pneumonia -- and not for the number of days a patient spends in the hospital, so keeping patients in the hospital longer costs money.
 Of course, the economics of medical care are rarely simple and the new programs have so far steered clear of the most difficult category: medical care that is useless or unnecessary, a category that costs the nation hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
 ''That will be a bitter pill to swallow, and I'm not sure people will swallow it,'' Dr. Califf said. ''There's a lot of money being made on things that don't work well.''
 Dr. Jencks agreed.
 ''I would say we are moving much more slowly on trying to prevent overuse than in trying to fix underuse,'' he said. ''If I tell a physician he shouldn't do a surgery he wants to do, I personally would anticipate a lot more resistance than if I told him he should give a medicine he wasn't thinking of giving.''

HEADLINE: Birds and Dancing Ladies Skew the '12 Days' Index

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Maids-a-milking, gold rings and turtledoves were a relative bargain this year, but anyone who shopped for French hens, geese and ladies dancing may have been in for a touch of sticker shock.
 So said PNC Advisors, the wealth management firm that each year tallies the putative cost of assembling all the items from the song ''12 Days of Christmas.'' This year, all those goods and services would have set a buyer back $66,334, about the cost of a fully loaded sport utility vehicle. 
 That is a record price for the 364 tokens of affection ranging from a partridge in a pear tree to a dozen drummers drumming. Still, the cost is up only slightly, 1.6 percent, over last year's total, and compared with the 1984 total, is 5.9 percent higher.
 PNC Advisors, a unit of the PNC Financial Services Group, the Pittsburgh-based banking company, started tabulating the gift package two decades ago to see whether the costs of the presents in the English carol tracked the United States government's Consumer Price Index. The general conclusion the firm has drawn is that they usually do.
 This year PNC Advisors found that the prices went up in the low single digits on a percentage basis for goods and remained steady for services. 
 The flat prices for services, according to the group's chief investment strategist, Jeff Kleintop, reflect an hourly compensation anchored by a static minimum wage and the outsourcing of unskilled labor. 
 Hence, the eight maids-a-milking, who earned $26.80 for the chore 20 years ago, put a buyer out only $41.20 today, at $5.15 an hour.
 Skilled labor, like the nine ladies dancing, would make the biggest dent in a budget, at $4,400, up 4 percent from last year. The 10 lords-a-leaping went up 3 percent, to $4,039.08, and the 12 drummers drumming rose 3.6 percent, to $2,224.30.
 Among the assorted fowl named in the song, there were various breed-based price differentials. Swans, doves, partridges and calling birds (today's canaries) cost about the same as last year, according to information from the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens. 
 But the price of French hens, which are a slightly more exotic version of American hens, went up 200 percent, Mr. Kleintop said, largely because American breeders of French hens introduced a more expensive variety.
 PNC Advisors' news release elaborated: ''The price for French hens and geese saw significant increases, which may be due to fewer hatchlings during this breeding cycle creating an imbalance in the supply-demand chain. Turtledoves, on the other hand, may have had a more fruitful breeding cycle, creating an oversupply of birds and a 31 percent decline in price.''
 The release continued, ''All told, the cost of the birds in the Christmas classic totaled $4,201, just 1.5 percent more than the $4,138 it would have cost a year ago.''
 Mr. Kleintop said the trumpeter swans could now and then really jolt the index, because breeding cycles vary and affect the price. In 1984, for instance, the seven swans-a-swimming called for in the song cost $1,000 each, but in subsequent years the price of the long-necked birds slumped. Since 2001, the price has risen, to $500 each. Every year, PNC offsets the swans' variable cost by calculating a core index that excludes such cost anomalies.
 Taking that into consideration, the PNC index rose 3.1 percent, roughly in line with the 3.7 percent increase in the first 11 months registered by the Consumer Price Index, which measures a much broader range of goods and services.

HEADLINE: Snowboard Is Indeed Reshaping the Ski Industry

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; International Herald Tribune

 BODY:
Like many people in the Alps, Stephane Radiguet grew up on skis. And like many skiers, he switched to snowboarding in the 1980's, attracted by its laid-back image and the feeling of floating effortlessly through powder snow, at a time when skis were long, straight and ramrod stiff -- and many skiers were, too.
 Mr. Radiguet, whose nickname is Zag, became a competitive snowboarder and eventually went to work for Nidecker, a Swiss snowboard brand, as a designer. But as his 40th birthday approached a few years ago, Mr. Radiguet, who is now 43, sensed that the snowboard phenomenon might be losing steam.
 So he decided to design a new type of ski that borrows the voluptuous dimensions of a snowboard, allowing skiers to share that buoyant sensation. 
 ''When I tested these skis, it was like, 'I want to go skiing again,''' Mr. Radiguet said. So he started his own company and Zag Skis was born.
 Zag Skis operates with three full-time employees from a 270-square-foot office in Bourg Saint Maurice, France, a railhead and pit stop on the way to ski areas like Val d'Isere, Tignes and Les Arcs. Despite its tiny size, it is one of a handful of start-up ski brands springing up in France, Switzerland, Scandinavia and the United States that are giving a troubled industry a shot of adrenaline.
 While their sales remain small -- Zag Skis, for example, expects to sell about 2,000 pairs of skis this year -- they are contributing to a resurgence in skiing, after nearly two decades in which snowboarding, well, ruled.
 The global market for skis has held steady at 4.2 million pairs for several years, according to industry estimates, despite tough economic conditions in major markets like Japan and Germany. Snowboard sales, which shot out of nowhere in the early 1980's and reached about 1.5 million by the late 1990's, fell back to 1.28 million during the 2003-4 season.
 For now, the newcomers -- with names like Boheme, Bumtribe, Armada, 4front, Line, Aluflex and Movement -- pose little threat to the titans of the ski industry, led by the German-French sporting goods maker Adidas-Salomon, Skis Rossignol of France and the Amer Group of Finland, which owns the Austrian brand Atomic.
 But even the big players acknowledge that the start-ups are influencing design and attitudes.
 ''These brands are bringing a bit of motivation'' that is stimulating the market, said Patrick Werle, managing director for Europe at Skis Rossignol in Voiron, France.
 But Rossignol is not worried about a looming competitive threat, Mr. Werle said, adding: ''In any market, there are examples of brands that identify a niche. After a few years, they usually get taken over or go out of business.''
 Still, entrenched manufacturers have found it impossible to ignore the niche brands. Rossignol and its competitors have been rushing to develop and market their own skis aimed at proponents of snowboard-influenced trends like ''new school'' and ''freeride,'' which are championed by the start-ups.
 New school, or free style, which involves wearing baggy clothing and performing skateboard-style aerial tricks in obstacle-ridden snow parks, is all the rage in the United States and among young skiers; freeride involves leaving the prepared runs at a ski area in search of fresh powder, and is popular in the Alps.
 In the United States, snowboarding is still going strong, with sales rising to 475,000 last season from 458,000. But there are signs that the trend in the United States may also be close to a peak, experts say.
 ''The key thing is demographics,'' said David Ingemie, president of Snowsports Industries America, a trade organization. ''Most of the new people coming in are getting on snowboards, at least initially. But we're seeing a lot of people who started out with snowboarding who are getting back into skiing.''
 That is sweet music to the ears of ski manufacturers, who have had precious little good news for most of the past two decades. As a post-World War II ski boom crested in the early 1980's, the industry sold as many as eight million pairs of skis a year. But then snowboarding arrived, along with a succession of dry winters in the Alps in the late 1980's, which cut into sales.
 The drawn-out economic downturn in Japan, which persisted through the 1990's, curbed growth in what had been one of the fastest-growing markets.
 Rapid inflation in ski ticket and equipment prices in the United States had a similar effect. And many people who used to buy skis now rent them, with the caliber of equipment in rental shops having improved.
 While volume has shrunk, winter sports remain a sizable business, with $2.2 billion worth of ski and snowboard equipment, apparel and accessories sold annually in the United States alone, which accounts for about one-fifth of the global market.
 The ski industry responded to leaner times with waves of consolidation, starting in the 1980's, as dozens of small, often family-owned companies concentrated in the Alpine countries either went out of business or came under the control of bigger corporations. Skis Rossignol, for instance, acquired Dynastar and the Trappeur and Caber boot brands, along with Look, a maker of bindings.
 Atomic bought Ess bindings and Koflach boots before it, too, ran into financial difficulties and was acquired by Amer, the Finnish sports equipment maker. Last year, Amer in turn added Volant, a niche United States ski brand.
 Benetton of Italy acquired Kastle, an Austrian ski maker, and renamed it Nordica, like its boot brand.
 In the mid-1990's, ski makers in Austria, which still has the largest number of independent brands, developed the first effective product innovation in years: the parabolic ski, so named because of its hourglass shape. The wide tips and tails and narrow middle help skiers ''carve'' turns, rather than skidding from edge to edge, as they often did with the traditional, straighter models, which were fine for World Cup racers but more difficult for the average weekend skier to use.
 ''The carving is very attractive now,'' said Ewald Kainz, head of research at Fessel-GfK, a research firm in Vienna. In Austria, where more than 500,000 skis are sold every year, sales are expected to rise by 3 percent to 4 percent this season, he added.
 While ski manufacturing remains concentrated in the Alpine countries, some companies are experimenting with lower-cost options elsewhere. K2, the only major United States brand, for instance, has moved production of its skis to China. When K2 recently acquired Volkl, the leading German brand, it started speculation about another possible move, but the company says Volkl will stay in Germany.
 This week, Adidas-Salomon said it would cut almost 10 percent of the work force at its French snow sports division as it shifts production to China and Romania.
 Some of the start-up ventures also use outside contractors to make skis, leaving them to concentrate on design and marketing. Zag Skis, for instance, are made in Voiron, near Grenoble, in a factory next door to Rossignol.
 Movement, based in Vevey, Switzerland, works with a contractor in Italy. It has been one of the more successful start-up brands, expecting to sell more than 5,000 pairs of skis this season, 4,000 outside Switzerland. Like Zag, Movement grew out of a Swiss snowboard brand, Wild Duck, which was started in 1981.
 By 1998, the snowboard market was losing promise, said Roch Schenk, who handles marketing at Movement, so the founding partners decided to branch out into skis. A year later, the first skis appeared, and now there are 17 models, sold across Europe, Australia and parts of Asia. Eventually, Mr. Schenk said, Movement hopes to enter the market in the United States.
 Like other employees of ski start-ups, Mr. Schenk spends a lot of time on the road -- driving 4,000 kilometers, or nearly 2,500 miles, in two weeks is not uncommon, he said.
 Because these start-ups lack sizable advertising budgets, marketing is essentially done through sponsorship of ''riders'' -- that is, daredevil skiers who use the skis at freeride competitions and other road shows.
 That is how Mr. Schenk started with the company himself.
 Can turning out a few thousand pairs of skis be a profitable business?
 For now, Mr. Schenk said, the company is breaking even, plowing its earnings back into product development.
 ''I would be lying if I said we didn't want to make money,'' he said. ''But everyone at the company loves skiing or snowboarding, and that's the bottom line.''

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing The Americas: Peru: Free Trade Pact Expected

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Peru will probably complete a free trade agreement with the United States by July, the minister of foreign trade and tourism, Alfredo Ferrero, said. The country is counting on the agreement to drive economic growth into a fourth year by increasing exports above this year's $12 billion and creating over 135,000 new jobs, Mr. Ferrero said. Negotiations, which began in May, are scheduled to end in March 2005 after two more rounds of talks. The timetable was set back three months after talks did not result in an agreement to end American subsidies for agricultural produce.

HEADLINE: Rockers: Take Two

BYLINE: By HUGH HART

 BODY:
Aging gracefully in public is a tricky proposition for most performers, but two 40-something rockers plan to shift gears, midcareer, by ringing in the new year with their own TV shows. On a recent afternoon in Los Angeles, the singer Vince Neil, 43, rehearsed with Motley Crue in preparation for the band's forthcoming reunion tour. He's been surgically ''refreshed'' courtesy of ''Remaking,'' a new reality-based series from VH1 that has its premiere on Saturday at 9 p.m.
 A few blocks away, the former punk-band front man Henry Rollins, 43, sat in his Hollywood Boulevard headquarters surrounded by half-empty cups of coffee and a 10,000-CD collection to talk about his new role as resident movie critic on ''Henry's Film Corner,'' shown the first Saturday of each month on the Independent Film Channel. 
 ''I've done a lot of rock 'n' roll,'' said Mr. Rollins, who joined the hard-core punk group Black Flag in 1981 and later led Rollins Band. ''But I've also written 14 books. I do 90 to 100 speaking dates all over the world every year. I have a radio show. I've acted in 20 films. I'm not really an actor, but I've learned how to hold my own. So if I can talk about films I'm enthusiastic about and directors that I'm really geeked on, then why not do it? This is not about Rock 'n' Roll Boy reinventing himself. This is: 'Fan Boy gets a show.'''
 In this Saturday's ''Corner'' -- the second of the series -- Mr. Rollins and Daryl Hannah will discuss Kevin Bacon's gritty new film, ''The Woodsman.'' Ordinary people get to weigh in, too. A high school economics teacher will offer his take on the new ''William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice'' movie and a group of boxers, all women, will critique the 2000 movie ''Girlfight.'' In the Dec. 4 premiere episode, firefighters reviewed ''Ladder 49.'' 
 Besides serving as genial host, the fiercely opinionated Mr. Rollins displays his prowess as a free-associating wordsmith in a couple of unscripted rants called ''Teeing Off'' and ''Rollins' Revenge.'' ''I'm just winging it,'' he said. ''We do four takes and whichever one gets the biggest laugh and the loudest claps from the crew behind the camera, that's the one we use.''
 Mr. Rollins downplayed his qualifications as an official, bona fide reviewer. ''I don't want to be a film critic,'' he said. ''I'm not a Siskel-Roeper kind of guy.'' He credited his informal film education to a succession of cinema-loving roommates and musicians. ''My roommate Maya had me watch 'Yawl,' this film from Turkey: mind blown. The guitar player in my band hipped me to Kurosawa. 'Here's ''Seven Samurai'' -- Shut up and watch.' I became a huge fan of Kurosawa, Fassbinder, Wim Wenders, Coppola. We ended up digesting tons of movies, which makes me no expert, but it sure makes me love a good film.''
 Mr. Rollins isn't the only rocker who has used music as a springboard to other creative ventures. Michael Stipe produces films when he's not singing with R.E.M.; the former teen idol Shaun Cassidy produces television dramas. Kinky Friedman, ex-country singer, writes crime novels. The pop rocker Greg Kihn deejays for a San Jose radio station. Charlotte Caffey, former guitarist for the Go Go's, is working on a stage musical about the porn star Linda Lovelace. The 70's folk diva Joni Mitchell paints. Puffy Combs designs clothes. Rupert Holmes survived ''The Pina Colada Song'' to write novels and plays, including the music, book and lyrics to ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood.''
 In recent months, TV has become an especially hospitable environment for moonlighting musicians. The Sugar Ray singer Mark McGrath is the co-host of the syndicated entertainment news show ''Extra''; the singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb has a cooking show with Dweezil Zappa on the Food Network; and Mr. Neil's Motley Crue bandmate Tommy Lee will attend college in Lincoln, Neb., for his own reality series on NBC next summer. 
 Mr. Neil, on the other hand, will star in his own physical transformation on Saturday. ''Remaking,'' he said, reminded him that survival in the image-conscious pop music world often hinges on a well-timed makeover. For those who hesitate, there's VH1. The network is working on future ''Remaking'' interventions for Vanilla Ice and the R&B belter Taylor Dayne. 
 ''You have to keep changing,'' Mr. Neil said. ''If you look at Motley, we looked different on every single album. 'Shout the Devil' was leather and devil costumes. Then we were the glam boys in pink and white and frills. On the next album, 'Girls, Girls, Girls,' we're bikers. So me and the other guys, we always kept changing.''
 Mr. Neil admitted he'd grown a little complacent, and chubby, in recent years. ''I was about 15 pounds more than I wanted to be. I'd watch these shows with people who are a bit overweight and I'd think, 'God, I wish something like that would happen to me, to light a fire under my butt and get me into the gym.'''
 That's precisely what happened last February, Mr. Neil recalled . ''I'm in South Beach, where everybody looks really good, sitting by the pool with a cocktail when I get this phone call from VH1 and my managers.''
 They explained the concept and Mr. Neil signed on for a 90-day transformation. As cameras rolled, he changed his hair color from blond to brown, sang his first power ballad, stopped drinking vodka, gave up junk food, lost 30 pounds and spent at least eight hours under the knife. ''They did a lot of things,'' Mr. Neil said. ''Brow lift, upper-lower eyes, partial face-lift, cheek implants, nose job, jaw line sculpturing. A lot of people think once you get that kind of surgery you turn out looking like Ethel Merman, and it's not like that. You look refreshed, like every night you've had a great night's sleep.''
 Getting plenty of sleep would have ranked as a fairly low priority back in the 80's, when Mr. Neil and his bandmates excelled in the sport of extreme partying. But Mr. Neil said he was ready to embrace the regimen advised by his team of consultants -- with one exception, when he just said no to the Life Coach. ''When I got to this leadership seminar,'' he recounted, ''they were like drill sergeants, screaming at each other, and they want you to scream back at them. I got hoarse the first night. I was still on tour at the time. I couldn't see myself screaming for the next few days, so I was like, 'I can't deal with this. I've got shows to do.'''

HEADLINE: Ernst & Young to Pay U.S. Over Bank Collapse in '01

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HINSDALE, Ill., Dec. 24 

 BODY:
The accounting firm Ernst & Young has agreed to pay $125 million to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over the collapse of a suburban Chicago bank three years ago, the F.D.I.C. announced Friday.
 The failure of Superior Bank, based in Hinsdale, cost the F.D.I.C. about $700 million, making it one of the largest federally insured financial institutions to fail in a decade.
 Investigators for the Treasury Department, the F.D.I.C. and Congress blamed the risky business strategies of Superior's management for the collapse, but they also cited failures on the part of Superior's outside auditing firm, Ernst & Young. The F.D.I.C. accused the firm of negligence and concealing the bank's true financial conditions. 
 Under the agreement announced Friday, Ernst & Young did not admit any liability.
 A spokesman for Ernst & Young, Charles Perkins, said the firm had already made changes to its auditing practices, including adding more technical resources and increasing its requirements for training and experience.
 ''Our decision to reach these settlements,'' Mr. Perkins said, ''underscores our commitment to work cooperatively with regulators and to ensure that we have the strongest policies and procedures to serve our clients and the public interest.'' 
 The Ernst & Young agreement involved two settlements: one for $40 million with the F.D.I.C. and another for $85 million involving enforcement claims by the Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision, which closed Superior on July 27, 2001. The F.D.I.C. said that it would receive both amounts.
 ''We still expect to lose money because of this failure, but this will go a long way in recouping as much as possible,'' an F.D.I.C. spokesman, David Barr. He said some of the settlement would eventually reach uninsured depositors who lost money in Superior's collapse.
 Superior Bank claimed about $2.3 billion in assets at the time and was owned by the multibillionaire Pritzker family and a New York developer.
 The Pritzkers agreed to a $460 million voluntary settlement in 2001 that barred government action against the owners. The owners admitted no liability. So far, the Pritzkers have paid about $175 million under the settlement's payment schedule, Mr. Barr said.

HEADLINE: 2 Centers For Film In Bay Area Cut Back

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Two film production centers here associated with some of the great films of the last three decades, from the ''Godfather'' series to ''The English Patient,'' are radically scaling back their activities and changing ownership, a consequence of technological shifts and economic hardship in the California film industry.
 The Saul Zaentz Film Center in Berkeley, founded by the veteran producer of ''The English Patient,'' will ramp down operations in mid-January and lay off its 14 workers, the center's general manager said.
 ''If you say we're closing down, it's not quite true,'' said Steve Shurtz, the general manager. ''What we're trying to do is find a new mode for staying alive.'' He said the center would operate on a freelance basis. 
 Similarly, Francis Ford Coppola's San Francisco-based American Zoetrope Productions closed this month. The production center, founded as an alternative to commercial Hollywood, was co-created in 1969 by Mr. Coppola, the ''Godfather'' director; George Lucas, the ''Star Wars'' director; and Walter Murch, an awardwinning sound designer. It is expected to reopen under the name ZAP Productions, focusing on DVD production, and to be run by Kim Aubry, who was previously in charge of Zoetrope. American Zoetrope will still maintain a Los Angeles office.
 Official announcements are expected from each company in the coming days.
 The reasons for the cutbacks and ownership changes, industry professionals here say, include the advancing age of Mr. Zaentz, 84, and the fact that Mr. Coppola, 65, has announced he will no longer hire himself out to direct Hollywood movies.
 But it also reflects shifting trends in the industry, in which editing and even sound design can be accomplished on laptop computers. Many of the major studios have built editing facilities on their lots and no longer contract out this work. As important, the realities of film financing keep many productions away from California and its Bay Area experts. Mr. Murch said he wanted to edit ''Cold Mountain'' here but found that European tax breaks made it cheaper to work in London.
 Over the past three decades, the Bay Area had become famous for its achievements in sound design and special effects. Mr. Coppola made two of his three ''Godfather'' films at Zoetrope, along with ''Apocalypse Now'' and Mr. Lucas's ''American Graffiti.'' In 1999, Mr. Coppola expanded into DVD production as well.
 Mr. Murch, who won Oscars for Best Editing and Best Sound for ''The English Patient'' and another Oscar for Best Sound for ''Apocalypse Now,'' has trained virtually a generation of sound technicians. The Zaentz Film Center was where ''Amadeus,'' ''The Right Stuff'' and ''The English Patient'' were edited and mixed, and the center has been home to such esteemed filmmakers as David Lynch, Bob Rafelson, Gus Van Sant and John Waters.
 Even now the director Carroll Ballard is completing a film at the Zaentz Film Center called ''Duma,'' and Terry Zwigoff, the director of ''Bad Santa,'' is doing post-production work there on his latest film, ''Art School Confidential.''
 The scale-backs and closures still leave two large film entities in the Bay Area: George Lucas's production-oriented LucasFilm and his computer effects powerhouse Industrial Light and Magic, which is expanding into a space in the heart of San Francisco's Presidio, a former military base. The other major film business in the region is Pixar, the computer animation hit-making machine, based in nearby Emeryville.
 Through a secretary, Mr. Zaentz said he was ''re-examining the business and is in the process of deciding'' the future of his film center. Mr. Coppola did not respond to requests for comment.
 California has been struggling with runaway production for several years. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has appointed a new film commissioner, Amy Lemisch, with a mandate to examine the tax incentives offered by other states and devise a way to counter them.
 Some film professionals expressed dismay at the shrinking local base.
 ''I'm devastated -- I'm horrified,'' said Stefanie Coyote, the newly-appointed director of the San Francisco Film Commission, part of the mayor's office. But she said she was not necessarily surprised. ''There has been so little production work in the Bay Area in the last four years,'' she said. ''I haven't had a chance to try to resurrect the film industry here. I need a shot.''
 Others said the decline was inevitable, given technological changes. ''The fact that it's come to this, and simultaneously for both places, is sad,'' Mr. Murch said. ''But you can edit a film on your laptop now. You can do a lot of premixing of sound on a laptop, or somewhere where you rent an office.''
 Symbolically, San Francisco has been synonymous with the group of filmmakers who moved from Los Angeles in the 1970's, seeking a creative haven from Hollywood, among them Mr. Coppola, Mr. Lucas, Philip Kaufman and Michael Ritchie. Mr. Coppola's film company occupied a historic building in downtown San Francisco and expanded into a miniempire, including an avant-garde magazine and his Napa Valley winery. With the riches begat by ''Star Wars,'' Mr. Lucas built a veritable town north of San Francisco, Skywalker Ranch, and founded Industrial Light and Magic.
 But despite the reputation and expertise of the Bay Area film professionals, many here say that there was never really enough commerce to create a viable industry, apart from the films of the extended Coppola family -- Mr. Coppola, his daughter Sofia, his son Romanand -- and Mr. Zaentz and Mr. Lucas.
 ''The blow is, I think, in terms of prestige and the identity of the area as not being a colony of the Los Angeles film industry, which was pretty much a fantasy anyway,'' said Gordon Whiting, a technical consultant to Mr. Zaentz. ''In terms of the studios and post-production facilities, they were the personal playgrounds of three major filmmakers. There wasn't enough industry traffic that was local to the area to really call itself sustaining.''
 The impetus for the changes at the Zaentz Film Center was the recent sale of Fantasy Records, Mr. Zaentz's music label, to Concord Records, owned by the producer Norman Lear. In previous decades, Mr. Zaentz had used the proceeds from the label to finance his film projects.

HEADLINE: Spitzer, in a Shift, Will Yield Inquiries To U.S. Regulators

BYLINE: By PATRICK O'GILFOIL HEALY

 BODY:
After nearly three years of high-profile prosecutions of investment banks, mutual funds and insurance companies, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York said yesterday that he is ready to cede those investigations to federal regulators.
 Mr. Spitzer said he believed the era of state attorneys general crusading against misdeeds on Wall Street was ending. He said he was concerned that 50 different investigations would balkanize regulations, and added that once-lax federal agencies had become more aggressive about rooting out fraud and wrongdoing. 
 The shift, first reported in The Financial Times, represents a remarkable turnabout for Mr. Spitzer, who has built a reputation as a giant-killer with his investigations of Merrill Lynch, one of the country's largest brokerage firms; Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker; and Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.
 His decision comes just two weeks after he declared his candidacy for governor of New York in 2006, a campaign in which he will need to raise large sums to be competitive. Traditionally, many of those donations in a governor's race come from Wall Street, but Mr. Spitzer said his move away from big-business investigations was not related to his campaign.
 ''This has nothing to do with that,'' Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, said in an interview yesterday. ''If you think of it a zero-sum game, if the feds begin to do what they need to do, the relative role of state agencies would diminish. Nothing I've said means that we wouldn't do all our cases over again. But as the pendulum swings, I think the feds have come back a bit.''
 But Stephen J. Minarik, chairman of the state's Republican Party, said the shift was a bald political move timed so the newly declared candidate for governor could distance himself from any criticism that Wall Street investigations had hurt the state's economy.
 ''I think he's trying to do an about-face,'' Mr. Minarik said. ''It's hard. Leopards don't change spots very often.''
 The news was likely to be a welcome development for Wall Street executives, who have said that Mr. Spitzer's investigations have sparked a frenzy of potentially contradictory state investigations from California to Oklahoma to West Virginia. He was particularly criticized by the industry for being stricter than the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency charged with policing the markets.
 ''The notion that he claimed that the S.E.C. was asleep at the switch, and therefore, that all enforcement activity should fall to the states, that took it too far,'' said Marc Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association. ''All of a sudden you had lots of imitators, Spitzer wannabes.''
 Mr. Lackritz said some of Mr. Spitzer's fixes to conflict-of-interest cases on Wall Street had gone too far, building needless barriers between investment bankers and research analysts. And Mr. Spitzer himself said that a flurry of state prosecutions could muddle regulatory territory. 
 ''I've always said that there's a real risk to having 50 different enforcement entities,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
 Although critics said ambition and ego had fueled Mr. Spitzer's voracious investigations, he long maintained that his office acted because agencies like the S.E.C. had failed. Now, Mr. Spitzer said, the new S.E.C. chairman, William H. Donaldson, and the Food and Drug Administration's investigations of arthritis medications were signs of a more aggressive posture.
 ''The notion that you could just abandon the regulatory role has been left behind,'' he said. ''I don't know if it will have a dramatic impact on what we do. We'll see how it plays out.''
 Mr. Spitzer would not say whether he planned to shift his focus toward investigating corruption and backroom dealing in state government -- issues likely to be prominent in the governor's race. Political analysts said Mr. Spitzer has to demonstrate that he can reform Albany as well as Wall Street.
 ''Not until recently has he weighed in, in a significant way, on issues dealing with state politics,'' said Blair Horner, legislative affairs director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''If Spitzer wants to be governor, he's got to develop a sophisticated response to the myriad of problems, and that's going to take some time, and it's going to take some thought.''
 Mr. Spitzer talked about his shifting attitude toward Wall Street and the S.E.C. two weeks ago during a breakfast meeting at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a Manhattan law firm where he once practiced. He also discussed the subject at a meeting of the New York Partnership.
 Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman under President Bill Clinton, said Mr. Spitzer had distinguished himself as a fierce opponent of Wall Street malfeasance, but he cautioned against now putting too much faith in federal regulators.
 ''If Spitzer is saying that now he's turning the whole thing over to the S.E.C., I think that's wrong,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''I think that we need a diligent New York State protector of investor rights working with the S.E.C.''
 Mr. Spitzer, a former prosecutor who used his family's fortune to run for attorney general, charged headfirst into Wall Street two years ago, wielding the Martin Act, a 1921 state law giving him jurisdiction over stock trading. He accused Merrill Lynch of publicly pushing stocks that its analysts derided in private.
 Merrill apologized and paid $100 million in fines, and over two years his investigations squeezed $4.4 billion from various firms. Fortune magazine called him ''The Enforcer,'' and The Financial Times named him its Man of the Year yesterday.
 Political analysts said Mr. Spitzer had earned many enemies on Wall Street, but campaign-donor records show he still has friends in the financial sector. Of the $6.8 million Mr. Spitzer has amassed since January 2003, $929,008 came from donors in finance, real estate and insurance, according to Follow the Money, an Internet database of campaign contributions.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 4, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday referred imprecisely to plans by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York for further investigations of business practices. It left an incorrect impression that he had spoken of ceding existing investigations to federal regulators -- as opposed to recognizing a reinvigorated federal role in new investigations. A corrective article is on Page 46. 
A front-page article on Dec. 25 about a decision by Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, to rely on federal regulators to handle future investigations of Wall Street misdeeds misstated the name of a group before which he said the Securities and Exchange Commission was aggressively pursuing such investigations. It is the Partnership for New York City, not the New York Partnership.

HEADLINE: Armenia's Isolation Grows Only Deeper

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS

DATELINE: YEREVAN, Armenia 

 BODY:
Landlocked and stuck in a cold war with two of its four neighbors, Armenia has rarely seemed so alone as in the past few months. 
 Citing terrorism concerns, Russia abruptly sealed its border with Georgia in September and kept it closed for nearly two months, effectively cutting off the road that was the main route for Armenian trade with Russia.
 At the same time, Armenians had to watch from the sidelines as Azerbaijan and Georgia celebrated the completion of a large section of the pipeline to carry Caspian Sea oil to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. The $5 billion regional energy project bypasses Armenia and excludes it from the hefty fees the participating countries will get. 
 Another bitter pill came in October, when the European Union's executive commission recommended that Turkey start negotiations for full membership without first having to end its rail and land blockade of Armenia. [On Dec. 17, the European Union invited Turkey to begin those talks without mentioning Armenia's demands in its decision. European Union leaders said Turkey could join within 10 years. 
 For many people in this impoverished country, the events added up to a reminder of their deepening isolation.
 ''If nothing changes, Armenia will be left as an island,'' said Levon Barseghyan, who is active in politics in Gyumri, a rundown town on a railway line that was closed by Turkey in 1992. ''Everyone will forget about Armenia.''
 As winter closes in, bringing the risk of new hardships in a country heavily dependent on imports and foreign aid, the prospects appear grim without outside intervention.
 Despite infusions of cash from Armenians living abroad that account for more than 20 percent of the country's income, and strong economic growth for the last decade, nearly half of the country's three million people live in poverty, on less than $2 a day. The limited opportunities have contributed to an exodus of working-age Armenians since independence 13 years ago, with some estimates putting the population loss at nearly 30 percent. 
 Armenia's long-running conflict with Azerbaijan, its oil-rich neighbor to the east, remains one of the more intractable problems left from the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
 Both countries claim Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous slice of land that is geographically inside the borders of Azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic Armenian separatists. Their six-year war over the region ended with a cease-fire in 1994, after 35,000 people had been killed and an estimated one million, most of them Azeri, had become refugees. 
 Turkey, Armenia's big neighbor to the west, has backed its Turkic ally, Azerbaijan, and closed its land border with Armenia. Turkish leaders have said they will not reopen the border until Armenia starts withdrawing its troops from in and around Karabakh. Peace negotiations have ground to a standstill despite mediation efforts by Russia, France and the United States. 
 ''On neither side is there a public mood that is conducive to compromise,'' said a Western diplomat in Yerevan.
 The stalemate has left Armenia boxed in from the east and the west. Turkish and Russian goods make their way to Armenia, but with the added cost of air transportation or road transit through third countries like Georgia.
 Georgia's roads, however, have sometimes been closed because of political instability or, as was the case this fall, because of action by Russia. Armenia's only other direct outlet is through Iran to the south, where trade has been hampered by a poor road network and lack of railway lines. The cost of building two needed new lines to Iran has been estimated at more than $1.5 billion.
 Armenian officials have been eager to revive peace talks with Azerbaijan but have also refused to make unilateral concessions on Karabakh, which they consider liberated Armenian territory, in exchange for Turkey's reopening of rail and road traffic. 
 ''We won't trade off Karabakh for a railroad,'' said the foreign minister, Vardan Oskanyan, adding that Armenians have learned to cope with their isolation. ''Things are evolving around us,'' he said. ''Let it be.''
 Many Armenians, foreign donors and economists are not nearly as sanguine. 
 While the economy has recovered from the near-total blockade on Armenia in the early 1990's, its growth rate could increase by as much as 50 percent if the eastern and western borders reopened, according to international studies.
 Such dire circumstances might be expected to provoke political unrest. But President Robert Kocharian, a Karabakh native and former commander of the separatist forces who was re-elected to a second term last year, has wide public support for his Karabakh policy. 
 ''Every day the government tells us our economy can flourish without opening the Turkish border and without solving the Karabakh problem,'' said Aram Abrahamyan, editor of the daily Aravot. ''And the government propaganda succeeds with the common people.'' 
 But a continuation of the status quo could be costly. Armenia 2020, a privately financed research group in Yerevan, has commissioned studies of the country's future, based on a range of possible developments including no easing of the blockade on Armenia. The studies concluded that ''if there are no changes, there is no prosperity,'' said Artashes Kazakhetsyan, the director of the group.
 Armenia has focused much of its effort on a two-pronged approach to Turkey. It has appealed directly to Turkish leaders to normalize relations. At the same time, it has tried to increase diplomatic pressure, openly questioning Turkey's fitness to start European Union entry talks before addressing Armenian grievances.
 In an interview, Mr. Oskanyan said he did not understand why European leaders ignored what he called Turkey's ''faults and shortcomings'' with regard to Armenia. ''What is regrettable,'' he said, ''is that Europe is closing its eyes on Turkey's petulance.''
 While Turkey has changed many of its policies over the last two years to win European Union acceptance, there has been no indication of a shift in its official line toward Armenia.
 Private contacts between Turks and Armenians will continue to be encouraged, said a senior Turkish diplomat in Ankara, who asked that his name not be used, in accordance with Foreign Ministry rules. Trade will continue. But the diplomat said the political impasse must be broken by Armenia.
 ''We can't change our policy on the Azeris,'' he said. ''So the first move has to come from Armenia. We would like to see an opening, even a small opening, on Nagorno-Karabakh.''

HEADLINE: Murder, Suicide and Pestilence. Bravo!

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:

1. 'ASSASSINS' Dispossession, alienation, political resentment: poisonous feelings were given ravishing voice in Joe Mantello's production for the Roundabout Theater of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's criminally underappreciated show. The year's great resurrection of a revival, which had all too brief a run at Studio 54.

2. 'BUG' Dispossession, alienation, political resentment (do you sense a trend coming on?) become the stuff of coruscating comedy in Tracy Letts's story of a man, a woman and a lot of mean little critters of the mind. Directed by Dexter Bullard. Playing at the Barrow Street Theater.

3. 'DEMOCRACY' The English dramatist Michael Frayn (with the invaluable assistance of the stage-savvy director Michael Blakemore) turns the rise and fall of the West German Chancellor Willy Brandt into a gripping consideration of the ambiguities of politics and of the private mysteries behind public personas. Playing at the Brooks Atkinson Theater.

4. 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' John Patrick Shanley's sleeper of a hit about a nun, a priest and the evidence of things unseen is brought to searing life by the leading performances of Cherry Jones and Brian F. O'Byrne. An inspired study in moral uncertainty with the compellingly certain structure of an old-fashioned detective drama, directed by Doug Hughes. Playing at the Manhattan Theater Club.

5. '4:48 PSYCHOSIS' In a season where darkness shimmered on stages throughout New York, no play was more haunting or, paradoxically, more theatrically vibrant than the Royal Court Theater's traveling production of the London playwright Sarah Kane's irrefutable suicide note of a play. Directed with echoing lyricism and boundless empathy by James Macdonald at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn.

6. 'JUMPERS' The National Theater of Britain's glittering, calisthenic revival of Tom Stoppard's brainteaser of a comedy of metaphysics, murder and marriage, directed by David Leveaux and starring the great Simon Russell Beale, in a smashing Broadway debut, as a cloud-gathering philosopher.

7. 'MRS. FARNSWORTH' A.R. Gurney's elegant demonstration that in political theater, politeness can be more lethal than a full-fisted punch, as George W. Bush is condemned (in absentia) by the standards of his own patrician class. Sigourney Weaver and John Lithgow provided brilliantly calibrated cartoons of WASP's who sting gently in this Flea Theater production, directed by Jim Simpson.

8. 'A NUMBER' Further confirmation that no living playwright combines breadth of imagination and economy of means as Caryl Churchill does. A chilling, mind-expanding fugue for two actors about the moral and psychological implications of cloning, starring Sam Shepard (in his first New York stage appearance in more than 30 years) and Dallas Roberts. Directed by James Macdonald. Playing at the New York Theater Workshop.

9. 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' A creaky relic from the 1950's, Reginald Rose's tidy portrait of all-American pride and prejudice in a jury room is restored with gleaming polish and plenty of actorly lubrication. Directed by Scott Ellis for the Roundabout Theater Company and featuring a delightful dozen of New York's finest character actors. Playing at the American Airlines Theater.

10. 'WELL' Lisa Kron's self-imploding memoir of a play about her mother, herself and the ultimate unknowability of people. Directed by Leigh Silverman at the Public Theater and starring Ms. Kron and Jayne Houdyshell as the kibitzing mother who refuses to let her daughter's play settle into predictable patterns.

HEADLINE: Dodgers Reach 'Midstream,' but It's Unclear Where the Paddle Is

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
AT times, it seems as if the Los Angeles Dodgers throw a bunch of names up on a wall and keep the players whose names stick. Of course, if a team can win division championships with those players, it might not be a bad way of operating.
 The Dodgers' methods came under scrutiny last week when they pulled out of a three-way trade that would have sent Arizona's Randy Johnson to the Yankees. The elements of that trade will be disputed and debated for the rest of the winter, but the Dodgers readily acknowledged that they killed it.
 That development added controversy to what had already been a controversial off-season for the Dodgers. 
 The Dodgers reached the playoffs for the first time since 1996 and won their first division championship since 1995, but that team did not remain together for long. Nine of the 24 players who faced St. Louis in the division series became free agents.
 The Dodgers have re-signed two of them, pitchers Wilson Alvarez and Elmer Dessens, but they have let the others leave, most notably the hitters Adrian Beltre and Steve Finley and starting pitchers Jose Lima and Odalis Perez. Lima, who rejoined the Kansas City Royals yesterday when he agreed to a one-year contract, had the team's best record, 13-5. Perez's 3.25 earned run average was the 10th lowest in the National League.
 Beltre, at 26, had the best year of his seven-year career, producing career highs with a .334 batting average, 121 runs batted in and a major league-leading 48 home runs. But the Dodgers were not impressed enough to outbid the last-place Seattle Mariners for his continued services.
 Finley, whose grand slam clinched the division for the Dodgers on the next-to-last day of the season, did not get any attention from the Dodgers as a free agent. He instead went south to another division champion in Anaheim.
 Last week, the Dodgers showed that they were not finished shedding players, making their second baseman, Alex Cora, a free agent by not tendering him a contract.
 They were also prepared to lose Shawn Green, their No. 1 offensive threat remaining after Beltre's departure, and three pitchers in the three-team trade that did not happen.
 One of the pitchers was Brad Penny, who was the primary player the Dodgers received last July 31 when they traded catcher Paul Lo Duca, the heart and soul of their team, to Florida. When they made that trade, the Dodgers planned to turn around and include Penny in a package they would give to Arizona for Johnson, but that time, the Diamondbacks balked and the trade never happened.
 The Dodgers did make another deal on that trading-deadline day, sending outfielder Dave Roberts to Boston, where he registered the stolen base against the Yankees' Mariano Rivera that turned around the postseason for the Red Sox.
 All of the vacancies in the starting lineup have not remained unfilled. Three days ago, the Dodgers signed J.D. Drew as a free agent, presumably as the offensive replacement for Beltre. Drew will play right field, making Green the regular first baseman.
 The Dodgers previously signed free agents to fill the infield holes, Jeff Kent for second base and Jose Valentin for third. Those players presumably will provide more offense than defense for a team that was the league's best defensively last season. The Dodgers also signed Ricky Ledee to bolster their outfield corps. 
 They are not finished putting the pieces together, General Manager Paul DePodesta said.
 ''No question we're still in midstream,'' he said. ''I don't think that what we currently have will comprise our 25-man roster.''
 Pitching is one area DePodesta said he would look to strengthen. The team's current starting rotation would have Penny; Kazuhisa Ishii, who would have gone to the Yankees in the three-way deal; Jeff Weaver, whom the Dodgers acquired from the Yankees for Kevin Brown a year ago; Alvarez; and Edwin Jackson, a 21-year-old right-hander. 
 When the Dodgers chose not to compete vigorously for Beltre and when it appeared that they would trade Green, who has a $16 million salary next season, critics among fans and the news media accused the first-year owner, Frank McCourt, of slashing the payroll from its $102 million season-closing level.
 McCourt could not be reached to discuss the payroll issue, but DePodesta said: ''Payroll in general plays a part in just about everything anyone does, but we still have significant payroll flexibility. We still have money to spend.''
 With Green's salary remaining on the payroll, though, the Dodgers have $16 million less to spend. Had the Dodgers traded Green, on the other hand, they would not have received a hitter in return. That was one reason the proposed trade drew so much criticism in Los Angeles.
 Some officials on the other teams suspect that news media criticism prompted the Dodgers to pull out of the deal.
 ''No,'' DePodesta said. ''I've had to do a number of unpopular things here in the last 11 months, and it's probably not over. We're not going to do things just to be popular. Ultimately, we're going to do what is right for the Dodgers.''

They're Not Bankers
 Recent baseball history is littered with foolish financial decisions made by players and in one instance by a coach. Jody Reed, an infielder, is credited with initiating this practice. As a free agent after the 1993 season, he rejected the Dodgers' offer of $7.8 million for three years, then, after changing agents, wound up signing a minor league contract with Milwaukee that was to pay him $350,000 if he won a major league job.
 Before the 2003 season, Nomar Garciaparra turned down Boston's offer of $60 million for a four-year contract extension. He became a free agent this year and signed a one-year contract with the Cubs for $8 million.
 A few years ago, Jose Cardenal walked away from his job as the Yankees' first-base coach because they would not give him a small raise. It was an act of foolish pride, because with the job, he also gave up a postseason share that was far larger than any raise he might have secured. 
 Miguel Cairo is this year's questionable economic genius. Signed a year ago as a utility infielder, Cairo became the Yankees' everyday second baseman and performed better than anyone expected, batting .292 in 360 times at bat. 
 The Yankees planned to re-sign him for next season, but they were a little uncertain how to view him, General Manager Brian Cashman said. 
 ''We wanted to do a one-year deal; they wanted a two-year deal,'' Cashman said. ''We offered a two-year deal at 1.5 a year. After that, we got uncomfortable. Is he the everyday guy that we think, or is he going to wind up being a utility guy? We just weren't certain, and when it started getting up to the 2 million range, where he was looking for on a two-year basis, we looked at other alternatives.''
 Tony Womack was also a free agent. 
 ''Tony Womack's been an everyday player for some time,'' Cashman said. ''There's been a little more consistency there, so if you're going to spend that kind of money we started gravitating toward more certainty.''
 The Yankees signed Womack to a two-year, $4 million contract, and Cairo is still looking for a job.

Making Minor Exceptions
 Two free-agent signings have produced unusual results.
 The Baltimore Orioles signed shortstop Chris Gomez to a minor league contract and left him unprotected in the minor league draft this month. Free agents who sign major league contracts cannot have their contracts assigned elsewhere without their permission until the following June 15, but Gomez was not protected by that clause because he had signed a minor league contract.
 Philadelphia selected him in the draft, but the Orioles prevailed on the Phillies to sell him back to them, which they did a week later.
 A minor league contract was also involved in reliever Jeff Zimmerman's status. Zimmerman, who has not pitched the past three years because of a series of elbow problems, was a free agent whom Texas did not offer salary arbitration.
 Under the rules, the Rangers lost rights to Zimmerman until May 1. But exceptions have been made on a handful of players with special circumstances, and Zimmerman was deemed to fall into that category. Other teams need not fear that the Rangers will sneak him into April games, because he will not be ready to pitch until well into the season.

HEADLINE: Blame The New Yorker

BYLINE: By Walter Kirn

 BODY:

THE COMPLETE CARTOONS OF THE NEW YORKER
Edited by Robert Mankoff.
656 pp.
Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers.
$60.
 Now that America's urbane sophisticates have had to acknowledge their status as a fringe group so out of touch with mainstream moral values, tournament bass fishing, Nascar and Christian rock that their electoral and cultural clout is marginally less than that of Casper, Wyo., legions of self-doubting highbrows are asking themselves how this decline into decadence occurred. 
 Because of what enfeebling bad habit did the proud and potent thinking class that gave us F.D.R. and J.F.K. fade into a cynical, ironic, smirking bunch of spiritual weaklings headed up by Al Franken and Michael Moore? Was the problem attending movies instead of church? Deserting Burger King for Whole Foods Market? No, I've concluded. The blame lies elsewhere. The seduction of America's elites by the vices of humanism and skepticism can only be blamed on the New Yorker cartoon, an agent of corruption more insidious than LSD or the electric guitar.
 For proof of this theory, please obtain and study ''The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker,'' a coffee-table book so broad and thick that it doesn't need a table under it because it's its own table -- just bolt on legs. And the book might have been even larger, its editor, Robert Mankoff, writes. Of more than 68,000 pieces of art that could have been included in its pages, only about 2,000 have been printed on paper, while the rest are reproduced on two CD's attached to the inside of the front cover. The book is an astonishing object, still. The thought that all (or even just all the best) New Yorker cartoons can be gathered in one volume means that the set isn't infinite after all. It's like finding out there are only so many sad songs or only so many attractive blondes.
 The subversion of ruling-class piety by wit dates back to the mid 1920's and a cartoon by Peter Arno, the form's first master. A scantily-dressed flapper with heels like black daggers, endless legs and perfect posterior cleavage is pressing herself into the padded abdomen of a stuffy older gentleman in tails. He's dancing, but she's on the verge of copulating. ''Good God, woman! Think of the social structure!'' Funny? Sort of. Not really. It's something else; a smirky, gently cynical something else that will characterize the form for decades to come, right up until the present. The key phrase in this instance is ''social structure,'' of course, which the fellow has presumably picked up from some asinine conversation at his club or some best-selling history of Western Man, and the key visual detail is his mustache, so walrusy and pompous and well-brushed. The girl stands for jazzy Freudian libido, the man for repressed Victorian lust. Hers is the irresistible new attitude, and all the old gent can do to hold it off -- in her, but chiefly in himself -- is sputter high-minded jargon.
 By the 1930's and 40's, the New Yorker cartoon had adopted two basic modes. First, it made fun of its readers' aspirations -- social, intellectual, economic and romantic -- by satirizing their language, their professions, their pastimes, their dress and their physical mannerisms. This was the humor of self-recognition, but also of self-congratulation, since a fool who can laugh at his folly is not a fool but something rarer and finer: a self-ironist. Under drawings of dance parties, cruise ships, tennis matches, clothing stores and theaters the artists set captions -- usually bits of dialogue -- that showed up their speakers as posing, posturing, preening, pedantic pretenders. James Thurber, whose influential innovation was to draw as crudely as a 5-year-old, making only the most cursory effort to individualize his figures (because, really, why bother; we're all just talking apes), gives us two couples seated at a table, holding up glasses of dark liquid. The fanciest of the drinkers -- he wears a bow tie -- says: ''It's a naive domestic Burgundy without any breeding, but I think you'll be amused by its presumption.'' Thus did the wine snob get his donkey tail, and his kind has worn it ever since.
 The second, less common species of cartoon relied more heavily on visual gags and traded in featherweight absurdism. Two politicians and an engineer stand at the edge of a massive and sweeping Western dam. ''The other side!'' one of the politicians bellows. ''The water's supposed to be on the other side.'' In a mute, seven-panel sketch by Otto Soglow, a generic male figure appears first in a crib, then in a playpen, then behind various grates and fences, and then, in the next-to-last image, inside a bank cage under a sign: ''Receiving Teller.'' The motif of bold vertical lines pays off with a picture of the poor everyman in jail, probably as punishment for embezzlement, the sole act of rebellion in his dry and pent-up life.
 Toward the 50's this second, more graphic, laconic style started to predominate. The captions got shorter, or vanished altogether, while the drawings grew louder, cuter, trickier. The Jazz Age, its Great Depression hangover and World War II were all behind the country, and the cartoons seemed to lack a subject for a while, substituting trickiness for punch. This enervated spirit of the early cold war is crystallized in a creation by Chon Day: A pudgy, tie-wearing nonentity of a man holds a pistol to one side of his head while plugging a finger in his opposite ear. He doesn't want to hear the shot, he doesn't really want to fire the shot -- he just wants a respite, a little peace. He's spent. (The cartoon rather closely reprises an earlier piece done by Saul Steinberg in 1946 that shows another suited sad sack aiming a revolver not at his temple but at an apple perched on his bald scalp.)
 The morbid streak that emerged around this time made a pop-culture sensation of Charles Addams. Memories of ''The Addams Family,'' the campy TV show spun off from his work, make it hard to assess his cartoons' original impact. They certainly didn't resemble their predecessors. To begin with, they were darker in hue, their objects and characters often framed in a barren, timeless gloom that's closer to Sartre and Beckett than Hollywood horror films. Instead of the dapper, devilish good fun offered by the TV show, a disquieting cruelty keeps cropping up. In a 1949 cartoon, an automobile pulling a travel trailer is parked alongside a high, sheer cliff. A man in a raincoat stands next to the car, facing the trailer's door, which faces the cliff. ''Oh, darling,'' he says, ''can you step out for a moment?'' Gothic fun-house spookiness? Not quite. The tone of blandly vicious marital malice feels troublingly real.
 By dividing the collection into decades that begin and end at the five-year mark, and by adding brief topical and historical essays, the editor seeks to convince us that the cartoons represent a progression of some sort linked to current events and social trends. One of the better essays, by John Updike (the other two good ones are Calvin Trillin's and Ian Frazier's), notes a lag between the subjects of the cartoons and the headlines of the day, particularly in regard to heated issues such as civil rights. In the decade from 1955 to 1964, Updike observes, only one cartoon features a black face.
 That's more than a lag; it suggests that the cartoons were, for the most part, a refuge from reality -- or an antidote, like a stiff cocktail -- rather than a trailing reflection. Just because more and more drawings included TV sets and other period accouterments doesn't mean they engaged the the larger culture at any interesting level -- with some exceptions. One work of art, yes, art, by William Steig (who, with Steinberg, was one of the magazine's licensed weirdos) uses shaky psychedelic lines that thin and thicken and curl around themselves to give us a lumpy, not-quite-human creature standing glumly under a tall flower. ''The Burden of Self-Consciousness.'' It's perfect. It levels the era's turtlenecked existentialism with one decisive comic blow, but after its point is made it keeps on moving, burrowing through the eye to the subconscious and lodging there like an abstract parasite.
 Depending on the reader's age, a point will come in the book when the cartoons stop representing The New Yorker's history, let alone American society's, and start recalling bits of his own life. For me, this happened on Page 382 with a William Hamilton cartoon from 1972. I was 9 years old when I first saw it, growing up in a Minnesota village that had changed in four or five short years from a sleepy ma-and-pa farm town to a hip colony for outdoorsy Twin City professionals. This new crowd, which included my parents, was on a tear just then, drinking, dancing and divorcing. When my parents threw one of their smoky, noisy parties (many featuring fondue) a terrible sense of moral peril floated upstairs to my bedroom. Please save us, God. My fear that my family, and all of civilization, was about to collapse in some swinging, groovy orgy that would leave me and all other young children homeless merged somehow with certain objects: the bottle of Smirnoff vodka in our pantry, the copy of ''The Happy Hooker'' in my father's sock drawer and, most frightening of all, the stack of magazines beside the toilet in our downstairs bathroom.
 I'd opened one of them once and seen a drawing -- angular, snappy and very mod in precisely the manner I found so menacing -- of a strange man and a woman seated in a restaurant in front of a crowded, lively bar. The man had long hair, big glasses, a droopy mustache and a flowery wide tie. The woman had a plume of frizzy hair, chunky earrings and startlingly thin arms. He was leaning back, smoking. She was drinking wine. She was saying something, but I didn't get the joke. It hardly mattered. The picture's feeling, its vibe, was disturbing enough. It haunted me. Seeing it again, I got the chills. (''It's hard to believe,'' the forgotten caption reads, ''that someday we'll be just so much nostalgia.'')
 In the 80's and afterward, the cartoons tended to loosen up and grow freewheeling, branching out from ingenious visual jokes and the light comedy of upper-middle-class manners into more idiosyncratic terrain. Roz Chast's 1981 three-panel piece titled ''The Three Certainties'' begins with a faux-naif skull and crossbones, ''Death.'' A check made out to the I.R.S. and surrounded by disembodied angels' wings signifies ''Taxes.'' The final panel shows a clown in a curly wig and a ruffed collar -- ''Bobo.'' Get it? Of course you don't. Such humor can't be gotten, in the old sense, only inexplicably chuckled at. Chast and her quirky contemporary counterparts practice a sort of comic expressionism that depends for its effects on the reader's ability to recognize, identify with and mysteriously anticipate the habitual, signature movements of individual artists' minds. The most one can say of a good Chast cartoon is that it's deeply Chast-like. And that's sufficient.
 Such recent cartoons don't make a point, they are a point -- a sign, perhaps, that the genre has reached maturity. It's playing with its own traditions now and milking the expectations of a fan base whose tastes have become slightly jaded, even perverse. The appearance of this encyclopedic anthology, though it's nominally linked to the The New Yorker's 80th anniversary next year, can only feel a bit final and funereal, just as the volume's slablike heft makes it feel like a tombstone. And though it would be foolish to suggest the medium has run its course and that renaissance and revival aren't still possible (America might elect another Democratic Senate someday, too) one does sense that the cartoons have done the job they first set out to do: purging any lingering puritanism from their relatively well-heeled audience and replacing it with a smart-aleck self-awareness that suddenly -- just look around -- feels useless, lonely and crippling.
 But still amusing.

HEADLINE: The Extraordinary Who Lived Among Us

BYLINE: By DICK AHLES

 BODY:
IT is impossible to read the following remembrances of some of the Connecticut residents who died this year and not feel regret. It's not just the sadness over the death of truly extraordinary people, but that they lived such rich lives out of the view of so many of us. 
 Who wouldn't have loved to have sat down with Alix and Pierre Deguise to hear their tales of the French Resistance and going ashore at Normandy with Free French forces? Or to have danced to the music of Al Gentile or flown with the aviation pioneer Mary Goodrich Jenson, who learned to fly the year Charles A. Lindbergh landed in Paris? Or to have given a standing ovation to Patricia Kingsley Ritter, who spent a lifetime working for civil rights? 
 These were lives not to be missed. Here, briefly, are rememberances of a few written by Dick Ahles.

Fighting for France, but Teaching Here
 Alix and Pierre Deguise met and married after serving in separate French military organizations during World War II. Pierre Deguise was a member of the French Resistance and Ms. Deguise was with the Free French forces.
 Ms. Deguise was born in Paris and Mr. Deguise in Burgundy in eastern France. He was educated at the University of Lyon and the Sorbonne before the war and joined the French Army in 1938. After France's defeat, he became a member of the underground Resistance movement, was imprisoned, escaped and rejoined the Resistance.
 Ms. Deguise, who was Jewish, escaped from occupied Europe and came to New York when she was 15 with her mother and brother. After studying at the Lycee Francais of New York, she left Smith College at 18 to join Charles de Gaulle's forces in London. She reached Normandy three weeks after the invasion and was involved in providing relief to the residents of Caen, Boulogne, and Calais. She later worked with the survivors of concentration camps, including Bergen-Belsen, where many of her relatives had died.
 She resumed her education at the University of Aix en Provence and the University of Lausanne and married Mr. Deguise in Monaco in 1948. 
 They came to the United States in 1951 when Mr. Deguise joined the faculty of Wellesley College. In 1958, they moved to Connecticut College where Ms. Deguise taught French literature and civilization and Mr. Deguise was chairman of the French and Italian departments. They lived in Niantic.
 On July 29, Ms. Deguise, suffering from a blood clot on her lungs, was taken to Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London. In the emergency room, Mr. Deguise fell, broke his hip and also developed what proved to be a fatal blood clot on his lungs. Four hours after his death, Ms. Deguise also died.
 Ms. Deguise was 79 and Mr. Deguise was 88.

The First 'Girl Pilot'
 When the Hindenberg flew over Hartford in 1936, Mary Goodrich Jenson was the only woman on board.
 Ms. Jenson, then Mary Goodrich, was The Hartford Courant's first aviation editor as well as the first Connecticut woman to hold a pilot's license, having learned to fly in 1927 at age 20. 
 Mary Goodrich wrote for the newspaper while taking flying lessons at Brainard Field in Hartford and was billed by The Courant as its ''girl pilot.'' 
 In 1929, she became a member of Amelia Earhart's Ninety Nines, an international organization of female flyers. She was a director of the Betsy Ross Corps, a group of female pilots who assisted in national defense, and she was active in the Women Flyers of America, started in 1940 to free male pilots for military service by flying from factories to air fields and transporting supplies.
 She lived most of her life in Wethersfield, where she served on the Board of Education, Republican Town Committee and Council of Social Agencies of Greater Hartford.
 In 2000, she was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in recognition of her aviation pioneering.
 Ms. Jenson died at Hartford Hospital on Jan. 4. She was 96.

Titan of the Big Bands
 They called Al Gentile the ''Titan of the Big Bands'' during the nearly seven decades he led dance bands in Connecticut and throughout the northeast.
 Mr. Gentile was born and raised in New Britain and began his musical career at New Britain Senior High School when he founded and led the school's pep band. He lived in New Britain for most of his life.
 After high school, Mr. Gentile organized the band Ten Melodeons until it expanded to 15 musicians and two vocalists. The band, renamed the Al Gentile Orchestra, performed throughout New England and along the Eastern Seaboard from the 1930's to 2000. 
 For many years, there were a number of Al Gentile Orchestras appearing in the region. ''He kept a lot of musicians working,'' said Ed Sarisley of Enfield, a former drummer with an Al Gentile Orchestra. 
 When he wasn't leading his dance band, Mr. Gentile worked as an agent, producer and booker of entertainment acts.
 A lifelong member of the American Federation of Musicians, Mr. Gentile served the musicians' union in several positions. Members of the union waived their fees when he performed a farewell concert in New Britain High School, where his career began, in 2000.
 Mr. Gentile died Feb. 18. He was 88.

A Woman's Voice in Barkhamsted
 Carmella Lattizori's election as the first selectwoman of Barkhamsted in 1985 ended what The Hartford Courant called, ''about 200 years of Republican males serving in that office.'' She would serve for 11 years and was a leader of the community and an advocate for its citizens for decades.
 Ms. Lattizori had unsuccessfully run for first selectwoman in two previous elections and after retiring as first selectwoman, she continued to serve on the board of selectmen until 1999 and was also Barkhamsted's Democratic registrar of voters and a member of other town boards. 
 Ms. Lattizori was co-founder of the Valley Thrift Shop in New Hartford and the Susan B. Anthony Project for battered women in Torrington. As first selectwoman, she also helped to organize the bipartisan Litchfield Hills Council of Elected Officials. During her years on the board of selectmen, she played a leading role in two major community projects, the construction of a new town hall and renovations of the elementary school.
 Ms. Lattizori died at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford July 7. She was 70. Her husband, Francis, will help dedicate a flag pole in her memory on the grounds of the Barkhamsted Town Hall following the town's Independence Day parade next year.

'A Good, Vibrant Newsroom'
 E. Bartlett Barnes, the publisher of The Bristol Press from 1956 to 1985, was one of the last proprietors of independent, family-owned newspapers that once thrived in many Connecticut small towns.
 Donald Selena, who worked with Mr. Barnes at The Press for 43 years, said Mr. Barnes ''wanted to make enough money to support a good, vibrant newsroom.'' He cared about advertising, circulation and other areas of the newspaper, but his main purpose as a publisher was to be sure he had a good newsroom, Mr. Selena said.
 Mr. Barnes grew up in Bristol, graduated from Yale in 1929 and worked as a reporter and advertising salesman at The Stamford Advocate for eight years before joining the family's newspaper in 1937. During his 48 years at The Press, Mr. Barnes was ''almost synonymous with the town,'' said Thomas D. Kennedy III, president of Bristol Hospital. ''Every place you turned, every good deed that was done, he was part of it.''
 At various times, Mr. Barnes headed the Bristol Board of Education, the Library Board, the Boys Club, the Barnes Nature Center and the town's Industrial Development Board. He was a founder of the town's American Clock and Watch Museum, the Environmental Learning Centers of Connecticut and the New England Carousel Museum. He was a founding member of the Bristol Yale Club in the 1950's and established a scholarship fund that has helped dozens of Bristol students attend Yale.
 ''What he wasn't involved in wasn't important,'' Mr. Selena said.
 Mr. Barnes and his older brother, Clarkson, succeeded their father as co-publishers of The Press in 1956, and Mr. Barnes became president and publisher when Clarkson Barnes retired in 1968. 
 Mr. Barnes was a strong supporter of the public's right to know and was part of a group of publishers and editors who began pushing for a state freedom of information law in the 1950's. The law was passed in 1975 and Mr. Barnes served as a member of the state's Freedom of Information Commission in the 1980's. He continued to attend meetings of the Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information well into his '90's.
 Although most of his career was on the business side of his newspaper, Mr. Barnes always felt his greatest achievement in journalism occurred during the great 1955 flood. He waded through waist high water from The Press, which had lost its telephone lines, to the Southern New England Telephone Company, where he called in his account of the flood damage in Bristol to the Associated Press in Boston. But, he always added ruefully, the Associated Press mistakenly put Mr. Barnes's brother's byline on the story. 
 Mr. Barnes died Feb. 9 in his home in Bristol. He was 96. 

A True Boy Scout
 Kenneth Gunsalus of Danielson joined the Boy Scouts when he was 13 and stayed for 75 years.
 As a scoutmaster, Mr. Gunsalus spent 45 summer vacations leading his troops to summer camp. He had one of his greatest experiences in scouting in 1935 when he met Lord Robert Baden-Powell , who founded the Boy Scouts in England. In 1939 and 1940, Mr. Gunsalus led troops of Boy Scouts who worked as tour guides at the New York World's Fair.
 Mr. Gunsalus received the Scouts' highest honor, the Silver Beaver, and many other awards. The Kenneth Gunsalus Good Citizen's Award is given in his honor each year to students from Putnam Elementary School and St. Mary's School.
 In World War II, Mr. Gunsalus was an infantryman in the Pacific and served in the Connecticut National Guard for 10 years. An electrician, Mr. Gunsalus worked for Connecticut Light and Power for 43 years, retiring as a service foreman in 1977.
 Mr. Gunsalus died May 4 in Danielson. He was 88.

Helping the Polish
 Edward Pawlowski assumed many leadership roles in Hartford's Polish community, and he was especially proud of helping Polish immigrants become American citizens.
 Many Poles fled Poland after a Communist government gained control following World War II and many settled in the Hartford Polish community. Mr. Pawlowski befriended many of them and sponsored more than 250 immigrants for the naturalization classes that were required for citizenship.
 As manager and president of Hartford's Polish National Home, a popular gathering place for Polish-Americans, he organized many of the annual Pulaski-Kosciuszko Day Parades and was active in the Polish Legion of America Veterans Post and the Pulaski Democratic Club.
 In order to help Poles still living in Poland learn something about America and its national pastime, he was a director of the Polish National Youth Baseball Program that helped introduce the game to Poland. 
 A Hartford native and lifetime member of SS. Cyril and Methodius Church, Mr. Pawlowski was a graduate of the city's Bulkeley High School and captain of its 1936 football team. He attended Providence College on a football scholarship before enlisting in the Army and serving in the Pacific during World War II, where he was wounded and awarded the Purple Heart.
 As a two-term member of the City Council in the 1950's and 60's, Mr. Pawlowski was an early advocate of a civic center for Hartford. He worked for the state for many years and retired in 1987 as a superintendent in the Department of Public Works.
 Mr. Pawlowski died Nov. 2 in Hartford's St. Francis Hospital. He was 87.

Housing and Civil Rights Advocate
 In 1936, when Patricia Kingsley was a 16-year-old college freshman, she organized one of the nation's first anti-discrimination sit-ins at a restaurant in Iowa.
 Patricia Kingsley Ritter would continue to be active in the civil rights movement throughout her life. With her husband, George Ritter, a Hartford lawyer and former city councilman and state legislator, she founded the Connecticut Housing Investment Fund, which has, since the 1960's, helped more than 70,000 families move into integrated housing in the Hartford area, according to the Ritter family.
 The family also recalls that Ms. Ritter's efforts to integrate housing were met with violence on several occasions, including an incident in 1963 when an East Hartford mob nearly overturned her car with her and her 7-year-old son inside. 
 Ms. Ritter's first civil rights project in Connecticut was as New England director of the Citizens Committee on Displaced Persons, which helped many people who had fled Europe after World War II resettle in the United States.
 In 1950, Ms. Ritter was appointed to the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights by Gov. Chester Bowles. She was the first woman to be named to that commission. President Jimmy Carter made her a director of the National Housing Partnership in 1979. 
 At about the same time, Ms. Ritter founded China in Connecticut and helped China rebuild its libraries and universities. She taught at colleges in China and received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Heilongjiang University in Harbin, China. She also received an honorary degree from Lawrence University in Wisconsin and the distinguished alumni achievement award from the University of Iowa.
 Ms. Ritter taught English and American literature at West Virginia University, Hillyer College, now part of the University of Hartford, and Hartford College for Women. She was the mother of a daughter and four sons, including Thomas Ritter, who followed his father into the Connecticut General Assembly and was speaker of the house.
 Ms. Ritter died Dec. 10 at Hartford Hospital. She was 84.

Try and Try Again
 Donald Jepsen ran for the state House of Representatives in 1970 and circulated a campaign flier calling for a commuter rail line between Hartford and its suburbs, harsher penalties for drug dealers, alternatives to low income housing projects and fiscally responsible state government. He lost.
 Eighteen years later, Mr. Jepsen ran for the state Senate and handed out the same document, saying the issues hadn't changed in 18 years. He also lost that race.
 Mr. Jepsen was the owner of the Built Rite Engine Exchange in Hartford and Windsor Locks until 1972 when he was appointed state unemployment compensation commissioner by then Gov. Thomas Meskill. He was reappointed by Gov. Ella Grasso and later served as an administrative law judge until he retired in 1988.
 He was an avid sailor, earning the ''N'' for navigator designation from the United States Power Squadrons. In 1994, Mr. Jepsen served on a small ship that traced Christopher Columbus' route from Spain to America.
 Mr. Jepsen died at his home in New London on Jan. 24. He was 71.

The First Lady of Avon
 They called Beatrice Murdock France ''the first lady of Avon'' and with good reason.
 A resident of Avon for 36 years, Bea Murdock, as she was known in the town, served on the Board of Selectmen for seven years, five of them as first selectwoman. She represented the town in the Connecticut House of Representatives during the 1980's, and in 1989 she was elected to the Town Council, which had replaced the selectman form of government. She was one of the founders of Avon Day, an annual community celebration.
 A lifelong Republican, Ms. France considered herself an ardent supporter of home rule. As a legislator, she co-sponsored the bill that created the statewide 911 emergency telephone network.
 Ms. France was also involved in many other Avon and Farmington Valley organizations. She was a soloist and choir director at the West Avon Congregational Church, president of the Avon Red Cross and a member of the Farmington Valley Association for the Retarded and Handicapped, and the Farmington Valley Visiting Nurses' Association, among others. 
 Ms. France was born and raised in Connecticut and graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1954, the year she married James Murdock of Guilford. Two years after Mr. Murdock's death in 1986, she married Bud France of Avon. The couple moved to Cape Cod in 1994.
 Ms. France died in March at her home in Eastham, Mass. She was 71.

A Proponent of the Gifted
 William Vassar Sr.'s professional life was dedicated to helping gifted and talented students reach their educational potential. 
 Colleagues credit him with expanding gifted programs in Connecticut schools from four when he joined the Department of Education in 1966 to more than 140 today. Mr. Vassar was director of the Department of Education programs for gifted and talented children from 1966 to 1986 and later served as coordinator of gifted education at Central Connecticut State University. 
 From 1967 to 1970, he conducted a 50-state study for President Lyndon Johnson's White House Task Force on the Gifted and Talented. Over the years he published 72 articles on the subject. In 2002, he was named one of the 50 most influential people in the field by the National Association for Gifted and Talented Children. He was a past president and vice president of that organization.
 Mr. Vassar was also a sports enthusiast and worked for more than 30 years as a Division I college baseball umpire. He also umpired minor league baseball games and was a scout for the San Francisco Giants. After the baseball season ended, Mr. Vassar refereed college football.
 Mr. Vassar died in November in Hartford. He was 79.

Not Just Any Teacher, but the Best
 Fred Kort was studying law at the University of Vienna in 1938 when the Nazis came to power in Austria and expelled him along with other Jewish students.
 Mr. Kort immigrated to the United States, joined the United States Army in 1942 and returned to Europe as a member of the 11th Armored Division. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944 and ended his European tour of duty back in Vienna.
 After the war, Mr. Kort resumed his interrupted education at Northwestern University, receiving his bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. degrees in four years. Upon joining the political science faculty at the University of Connecticut in 1950, Mr. Kort predicted he would have a 40-year career there, according to his family. He retired from the university in 1990.
 Mr. Kort was admired as a researcher and teacher and the students named him the best teacher at the university in 1964. He was a pioneer in applying mathematical techniques and the computer to political science. As a fellow at the University of Chicago Law School in 1958 to 1959, he worked with the early Univac 1 computer. He enjoyed telling how the Univac had to be shut down on Tuesdays and Fridays to change the tubes. Later, he did considerable research on how biological determinants influence political behavior. 
 Mr. Kort died July 17 in Bloomfield. He was 85.

'The Egg Lady'
 Adaline Laughlin was a pewtersmith and glass artist, but she was best known as ''the Egg Lady'' for her skill at the art of pysanky, or Ukrainian Easter egg decorating.
 Ms. Laughlin was a Connecticut Yankee descended from 17th century settlers who founded Hartford, Wethersfield and Windsor, which is why she sometimes called her creations Scots-English-Irish-Ukrainian eggs. 
 Ms. Laughlin was living in Ridgefield in 1972 when a friend taught her how to apply dyes and beeswax to drained raw eggs to create Ukrainian eggs. For the next 32 years, she passed her skills on to many others and decorated eggs that were both traditional and of her own design. One of her eggs has been an ornament on the Christmas tree in the Connecticut governor's residence and since 2001, another has represented the state on the White House tree.
 For many years, Ms. Laughlin ran a workshop for school children at the Washington School in Manchester where she and her family lived in a home that was built by her great grandfather in 1842.
 Ms. Laughlin's work in pewter hollowware and glass jewelry has been exhibited and sold nationally. As president of the Society of Connecticut Craftsmen, she organized exhibitions and shows featuring Connecticut crafts at the Old State House in Hartford and at other historic sites in the state.
 Ms. Laughlin died Oct. 25 at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford. She was 67. 

Stalwart for the Schaghticoke
 Paulette Crone-Morange of Monroe was a leader of the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation in Kent and had an important role in the tribe's 25-year campaign to obtain federal recognition.
 As the tribe's administrator and historian, Ms. Crone-Morange poured over long forgotten historical records and tribal documents to obtain recognition from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. Recognition was denied in 2002, but the decision was reversed by the agency in January. The reversal is being appealed by the state Attorney General and the town of Kent, opponents of the tribe's plan to build a casino in Bridgeport or western Connecticut.
 Ms. Crone-Morange served at various times as secretary of the Tribal Council and vice chairwoman and project coordinator for the tribe's applications for federal recognition and grants. She was also chairwoman of the state's Indian Affairs Council.
 Ms. Crone-Morange died in Bridgeport on March 23 of an aneurysm. She was 60.

Madge, the Palmolive Manicurist
 Jan Miner was an actress on the Broadway stage, in radio and in films, but she was best known as Madge, the manicurist who soaked her clients' fingers in Palmolive liquid soap in a long running series of television commercials.
 Connecticut radio listeners first knew Ms. Miner as one of the members of the ensemble Guy Hedlund Players on WTIC in the 1930's and 1940's. The troupe also included the actors Michael O'Shea and Ed Begley.
 Ms. Miner was born in Boston and came to Hartford in 1941 to play host to two women's programs, ''A Woman's Day'' and ''Woman's Point of View,'' in addition to performing with the Hedlund troupe. She also wrote commercials for the now defunct, but once prominent Hartford businesses Sage Allen department store and Honiss's Oyster House. 
 On July 6, 1944, the station assigned Ms. Miner to accompany 16 school children and their teacher to the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus, which was playing in a tent in Hartford's North End. In a 1991 interview with The Hartford Courant, she recalled leaving the performance early to prepare her broadcast. As she reached the street, the tent burst into flames. 
 The children WTIC had treated to the circus survived because one of them, a Boy Scout, used his pocket knife to slash the tent and his classmates and the teacher fled. The fire killed 169 people, including several women and children.
 After leaving WTIC, Ms. Miner was the leading lady in the network radio drama ''Boston Blackie.'' She made her Broadway debut in 1948 and appeared in many Broadway and off Broadway shows from the 1940's to the 1980's.
 But it was the Madge commercials that made Ms. Miner famous. She did the commercials in French, German, Italian and Danish and credited them with giving her the freedom to do the stage roles she preferred.
 Ms. Miner died Feb. 15 at a health care center in Bethel. She was 86.

Tuning In in the Classroom
 Eugene (Jack) Dahlby was a broadcaster and an educator who used his broadcasting skills in the classroom as a teacher of English, speech and acting.
 Mr. Dahlby's first broadcasting job was as a 21-year-old announcer at radio station WNAB in Bridgeport in 1941. He worked at the station until 1954, except for time spent as a fighter pilot in World War II. After the war, he remained in the Air Force Reserve and retired as a major.
 In 1955, Mr. Dahlby became a teacher, first at the Baker School in Darien for seven years and then at Darien High School, where he taught from 1962 to 1980. During that period, he continued to work in radio as a staff announcer at WSTC in Stamford.
 After retiring from the high school, he remained active in radio and television as a narrator and an actor in educational and industrial films and as a commercial spokesman. 
 Mr. Dahlby was a charter member and past president of the Darien Showcase Theater and appeared in many of its productions. 
 Mr. Dahlby died Dec. 3 in Clinton. He was 84. 

Adding a Window of Beauty
 Before she retired and moved to Unionville, Marion Foster lived for many years in the Charter Oak Terrace public housing development in Hartford.
 She tried to make Charter Oak Terrace a better place in which to live, and in 1969 the Hartford Housing Authority gave her its Good Citizenship Award for doing just that. 
 To her neighbors, Ms. Foster was known as ''the window box lady,'' a tribute to the window boxes of flowers she maintained at her apartment. She encouraged others to install the boxes to make the development more attractive. 
 She also founded an organization known as ''Give a Hand to a Boy,'' which sponsored educational trips and recreational activities for the boys in the neighborhood.
 Ms. Foster worked as a seamstress and raised a son and six daughters. She died April 30 at age 78.

The Best Dress, Always
 During the middle decades of the 20th century, Pratt Street in downtown Hartford was the city's center of style and elegance.
 From the 1930's to the 60's, fashionable dress shops, shoe and jewelry stores and men's clothiers lined both sides of the block between Main and Trumbull Streets. Among them was a dress shop known as ''Florence Travis'' and owned by a pair of transplanted New Yorkers, Bill Travis, and the shop's namesake, his wife, Florence.
 They were the children of retailers. Ms. Travis's father owned a successful line of boys' and girls' clothing, known as ''Sunny Lee'' and ''Sandra Lee'' and Mr. Travis was the son of a dress-shop owner. A year after their marriage in 1936, they decided to go into the family business and open a shop in Hartford that would feature the best in New York fashions.
 They were trend setters in Hartford retailing. Their store was one of the first small shops to offer charge accounts, and the Florence Travis shop helped the young women working in nearby insurance companies to buy and wear the latest New York fashions on credit by introducing one of the first layaway plans.
 Sara Greenberg, who worked for Ms. Travis for 20 years, recalled how she sold by example. ''She would wear it and everybody would want it,'' Ms. Greenberg said.
 From a small shop on Pratt Street, the couple moved to larger quarters on the same street and opened Florence Travis branches in Bloomfield, Middletown and West Hartford. Pratt Street went into decline around the time the anchor department stores in downtown Hartford began moving to the suburbs and the Pratt Street store closed in 1973, three years before Mr. Travis' death. The West Hartford shop operated until 1996.
 Ms. Travis died March 5. She was 88.

Restoring Gardens, Even Twain's
 When the restoration of Mark Twain's Hartford home was begun in the late 1950's, Mary Edwards wanted the landscaping to be as authentic as the home's furnishings.
 She researched and identified the shrubs, flowers, trees and vines that were on the grounds when the Samuel Clemens family lived in the house and searched the countryside to make certain the gardens and the contents of the house's large conservatory would reflect the proper period.
 Ms. Edwards was a Hartford native, was educated at the Oxford School, Vassar College and the Rhode Island School of Design and was a landscaper specializing in residential work. 
 She joined the Mark Twain House Board of Trustees in 1956 and served until 1978 when she became a trustee emeritus. In addition to her work on the Mark Twain grounds, she restored the gardens at other historic homes in the Hartford area, including the Webb House in Wethersfield and the Phelps-Hathaway House in Suffield. She was a member of the Hartford Garden Club and the Sow and Reap Garden Club of the South Congregational Church in Granby.
 Ms. Edwards and her mother, the late Helen Bunce Edwards, were longtime supporters of the Hartford Art School of the University of Hartford. Ms. Edwards was a trustee of the school from 1958 to 1965. 
 Ms. Edwards died Jan. 15. She was 91.

Caring for His Hometown
 Dr. William Finkelstein was known as the dean of internists and the father of medical education at St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury. 
 He served the hospital in his hometown as chief of medicine, president of the medical staff, director of medical education and cardiology.
 Born in Waterbury, Dr. Finkelstein was the valedictorian of Crosby High School's Class of 1925 and received his undergraduate and medical education at Harvard. After a residency at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, he came home to Waterbury in 1934 and practiced medicine there for the next 54 years until his retirement at the age of 80 in 1988.
 As a member of the American College of Physicians, Dr. Finkelstein always considered the mentoring of those who followed him in medicine as his first priority, according to his family. 
 For many years, he provided scholarships to help Waterbury students attend college and he recently sponsored an exchange student from Kazan Medical School in Russia to study at the Yale Primary Residency Program at St. Mary's Hospital. A research fellowship has been established in the residency program in Dr. Finkelstein's name and the hospital's medical library is also named for him.
 Dr. Finkelstein died at St. Mary's Hospital May 18. He was 95.

Understanding the World
 Marjorie Anderson was executive director of the World Affairs Council of Connecticut from 1974 until her retirement in January. The council, based in West Hartford, is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that promotes the understanding of global affairs.
 During Ms. Anderson's three decades as executive director, she established the council's executive forum, which attracted many prominent speakers to its foreign policy discussions, among them former President George H.W. Bush, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and diplomats from many nations.
 Ms. Anderson was also active in the League of Women Voters and was president of the state league from 1977 to 1979. In 1980, she ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Republican in the solidly Democratic First Congressional District and she was a member of the West Hartford Town Council in the 1980's. 
 At the World Affairs Council, Ms. Anderson directed the Model United Nations and Great Decisions programs and was responsible for administering the State Department's International Visitor program in the Hartford area.
 Born in Liverpool, England, Ms. Anderson came to the United States as an evacuee during World War II. She graduated from Hall High School in West Hartford and studied political science at the University of Brussels and the Sorbonne. 
 Ms. Anderson died Oct. 11. She was 75.

A Lover of Hartford's Arts
 Georgette Auerbach Koopman was the great granddaughter of Gerson Fox, the founder of G. Fox and Company, the downtown Hartford department store the family owned from 1845 until it was sold in 1965 by Gerson Fox's granddaughter and Ms. Koopman's mother, Beatrice Fox Auerbach. 
 Ms. Koopman was devoted to Greater Hartford's philanthropies, especially the arts. She was a longtime trustee of the Hartford Art School and the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. A two-time president of the art school board of trustees, she was the recipient of one of its rarely given honors, the Hartford Art School Medal. She was also a trustee of the Atheneum for many years and an honorary trustee at the time of her death. 
 Ms. Koopman also received the Atheneum's highest honor, the Goodwin Medal, with a citation that noted her ''clarity and decisiveness of mind and her respect for the opinions of others.''
 In addition, Ms. Koopman was on the boards of the Hebrew Home and Hospital, the Connecticut Institute for the Blind, the American School for the Deaf, the Jewish Endowment Foundation and Kingswood-Oxford School. She was a trustee on the boards of both Hartford and St. Francis Hospitals. She and her husband, the late Richard Koopman, also supported many other causes through the family's Beatrice Fox Auerbach Foundation and the Koopman Fund. 
 Ms. Koopman died April 5. She was 87.

High School Coach in 500 Club
 Only eight Connecticut high school basketball coaches have won 500 games or more in their careers, and Joe Reilly is on the list. 
 Mr. Reilly spent most of his coaching career at South Catholic High School in Hartford and won his fifth state championship there in 1991, two days before the Archdiocese of Hartford announced the school would be closed. He coached at South Catholic for 27 years and later coached at Bloomfield and Newington for seven years before retiring in 1998 with an overall record of 512 victories and 288 losses.
 Mr. Reilly's most successful season was 1970 when both his basketball team and baseball team won state championships for South Catholic. He was named coach of the year by the Connecticut High School Coaching Association in 1977 and was selected for the New England Basketball Hall of Fame's inaugural class in 2002.
 Mr. Reilly was part of a coaching family. His brother Gene, who coaches at Portland High School, is also one of the state's eight 500 game winners. In addition, two of Mr. Reilly's sons are coaches: Joe at Bates College in Maine and Luke at East Catholic High School in East Hartford. His daughter Molly Kleinhen coaches a Catholic Youth Organization team in Glastonbury.
 Mr. Reilly died Nov. 2. He was 66.

From Retail to Photography
 Isadore Berson was the founder of two well-known retail chains, the Youth Centre clothing stores and the Bradlees department stores.
 Mr. Berson was also an accomplished, self-taught photographer whose work won him many international prizes from the Photographic Society of America and similar organizations in India, Pakistan, Scotland and South Africa. His photographs have been exhibited at the Chicago Botanic Garden, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the University of Hartford and the University of Connecticut Medical Center. 
 He began his business career by opening the first Youth Centre store in Springfield, Mass., in 1937. The company grew into a 17-store chain in Connecticut and Massachusetts by the time it was sold by Mr. Berson in 1978. During the 41 years he operated the stores, Mr. Berson's wife, Marian, was the company's vice president.
 Mr. Berson founded the Bradlees chain in 1958, but sold the company five years later. Bradlees was one of the nation's first discount department stores.
 Mr. Berson died at his West Hartford home on Oct. 27. He was 93.

Aircraft Worker Who Loved Golf
 Porter Pernell came to Hartford from Selma, Ala., when he was 16. After serving in the Korean War as an investigator with a Military Police unit and being trained at the Porter School of Machine and Tool Design in Hartford, he went to work for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft in East Hartford.
 At Pratt & Whitney, Mr. Pernell became the first African-American promoted to foreman and later to superintendent. He worked for the company for 36 years.
 Mr. Pernell was also the first African-American appointed to the board of directors of the East Hartford Aircraft Federal Credit Union and was chairman of the board from 1992 to 1994. He was also a director and chairman of the scholarship committee of the Society of Carbide and Tool Engineering.
 An avid golfer, Mr. Pernell was president of the United Golfers Association for 17 years and a leader in efforts to integrate the sport he loved, according to his family. He was a member of the United Golfers Association Hall of Fame. After his retirement, he lived in Orlando, Fla. and in Bloomfield, where he had made his home for many years.
 Mr. Pernell died June 26. He was 71.

In-Laws Devoted to Winsted
 William Riiska and Joseph O'Brien had a great deal in common. They were Winsted natives, World War II veterans, brothers-in-law for more than 50 years, writers and amateur historians. But most of all, they shared a profound devotion to their home town.
 Although born just three years apart, Joe O'Brien and Bill Riiska didn't know each other growing up. ''We were from the west end and Bill came from the north end of town, and three years make a big age difference when you're young,'' said Marge O'Brien Riiska, Mr. O'Brien's sister and Mr. Riiska's wife.
 Mr. O'Brien was a chief petty officer in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II, and Mr. Riiska was in the Army and landed on Omaha Beach in France shortly after D-Day.
 They came home to northwest Connecticut after the war, married and lived there the rest of their lives. Mr. O'Brien, as a reporter with The Hartford Courant, sometimes worked on a larger stage, covering some of the state's major news stories during 34 years with the newspaper. 
 He was the first reporter to tell of a $400,000 contribution to the national Republican Party following the approval of the merger of International Telephone and Telegraph and the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. Later, his reporting resulted in the exoneration of Peter Reilly, a North Canaan teenager accused of killing his mother. When Mr. O'Brien retired from The Courant, his daughter-in-law recalled that whenever he covered an accident, Mr. O'Brien took a moment to say a prayer for the victims.
 Mr. Riiska's professional life was as an educator, for a short time in Seymour, but for most of his years at a junior high school in Norfolk and at the Regional High School in Winsted that serves students from Norfolk, Barkhamsted, Colebrook and New Hartford. 
 He was deeply involved in Winsted's civic life, serving on many of the city's boards and commissions. He was mayor for four years, city clerk for 14 and acting city manager on several occasions when Winsted found itself between city managers.
 ''He believed that you had to be in government to realize how much valuable time is given to the community by volunteers,'' Ms. Riiska said. Mr. Riiska's favorite volunteer activity was as manager of American Legion baseball teams.
 Mr. O'Brien ended his newspaper career covering his home town and Mr. Riiska retired as city clerk in 1999. Then, both men turned to writing reminiscences. Mr. Riiska wrote about his experiences as a member of a reconnaissance unit in France and Mr. O'Brien wrote about his fond recollections of life in Winsted in the 1930's and 40's for the local newspaper, The Winsted Journal. 
 Mr. O'Brien died March 4 at Charlotte Huntington Hospital in Torrington and Mr. Riiska died two weeks later, March 18, at a hospital in Providence, R.I. Mr. O'Brien was 76 and Mr. Riiska, 79.

A Deep Knowledge of Babies
 Edmund Crelin Jr. was an anatomist at the Yale School of Medicine and a leading authority on infant anatomy.
 In 1969, Dr. Crelin wrote ''Anatomy of the Newborn,'' the first atlas of human infant anatomy, and four years later, he published ''Functional Anatomy of the Newborn.'' The books are considered the foremost reference works on the subject.
 His other specialty was human vocal chords and the origin of modern speech. Dr. Crelin determined that modern speech originated between 500,000 and 1 million years ago. He wrote a book on his research, ''The Human Vocal Tract,'' in 1987.
 Dr. Crelin joined the Yale medical school faculty after receiving his Ph.D. in 1951 and lived in Branford.
 Dr. Crelin died June 21. He was 81.

A Cartoonist of Range
 Gill Fox was a comic book cartoonist, an animator and a syndicated newspaper cartoonist.
 Mr. Fox's career began in the 1930's, considered the golden age of the comic book, as the illustrator of the adventure strip ''Plastic Man.'' He was best known for his widely syndicated single panel comic, ''Side Glances,'' which ran in newspapers for more than 25 years.
 During World War II, Mr. Fox drew ''Bernie Blood'' and ''Dogface'' for Stars and Stripes, a military newspaper.
 In his later years, he was a political cartoonist for The Fairfield Citizen, and in 2003 Mr. Fox won the 2003 New England Newspaper Award for a political cartoon. 
 Mr. Fox died May 15 in Redding. He was 88.

Expert in Transportation Law
 In 1913, when Hugh M. Joseloff was 11 years old, his father and uncles opened a grocery store in Waterbury. By 1929, the brothers owned 500 Economy Stores, which merged with First National Stores, became the Finast chain and is now Stop & Shop.
 Mr. Joseloff worked in the family grocery business for two years after college and law school, but he devoted his career to the law. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale College in 1923 and was the editor of the Law Review at Yale Law School.
 Mr. Joseloff's specialty was motor carrier and transportation law and he also practiced in such regulatory areas as cable television and public utilities. He appeared before the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1936 and the United States Supreme Court in 1943. He was a prosecuting attorney and judge in the West Hartford town court and a member of Hartford's Draft Board for more than 25 years. An original incorporating attorney of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, Mr. Joseloff served two, four-year terms as a member of the state's Transportation Authority.
 Mr. Joseloff died April 29. He was 102.

A Renaissance Man
 William Koneazny was a chef, a radio host, a critic, a saloon keeper, a veteran of two armed forces in two wars, an author of two cookbooks and two books on the Roman Catholic Church. 
 He and his brother, Jack, founded the Peerless Tree Expert Company in 1945, and he was among the first to be licensed as an arborist by the state of Connecticut.
 Beginning in 1947, Mr. Koneazny was a host on the radio talk show, the ''Bill Wicky Hour,'' on a station in Torrington, and he ran a tavern, the Pearly Gates Saloon in Sheffield, Mass., just over the state line. Mr. Koneazny was employed as a restaurant reviewer by two newspapers, The Lakeville Journal and The Connecticut Western Newspaper.
 Mr. Koneazny, a Hartford native, graduated from Weaver High School in 1944 and saw service in the Merchant Marine in World War II and in the Army in the Korean War.
 Mr. Koneazny died June 16. He was 77.

Growing Food for the Hungry
 William Liddell was named one of President George H.W. Bush's ''thousand points of light'' for his volunteer efforts in the 1980's and 90's at the Connecticut Food Bank, which also established an award in his name.
 Farming an acre of land with the help of friends, Mr. Liddell was able to grow more than 30,000 pounds of food annually. He spent 35 years as a horticulturalist with a seed company. 
 From 1956 to 1973, he was a member of the Hamden Board of Education and is remembered for his successful battle against a campaign by some parents to ban J.D. Salinger's ''Catcher in the Rye'' from a high school reading list.
 Mr. Liddell grew up in Massachusetts, graduated from Haverford College in 1941 and served in World War II as an Army cryptologist in Brazil and Italy. He came to Connecticut to earn a Ph.D. in history at Yale in 1953 and lived in the New Haven area for the next five decades. 
 Mr. Liddell died April 26 in Wallingford. He was 84.

Mr. Mayor of Middletown
 Sebastian Garafalo, a Republican, was elected mayor of Middletown, usually a Democratic city, four times. According to his deputy mayor, Stephen Gionfriddo, it didn't matter what party he represented because Mr. Garafalo owed his success to his way with people. He was known as a politician who would argue fiercely at council meetings and then go out for a beer with his allies and opponents.
 Anthony Marino, a Democrat who defeated Mr. Garafalo in 1977 in a close, hard-fought election, said he and Mr. Garafalo were lifelong friends whose grandfathers grew up on the same Middletown street. 
 Mr. Garafalo's public service spanned 31 years, serving the city as a councilman and tax collector as well as mayor. 
 Mr. Garafalo died Jan. 21. He was 71.

HEADLINE: Investors Give Markets a Pre-Christmas Rally

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market rose in four days of trading last week, as both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed on Thursday at their highest points in the last three years.
 The Commerce Department reported Thursday that personal incomes rose 0.3 percent last month, more than anticipated by many economists, and the University of Michigan said that its index of consumer confidence jumped to an 11-month high in December. 
 These signs of economic buoyancy, as well as a drop in oil prices, contributed to optimism in the stock market, as many investors sought to lock in year-end gains.
 Markets in the United States and in many other Western countries were closed on Friday in observance of the Christmas holiday. By the end of the trading week on Thursday, the Dow had gained 177.20 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 10,827.12. The S.& P. 500 climbed 15.93 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 1,210.13. The Nasdaq composite index rose 25.42 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 2,160.62.
 In the bond market, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell slightly, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.22 percent from 4.20 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Big Farms Reap 2 Harvests With Aid as Bumper Crop

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: GURLEY, Neb. 

 BODY:
The roadside sign welcoming people into this state reads: ''Nebraska, the Good Life.'' And for farmers closing out their books at the end of a year when they earned more money than at any time in the history of American agriculture, it certainly looks like happy days.
 But at a time when big harvests and record farm income should mean that Champagne corks are popping across the prairie, the prosperity has brought with it the kind of nervousness seen in headlines like the one that ran in The Omaha World-Herald early this month: ''Income boom has farmers on edge.''
 Despite the fact that farm income has doubled in two years, federal farm subsidies have gone up nearly 40 percent over the same period -- projected at $15.7 billion this year, and $130 billion over the last nine years. And that bounty is drawing fire from people who say that at this moment of farm prosperity, the nation's subsidy system has never made less sense. 
 Even those deeply steeped in the system acknowledge that it seems counterintuitive. ''I struggle with the same question: how the hell can you have such high government payments if farmers had such a great year?'' said Keith Collins, the chief economist for the Agriculture Department.
 The answer lies in the quirks of the federal farm subsidy system as well as in the way savvy farmers sell their crops. Mr. Collins said farmers use the peculiar world of agriculture market timing to get both high commodity prices and high subsidies. 
 ''The biggest reason is with record crops, prices have fallen,'' he said. ''And farmers are taking advantage of that.''
 A farmer can sell his crop early at a high price, say, in a futures contract, and still collect a subsidy check after the harvest if prices are down over all. The money is not tied to what the farmer actually received for his crop. The farmer does not even have to sell the crop to get the check, only prove that the market has dropped below a set rate.
 ''For those who can milk the system, it's been a great year,'' said Kent Miller, whose German great-grandparents were pioneers near this tiny town. Mr. Miller operates a small farm and says he barely made a profit this year on his 3,000 acres of wheat and millet.
 Still, while Mr. Miller is a critic of the system, he is not forgoing aid. Here in Cheyenne County, in the wind-raked western edge of Nebraska, the fields are slumbering for the winter. Most of the harvest is in. Mr. Miller was one of the farmers going into the federal agricultural office to register for new checks after recent swings in the market.
 ''I just signed up for new government payments today,'' Mr. Miller said, standing inside the federal agriculture office for this county. He described the subsidies as little help for ailing family farmers. ''It's a Band-Aid on a large wound.''
 Farm groups say the subsidies provide for a stable food supply, and ensure that major sectors of American agriculture will be competitive on the global market.
 ''When people ask me what the justification for this is, I point out that in nearly every country in the world, you find government involved in the food supply,'' said Bob Young, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the powerful trade group for major agricultural producers.
 But because nearly 70 percent of the subsidies go to the top 10 percent of agricultural producers, the recent prosperity is not seen or felt among many small to medium-size growers who keep the struggling counties of the Great Plains alive.
 Though some retailers in places like Iowa and Kansas say the boost in farm income promises a good Christmas season, merchants here say they are not experiencing any gains. All around western Nebraska, in places like Chappell or Lorenzo, storefronts are boarded and the merchants who remain complain of the difficulties of surviving.
 Even though Cheyenne County is one of the few bright spots in the economic desert of the rural Plains, its recent job boom has nothing to do with agriculture. A major outdoor goods company, Cabela's, has its world headquarters in Sidney, and its giant retail store is a draw off Interstate 80.
 ''It's been real slow, and usually December is a good month for us,'' said Brian Thacker, who sells new trucks and cars in Sidney, the biggest town in the county. But he said farmers complain about not having enough money even in good years.
 ''If it's raining, they complain; if the wind is blowing too much, they complain,'' Mr. Thacker said. ''It just seems like they're never happy.''
 Ed Miller, who owns a family feed and seed store in Sidney that caters to small farmers, said his business was not up despite the increase in farm income, because most of the big corporate farms that are doing particularly well do not buy from the local seed dealers.
 So it is not surprising that the current subsidy system is drawing home-grown criticism from people like Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, who says it is only widening the gap between larger and smaller farmers, while not helping rural America.
 The subsidies have also drawn criticism from farmers who grow fruits, vegetables and nuts -- nearly half of American agriculture -- but have nothing like the elaborate safety net in place for corn, cattle, wheat and hog producers.
 ''We don't get payments, and we don't want them,'' said Tom Nassif, president of the Western Growers Association, which represents farmers in the nation's biggest agricultural state, California. ''We believe the marketplace should decide who stays and who goes. And we certainly shouldn't be paying people not to grow.''
 Farm production has doubled over the last 50 years, while the number of farms has fallen by two-thirds. Economists say about 150,000 of America's 2.1 million farms produce 70 percent of the major food crops. But only certain crops -- wheat, corn, cotton, soybeans and sunflowers among them -- qualify for subsidies.
 Every subsidy payment in the country can be found on a Web site put together by the Environmental Working Group, which advocates an overhaul of the farm payment system. The site has become a must-read for farmers, and receives about a million hits a day, the group says.
 According to those records, which are supplied by the Agriculture Department, Mr. Kent Miller, the wheat and millet farmer, received $18,449 in subsidies last year, and a total of $189,254 over the last nine years.
 His neighbor down the road, a wheat farmer named Ronald Jessen, was paid $424,387 over the last nine years, according to the database. Mr. Jessen's father, Raymond, got $485,096 in government money, and his brother, Michael Jessen, got $356,769. They are among the 10 biggest recipients of wheat subsidies in Cheyenne County, which is the state's top wheat county.
 Over all, Nebraska got $7.5 billion in government farm payments over the last nine years.
 The Jessen family wheat farm, despite getting more than $1.2 million in subsidies in that time, is not a gold mine, Ronald Jessen said in an interview. ''You've got to look at all the expenses,'' he said. ''A new combine can cost $200,000. When I do my taxes, the crop breaks even. My profit is what I get from the government.'' 
 Still, Mr. Jessen said he was not proud to be harvesting so much from taxpayers.
 ''Most farmers will tell you they would rather get paid for what's in the elevator rather than from the government,'' he said.
 Other farmers and some critics say that corporations, extended families and partnerships are taking advantage of a system that has little relationship to the ebbs and flows of food supply, and rewards them most in times like now, when farmers should seemingly be able to get by without government help.
 ''It's shocking the extent to which taxpayers subsidize this select group of people whether they're having a good year or bad,'' said Ken Cook, director of the Environmental Working Group. ''I call them the red ink states.''
 Any farm entity -- often a corporation -- can collect up to $360,000 per year. Some of the biggest payments are to farmers who can show a ''historic pattern'' of having grown one of the big commodity crops. In a system that supporters say is intended to ensure economic stability from year to year, farmers do not actually have to grow the crop to get the money. For other payments, a farmer is required to show involvement in helping to run or manage the operation.
 Mr. Kent Miller, who is struggling to run his family farm on his own, says big farms will line their subsidy payroll with family members who have minimal involvement.
 ''Typically, you get 10 relatives who all get the payments, but maybe for 6 of them, the only time they come out to the farm is for Christmas,'' Mr. Miller said.
 While the big farms are having record years, much of rural America is continuing to decline.
 Senator Hagel voted against the 2002 farm bill that is the framework for the current subsidy system. At the time, he said, ''these lopsided payments encourage and subsidize overproduction'' and would ''only widen the disparity gaps between large and small farmers.''
 In a hearing last August, Mr. Hagel said the Great Plains states were in a continued downward spiral, even with record farm income.
 ''Half the rural counties in America lost population in the 2000 census,'' Senator Hagel said in the hearing. ''And three out of four rural counties experienced below-average economic growth, despite the record level of farm subsidies.''
 The highest year for subsidies was 2000, when farmers received $22 billion in payments. Their income was only $47 billion that year. This year, with farm income at $73 billion, is the first year when farmers set a record for earnings, while subsidies were still among the highest in recent years.
 This record year raises the question of what would happen to American agriculture if the government stopped making such large payments. Mr. Collins, the chief economist at the Agriculture Department, said it was possible that farmers would produce the same amount of food in a pure free market.
 Some farmers say they could go cold turkey and make it on their own. Others say they would go under. But the thing many agree on is that working the land, even in good times, is not something they would recommend to their children. 
 ''Out here, the joke is that anyone who tries to get their kid to go into farming is encouraging a form of child abuse,'' Mr. Kent Miller said.

HEADLINE: Before Slicing, Make Sure That the Pie Is Big

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DECIDING how much of your money to put into stocks (versus bonds) is often said to be the single most important choice you'll make as an investor. Financial planners and investment experts have spent the better part of the last decade drilling that pearl of wisdom into our heads. But it isn't really true. 
 While allocating assets is certainly more important than stock picking in explaining long-term returns, there is an even more crucial question to answer: How much money should you be investing in the first place? 
 ''Yes, asset allocation is important, but it's not nearly as important as getting money into the market,'' said Patti Brennan, president of Key Financial, a financial planning firm in West Chester, Pa. ''Good savers will be good investors every single time.''
 A study by T.Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, seems to confirm this. Using what are known as Monte Carlo simulations -- computer models that help to predict the probability of achieving a goal -- the company set out to answer a rather complex question: What percentage of preretirement income will our nest eggs be able to produce, safely, based on various rates of savings and different assumptions about asset allocation?
 Here's what the research found: Say you're in your 30's with 30 years to go before retiring. Assume that you've already saved a year's worth of your current pretax salary. (In other words, if you make $100,000 a year, you've banked that amount.) Say you plan to invest conservatively during your working years, with 40 percent of your holdings in stocks and 60 percent in bonds. Then assume that you will downshift even more during retirement, to 20 percent stocks and 80 percent bonds. 
 According to the simulation, there is a very good probability -- 80 percent, to be exact -- that you would be able to replace 41 percent of your preretirement income once you left the work force. That assumes you're able to save and invest 15 percent of your salary annually during your working years. This figure includes all sources of savings, including your 401(k) money, 401(k) matches from your employer and profit sharing.
 Now say you decided to become more aggressive, putting 60 percent of your money in stocks and 40 percent in bonds during your career and then moving to 40 percent stocks, 60 percent bonds in retirement. Although you are now taking on considerably more risk, the study by T.Rowe Price says this strategy is highly likely to let you replace 43 percent of your income in retirement -- a difference of just two percentage points.
 On the other hand, if you increased your annual savings rate modestly, to 20 percent from 15 percent, you'd be able to replace 52 percent of your income -- and that's under the original, conservative asset allocation strategy that emphasized bonds. 
 The results tell us a couple of things. First, investing more money will give you more bang for your buck than investing a smaller pot of money more aggressively. It's just the nature of investing. Moreover, you will have to save a large percentage of your salary -- probably far more than most households assume -- if you hope to replace most of your income in retirement.
 Even if you saved 25 percent of pretax income a year starting in your 30's, there's a very good chance you would be able to replace only 65 percent of income. And that's if you had already banked a year's worth of salary and invested 60 percent of the money in stocks and 40 percent in bonds during your working years.
 If you've managed to bank three times your annual salary by your 30's, you could replace 87 percent of income, based on the same assumptions. ''The reason for that is compound interest,'' said Rande Spiegelman, vice president for financial planning at the Schwab Center for Investment Research. ''Every dollar you've already saved will have a big impact on your future returns.''
 The Schwab research center did its own study of how much investors should be saving, based on traditional assumptions like an 8 percent annual rate of return and 2.5 percent annual inflation. Its conclusion was that people in their 20's should be saving 10 to 15 percent of their salary each year, while people in their 30's who have nothing in the bank should start saving 15 to 25 percent. And those in their early 40's who previously neglected to save would need to set aside 25 to 35 percent. 
 SOME investors may look at these numbers and throw up their hands. ''It can make people feel like it's a hopeless proposition,'' said Lori Lucas, director of 401(k) participant research at Hewitt Associates. But Ms. Lucas said Hewitt's own research concluded that ''if you save a couple percent more a year and are willing to retire a couple years later, that can have a major positive impact on your results.'' 
 All of these studies seem to point to another truth: investors should look everywhere for that incremental 2 percent. If you're not maximizing 401(k) contributions, you should. And if your company offers matching 401(k) money, you may be able to raise your contribution by less than 2 percent to achieve the additional savings.
 Failing to take these steps, particularly at an early age, may mean the difference between living comfortably in retirement and having to work a few more years, said Christine Fahlund, a senior financial planner at T.Rowe Price, who ran the probability studies. That is why it's important to ''moderate your lifestyle as early in life as you can,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Everything's Up to Date in Korea's Ancient Capital

BYLINE: By ANDREW YANG

 BODY:

Why Go Now
 Because Seoul is the new Tokyo. With Seoul's proximity to Beijing and Tokyo (both less than two hours away by air), this city of about 10 million is becoming the focal point of transportation and business in northern Asia. Think of it as a capital with the culture and excitement of Tokyo, but less hectic and easier on the pocketbook. It was host to the 1988 Summer Olympics, and is becoming more international and cosmopolitan. 
 The commercial conglomerates of Seoul, like Samsung and SK Telecom, have kept the city enriched with a healthy diet of skyscrapers and world-class cultural institutions. As the country's economy has stabilized since the late 1990's, design-centered museums, art galleries, restaurants, bars and boutique hotels are thriving. 
 A quick flip through the Korean versions of GQ and Teen Vogue in any of the scores of Starbucks stores or a stroll down Cheongdam-dong past the fashion boutiques quickly reveal that Seoul is poised for a hipper future. Any of the fashionable enclaves such as Apgujeong, Cheongdam or Itaewon could easily be mistaken for West Hollywood, or the Harajuku, and young Koreans are likely to know as much about Britney Spears as they do about Korean politics. 

Where to Stay
 The 1 W Seoul-Walkerhill, this hotel chain's first outpost in Asia, opened last September. Perched atop Mount Acha, right on the bank of the Han River (21 Gwangjang-dong, Gwangjin-gu, (82-2) 2465 2222, or on the Web at www.wseoul.com) the W offers a most stunning and seductive view of the city. With floor-to-ceiling windows, the remote-controlled electric curtains automatically open in the morning to reveal the river and the rest of the city skyline, almost within arm's reach. The hotel offers two restaurants as well as a spa, gym and a third-floor pool that is situated with a city view and feels like an extension of the river. Doubles, $308, at 1,084 won to the United States dollar. 
 The 2Shilla Seoul, 202 Jangchung-dong 2-ga, Jung-gu, (82-2) 2233 3131 or on the Web at seoul.shilla.net, is a luxurious 507-room hotel with a more traditional Korean decor. Doubles, $275 and up. 
 For a location across the Han River, closer to the newer parts of the city, the 3Coex Intercontinental, 159 Samsung-dong Kangnam-ku, seoul-coex.intercontinental.com, (82-2) 3452 2500 is a modern hotel near the Coex convention center and mall, Korea's largest. Doubles, about $325.

Where to Eat
 As you might expect, kimchi, that spicy fermented cabbage, is ubiquitous in Seoul restaurants. It is an option for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and will often be served regardless, depending on where you eat. Other popular Korean food includes bulgogi, marinated barbequed beef and galbi, marinated ribs, which are cooked on a heated pot at the dinner table. 
 For the most authentic Korean cuisine, try 4Jihwaja, San 14-67, Jangchung-dong 2-ga, Jung-gu, (82-1) 2 2269 5834, located within the National Theater of Korea. The main dish is gujeolpan, a nine-sectioned plate of food that can be mixed in a rice or wheat wrap. Multicourse dinners $25cost to $100 a person. 
 For more adventurous fare, 5Cafe 74, 83-20, Cheongdam-dong, (82-2) 542 7412, serves an Italian-Eastern fusion cuisine. Italian food is to Koreans what Chinese food is to New Yorkers. While a smattering of fusion cuisines exists in Seoul, such as kimchi-flavored risotto (a harrowing experience), Cafe 74 is quite a reliable way to experience the Korean version of Italian food. Dinners cost between $22 and $32 a person. 
 The crowds are flocking to 6Mr. Chow, 91-6, Nonhuyn-dong, Gangnam-gu, (82-2) 517 2100, the first Asian outpost of the chain that currently has locations in New York, Los Angeles and London. While it's hard to get a table without calling well in advance -- the restaurant has been so crowded that it has been known to take reservations just to have a drink at the bar -- the couches of the dark, cozy bar make an ideal place for a nightcap. Dinners cost around $35 to $120 a person. 

What to Do During the Day
 A popular place for antiques and historic shops is Insadong, an arts district north of downtown. A thoroughly modern arts center, the 7Insa Arts Alley, opened a new building this month, across the street from the Insa Art Center, (82-2) 736 1020. With a Guggenheim-like spiral network but set around an open courtyard, the new building shows the work of young, experimental Korean artists, and is a design collaboration between Gabriel Kroiz, an American architect, and Moongyu Choi, a Korean architect. 
 For a spectacular view of the city, go to the gleaming, 1,200-foot-tall 8Seoul Tower, Namdaemun-ro 1-ga, Jung-gu, (82-2) 775 6222, in Namsan Park. Also near Namsan Park is a recent addition to city's cultural landscape, 9Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, 747-18, Hannam-dong, Yongsan-gu, or www.leeum.org, which opened in October with a campus of three buildings each designed by a different architect. Rem Koolhaas, Jean Nouvel and Mario Botta created a stunning assemblage of drastically different designs. The museum shows the Samsung Cultural Foundation's top-notch contemporary and traditional art collection. The museum is free to the public but is open by appointment only. Located in a densely populated residential neighborhood on Yongsan Mountain, it is difficult to find, even for experienced cabdrivers, so be sure to note that it is near the Grand Hyatt. 

What to Do at Night
 Our best source of intelligence came from the bartender at 1Woobar, (82-2) 2022 0022, a multilevel lounge complete with silver-pod D.J. booth and private cabanas on the ground floor of W Seoul-Walkerhill (see above). During the day, the main boulevards in Cheongdam-dong are the fashionable places to shop, she explained, but at night, the locals come out to enjoy themselves there. Some of the best bars and clubs in Seoul are off Cheongdam-dong. Jazz clubs are the rage in Seoul, and one of the less kitschy venues is 10Hwa Su Mok, 125-24 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, (82-2) 548 5429, which means Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or fire, water and wood, in Korean. The jazz is superb, and the crowds tend to be more low-key. 
 Itaewon, a neighborhood in the center of the city north of the river, is where you will find 11Areno, 395, 5-ga, Namdaemun-ro, Chung-gu, (82-2) 317 3244, a popular dance club inside the Millennium Seoul Hilton. Nearby, inside the Hamilton Hotel, you'll find 12 Limenight, 119-25, Itaewon-dong, Yongsan-gu, (82-2) 790 0588, a big 1980's-style club where international bankers and local hipsters mix, as well as 13J Bar, a quieter and more funky bar and lounge in an alley adjacent to the hotel.

Where to Shop
 UN Studio, a Dutch architectural firm, recently outfitted the 14Galleria department store, 494, Apgujeong-dong, Gangnam-gu, (82-2) 3449 4114, or www.galleria.co.kr, with a massive new facade with 4,300 white discs. At night, it is easily the most luminous sight in Apgujeong, as it flashes images and patterns in a multitude of colors for the store, which carries such brands as Christian Dior and Chanel. 
 From the Galleria, Apgujeong-dong runs south until it intersects Cheongdam, where Western luxury retailers have their boutiques. Farther down, visitors will find Boon the Shop, a popular Korean retailer. The first Boon opened three years ago as a single-level retail space designed by the New York architectural firm of LOT/EK. In August, the store opened a four-story shop, 151F Boon the Shop Building, Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, (82-2) 317 0397, that immerses shoppers in the store's stock of Burberry Prorsum and Commes des Garcons. 
 One of the city's most talked-about shops, 16Mue, 93-6 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, (82-2) 3446 8074, occupies an exquisite three-level space that, along with its smattering of Martin Margiela and Viktor & Rolf's clothes, includes fashion-architectural theatrics by the designer Minsuk Cho such as translucent concrete walls and 20-foot-high multimedia projections.

How to Stay Wired
 Cheap Internet cafes can be found scattered around the city. Most charge about $1 an hour. Free Internet access can be found within the Seoul Information Center, 31 Daepyungno 1-ga, Jung-gu, (82-2) 731-6337, located on the second floor of 17 Seoul City Hall.

Your First Time or Your 10th
 Slightly north of downtown is 18Gyeongbokgung, end of Sejong-ro, (82-2) 732 1931, the main palace during the Chosun Dynasty (1392-1910) in Seoul. Visitors who come from the Gwanghwamun subway station can instantly see down Sejong-ro to the majestic gates of the palace, which are framed by the Bukaksan Mountains. 
 The grounds are expansive, and include historic Korean, pagodalike structures as well as the 19 National Folklore Museum, 1-1, Sejongno, Jongno-gu, (82-2) 720 3137. But when one stands at the palace gates, the juxtaposition is jarring: In the foreground is 500 years of Korean history, and glittering in the background is the rest of Seoul, with its ultramodern skyscrapers arrayed across the horizon. 

How to Get There
 In 2002, the city opened Inchon International Airport on an island about an hour west of the city, leaving the city's other airport, Gimpo, to handle domestic flights. Inchon acts as a major hub for a number of airlines such as United and Korean. 
 During peak seasons, fares to Seoul from New York can be as much as $1,300. The best time to travel is in March and April, and in September and November. The city experiences the mildest temperatures in those months, and the fares are around $900. United, Northwest and Korean Airlines all offer direct flights from Kennedy Airport in New York to Tokyo, which take approximately 13 hours, and then another two-hour jump to Seoul. Less direct flights can take up to 25 hours or more. 

How to Get Around
 Traffic is notoriously bad in Seoul, particularly in rush hour, so use the city's subway systems, which are clean and cost around 85 cents a trip (5:30 a.m. to midnight, and until 1 a.m. on weekends).

HEADLINE: Regrets? They Have a Few.

BYLINE: By JESSE GREEN

 BODY:

MARIO CANTONE
 After appearing in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of ''Assassins,'' Mr. Cantone brought his take-no-prisoners one-man show ''Laugh Whore'' to Broadway's Cort Theater. The show is scheduled to close on Jan. 2, but was taped for future broadcast on Showtime.
 ''I would have worked out a better contract, because it's kind of pitiful what I'm making. I'm a bad businessman. And though I love the Cort, the star dressing room is for Barbie. It's like, 'Hi, where's Ken and Skipper?' It's so small, and visitors have no place to go. And why did I insist on a two-act thing with an intermission instead of just making it 90 minutes? To get through it, you really have to live like a nun. I can't drink, I can't smoke. I'm not even supposed to talk, which is hard for me. At this point I'm like, Jesus Christ, just give me a drink.''

SARAH JONES
 Ms. Jones wrote ''Bridge and Tunnel,'' a play that consisted of her startling impersonations of 14 would-be poets at an immigrant poetry slam. A hit of the Off Broadway season, ''Bridge and Tunnel'' closed in mid-August but is scheduled to open on Broadway in April. 
 ''I should have kept it going through the Republican convention. It's a show about immigrants, after all. I would have invited Arnold Schwarzenegger to be one of the poets.''

TONY KUSHNER
 ''Caroline, or Change,'' with words by Mr. Kushner and music by Jeanine Tesori, sold out its run at the Public Theater but closed after four months on Broadway. Also in 2004, HBO's ''Angels in America'' won seven Emmy Awards, including one for Mr. Kushner's script. 
 ''We got 'Caroline' to Broadway and 120,000 people saw it and we got the CD made, and the show's doing well in Los Angeles. Broadway economics is a disaster -- Off Broadway not much better -- but I wouldn't change anything I did in 2004, at least not professionally. I shouldn't have let the stress of getting 'Caroline' to Broadway make me gain 20 pounds, knowing that I might well have to be on national TV for the Emmy Awards. But thanks to Weight Watchers I've now lost 26 pounds.''

BARRY HUMPHRIES
 An Australian actor who has appeared in many reputable plays and movies, Mr. Humphries is best known here as the mauve-haired ''gigastar'' Dame Edna Everage. He returned to Broadway this year in ''Dame Edna: Back With a Vengeance!,'' now playing at the Music Box. 
 ''I regret Dame Edna's insistence on dominating the entire show and not allowing me a look in. One day I'd quite like to do in New York one of the shows I do in England and Australia, where I normally play six or seven other characters, including Sir Les Patterson, an Australian diplomat who is given to habits of intemperance and is rather well endowed, as ladies whose eyes stray to his powder-blue trousers can attest. But Dame Edna won't let me. She further accuses me of embezzlement.''

DAME EDNA EVERAGE
 According to her biography, Dame Edna is ''probably the most popular and gifted woman in the world today.'' She also has a mighty arm, hefting hundreds of her signature gladioli into the audience during each performance's finale.
 ''One thing I would change is my producer, Barry Humphries, who took up with me years ago and had me sign something that turned out to be binding in perpetuity. Like all producers, he thinks he's an artist; I just smile and ignore him. There is also a problem with my show that has been happening with increasing and spooky regularity. When I pick subjects from the audience for my empowerment and finally summon them onto the stage, very often they say, 'You picked me before.' A very distinguished banker was onstage the other night and I had him dress up as my son, Ricky, in leather and spikes. He whispered to me, 'I was the Queen Mother last time.' And I hate to say it, because they are my signature, but the gladdies cost a fortune, even for a rich woman like I! I'm throwing thousands of dollars into the audience every night. If I could have it to do over, I would change from gladioli to some other flower, something more readily available in the depth of winter. I've thought of cacti. Or thistles. Or nettles.''

BERNADETTE PETERS
 After 33 previews and 451 regular performances, the Broadway revival of ''Gypsy'' starring Ms. Peters as Rose closed in May. 
 ''It was exhausting, but I wish we had kept doing the show. We could have gone deeper.''

LARRY KRAMER
 The Worth Street Theater's revival of ''The Normal Heart'' -- Mr. Kramer's 1985 play about the beginning of the AIDS crisis -- opened in April. Despite strong reviews, talk of a Broadway transfer and full houses (heavily ''papered'' with freebies), it closed after Joanna Gleason unexpectedly left to join rehearsals for the musical ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' 
 ''I sensed going in that the original director wasn't going to work out but I was too anxious to get the play on and said nothing. The actors were exceedingly unhappy, and he had to be replaced. Another big problem was money. I was assured there was enough in place when we started -- $400,000 or something -- to get us through the production. It wasn't true, and I should have gotten more assurances on that matter. Now I'm told that happens all the time, but I was naive. That in the end killed us, because they didn't have money to advertise. And then Joanna left suddenly. We didn't have an understudy so we went dark for two weeks while Lisa Kron learned the part, and she went in very fast, but it was too late. The momentum was gone. Even though the houses were always full, and there were always people in standing room! But it turned out the play was heavily papered, and I didn't know. I should have checked on that early. It breaks my heart. I have plenty of plays left in me, but what's the point? I will never write another play.'' JESSE GREEN

HEADLINE: Cuba Counters Prostitution With AIDS Programs

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: HAVANA 

 BODY:
Like many prostitutes who ply their trade in the darkened bars and discos near tourist hotels here, Maria says she does not go out every night. But whenever money gets tight and her 12-year-old son is hungry, she puts on a red miniskirt, puts rouge on her lips and heads for El Conejito bar, a thinly disguised rendezvous point.
 ''Most of the tourists come to look for girls, tobacco, you know, the things they cannot get in their country,'' she said. ''They say the Cuban girls are very hot.''
 Maria, who is 36 and insisted that her last name not be published, said she worried about contracting AIDS and forced her clients to use condoms, every time. She is knowledgeable about the disease, having learned about it through the government's anti-AIDS program, and she was tested twice during a stint in jail last year for prostitution. Since then, she said, she voluntarily gets tested regularly at the free health clinics. 
 A decade after an economic collapse forced thousands of young women and men into prostitution, Cuba has become something of an anomaly in Latin America: a destination for sex tourists where AIDS has yet to become an uncontrollable pandemic. 
 Cuba has the lowest infection rate in the Western Hemisphere, less than 0.1 percent of the population, according to the World Health Organization. The infection rate in the United States is six times that in Cuba, and Cuba's rate is far below that in many neighboring countries in the Caribbean and Central America. 
 That is not to say the disease is not spreading in Cuba, and some outside the government say a thriving sex industry has contributed to its spread. On July 3, 1998, the Cuban government said 1,980 people had tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS since 1986. Since 1998, 3,879 more have been discovered to have the virus, according to statistics released by health officials; in just six years, the number of newer cases has nearly doubled. 
 ''I think the epidemic has kept growing,'' said the Rev. Fernando de la Vega, a Roman Catholic priest at the Iglesia Montserrat, who runs a program for people with AIDS at the Iglesia Montserrat in Old Havana. ''We have to face facts. There is a portion of tourists, mostly Europeans, who come to Cuba for a good time, and a good time includes sexual activity.''
 Cuban health officials acknowledge that the number of infections has increased, as in most countries, but they say the overall rate is very low for a population of 11 million. 
 ''Prostitution is not an aggravating problem in the epidemic,'' said Dr. Rigoberto Lopez, the director of the National Center for the Care of Persons with HIV-AIDS, adding that only a handful of the 280 patients he cares for at the main sanitarium for AIDS patients in Havana, known as Los Cocos, are former sex workers. 
 For more than a decade, the government has run an intense public-education campaign in schools and on state-owned television and radio stations, promoting the use of condoms and informing people about how H.I.V., the human immunodeficiency virus, is transmitted. The system of free primary care clinics in Cuba, a Communist country, has also led to the early detection of the virus in many people, Cuban and United Nations officials say.
 In the early 1990's, Cuba quarantined people with the virus, and those discovered to be infected are still required to stay three to six months in one of Cuba's 13 government AIDS sanitariums, where they receive treatment and counseling on how to survive with the virus and how to avoid passing it along. Once they leave the hospitals, the patients are closely monitored in their homes by social workers, officials say. 
 A decades-old United States embargo on selling Cuba many medical supplies has crimped the country's ability to provide drugs to patients, but the government has replicated some advanced retroviral medicines used to fight AIDS, providing them at no cost. This, too, has slowed the epidemic.
 United Nations officials who track AIDS say Cuba has done a better job than most countries at corralling the disease. ''Certainly there has been an increase in AIDS, but it is not big, not like you see in the Dominican Republic, or Haiti, or in Puerto Rico,'' said Paloma Cuchi, who oversees the United Nations AIDS program in Latin America. ''They have a very good medical infrastructure, and people have access to care and prevention.'' 
 The low levels of the virus in Cuba and the inexpensive price of sex compared with other places have made the island a destination for male tourists seeking women. 
 In Havana, the sex trade becomes obvious after sunset. Around 10 p.m., young women in skimpy attire begin gathering outside the main tourist hotels, asking men if they would like to go to nightclubs, where a sex-for-cash proposition is usually made.
 Sex workers, known as jinateras, seeking tourist clients can also be seen outside certain discos and bars, or hitchhiking along the Malecon, the main highway separating Havana from the sea, to proposition tourists.
 In interviews, several jinateras said the brutal economic conditions in Cuba under an American embargo, where monthly state salaries do not buy enough food for a month, had pushed them into the business. 
 Most work for themselves, and on most days, they say, they can count on $50 to $75 from Europeans, plus meals, drinks and gifts.
 The government periodically cracks down on prostitution, they said. Undercover police officers work the streets and clubs, looking for prostitutes. An arrest can mean a two-year prison term.
 But some women said they kept relationships with pimps, or chulos, to pay off the police. These men lurk outside hotels and guide tourists to bars where the women wait. One recent night, a chulo was working the fringes of the Melia Cohiba, a hotel, trying to persuade men to go to the Copa Room, a nearby disco in the Riviera Hotel.
 ''If you see a girl you like inside, you tell me and she can come to your room,'' said the man, who gave his name only as Carlos. ''The hotels usually do not allow the jinateras upstairs,'' he added, winking. ''But everything is possible with money.''
 For the most part, the women who work as prostitutes say they are looking to link up with someone who can take them out of Cuba, or provide them with a steady income. Many are part-time prostitutes, who go out only when their meager state salaries run out.
 Hermita, 28, a secretary at a school who earns about $8 a month, was trolling for tourists near the Hotel Inglaterra in Old Havana on a recent evening. She has a 2-year-old daughter from a marriage that did not last, and she said she needed money for food, clothing and shoes. 
 ''When I am with a foreigner, I try to be with them for the whole time they are here,'' she explained. ''Above all it's about the money.'' Ideally, however, she would ''meet a foreigner, marry him and be able to travel, without having to leave the country forever.'' 
 Outside Jardinas 1830, an outdoor disco on the Malecon also known as a place to pick up jinateras, Maria A. and her sister, Yamilet, two young women from Camaguey Province, were showing off their legs and midriffs to tourists who approached the club, hoping someone would invite them in for a drink or take them to a rooming house for the night.
 Maria A., 23, said she gave up working as a hairdresser and started sleeping with tourists two years ago. She said she came close to striking it rich when an Italian tourist several years older than she had agreed to pay for an apartment for her. But they quarreled on a subsequent visit, she said, and now she is on the hunt again. In the meantime, she collects $40 to $70 a night from any tourist she can lure to a rooming house with which she has a mutually beneficial arrangement.
 ''Nobody does this because they like it,'' she said, drawing on a cigarette. ''I would marry someone to get out.''
 Asked about AIDS, Maria shrugged. ''We take care of ourselves, protect ourselves, use condoms,'' she said. ''I get a test from the doctor every six months.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about prostitution in Cuba misspelled a Cuban term for a prostitute. It is jinetera, not jinatera.

HEADLINE: Cuba Meets Peru, Over a Melting Pot

BYLINE: By Louise Kramer. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE restaurant business is famous for flops. More than two thirds of all restaurants either close or change hands within the first five years, and some even fail to make it to their first anniversary, according to the New York City chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association.
 Nevertheless, there is a seemingly limitless supply of would-be restaurateurs in the city who are eager to take a chance on the business, and some, like Sofia Luna, an immigrant from Lima, Peru, are managing to beat the odds. Ms. Luna, 27, is poised to turn her family's minichain of five Cuban restaurants, Sophie's Cuban Cuisine, into a regional and perhaps even national chain. 
 This month, the first Sophie's outside the financial district opened in Midtown, on Madison Avenue between 33rd and 34th Streets. By next spring, Ms. Luna, who has emerged as the chain's business manager and driving force, hopes to start selling franchises.
 ''We've run out of brothers and sisters to run them,'' she joked.
 Some of the most successful entrepreneurs seem to be born with a knack for business, and Ms. Luna appears to be among them. On a recent tour of the Madison Avenue Sophie's before it opened, Ms. Luna, a trim woman in a pink sweater, with large hoop earrings and a neat ponytail, recounted with a note of pride in her voice how she negotiated several months' free rent to provide time for construction.
 It was a family decision not to sell Peruvian food. ''It's very tasty,'' Ms. Luna said, but added that it is somewhat difficult to produce on a large scale. Moreover, she did not think New Yorkers were familiar with the cuisine, and worried that there would not be enough demand.
 Cuban food turned out to be a good bet. The city has few Cuban lunch spots among its 23,000 food-service establishments. Almost from the day the first Sophie's opened on Greenwich Street, near the World Trade Center, in 1997, it was packed. Sophie's restaurants feature classic Cuban dishes like stewed chicken, roast pork and shredded beef. They are served cafeteria style, and cost $7, including a helping of rice and beans. The menu also includes classic Cuban sandwiches for $5.
 During every weekday lunch hour, the tables at the downtown restaurants are filled with a melting pot of financial district employees, municipal workers and executives. The two largest Sophie's branches, on Pearl Street and Chambers Street, have annual sales of $1.5 million each, according to Ms. Luna. That is close to the average sales of a McDonald's. Each restaurant goes through 700 pounds of rice, 300 pounds of beans, and 280 pounds of pork a week. Limited hours -- the restaurants close at 7:30 p.m. and are shut on Sundays -- and spare decor keep costs down. ''We are successful because we are not a fancy restaurant,'' Ms. Luna said. ''We provide good food, it's fast and we keep our quality high.''
 E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the New York City chapter of the state restaurant association, said that restaurants often fail because of ''poor selection of a location, undercapitalization, and lack of experience.''
 Ms. Luna started getting her experience early on. Her grandparents, with whom she lived, owned a restaurant in Lima and did much of their cooking at home. After she came to New York in 1990, she, her two sisters and a brother would help their mother cook Peruvian specialties, like seviche and canario beans, to sell at soccer games in Queens.
 A family friend persuaded the clan to think bigger. By pooling their funds and borrowing, the family raised $200,000 to invest in the first Sophie's. The subsequent ones have been financed with profits from the business.
 Like most downtown businesses, Sophie's was affected by the attack on the World Trade Center. One restaurant was shut for six months. Another, the closest to ground zero, never recovered from the loss of business, and the family shut it down. But no one at any of the restaurants was hurt that day; by chance, Ms. Luna, a sister, and their mother had skipped what had become a regular breakfast meeting at a deli in the World Trade Center. Ms. Luna was at St. John's University, where she was taking courses in restaurant management.
 That fall, when many businesses were avoiding downtown, Ms. Luna signed a lease for the restaurant on Chambers Street. ''We called the landlord directly and got a good lease,'' she said. ''We knew downtown was going to get back to the way it was before.''

HEADLINE: China Expands. Europe Rises. And the United States . . .

BYLINE: By FRED KAPLAN. 
Fred Kaplan is the national security columnist for Slate.

 BODY:
IT'S a risky business to predict the decline of the American empire. Ask Paul Kennedy, the Yale historian, who issued such a forecast in his 1987 book, ''The Rise and Fall of Great Powers,'' only to witness an almost immediate American resurgence.
 Yet the signposts, at the end of this year, are ominous. As an economic power, the United States no longer sets the rules, much less rule the game. As a military power, it vastly outguns the rest of the world, but has a harder time translating armed might into influence. 
 On March 1, the European Union announced that it was raising import tariffs on a long list of American products, and would go on raising them each month until Congress repealed a subsidy for American exporters that had been ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization. Congressmen railed against this intrusion but finally gave in. Americans realized that, in the global economy they largely created and for 60 years dominated, they could no longer do whatever they wanted.
 Last month, China's president, Hu Jintao, embarked on a 12-day tour of Latin America, and wound up making commitments to invest $30 billion in the region. China is now Brazil's second largest trading partner and Chile's largest export market. In trade, technology, investment, education and culture, China has been displacing the United States all across Asia, and is now starting to do the same in America's backyard.
 There is nothing necessarily alarming about an expansive China or an emergent Europe, except perhaps that they coincide with a growing American dependence on both.
 The United States government spent $650 billion more this year than it raised in revenue, and financed the deficit largely by borrowing from foreign central banks, mainly those of Japan and China. They have been willing creditors because American consumers send much of the money right back by purchasing foreign-made products. It's a neat balancing act, to a point. But the American accumulated debt to foreign investors has now swelled to $3.3 trillion -- 28 percent of gross domestic product, nearly double the share of four years ago.
 In the 1990's, the United States admonished Mexico and Argentina to get their economic houses in order. This month, the Chinese premier gave Washington a strikingly similar lecture.
 These imbalances are not inherently disastrous. The Chinese get something out of the deal, a ready consumer market for their overheated production lines. If they stop lending to the United States, it would cause a deep recession here, but then Americans could not buy as many of their goods, and the recession would ricochet right back to Asia.
 It's a variation on the old joke: If you owe the bank $1 billion, the bank owns you; if you owe the bank $1 trillion, you own the bank.
 But what if another trillion-dollar customer walked into the bank? The bankers might be more willing to foreclose on the debtor, knowing that they could pick up business from the new tycoon.
 The European Union, in many respects, is looking more and more like this new tycoon. Its currency, the euro, has risen in value by 35 percent against the dollar in the last three years.
 Again, that is not necessarily bad. In theory, a falling dollar makes American exports cheaper, attracting demand that then boosts the dollar; a rising euro crimps European exports, which then lowers the euro; equilibrium is restored. In reality, this process unfolds slowly and shakily: in October, for instance, American exports rose, but American imports soared, too. 
 A more serious consequence of the dollar's fall is that the euro has become more rewarding for foreign investors, and they are reacting accordingly. In 2001, Middle Eastern oil-producing countries kept 75 percent of their currency reserves in dollars; now the figure is 61 percent, with much of the rest in euros. Chinese and Russian central bankers are also shifting reserves. This trend, at some point, could set off a spiral: the dollar declines, causing further sell-offs, leading to a further decline, and so on.
 When the dollar has fallen in the past, the United States was a net creditor and there was no serious rival currency. Neither condition holds true now. As The Economist recently put it, ''Never before has the guardian of the world's main reserve currency been its biggest net debtor.'' 
 Financiers and diplomats are beginning to ask: How much longer will the dollar remain the world's principal reserve currency? One could also ask, how much longer can the United States remain, as Madeleine Albright put it, ''the indispensable country'' of world politics?
 This year, the United States spent nearly as much on its military as all other countries combined. No other nation possesses, or aspires to, anything like the reach of American armed forces.
 Yet, if someday the United States finds that it can no longer count on foreigners to bankroll its deficits, it may also find that it can no longer afford a globe-spanning military. The war in Iraq has already stretched America's forces to the limit. In the 1970's and 1980's, when Pentagon strategists spoke of a two-front war, they envisioned having to fight simultaneously in, say, Germany and Korea. Today, they mean Mosul and Falluja.
 About 40 percent of the American troops in Iraq are from the National Guard and Reserves, ''weekend warriors'' who never figured on serving long combat tours. As a result, Guard recruitment has fallen by 30 percent. If there is no large Guard and Reserve, there is no large Army. In short, not only has the Iraq war been harder than many imagined, it has also made going to war elsewhere a less practical option -- and a less credible threat.
 The economic trends are worrisome because they stem not just from market forces but also from politics. As T.R. Reid notes in his new book ''The United States of Europe,'' the euro ''was specifically designed to challenge the global hegemony of the dollar.'' Similarly, China's rivalry with the United States in Asia and Latin America isn't a side effect of economics; it's an explicit ambition.
 These challenges will take decades to unfold, and may not succeed. China may recoil from its manufacturing boom and its excesses; Europeans could revert to age-old continental tensions. The United States may revive itself through changes in policy. 
 Meanwhile, power is not transferring so much as dispersing. It may turn out, if trends continue, that no country or bloc of countries possesses the combination of economic and military power needed to reward the good, deter or punish the bad and impose international rules, order and security. 
 A multipolar world can be a chaotic place. The danger is not so much that the United States may lose power, but that the globe's new rivals may fail to strike and manage a balance of power. End-of-the-year Cassandras traditionally predict doom, gloom and anarchy. This year they're looking less preposterous.

HEADLINE: For a Patchogue Inventor, a Costly Uphill Battle

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
AT the heart of American enterprise is the ''build a better mousetrap'' axiom: create a fine product, and the market will reward you handsomely.
 Try telling that to Carmine F. Vasile.
 This last year has been a long and trying one for Dr. Vasile, an electrophysicist who lives in Patchogue, a basement inventor and, of late, a lapsed believer in free-market economics. Dr. Vasile (pronounced vah-SILL-ee) believes that he invented the proverbial better mousetrap but that bigger companies and their lawyers have stolen his ideas. ''A great invention doesn't do you any good unless you can afford to protect it all over the world,'' he said. 
 Nineteen years ago, during a period of self-employment between stints at Motorola and the Hazeltine Corporation, an electronics manufacturer in Greenlawn, Dr. Vasile developed a heat-exchange process that had considerable commercial potential, he thought. The process uses a copper coil inserted in a drain to absorb heat from wastewater and transfer it to incoming cold water. The process makes it cheaper to heat cold water.
 Dr. Vasile, who said that during his career he had received about 35 patents on behalf of various employers, including Motorola, Rockwell, Hazeltine and Grumman, holds Patent No. 4,619,311 himself. He assigned the patent to a company called Hydrofilm, a limited partnership he and his wife, Cheryl, operate from their home.
 Dr. Vasile calls his invention a gravity film heat exchanger -- GFX for short. In 1994 Dr. Vasile retired early to focus his entrepreneurial energies on bringing the GFX to market. At the time, Dr. Vasile said, he thought the GFX would finance a comfortable retirement for himself and his wife.
 Five years ago, Dr. Vasile found a partner, Doucette Industries of York, Pa., which manufactured and marketed the device and mailed him monthly royalty checks ranging from $2,000 to $4,000.
 In March, the checks stopped. Doucette announced it was ceasing distribution of the GFX in favor of another product called the Power-Pipe, manufactured by a company called Renewability Inc. in Aurora, Ontario.
 As might be expected, Dr. Vasile was furious, and the Power-Pipe, in his view, is just the GFX under another name.
 ''This is fraud,'' he said. ''I have pictures of the product. Power-Pipe is the same thing as GFX.''
 Dr. Vasile wrote letters, many letters, to everyone involved. He complained to Underwriters Laboratories in Melville, which certified the safety of the GFX; to the Canadian Embassy in Washington; to a trade association of building contractors; and to the Federal bankruptcy court in Central Islip. 
 ''They tell you to watch out for countries like Thailand,'' he said, describing warnings he received about product counterfeiting. ''Nobody tells you about Canada.''
 Dr. Vasile acknowledges that his design is not protected under the Canadian patent system, and he knows that most companies routinely patent their inventions in all markets where they expect to sell or where the product might be manufactured.
 ''I couldn't afford to do that,'' he said. He said he relied on the belief that the GFX design qualified as a trade secret and was thus protected under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. 
 ''I protected trade secrets for 20 years for companies like Hazeltine,'' Dr. Vasile said. ''When I talk about trade secrets, I know what I'm talking about.''
 Charlie Boeckmann, an aide to Representative Tim Bishop, said that he had written letters on Dr. Vasile's behalf to appropriate F.B.I. officials, asking them to review his claims under the espionage act, and that the F.B.I. told him earlier this month that the claims were being investigated.
 ''If in fact his allegations are correct, we have a serious issue on the federal level.'' Mr. Boeckmann said. 
 John Lebo, the president of Doucette Industries, refused to comment on Dr. Vasile's contentions. ''There really is nothing to discuss with you,'' he said. ''We will comment at the proper venue, and this is not it.''
 Denis Van Decker, a vice president of Renewability Energy, denied that the Power-Pipe was the same product as the GFX. 
 Of Dr. Vasile, he said: ''The man has no credibility. He throws mud at people. The products aren't the same, and our customers know the difference.'' 
 Mr. Van Decker said that arbitrators had ruled against Dr. Vasile in 12 instances, but Dr. Vasile denied that. He said that there had been only three rulings against him and that the arbitration process was incomplete, because he could not afford to pay the costs assessed by the arbitrators. Mr. Van Decker said the issue would be resolved in court. 
 Dr. Vasile has ''done the lion's share of what would be expected of him'' to get his idea successfully commercialized, said an official of the federal Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which administered a grant of nearly $100,000 given to Dr. Vasile to help him develop and market his invention. 
 Inventors often confront the problem of defending their patents in other countries, said the official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used because he was afraid of how his supervisors would react to his comments.
 ''All these guys are disadvantaged trying to get their technology to the market,'' the official said, describing independent inventors. ''They're like the guy in the Greek myth who pushes the boulder up the mountain,'' only to have it roll down again. 
 The official said that there was little the government could do for them, aside from sympathizing with them. His own approach, he said, is to recite motivational speeches made by Vince Lombardi, the Green Bay Packers' coach. ''I told Carmine, 'Don't give up,''' the official said. ''I regularly tell inventors, 'Don't give up.'''
 Dr. Vasile said that he had not given up but that because of financial problems brought on by the GFX, he could not afford to hire a patent lawyer and is presenting a claim in bankruptcy court. 
 Ronald Weiss, a Huntington lawyer who represented Dr. Vasile at his bankruptcy hearing in Central Islip last month, called the case ''particularly complex with several overlapping issues.''
 ''This is a David and Goliath situation, and Carmine is taking on six Goliaths,'' Mr. Weiss said.
 So, instead of financing a comfortable retirement for him and his wife, Dr. Vasile said his efforts to market his GFX invention had depleted ''our lifetime earnings.''
 ''It's been a nightmare,'' he added. ''I blew through my retirement money and my wife's. What I've learned is that people can steal technology at will. Unless you've got money to defend your patent, it's worthless.''
 The GFX patent comes up for renewal next June, but Dr. Vasile is not giving up. ''I'll renew it,'' he said. ''With improvements.'' And things are, in fact, looking up. In July he found a new manufacturer for the GFX, Fuel Cell Components Integrators of Hauppauge, and sales have just gotten under way.

HEADLINE: Kings Park Catches the Imagination of a Literary Journal

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

 BODY:
LITERARY magazines are generally known for their stunning inability to turn a profit. Often proceeding with an optimistic lack of a business plan, their editors drum up just enough financial backing to publish a few times before the journal disappears, appreciated only by a small, rarefied and fickle audience.
 Then there's Night Train, devoted to keeping alive the waning art of short-story writing through a cunning marketing technique.
 Now in its fourth issue, Night Train is published twice a year by a Boston-based nonprofit group. Its last two issues each had a run of 3,000 copies. 
 But its marketing strategy has worked so well that its subscription base has quintupled since the first issue, and Barnes & Noble doubled its order for the upcoming fifth issue, said Tom Jackson, the magazine's marketing manager and a short-story writer. 
 Mr. Jackson, who works by day writing ad copy for an insurance company based in Peoria, Ill., explained the Night Train strategy in a telephone interview. 
 For each issue, he said, the metaphorical train of the title pulls into a community that has been selected to sponsor the edition. Inside the issue are more than 200 pages of the most provocative short fiction the editors can find. But the photograph on the cover and the last piece of writing are not fiction; they relate to the sponsoring community.
 The selected community gets publicity, and Night Train gets published, with the help of the advertisements in the back of the edition, paid for by business and organizations in the sponsoring town.
 The result looks more like a thick paperback book than a magazine.
 For its most recent issue, out in September, Night Train focused on Kings Park, a hamlet in Smithtown that to outsiders is known mostly for its shuttered, crumbling state psychiatric hospital, which opened in 1885. A bricked-up, Greek-Revival portico at the hospital, framed by out-of-control foliage, is the creepy cover image.
 A 26-page history of the hamlet, written by Rachel Wallack, a Kings Park native, is dotted with photographs taken there. It appears after the contributors' notes, but before the six-page list of 53 local benefactors who wrote checks ranging from $50 to $1,000 to advertise their businesses.
 The benefactors include the local school district and historical museum, which donated $1,000 and $500 respectively; a carver of tombstones who gave $250; a deli, two banks, two funeral homes and the local newspaper, which gave $100 each; and an architect who donated $50. In all, the magazine took in about $10,000.
 Add in revenue from over-the-counter sales and subscriptions, and there is enough -- barely enough -- to keep an obscure literary magazine alive long enough to see another issue, Mr. Jackson said.
 But Night Train is becoming a victim of its own modest success. To meet a growing demand, it must double its next print run. And that necessitates bumping up the sponsorship from the next community, Mr. Jackson explained. 
 As a result, he said, the editors are considering communities for the fifth issue that would raise more money. High on the list is Petaluma, Calif., along with prospects in Pennsylvania and Maine, he said.
 The managing editor, Susan Henderson, lives in Kings Park, which only partly explains the editorial board's choice.
 ''I had to push very hard,'' said Ms. Henderson, who moved there from Pittsburgh.
 In selecting a sponsor, she said, the editors require, first, that the community have a train depot and some railroad-related history, to fit in with the theme of the journal's title. Kings Park is a central stop on the Long Island Rail Road system, one of the most heavily used commuter lines in the nation.
 But the editors also look for little places that are evolving. Kings Park worked, Ms. Henderson said, because its history and shifting identity combine to create a sort of real-life short story.
 The setting is Poe-like -- the looming, ominous-looking hospital, with its darkened, crumbing facade and underground tunnels, and its central role in the hamlet's economic development.
 ''Everyone in town has worked there or knows someone who was locked in that building,'' Ms. Henderson said, noting that the lobotomy was invented there.
 Meanwhile, the hospital is to be torn down, its land to be sold to a developer, and so change is afoot. 
 ''Kings Park is simple and working class, and people have lived here for generations, so we're protective,'' Ms. Henderson said. ''But it has to grow and change with the times, so we're right on the cusp of something. But we don't know what it will become.''
 The magazine's third issue focused on Galesburg, Ill., which is near Chicago and St. Louis, in the middle of the country, and known among railroad buffs as an historical hub on the major east-west rail lines. Galesburg has been going through its own transition, in its case a resurgence of its historic district.
 It also has a literary history. It is the home of Knox College, which has a respected writing program, and was the birthplace of Carl Sandburg.
 Amid pronouncements that the short story is on life support, the Night Train editors are optimistic about the future of the genre. A Nov. 13 reading held by the magazine in a Kings Park pub, the Union Square Tavern, drew successful writers from across the country as well as a crowd of locals, Ms. Henderson said. Some were hecklers, but others, she said, were new fans of the short story.
 To choose the 18 pieces in the Kings Park issue, Ms. Henderson said, the editors culled through a few thousand submissions.
 ''In all the aspects of my life, that is the one place where people are just on fire,'' she said. ''And by getting a place interested in seeing its name in lights, we're doing our best to expand the boundaries of the audience.''
 Night Train is sold on Long Island in Barnes & Noble bookstores and at the BookHampton shop in East Hampton. Information: www.nighttrainmagazine.com.

HEADLINE: With Fares Rising, So Is Riders' Dismay

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
FOR Robell Yeung of Port Washington, the scheduled March fare increase of as much as 15.2 percent on the Long Island Rail Road could not come at a worse time.
 ''The economy is very bad, my husband just got laid off and he can't find a job with the same salary,'' she said as she arrived at Pennsylvania Station last Monday morning. ''It's very hard to maintain a household and manage the monthly expenses.''
 Ms. Yeung, who works as a garment importer in Manhattan, said she thought the fare increase, approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Dec. 16, was unfair because ''we just got hit with an increase about a year ago of 20 to 30 percent, and we shouldn't have another one in such a short time.'' 
 Gloria Luna of Melville voiced similar sentiments as she walked through Penn Station.
 ''I think it's horrible,'' said Ms. Luna, who markets cosmetics. ''And they are warning that service will still be reduced. The railroad is inefficiently organized, and they are not doing anything to make any significant changes to improve it.''
 Aboard the 7:47 a.m. from Deer Park to Penn Station, Keela A. Bacchus, an administrative assistant from Deer Park, said she was also upset about the fare increases, which will average 5 percent.
 ''You can barely make ends meet now,'' she said. ''I'm appalled. There was a big surplus. What happened to it?''
 Kathleen K. Grgin of Hauppauge, seated next to her, replied, ''They gave it away in salaries.''
 Ms. Grgin, who works for a computer software firm in the city, said she was referring to the 22 percent pay raise of $42,500 that was quietly given this year to Katherine N. Lapp, executive director of the M.T.A. It projects a net surplus of $466 million this year and has set aside $240 million as a ''rainy day'' reserve.
 Ms. Bacchus said she had been riding the railroad for almost two years and was ''sick of it'' but had no choice because driving was out of the question. 
 ''And this is the worst line,'' she said of the Ronkonkoma branch, citing an on-time performance of just 83 percent in the morning rush last month.
 Twenty minutes after Ms. Bacchus's train pulled into Jamaica, the conductor announced, ''This train is out of service.'' There was no further explanation.
 As Ms. Bacchus scurried with fellow passengers in the cold to catch another train to New York, she muttered, ''This is ridiculous.''
 James J. Dermody, president of the railroad, said that one reason for the poor performance last month on the Ronkonkoma branch was the single track between Farmingdale and Ronkonkoma.
 Mr. Dermody noted that the 2005-9 capital program calls for adding a third rail along the Main Line from Bellerose to Hicksville, building a 16-track storage yard on the Port Jefferson line east of Huntington and making major signal improvements.
 ''One of the reasons for the fare increase is because of the bonds to finance the capital program,'' Mr. Dermody said. ''Almost $700 million in interest is due in 2005, and $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion is due in 2006. The last two capital programs were financed completely by the M.T.A., so it all came from the fare box.''
 Mr. Dermody said the fare increase was projected to generate an extra $18.5 million in 2005 and more than $22 million in 2006, the first full year of the increase. It is also expected to cost the railroad 2 million of its 81 million annual riders.
 Although the average fare increase is 5 percent, riders who buy one-way off-peak tickets and off-peak 10-trip tickets will face an increase of as much as 15.2 percent more. Mr. Dermody said the M.T.A. ordered that increase to ''make us closer to Metro-North,'' of which the M.T.A. is also the parent.
 He said that off-peak tickets were now 30 percent less than peak tickets on the L.I.R.R., but 25 percent less than peak tickets on Metro-North. The increased fare beginning March 1 will reduce the off-peak discount on the L.I.R.R. to 27.5 percent.
 Gerry Bringmann, vice chairman of the Long Island Rail Road Commuters Council, said the M.T.A. cited the need to make the two lines uniform ''when it is to their advantage to do that.''
 ''One of the things that is upsetting a lot of commuters is that they had previously not talked of service cuts, only a 5 percent hit,'' he said. 
 But under the budget approved this month, the railroad is cutting more than 20 trains, including 2 peak trains on the Hempstead branch, and is closing ticket offices on weekends at 12 stations. And there will be reductions in the cleaning of stations.
 Mr. Bringmann noted also that the railroad is reducing to 5 percent from 9 percent the discount for commuters who use the Mail & Ride option with a joint MetroCard. 
 Meanwhile, the base fare for single rides on subways and local buses in New York City, which rose to $2 from $1.50 last year, remains unchanged.
 James McGovern, chairman of the commuters' council, said the 5 percent average fare increase was ''only a drop in the bucket relative to the deficits they are facing, but it enables everyone to fight it out another day.''
 Beverly L. Dolinsky, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., pointed out that there is an $11 billion shortfall in financing the 2005-9 capital program and a projected $1 billion operating deficit in 2006. 
 ''They can't raise fares enough or cut service enough to address the debt they are facing,'' she said.
 Meanwhile, commuters continue to express frustration.
 ''I've talked to a number of people and we might refuse to show our tickets'' in protest, said Juliet Roscigno-Filipkowski of Central Islip. ''We don't want to boycott because driving is not an option. But the railroad is not making itself affordable.''

HEADLINE: Subtraction for Schools

BYLINE: By ALAN J. SINGER. 
Alan J. Singer is a professor of secondary education at Hofstra University.

DATELINE: Hempstead 

 BODY:
BEHIND the recent headlines about inflated salaries for school superintendents on Long Island -- and behind the disappointing academic performance of some of our students -- is a fundamental flaw in the way our school districts are organized.
 Nassau and Suffolk schools are divided into a patchwork of 124 small districts, most of them racially and economically segregated. This balkanized system forces districts to compete for superintendents, a rivalry that drives up salaries. It also prevents the use of economies of scale in construction and repairs. As a result, districts spend an unnecessarily large part of their budgets on overhead rather than on instruction. Meanwhile, school property taxes continue to rise. For the current school year, homeowners in two-thirds of Nassau County's school districts face a 10 percent to 17 percent increase in their school property tax obligations, according to the county's board of assessors. 
 The solution is to replace this mini-district system with about a dozen consolidated school districts. Consolidation -- already adopted by most rural areas in America -- would save money, improve education and better prepare Long Island's youngsters to live in a racially and culturally diverse world. 
 Currently, Long Island taxpayers pay $25 million a year to our many superintendents, who together oversee the education of about 450,000 students. Indeed, the Syosset district superintendent is the highest-paid school-district official in the state, with a salary of $290,736 a year. For heading a district with just 6,600 students, she is paid more than school chiefs in Chicago, Los Angeles or New York City (where the chancellor, who oversees 1.1 million students, makes $250,000 a year). 
 Recent salary and benefit increases for school superintendents on Long Island are nearly 40 percent higher than for the rest of the state and nearly 60 percent above the national average, according to an investigation conducted by Newsday. 
 Such expenses eat up money sorely needed for instruction. According to a report released by the state education department in 2002, about 25 percent of the budgets for Nassau and Suffolk school districts were spent on non-instructional expenses. 
 What's more, the extremely decentralized structure of the system contributes to malfeasance or just careless spending. In its continuing investigation of school districts in the wake of the embezzlement case in the Roslyn district, for example, the Office of the State Comptroller recently reported results for the first two of 21 districts it will audit -- Plainedge and Baldwin. While no wrongdoing was found in either district, the comptroller reported that both lacked clear policies on spending. 
 Consolidation could also ease the current inequities in school property tax rates. In Nassau County, the lowest school property tax rate is paid by homeowners in Great Neck, one of the most affluent towns. These residents are taxed at only 37 percent of the rate paid by homeowners in Hempstead, one of the county's poorest communities. Under a consolidated plan, commercial property taxes could be pooled and homeowners' property taxes replaced by a countywide income tax.
 Consolidated school districts would also be more racially integrated. In the Brentwood, Central Islip and Wyandanch districts of Suffolk, less than 20 percent of the student population is white. In Cold Spring Harbor, Smithtown and West Islip, student populations are more than 95 percent white. 
 The demographics in Nassau County are similarly unbalanced, with students at the overwhelmingly minority schools falling the furthest behind. Only 18 percent of the county's fourth graders scored at the lowest two proficiency levels on the English Language Arts test, according to the 2002 state education department report. But that figure was 40 percent in Elmont and Uniondale and 38 percent in Hempstead. Among high school students, 58 percent of sophomores in the academically troubled Roosevelt district received less than a 65 on the Regents' global history exam, compared with 10 percent in the county overall. 
 A newly consolidated district made up of the current Nassau districts of Glen Cove, Jericho, Locust Valley, North Shore, Oyster Bay-East Norwich, Syosset and Westbury would have a more diverse student population. It would have about 22,500 students -- roughly the size of the Yonkers or Syracuse systems. Its school population would be 66 percent white, 11.7 percent black, 14.7 percent Hispanic and 7.4 percent Asian. And, based on current average compensation packages, having one superintendent instead of seven would free $1.5 million . 
 Consolidation could achieve its goals in ways that ensure fairness and minimize inconvenience. Small magnet programs could help create maximum school choice. Pairing ethnically different school districts that abut each other geographically would allow children to continue to walk to their schools.
 School-district consolidation is an educational necessity on Long Island. We owe it to our children to muster the political will to make it a reality.

HEADLINE: For Ferrer, a Tightrope to the Voters

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
When Fernando Ferrer ran for mayor in 2001 he spoke frequently about ''the other New York'' and produced advertisements that sought to appeal to minority voters. One, a Spanish-language commercial, for instance, said that ''Fernando Ferrer is one of us.'' 
 While his campaign was accused of being racially and ethnically divisive, Mr. Ferrer insisted he was speaking to anyone who had been left behind in the economic boom that had swept through the city and that it was his opponents who were being divisive by framing issues in ethnic terms. In turn, he accused his opponent in a primary runoff, Mark Green, of using racist tactics. 
 What resulted was a primary that divided Democrats, cleared the way for a Republican, Michael R. Bloomberg, to win the mayor's race, and left hard feelings that linger to this day. Now Mr. Ferrer is facing his third run for mayor and again must navigate one of the most challenging aspects a candidate faces in a city where politics has long been defined by race and ethnicity: how to energize one's base, in Mr. Ferrer's case Hispanic voters, without turning off other constituencies.
 It is a delicate question, one that politicians and their strategists do not like to discuss publicly but one that a prominent Democrat speaking on condition of anonymity called the ''third rail reality'' of city politics. It is why pollsters seek to discern attitudes not simply among blacks and Hispanics, for example, but among Caribbeans, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans.
 ''Of course it is possible for politicians who hail from one ethnic group to appeal to their base and appeal to other groups of people,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''As a practical matter, not only to win, but to govern, you have to achieve the widest and deepest and most diverse coalition you have to get support.''
 The last Democrat elected mayor was David N. Dinkins, who did talk about race but finessed his message to sound inclusive, referring to the city's ''gorgeous mosaic.'' Mr. Dinkins was able to build a traditional Democratic coalition, attracting minority and white voters with the promise of uniting the city after the tumultuous final years of Edward I. Koch's administration, when racial strife after the killing of a black teenager in Bensonhurst dominated the political debate.
 Ever since, Democrats have struggled to find the right formula to rebuild that coalition and avoid the pitfalls of New York's racial politics. But those pitfalls are hard to get away from, especially for candidates who carry the baggage of having run in the 2001 primary. One of the most formidable potential candidates, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., who is black and who did not run for mayor in 2001, said this year that he would not enter the mayor's race in part because he did not want to be caught in an ethnically and racially divisive primary.
 And while Mr. Ferrer has not yet begun his campaign, he has already had to distance himself from the remarks of a supporter who accused Mayor Bloomberg of making a racist statement.
 Explaining a reason he chose not to run, Mr. Thompson said recently: ''You have to make a determination: What do you want to be remembered for? And that is just not what I want -- to be part of the disintegration of the Democratic Party.''
 As in 2001, Mr. Ferrer is careful not to use any explicit racial or ethnic appeals, but his political advisers acknowledge that his ability to motivate minority voters is central to his bid for mayor.
 But for Mr. Ferrer, those political calculations are more complex than in 2001, when Rudolph W. Giuliani had antagonized many minority voters. Mr. Bloomberg, on the other hand, has reached out to minority voters, particularly blacks. And while it is not yet clear what level of support he will have among blacks, political observers say the lack of antagonism toward the current mayor may make it harder for Mr. Ferrer to suggest the city needs a uniter when Mr. Bloomberg has not been seen as a divider.
 At the same time, there may be two black candidates in the race. Both Councilman Charles Barron and Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields have said they plan to run for mayor. In 2001, the Rev. Al Sharpton endorsed Mr. Ferrer, and while Mr. Sharpton proved to be a divisive figure among white voters, his support helped Mr. Ferrer with black voters in the primary, political observers said. Now Mr. Sharpton is endorsing Mr. Barron, and while it is unclear if Mr. Barron will actually follow through and run, it is not clear whether Mr. Sharpton would eventually help Mr. Ferrer.
 ''I think the racial dynamics are different when you have a Virginia Fields and Barron in the race,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''It became more difficult to talk about a black-Latino coalition.''
 Mr. Ferrer's campaign has not yet begun to advertise or to aggressively promote his candidacy. But his aides acknowledge that the challenge will be to build his base -- that is, to energize Hispanics and, the Ferrer camp hopes, win over black voters, while not recreating the dynamics of 2001, when white votes generally supported Mr. Green in a primary runoff. The swing vote in the general election may well be the liberal white voters who cast their ballots for Mr. Green in 2001. The question political observers are asking is whether these people will vote for Mr. Bloomberg in 2005, or for Mr. Ferrer.
 Mr. Ferrer ''is well positioned to win the primary, especially if the candidacies of the black candidates don't really sort of catch fire,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York.
 ''But to the extent that the Democratic primary triggers this underlying racial cleavage, it probably hurts him because it will consolidate support of white voters behind Bloomberg,'' Dr. Mollenkopf said.
 Mr. Ferrer's aides and supporters chose an approach in 2001 that -- regardless of their intention -- was perceived by many white voters as divisive when they talked about ''the other New York.'' Mr. Ferrer said he had delivered the same message John Edwards did in his presidential campaign this year, but where Mr. Edwards was seen as talking about class, Mr. Ferrer was viewed by many as talking about race.
 These days, Mr. Ferrer says he wants to focus on 2005, not 2001. He expresses frustration and despair when asked to talk about the politics of race, choosing instead to discuss policy issues, like the state of the schools, or the mayor's plan for redeveloping the West Side. 
 ''Can I frame this differently?'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''In 2001, but certainly in 2005, I will make every conscious effort to appeal to people in this city who believe that they are being priced out of it, who want their schools to be better, who need to have access to more affordable housing to want to live on safe streets who want to see their children play in parks, or too many who need a job in order to support themselves and their families.''

HEADLINE: Time Flew By This Year (or So I Hear)

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
HERE on the final weekend of 2004, many of you are no doubt thinking about the passage of time, about how this was a year in which time flew by, or crawled by, or took its inevitable toll, or whatever. For me, though, 2004 was the year that time stopped -- or, more precisely, the year that I stopped knowing what time it was. 
 See, for the last 12 months I have navigated life without benefit of a wristwatch. That's right, here in the Constantly Mobile State, the state where everyone seems always to be trying to get somewhere by a particular microsecond, I went a year without having the time available at the flick of a wrist. 
 Next to not owning a car, not owning a watch might be the nearest thing we have to sacrilege in New Jersey. Not owning a cellphone, a device that now doubles as a watch for many people, is right up there, but I don't have one of those, either. So sue me. 
 This yearlong experiment in timelessness didn't start out as an act of defiance or even curiosity. It started out as a lost wristwatch. In my unkempt house, if something as small as a watch gets lost, it stays lost. Yet after the watch disappeared I couldn't bring myself to buy another because I knew I already had a perfectly good one, somewhere. 
 For the first few weeks I was constantly looking at my naked wrist for guidance that wasn't there, and that made me annoyed that I had become a slave to a man-made device, and that made me stay watchless. Weeks became months, and now it's been 12. 
 I most noticed not having a watch when I would commute into work on New Jersey Transit, which introduced a randomness to the concept of time this year that was truly astounding. It wasn't catching the trains that was the problem. It was falling asleep on them, then waking up and not knowing if I had dozed off for 10 minutes or 10 hours. It actually added excitement to the work routine, having to wait until I reached Pennsylvania Station to find out whether I was on time, or late, or fired. 
 I am not the only person in New Jersey who has dabbled in watchlessness. There is, for instance, Kimberly Narol, a 15-year-old from Hopewell who for many summers has been going to a camp called Treetops in Lake Placid, N.Y., where the use of timekeeping devices is actively discouraged. She has taken that lifestyle home. 
 ''I haven't worn a watch in years,'' she said. Why? Because if you put a clock on yourself, you put yourself on the clock. ''It feels like your days are sort of being rushed and washed away,'' she said. 
 We spoke blissfully of a time-free New Jersey -- perhaps the Legislature could finance a turn-in-your-watches program like the ones some cities use for firearms. But in my heart I know that creating that nirvana is a job for Kimberly's generation, not mine. Because while not having a watch has obviously made her wiser, it has made me noticeably stupider. Basically, everything that happened in our state in this bizarre, befuddling year caught me by surprise, something I can attribute only to not having a watch. 
 Being watchless, I did not, for instance, realize that it was time for us to get a new governor. I did not realize that it was time to begin using elementary schools for aerial target practice. I did not realize that it was time New Jersey had an official state soil, something a legislative committee recommended last month. 
 And so I've been talking to John Hafner, who has a shop in Smithville and an Internet business to go with it (www.fotowatches.com) at which he'll sell you a watch with a photograph of your choice on the face. What photographs do people have imprinted on their watches? 
 ''Primarily it's animals and kids,'' said Mr. Hafner, whose own watch has a collage of his wife and children. I have animals and kids, but something else he said intrigued me more: about 15 percent of his customers order timepieces with pictures of people who have passed on. 
 Since my new watch will, in a fashion, commemorate a year that has now passed on, perhaps the photo I choose should be representative of 2004 or something in it that will no longer be with us. A shot of Jim McGreevey, for instance, the door hitting him on the way out. A picture of the Nets, packing for Brooklyn, or of General Motors workers in Linden, packing for the unemployment line. What time is it? Time for a calmer new year, I hope.

HEADLINE: Want to Retire Early? Well, It May Take Some Work

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
LYDIA POSNER was not considering retirement last year when Verizon offered her a buyout package. ''I always felt like I would work forever, so this was a very emotional decision for me,'' said Mrs. Posner, who was employed as a technical writer. ''I drove my husband and children crazy for six weeks talking about it, until my kids finally said, 'Mom, you worked for 31 years, you deserve this.'''
 Mrs. Posner was 56 when she retired in 2003. She is among the thousands of employees who have decided to call it quits in recent years after being offered buyout packages, which many companies have been turning to as an alternative to involuntary layoffs during cost cutting. Many other workers are quitting their jobs years before they qualify for Social Security payments, without the incentive of a buyout.
 Workers considering early retirement should crunch the numbers first, financial planners say, to make sure that they will have enough income -- typically about 70 to 80 percent of their preretirement earnings. They should also consider how they are going to cover their health care. Some buyout offers that are geared toward encouraging early retirement will offer medical insurance until Medicare kicks in at age 65, and might also sweeten employee pensions. 
 A smart financial planner will help clients decide how much money they can safely spend, as well as how much income they are likely to generate after retirement. People often think that expenses will decline as they halt their commutes and end purchases of business attire. But they might also want to spend more on travel and entertainment. ''For different people, the lifestyle choices are obviously quite different,'' said Lewis Altfest, a financial planner in New York.
 One rule of thumb, Mr. Altfest said, is that 65-year-old retirees can withdraw 4 percent a year from their portfolios -- including after-tax investment returns and principal -- with a high probability of not outliving their assets. This model assumes an asset allocation of 75 percent equities, which is a bit more than he likes. He recommends 60 percent equities and 40 percent fixed income for a typical retiree's portfolio. 
 When clients do not have enough money saved to generate the income that they will need to supplement social security and a pension, Mr. Altfest asks if they would consider selling their homes and moving somewhere cheaper. By doing this, money that is tied up in the home can be used for investment, and daily expenses are often lower. ''Virtually any city that's not L.A. or San Francisco or Boston or New York will cost about 15 percent less,'' he said.
 Early retirement requires an even tougher decision process, said Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in New York. Not only will clients have fewer years to save for retirement, they will have more years to draw down on their assets, Mr. Schatsky said. 
 ''This is one of the biggest financial decisions you can ever make,'' Mr. Schatsky said. ''People often don't view their job as an asset, but job security, and a healthy benefits package, are extremely valuable in today's economy.''
 Of course, not everyone who retires early is leaving a plum job. Some people stop working because the nature of their job -- or their entire industry -- changes so much that they no longer take pleasure in the work. Evan Lenk was 47 when he decided four years ago that 22 years as a manufacturer's representative for ladies' handbags was enough. ''I wasn't having fun at my job anymore, and my income was diminishing, so I decided to quit the industry,'' he said.
 Mr. Lenk is not looking for full-time employment. ''I have trouble using the 'R' word, retired, so I tell people that I'm in a midlife lifestyle change,'' he said. He and his wife, Diane, who is 56, have no children. ''That's a major factor that we're able to do this,'' he said.
 Although he is years away from being able to tap his retirement accounts without tax penalties, his wife still works, and they earn income from investments they made with money raised from selling a summer cottage in the Berkshires and auctioning off hundreds of antiques that they had collected over the years.
 Mr. Lenk worked as an independent contractor and his wife manages a doctor's office; neither will receive a traditional pension. So when Mr. Lenk considered that he might stop working, he asked his financial advisor whether he could afford to do so.
 ''Early retirement is even scarier without a really good pension,'' said Lee Rosenberg, the Lenks' financial planner, who has an office in Jericho, N.Y. Mr. Rosenberg suggested that the couple diversify their portfolio to cut risk. The Lenks are also thinking of using their long-time hobby of antiquing to earn a little extra money in retirement. 
 While the success they had selling their personal antiques may bode well, a recent poll indicated that many retirees could discover that their hobbies are less lucrative than they had hoped. In the telephone survey, commissioned by UBS Financial and conducted by Gallup, 47 percent of full-time employees said that they would like to pursue a hobby as a way to make money after retirement, but only 13 percent of current retirees said that they were able to do so.
 Mr. Schatsky said he told clients who hoped to make money in that way to take all of their vacation time at once, or negotiate an unpaid leave, and put their plan into action. That way, the client can determine if a hobby is likely to pay off, while preserving the ability to step back to a full-time job.
 Even with pensions and Social Security, some retirees choose to work part time. Larry and Nancy Jankner, who both retired at 59, receive traditional defined-benefit pensions, and Mr. Jankner, who is now 64, has started receiving Social Security checks. Yet Mr. Jankner, a former reference librarian for the Brooklyn Public Library, currently works about 20 hours a week for programs at the library that provide services to older users. Mrs. Jankner, who is now 61 and retired from a 20-year career as a public school teacher, is a consultant to an early-intervention program for young children.
 THE two of them bring in a total of about $1,500 a month from their part-time jobs. Mrs. Jankner said the extra income helped them to enjoy some frills -- such as dining out or going to the theater -- without having to dip into their I.R.A.'s.
 Altogether, from pensions, Social Security and part-time work, the Jankners bring in about 80 percent of the income they earned before retirement. They earned a total of about $100,000 while they were both employed full time, putting $10,000 a year into retirement accounts. Their income from all sources now is about $72,000. They paid off the mortgage on their house in Brooklyn before Mr. Jankner retired in 1999, lowering their monthly expenses.
 The Jankners probably wouldn't have considered early retirement if it hadn't been for their pensions and retirement health care benefits. On the other hand, Mrs. Posner could take early retirement, in part, because her husband was still working. She decided to opt out of Verizon's traditional defined-benefit pension plan, instead taking the value of her pension in a lump sum and moving the money into an I.R.A.
 While traditional pension plans often outperform individually invested portfolios, there are some advantages to converting a pension into a lump sum payment, a common option in buyout packages. One benefit is that children can inherit any money that's left in an I.R.A., Mr. Altfest said. And while a carefully invested portfolio can rise with inflation, corporate pensions usually do not. ''Over 30 years, the value of the dollar is going to shrink,'' he said.

 BODY:

THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND: A Century of Pleasure and Profit in Times Square, by James Traub. (Random House, $14.95.) This compact cultural history of Times Square (Longacre Square before it was renamed in 1904) chronicles the district's rise as a popular entertainment hub, its decline into a porn-and-drug haven and its rebirth as a sanitized shopping center. Traub looks at the forces that have shaped today's Times Square and shows the many versions of Manhattan that have occupied the same slice of real estate -- from vaudeville and speakeasies to MTV and Toys ''R'' Us.

THE STRANGER AT THE PALAZZO D'ORO: And Other Stories, by Paul Theroux. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.) The title of Theroux's tense, clinical collection comes from a novella about a young American's encounter with an aging German countess whose vanity demands a young lover. Temptation and untimely attacks of sexual desire mark the three accompanying short stories.

AMERICAN MASSACRE: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857, by Sally Denton. (Vintage, $14.) Denton ably recounts one of the most controversial events in the history of the American West -- the ambush in southern Utah that claimed the lives of some 140 members of a California-bound wagon train -- and gathers the evidence pointing to the Mormon Church.

THE WAY THE CROW FLIES, by Ann-Marie MacDonald. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $14.95.) Centered around a Royal Canadian Air Force officer and his family, this panoramic novel presents a sidelong view of the cold war and such events as the first sputnik and the Cuban missile crisis. MacDonald ties together several narrative threads, including the story of a defecting scientist (and former Nazi) in Canada and the murder of a local child.

THE NEW BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF FILM, by David Thomson. (Knopf, $22.95.) This latest edition of the treasured reference work, the book's third revision since it first appeared in 1975, bulges with hundreds of revelatory deflations and reverential salutes to directors, bygone starlets and cinematic heroes (from Abbott and Costello to Terry Zwigoff). Thomson, an iconoclastic film critic and biographer of David O. Selznick and Orson Welles, ''remains engaged, authoritative and occasionally visionary,'' our reviewer, Sarah Kerr, said. In NOBODY'S PERFECT: Billy Wilder, a Personal Biography (Applause Theatre & Cinema, $17.95), Charlotte Chandler draws from conversations with the director (1906-2002) and those who knew him, revealing the creative and production processes behind each of his films, including ''Sunset Boulevard,'' ''Some Like It Hot'' and ''The Apartment.''

DREAM JUNGLE, by Jessica Hagedorn. (Penguin, $14.) Set in the Ferdinand Marcos-controlled Philippines of the 1970's, Hagedorn's intricate novel shifts from year to year and between points of view. This narrative collage links a Manila millionaire's purported discovery of a Stone Age tribe on Mindanao with a filmed re-creation of the Vietnam War on the same island years later.

THE PURSUIT OF PERFECTION: The Promise and Perils of Medical Enhancement, by Sheila M. Rothman and David J. Rothman. (Vintage, $14.) The authors look back at the history of medical innovation and consider notable examples of ''treatments'' -- plastic surgery, for one -- that have blurred the line between therapy and enhancement.

DOUBLE VISION, by Pat Barker. (Picador, $14.) Barker's 10th novel describes an English winter in the lives of several interconnected characters. Kate is a sculptor whose husband, Ben, a photojournalist, was killed in post-9/11 Afghanistan. Stephen, the novel's other main character, is a recently divorced war correspondent (and a former colleague of Ben's) who's retreated to a cottage in the countryside, intending to write a book about representations of war. A sense of menace -- real and imagined -- blankets the novel; Barker ''employs classic techniques of suspense, juxtaposing the calm rhythms of rural life with shocking outbreaks of violence,'' our critic, Neil Gordon, said.

FIRST OFF THE TEE: Presidential Hackers, Duffers, and Cheaters From Taft to Bush, by Don Van Natta Jr. (PublicAffairs, $16.) Van Natta, an investigative reporter for The Times, sees unsettling affinities between presidents' golf games and their ethics, and shows how much presidential time has been spent ignoring affairs of state and chasing a little white ball around instead.

ARMAGEDDON
The Battle for Germany, 1944-1945.
By Max Hastings.
Illustrated. 584 pp.
Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
 In early September 1944, as the war in Europe entered its sixth year, Nazi Germany seemed about to collapse. That summer the German Army had suffered more than two million casualties in a series of bitterly fought battles on the eastern front; in the west, the Allies had broken through German defenses, liberated Paris and were rushing toward the Rhine. Hitler's allies had either surrendered or were desperately trying to switch sides. No wonder most Americans believed the war would be over by Christmas.
 It is tempting to speculate about what might have happened if Germany had surrendered in the summer of 1944. Although most of the Holocaust's victims had already perished, hundreds of thousands might still have been saved: Anne Frank, who died in Bergen-Belsen in March 1945, would have survived. Much of Eastern Europe might have been spared the devastation of the war's last year. Above all, the Germans themselves would have escaped the worst consequences of the war. Of the 1.42 million tons of bombs dropped on German targets by British and American airplanes, 1.18 million were used in the last year of the war.
 But, of course, in September the war in Europe still had another eight months to go. The central question about its final phase is not, to borrow the title of Richard Overy's excellent book, ''why the Allies won,'' but rather why it took the Germans so long to lose. This is the question posed by ''Armageddon,'' Max Hastings's splendid account of the European war from the Allies' failure to capture the bridge at Arnhem in mid-September 1944 to the final extinction of German resistance in May 1945.
 It is not difficult to understand why Hitler and those closest to him did not surrender in the fall of 1944. They knew what they had done: the mass murder of Europe's Jews, the vicious occupation policies in Poland and Russia, the millions of Russian prisoners of war dead of starvation and neglect. Their only option was to hope for a miracle -- one of the new weapons that German scientists were struggling to develop, the shattering of the alliance between the Western democracies and the Soviet Union, a dramatic victory by the hard pressed German Army.
 How the Nazis were able to keep fighting is more difficult to understand. Hastings offers three explanations. First was Albert Speer's organization of the German economy, which provided enough materiel to sustain the machinery of war. Second was Heinrich Himmler's huge repression of dissent, which severely punished any indication of ''defeatism.'' And finally there was the fighting power of the German Army, which is Hastings's main subject. Sometimes outnumbered by as much as seven to one, usually without air support, German troops nevertheless fought with remarkable skill and intensity, inflicting proportionally more casualties than they suffered, forcing their enemies to pay dearly for every kilometer they eventually conquered.
 The German Army functioned despite the failing of its leaders. (By 1944 Hitler was increasingly losing touch with reality; his operational interventions invariably made bad situations worse.) Some German soldiers fought because of an unshakable faith in Hitler's leadership or a fanatical commitment to Nazism's racial ideology; others fought out of professional pride or because they were loyal to their comrades; but most of all, Germans fought because they feared both the enemy's wrath and the heavy hand of the SS and military police. Even in the war's final days, with the Allied armies just a few streets away, the regime's agents were hanging alleged deserters and shooting anyone who failed to display sufficient confidence in victory.
 In comparison to his admiration for the military qualities of the Wehrmacht, Hastings is much less enthusiastic about the leadership and fighting power of the Allies. He acknowledges Eisenhower's managerial and diplomatic skills, common sense and willingness to take responsibility, but has a low opinion of his abilities as a strategist. Montgomery was, Hastings believes, a superb organizer but an uninspired battlefield commander. Patton, the most creative and aggressive of the lot, had been disqualified from high command by his personal failings. Hastings convincingly argues that the Allied generals' most serious failure was not some individual blunder like the disastrous Arnhem campaign but rather their persistent inability to exploit Germany's military weakness. The result was a six-month stalemate in the west that prolonged the war and greatly enhanced the Soviet Union's strategic advantage in the east.
 Hastings recognizes that the generals' failure to knock Germany out of the war in late 1944 reflected the kind of armies they led as much as their own deficiencies as leaders. The British and American armies were composed of citizen soldiers, who were usually prepared to do their duty but were also eager to survive. ''These were,'' Hastings writes, ''citizens of democracies, imbued since birth with all the inhibitions and decencies of their societies.'' Such peacetime virtues are not easily transformed into military effectiveness. James Gavin, whose airborne division was among the finest units in any army, filled his diary with harsh comments about the average soldier's military quality. ''If our infantry would fight,'' he wrote in January 1945, ''this war would be over by now. . . . Everybody wants to live to a ripe old age.'' When Winston Churchill complained to Montgomery about the British Army's lack of initiative, Montgomery replied by recalling the carnage on the Western Front during World War I: ''It was you, Prime Minister, who told me that we must not suffer casualties on the scale of the Somme.''
 In contrast to the British and the Americans, Soviet generals were prodigal in their willingness to sacrifice their soldiers' lives. Between June 1944 and May 1945, the Red Army suffered more than two million casualties, the Americans some 700,000. Discipline in the Red Army was extraordinarily harsh and summary executions were common. As in the Wehrmacht, members of the Red Army were motivated by patriotism, ideological conviction and small-group loyalty, but most of all by fear -- of the enemy and of their own regime.
 As Hastings shows in harrowing detail, war in the east was significantly more brutal than in the west. Casual-ties were higher, the treatment of prisoners worse, atrocities against civilians more common. Of the 50 million people who died in the war, roughly half were citizens of the Soviet Union. As the Red Army moved into German territories, it exacted a frightful revenge. Pillage, murder and mass rape made a living hell for anyone unfortunate enough to be in the path of the Soviet advance. In a desperate attempt to escape, millions fled westward in one of the largest population movements in European history; by May 1945, 25 percent of the German population were refugees. Hastings tells the story of this suffering with great sensitivity and skill, fully aware of both its moral complexity and its human tragedy. 
 ''Armageddon'' is a sequel to Hastings's ''Overlord,'' his fine account of the Normandy landings published in 1984. Both books display his distinctive virtues as a military historian: a clear, uncluttered style, absolute mastery of the technical details of combat and the ability to combine an analysis of the strategic situation with vivid descriptions of individuals and events. ''Armageddon'' is a richer, more ambitious, more challenging and provocative book than ''Overlord.'' It gives a fuller account of the human costs of war, raises troubling moral questions and probes the social and cultural forces that sustain and limit the ways armies fight. It is a book anyone with an interest in modern warfare will want to read.

HEADLINE: Poverty Has Grown; Services to the Poor Have Not

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
The word poverty in New York City usually conjures up images of abandoned lots or drug-infested housing projects in the most blighted sections of the Bronx or Brooklyn. 
 But in fact, amid the quiet streets of well-tended single-family homes on the city's most placid island, poverty is growing twice as fast as in those boroughs. 
 On Staten Island, long seen as a fortress for the middle class, the percentage of the population that is poor jumped by 48 percent from 1990 to 2000, the date of the most recent census. That rate of increase is the second-highest in the city, just behind the 50 percent increase in Queens and far outpacing the other three boroughs. 
 With a population of 443,728, Staten Island is still better off in terms of its proportion of poor people. But it is lagging in government and charity services meant to ease the struggles of the needy. 
 For the roughly 56,000 people on the island who are poor enough to qualify for government benefits, the island has only one city office to accept applications for food stamps and welfare. It has no publicly financed shelter beds for homeless men, no offices for free lawyers for immigration issues, and no city hospital. A study by the Food Bank of New York found that Staten Island's soup kitchens and food pantries were among the least well financed and kept comparatively short hours. A national survey released last month by the Low Income Housing Coalition found that Staten Island was second only to Caddo Parish, La., in the numbers of renters who live in severely unaffordable conditions -- renters, in other words, who spend over half their income on housing and utilities.
 ''Historically, Staten Island has always had to fight for its fair share,'' said Michael E. McMahon, who was born and raised on the island and represents its north shore on the City Council. ''But it has been particularly challenging to convince my colleagues on the Council and in the administration that we need services like this. The stereotype is that we are a middle-class enclave, and it is wrong.''
 The city may have been slow to recognize poverty's rise on the island in part because but the face of the poor is different there than in other boroughs. 
 Some 45 percent of poor people in Staten Island are non-Hispanic whites, according to census numbers, more than in any other part of the city. In the Bronx, by contrast, non-Hispanic whites account for only 7 percent of those in the lowest income brackets.
 Surveys from area food pantries indicate that the poor on Staten Island are more likely to be disabled and less likely to be unemployed. Independently, the pantries also report that they are commonly being used by homeowners, rather than renters or homeless people. 
 Because the needy blend in with neighbors, they have sneaked up on a community that perceives itself as generous and capable of caring for its own without government help. 
 ''It is still very small-town around here,'' said the Rev. Terry Troia, executive director of Project Hospitality, the nonprofit group that is the most extensive provider of poverty services on the island. ''If there was someone sleeping on one of the streets I'd certainly hear about it, because in Staten Island that just isn't done.'' 
 Instead, Ms. Troia said, the homeless men have hidden themselves away in places like the abandoned barge about five feet offshore near Snug Harbor, or in tent communities deep in the woods.
 Ms. Troia said she recently took an accidental dip in the bay trying to persuade the homeless men to abandon the barge for the winter. ''But since I don't really have beds for them,'' she confessed, ''it's a hard sell.'' 
 There are many reasons for the rise of the needy on the island and the increased burden they are placing on services, but local residents repeatedly cite two factors that have long affected other areas of the city but have arrived here only of late: soaring rents and large settlements of immigrants.
 Before the 1990 census, Staten Island was a relatively homogenous community compared with the other boroughs. Now, however, it is home to significant clusters of Liberians and Albanians. During the 1990's, Mexican Indians transformed Port Richmond Avenue, a shopping thoroughfare on the north side of the island, turning blighted storefronts into fruit stands, restaurants and dress shops.
 But unlike other boroughs teeming with immigrants, Staten Island has fewer of the services these populations rely on to get on their feet. There is a shortage of lawyers, for example, to help poor people navigate destabilizing events like disputed disruptions in welfare checks, homelessness and run-ins with child welfare officials. The dearth of lawyers handling green cards and deportation hearings is particularly severe.
 ''Look, there is a nationwide shortage of legal help for immigrants,'' said Roberta Herche, vice president for planning and development at the New York Association for New Americans, a nonprofit group that provides social and legal services. ''But because of the sheer mass of immigrants in Queens and Brooklyn, service providers readily go there. Not as many people know about the Liberian refugees in Staten Island. It is not known as a borough of immigrants.''
 Food pantries in Staten Island have budgets that are, on average, a quarter of those in Manhattan, and as a result they have to ration food and are able to keep only limited evening and weekend hours. Those are often the only times when working immigrant families can come in.
 Access to food pantries is further complicated because the island is less densely populated than other areas of the city. On a recent afternoon, Bill Shook, a 52-year-old white man with a long droopy mustache, said he had traveled 45 minutes by bus to a soup kitchen in Stapleton, a mile from the ferry. 
 ''There is really nothing over near me; it's a middle-class neighborhood,'' he said. ''I come here because I like to socialize with other people in my situation and also because the food is excellent.''
 The rapidly rising housing costs that have affected the entire metropolitan region have been particularly acute for the poor on Staten Island because there are only a handful of public housing projects on the island and it has the city's smallest supply of rent-regulated private apartments. Throughout Port Richmond, a neighborhood of trim little houses that were built for single families, working people live three or four families to a house. They often cut back on food or medical care to pay the rent. 
 ''Staten Island has one of the worst matches between what renters can afford and what rents cost of anywhere,'' said Danilo Pelletiere, research director of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The group, based in Washington, does advocacy and research; its report in November focused on rent disparities in the 400 most populous counties across the nation.
 Estela, who emigrated from Mexico four years ago and asked that her last name not be used because she is here illegally, owns a popular restaurant but shares a three-bedroom apartment with 14 people and sleeps in a room with her three sons. 
 ''It is impossible for one family to pay rent for one apartment here,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Glad Tidings for Women: The Christmas Tree Men

BYLINE: BY JENN BAIN AND MOLLY ROSE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
ONCE a year, something magical happens in New York. The metrosexuals, the unemployed artists and the unattainable are brushed aside. For five short weeks, the real men are in town. 
The Christmas Tree Men. They hail from Montreal, upstate New York and even Brooklyn. They are rugged and good-looking, and if you hurry, you might still find one packing up the remains of the holiday.
 Some women like them because they are reliable. ''He is there when I leave for work and when I get home at night,'' Sara Booth, a filmmaker, said of the blue-eyed Canadian she often saw on her way to the A train from her Washington Heights apartment. ''I don't always know where my boyfriend is, but I always know where he is.''
 Lindsey Schaeffer, a teacher who lives in the East Village, found them a pleasant break from the pressures of the usual dating scene. ''They see me in sweat pants going to the gym,'' she said, ''and they still smile at me.'' 
 They are almost too good to be true. ''Not only is he nice, burly eye candy, but I know he has a job,'' said Lisa Green, a graphic designer. For a holiday fling, you can't ask for more. 
 Approaching a Christmas Tree Man is easy. Bring an offering -- coffee or a slice of pizza will do. Remember, they are cold, hungry and would probably love to take a shower in your apartment. Here are some of our favorites:


GRAPHIC: Photos: Chris Fleischer, 32, and Mark Rivers, 21 -- 35th Street and Second Avenue -- ''Women get tired of the Wall Street type,'' Chris said. ''They like us because we are out here working with saws and living things. We're kind of rugged dudes.'' If you want to talk politics and religion all night long with these two, simply bring along a bottle of rum.
Jay Bruckner, 19, and James Patrick, 26 -- 20th Street and Second Avenue -- Jay and James are no newcomers to the dating scene. These two have gotten gifts of homemade meatloaf and mashed potatoes from young admirers. They've also been offered kisses in exchange for discounted trees. ''It's kind of like a game,'' James said. ''I know what it means when a woman asks, 'How late can you deliver this tree?'''
Above, Rafael, 27, and Emmanuel Cinta, 29 -- 110th Street and Broadway -- Rafael and Emmanuelle are brothers from Montreal with bewitching smiles. They love New York and want to see more of it. But sadly, they are not available for double dates. One of them will hold down the fort while the other goes out with you.
 Pascal Bergeron, left, 38 -- Essex and Houston Streets -- Pascal has emerald green eyes and a head full of thick, dark hair. He would like to take you to see a foreign film and have a lengthy discussion about it afterwards. His best tip? ''After a delivery, a woman once invited me for wine and cheese -- Manchego and Camembert.'' Pascal has extended his stay a week, so he might just be the New Year's Eve date you've been looking for.

HEADLINE: The Risky Assumption in Social Security Change

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
THE familiar disclaimer in ads for investment vehicles and money managers of all sorts is: ''Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.'' It probably sounds obvious to anyone who has ever played the markets. So why, in proposing changes to Social Security, has the White House ignored that counsel?
 When President Bush set up the Commission to Strengthen Social Security, part of its mandate was to come up with a plan that included individual portfolio accounts. The commission's mathematical models assumed that such accounts would always be split 50-50 between stocks and bonds. In addition, the commission chose to assume that stocks would offer an average annual return of 6.5 percent after adjusting for inflation, and that bonds would pay about 3 percent. 
 The assumptions about returns came mainly from historical averages. And to some experts, that seemed reasonable enough. ''I'm not sure what else one would do,'' said Robert F. Stambaugh, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''Over long periods of decades, it seems like average returns and risk are fairly stable.''
 Others begged to differ. ''If you look back at what has happened, especially in the last 20 to 25 years, we've had two huge boosts to asset returns, both of which are now spent,'' said Edward F. Keon Jr., chief investment strategist at Prudential Equity Group.
 The boosts that Mr. Keon referred to were the Federal Reserve's successful war against inflation and an upward trend in companies' profitability. ''When profitability is high, it tends to fall, when it's low, it tends to rise,'' he said. ''Future profit growth is likely to be less than the profit growth over the last 50 years.''
 Taking a longer view, Mr. Keon said, a third factor has bolstered returns over the last century: the doubling of the average valuations of companies, as measured by price-to-earnings ratios. ''Back in 1926, the price-earnings ratio was roughly half what it is today,'' he said. ''Putting aside whether you think this change in valuation is sustainable, I don't know anyone who thinks it's going to double again.''
 Taking those factors together, Mr. Keon predicted that returns from the stock market in the next 40 to 50 years would be only about two-thirds as high as the estimates used by the commission.
 Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, offered another reason for pessimism on both stocks and bonds. ''Our view has been that the No.1 rule of investing is that returns on capital are highest where capital is scarce,'' he wrote in an e-mail response to questions. ''Right now, courtesy of the Fed's liquidity and their encouragement of investors to take more risk, there is no asset class that is starved for capital. That's why we think asset returns, across the board, will be muted relative to current expectations for perhaps quite some time.''
 Given that some of the most senior people who earn their money predicting the stock market are so bearish, why have historical returns received so much attention?
 Part of the reason may have to do with the lack of a clear alternative, Professor Stambaugh said. ''There could be times where one might forecast stock returns to be either above or below their long-run average for the foreseeable future,'' he said. ''It's one of the areas in academic finance that's under debate. People are working on it to see if they can derive a compelling model.''
 Another explanation could be human nature. ''We know that, in general, people tend to extrapolate too much from the past,'' said Shlomo Benartzi, an associate professor of accounting at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in behavioral approaches to finance. ''They invest a lot of their retirement funds in company stocks because they did well in the past.''
 That can be a lousy strategy, since stocks that have been popular among investors, giving them high market values relative to their assets, tend to pay lower returns than stocks for which the reverse holds true.
 Regardless of one's expectations about the performance of the markets, these layers of uncertainty may mean that another one of the commission's assumptions -- a portfolio holding 50 percent stocks and 50 percent bonds -- might not be appropriate.
 Bernard Dumas, a professor of banking at Insead, the French business school, argued against assuming any fixed percentage in stocks or bonds. ''The information is not available to make this sort of decision now,'' he said.
 Professor Dumas asserted that the markets were so challenging that investment decisions should be left to professional managers, whose pay should be determined by the size of the dent they made in Social Security's massive liabilities. ''We should not let individuals make that choice, they are just not equipped,'' he said. ''It's not that I'm against freedom of choice. But we must recognize that some people have expertise that others don't.'' Instead, Professor Dumas suggested allowing savers to choose only a level of risk.
 Though that view may sound discouraging, Dr. Benartzi provides support for it. For instance, he and Richard H. Thaler, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, found that people made fairly arbitrary decisions when allocating money in their 401(k) accounts. When offered a choice between a stock fund and a bond fund, many people chose a 50-50 split. Yet when a second stock fund was added, many investors put a third into each fund and increased their stock holdings rather than opting to keep a total of 50 percent in stocks.
 ''Most people who picked portfolios on their own did not do a good job,'' Dr. Benartzi said. ''Even they themselves, at the end of the day, once provided superior information, rated their portfolios inferior to the average portfolio.''
 He cited numerous other examples of common errors. People tend to put the most money into stocks when equities are likely to be closest to their peaks. And they rarely rebalance their portfolios to maintain fixed ratios between stocks and bonds, as the commission assumed.
 ''IF the stock market would do as well as it did in the last 30 years, by the time people retire, without rebalancing, they might have 90 percent in stocks,'' Dr. Benartzi said. Finally, he added, assuring people of a minimum benefit in retirement -- another part of the commission's plan -- might also lead them to take excessive risks with their portfolios.
 In any case, Dr. Benartzi said, most people would rather have someone else make their investment decisions, and from an economic perspective, that might make the most sense. ''If you have a medical problem, rather than spending seven years to learn to be a doctor, you might as well just pay a doctor,'' he said. ''If you need to figure out a portfolio allocation, then, rather then delegating it, now we're going to force you to spend all the time and learn how to do it? It doesn't seem to be a very efficient use of people's time.''

DATELINE: PLEASANTVILLE 

 BODY:
EVERY few weeks Donna Leftwich drives from her Larchmont home to meet her son, Jim, here at the movies. They often have dinner beforehand at a nearby restaurant, and sometimes there's time to browse in a couple of shops. 
 The Jacob Burns Film Center counts on people like Ms. Leftwich, 58, and her son, a 34-year-old White Plains resident. So does much of Pleasantville, in fact, because it is moviegoers who bring a lot of the bustle to the businesses along its main street. 
 When the center opened in the summer of 2001, organizers hoped they would have about 400 members by the end of the season. To their delighted shock, they had more than 10 times that number by the end of the first year. Regionwide, membership has since grown to 6,000. 
 Ms. Leftwich was among those who joined three and a half years ago. In that time she has seen a series of documentary and animation films that she knows would have been almost impossible to view anywhere else in the county. 
 ''There was a real void,'' she said, as she stood in the lobby of the center one recent evening. ''But I think it is beginning to be understood what a big audience there is out here for this type of thing.'' 
 Back then, a trip to Manhattan was just about the only choice for Westchesterites interested in nonblockbuster-type film. There were a handful of screens showing independent, foreign or simply off-the-beaten-track movies. But the prevailing wisdom was that with the city nearby and transportation available, few movie lovers would ever be tempted by a local venue. 
 The Burns's success has given the lie to that notion; in fact, the county could hold a huge potential audience for something other than Hollywood multiplex flicks. Not only are residents affluent, but many are also highly educated and have lived in New York City, where they grew accustomed to seeing independent films at theaters like the Angelika Film Center, the Film Forum or Lincoln Plaza. 
 ''People move out here when they start children and they continue to have a culture and social life in New York City,'' said Stephen Apkon, the Burns's executive director. ''But as your kids get older, you start to realize that you can't replace having that life where you actually live.'' 
 With this goal in mind, organizers in Pelham have begun their own plans for a regional film center, offering the southern part of the county what the Burns offers the north: independent films in a historically interesting local theater. 
 ''There are fabulous opportunities for programming that otherwise just won't get seen,'' said Maura O'Malley, director of Pelham Picture House Preservation, Inc., the nonprofit group organized to create the theater. ''There is enormous potential here. We're looking at who goes to the movies and how they want to spend their time.'' 
 Peekskill, too, has gotten into the act. Its Paramount Center for the Arts is beginning the second phase of a $1.7 million renovation, restoring the venue to the movie-palace grandeur it had in the 1930's. Both it and the Burns are currently screening silent movies accompanied by live music.
 As the Paramount and the Pelham Picture House project look to the Burns for inspiration in their quest to cultivate the cultivated, so the Burns looks to Manhattan. It maintains a relationship with the Film Society of Lincoln Center that savvy viewers can chart if they pay attention to city film schedules: features often come to Pleasantville just a few days or weeks after being screened on the Upper West Side.
 Since its opening, the Burns has also attracted a growing roster of stars as guests for special events, among them Meryl Streep, Clint Eastwood and Salma Hayek. The center's advisory committee lists Glenn Close, Richard Gere, Liam Neeson, Vanessa Williams and Harvey and Bob Weinstein. Many of its events are invitation-only. 
 In some ways, though, it is the little names that attract people here. 
 ''I like a lot of things that not a lot of other people like,'' explained Mr. Leftwich, who lives just a few steps away from a multiplex in White Plains. He says he regularly makes the 20-minute drive to Pleasantville to see movies that ''won't make it in the big theaters,'' and to attend discussions with directors, writers or historians. 
 And just as the film fare suits more specialized tastes, the accompanying development in Pleasantville has been atypical. There is no Gap, or Barnes & Noble or Starbucks to be found on its main street. Instead the shops that have opened near the Burns are locally owned boutiques and coffee shops. The institution's roots are also close to home: Jacob Burns, whose foundation provided the seed money, was a local lawyer and artist.
 Downtown Peekskill is also big-box-free. Not long ago, said Frances Gibbs, a former mayor who is now vice president for development on the Paramount's board of directors, there were one or two antique shops in the Peekskill area. Now there are half a dozen. 
 ''I don't think a historic town could be or should be a cookie-cutter copy of what is in the mall,'' she said. ''You can go anywhere from New England to California to find that stuff. What you find in our downtown is different.''
 The ambience of Peekskill's area downtown, which is classified as a national historic district, attracts precisely the kinds of businesses and patrons Ms. Gibbs says she had hoped to get when she was in office. These have in turn kicked off several revitalization programs tied to arts in the city. 
 ''The galleries, the restaurants staying busy, the people walking around, all of those things are interrelated,'' Ms. Gibbs said. ''A place that is considered interesting and creative is going to attract something of the same nature.'' 
 All this bodes only good things for Ms. O'Malley of the Pelham Picture House Preservation group. A handful of Pelham residents began toying with the idea of starting an independent film center just as the Burns center was starting off. The Pelham Picture House, which still shows first-run movies on its single screen, was on the verge of being sold and demolished. After some negotiating with the family that owns the building, the group signed a contract to buy it and maintain its use as a theater. 
 Officially incorporated as a nonprofit in July 2003, the group has since raised about $700,000 of the $1.8 million needed to acquire the building by the end of 2005. According to its plans, it will need to raise $9.3 million to meet the goal of opening by early 2007. 
 The architecture firm that designed the Burns's sleek modern interior has drawn up plans for the renovation in Pelham. Like the Burns, the Pelham theater would have three screens, with one larger theater designated for more popular independent films. The building would largely maintain its current look, including stucco facade and fluorescent orange cursive writing that spells out ''Pelham Picture House.'' Expansion would be effected using glass-paneled walls and open skylights. 
 Ann Sorice, president of the preservation group's board, worked a decade ago on a downtown revitalization effort in Pelham. She says that in view of the changes brought to Pleasantville by the Burns, a Pelham film center might very well strengthen any economic upswing. 
 ''This could put us on the map,'' she said. ''Pelham has been a very sleepy little town and waking it up a little bit would be a good thing.'' 
 There seems little doubt that the county can support another film center about a half-hour drive away from the Burns. Mr. Apkon says he would not view it as competition, and Ms. Sorice says its audiences will most likely come from areas like New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and the northern neighborhoods of the Bronx. 
 ''Burns made the case,'' Ms. Sorice said. ''We'll hit a similar juggernaut. We'll get people who love the concept and would love to get up there but don't because of the distance.'' 
 Meanwhile, the Paramount will continue to focus on attracting an audience from Rockland and Putnam counties, in addition to the northern reaches of Westchester. 
 Ms. Leftwich's response to news of the extra cultural offerings gives a foretaste of what each might expect from the public. 
 ''I guess I'd join both,'' she said, ''just because I want these things to be supported.'' Pointing out that the planned Pelham center would be much closer to her home, she added: ''I think eventually I'd have to decide which one was right for me. Maybe I'd do one for a year, and the other one the next year.'' 
 Despite the ever-increasing membership rolls and ticket sales at the Burns, however, as a nonprofit it is not a great economic model, Mr. Apkon said. Along with the Pelham project and the Paramount, it was formed in part to save an old theater. 
 ''We're not a commercial theater, so we know we aren't going to make money on everything we put on,'' said Jon Yanofsky, executive director of the Paramount. ''Not everything is commercially viable, but we have to show it anyway.''
 Like the theaters, the audience is mostly older. Mr. Yanofsky says most viewers at the Paramount are in their 40's or older. 
 ''This is the land of the mass movies and the malls, and so you're never going to get the teenagers to leave that for here,'' said Mr. Yanofsky, sitting on the balcony of theater, which regularly shows live dance, theater and musical performances. ''I'd like to see it to become more acceptable, more of a regular thing to do.'' 
 One way to make that happen is to alter the mix, as the Burns and the Paramount are about to do with the silent-film-and-live-music program. The audiences they seek in this instance are teenagers and their families. 
 ''We aren't trying to replace the multiplex,'' Mr. Apkon said. ''My kids and all the kids that come here are going to continue to see those films, especially considering how much marketing dollars are spent on them.'' But both he and Mr. Yanofsky talk of getting children to ''decode'' what they see and be more open to a slower pace, rather than the breakneck speed of the video games and action movies. 
 ''They have to have introductions to films that are not just explosions,'' Mr. Yanofsky said. ''It's asking a lot of somebody to appreciate a Jim Jarmusch movie with no dialogue for 10 minutes. They are used to images that come constantly and fast. It's like asking them to understand a language they've never heard spoken.'' 
 Yet if they have a chance, he insists, they will be fascinated by the independents -- animated stories, for instance, or old silent films. To that end, the Burns center offers filmmaking programs for children and has created ''visual literacy'' curriculum guides for thousands of county students. (Visual literacy is gained by learning how images and other elements are used in the media.) 
 Also, for the second year, the center is organizing a ''red carpet'' premiere to take place in late January for a group of fourth-grade students from Mount Vernon and Yonkers who have created an animated film. (Red construction paper usually does a stand-in for plush carpet.) 
 But although the high school film club at the Burns is also growing, Mr. Apkon expresses doubt that its weekend crowds will ever be packed with teenagers.
 In Pelham, Ms. Sorice says she plans to tackle the youth problem by conducting focus groups with local teenagers to find out what would attract them. 
 ''We'll see what will engage them,'' she said. ''It might be Godzilla or something more current. I think they'll still see the big blockbusters, but there is a lot more, and they can be interested in both.'' 
 Meanwhile, it seems almost inevitable that as they burgeon, Westchester's arthouses will increase its appeal in the eyes of potential newcomers. Mr. Yanofsky, who is 35, said he had moved to Peekskill from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, in part because of the Paramount and the revitalization it augured. 
 ''Its draw will be that it's a small and diverse city,'' he said. ''That's what will get more people here.''
 Dana DeVito, who teaches art at George Washington Elementary School in White Plains, said the promise of an emerging art scene helped lure her to Peekskill three years ago. She and her husband, a sculptor, own a small art gallery that they run out of a carriage house a few blocks away from the downtown area. 
 ''The Paramount is a linchpin here,'' she said. ''It brings in people who wouldn't normally come to Peekskill, and it brings them here at night and it brings them here on Sundays. The area really depends heavily on that kind of traffic.''
 ''It gives the downtown validity,'' she added. ''It's just as cutting-edge as anything happening in the city.'' 
 By the end of this weekend, the major Hollywood releases will almost certainly report national ticket sales in the hundreds of millions. 
 And on a lively street in Pleasantville, theater officials hope they will bring in the few thousand people they typically get on good weeks.

HEADLINE: The Power of the PowerBar

BYLINE: By Jon Gertner. 
Jon Gertner is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In the days before the Internet bubble, the lives of successful late-20th-century entrepreneurs often seemed to follow a pattern. In the first phase, an ambitious but financially challenged man or woman is turned away by banks, big companies and venture capitalists and told no, no and no again. Such rejections only steel his or her resolve, of course, and so lead to the second phase, in which the single-minded capitalist forges ahead alone -- borrowing, scrimping, hustling -- to create the product everyone has said will fail miserably. In the third phase, he or she enjoys a ''liquidity event'': the thriving business is bought at a huge premium, and the entrepreneur in turn cashes out.
 By the time Brian Maxwell collapsed from cardiac arrest at a Marin County, Calif., post office in the spring at 51, he had sold the PowerBar company he started in the mid-80's and was beginning to enjoy that final entrepreneurial lap. A former marathoner -- in his 20's, Maxwell was ranked third in the world -- he was using his wealth to make generous gifts to his alma mater, the University of California at Berkeley. He was also acting as an investor and mentor to several Bay Area entrepreneurs. Once an upstart, he was now an elder statesman. 
 As business legends go, Maxwell's had unlikely origins -- in fact, it began with a stomachache. While running a marathon in the early 80's, he doubled over in pain and hunger at the 21st mile. He imagined that some kind of energy bar could ease his problem -- it would have to be rich in vitamins, protein and carbohydrates, but also low in fat to be readily digestible. With the help of both a biochemist friend and a food-science student, Jennifer Biddulph, who later became his wife, Maxwell began to tinker in his Berkeley kitchen, using his blender to mix ingredients like oat bran, fructose, milk proteins and maltodextrins into large quantities of bubbling glop; after more than three years of experimentation, he came up with a palatable recipe. He then combined his life savings with some money from his father (he was turned away by several food companies) to produce 35,000 high-energy ''nutrition'' bars on his own.
 Maxwell and Biddulph traveled around California selling the product -- setting up stands at 10-kilometer races, for instance, or hawking bars out of the trunk of their 1964 Ford Falcon to anyone who seemed curious. As business grew, they improved their recipe and began compiling a mailing list of customers. (The postman who took shipments from their apartment suspected that they were dealing drugs, a friend says.) By the late 80's, what was now named the PowerBar had a full-scale production facility in Berkeley; by the mid-90's, the demand required an even bigger manufacturing plant in Idaho.
 Part of Maxwell's legacy is easy to find: it's on display at any grocery store, where PowerBar, once a lone oddity, is now the center of a crowded energy-bar marketplace estimated at more than $640 million in sales per year. Other manifestations of Maxwell's influence are less apparent. For one thing, his company showed that an entrepreneur who understands a market niche can mix dogged salesmanship and savvy promotions to introduce a new product as well as (or probably better than) a big company and a big marketing campaign. By encouraging individual athletes to support his PowerBars and promote the brand, Maxwell helped spread the idea, long before
 viral marketing became a buzzword, that successful athletes depended on a successful nutrition bar. Then, by personally courting athletic retailers from coast to coast and requesting PowerBar displays on their counters, his company capitalized on the product's credibility.
 Above all, Maxwell had the good entrepreneur's knack for creating the right product at the right time. Though convinced that the gooey bars he made would be welcomed by those in competitions -- his cyclist friends riding 100 miles in a day, for instance, or marathoners like himself -- Maxwell never anticipated that office workers would replace their afternoon chocolate or pretzel habit with PowerBars. Yet aren't we all fleece-wearing, Gatorade-drinking achievers now, whether we're triathletes or middle managers? High performance is a goal for even the ordinary.
 Sadly, Maxwell's indefatigable nature led to his demise as well as to his innovation. Told by naysayers that PowerBar as a nutritional idea wouldn't work, he went ahead anyway and proved them wrong -- so wrong, in fact, that Nestle ultimately purchased his company in 2000 for a reported $375 million. Told by doctors as a teenager that he had a congenital heart condition, he became a world-class runner anyway and proved them wrong. For a while, at least.

HEADLINE: Have Yourself a Merry Little Festivus

BYLINE: By Richard B. Woodward

 BODY:
News articles about the Christmas run-up have in recent years taken a turn for the perverse. While it was once common to feel pity for those who couldn't afford to buy gifts for their children, now we are called upon to fret about the health of our local retailers, many of whom, as reporters constantly remind us, earn as much as one-quarter of their annual income during the year's home stretch. Will they meet last year's numbers? That's the anxious question hanging over the holiday season. 
 With economists saluting the consumer as the hero who enables our high standard of living, we increasingly feel it's our duty to buy things we don't need with cash we don't have. And these days, consumerism and national identity have been linked ever more closely. President Bush implied as much in a speech to Congress on Sept. 20, 2001, in which he urged our ''continued participation and confidence in the American economy'' in order to help recover from the terrorist attacks. As the journalist Allan Sloan remarked in this newspaper, the president's exhortation ''conflated patriotism with shopping. Maxing out your credit cards at the mall wasn't self-indulgence, it was a way to get back at Osama bin Laden.'' 
 Consumerism in defense of liberty is no crime in America. Indeed, one of the subtexts in The Business of Holidays (Monacelli Press, $35), the glossy collection of amusing, cynical essays edited by Maud Lavin, is that our grossly commercial approach to celebrations, sacred or profane, may be crass, but is ultimately salutary. Entwining ethnic and religious differences with the ritual of spending or making money, our motley calendar of holidays -+Groundhog Day, Presidents' Day, April Fool's Day, Mother's Day, Gay Pride Day, Labor Day, Ramadan, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa -- is a testament to the bottomless ingenuity of capitalism. 
 For example, in one essay in the collection, Amy Tavormina Fidler writes that the $39.8 billion diet industry now concentrates its advertising on New Year's Day when many women and not a few men traditionally resolve to lose weight. This strategy is diabolically effective because so many of the post-Halloween holidays-including, as she notes, New Year's Day itself -- encourage us to stuff our faces. Within the endless cycle of gorging and purging there's room for everyone to earn a buck.
 Tourists spend an estimated $1 billion in New Orleans during the nearly two-month debauch of Mardi Gras. But perhaps no one has exploited the event more resourcefully than Joe Francis. After studying film and business at the University of Southern California, he built a soft-porn empire with his ''Girls Gone Wild'' videos. Advertised on television more than 40,000 times a year, the series sold 4.5 million copies in 2002 alone. The beauty of his scheme is that he doesn't have to pay his talent; he need only train his cameras on drunken young women glad to flash their naked breasts at Mardi Gras revelers, an American tradition whose origins remain mysterious. Of course, not everyone has applauded Francis' approach. He's awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and enticing underage girls to do grown-up things. 
 National holidays are supposed to dissolve inhibitions and fold isolated individuals into a group. Even holidays that were once declarations of minority pride or separatism have become parties with an open-door policy. Everyone is invited to overindulge on Chinese New Year and St. Patrick's Day. More avocados are sold on Cinco de Mayo than at any time of the year, directly followed by Superbowl Sunday, and only a small fraction are bought by Latinos.
 Candy and greeting card manufacturers have insinuated themselves into various holiday rites, from Valentine's Day to Easter. Jason Warriner's essay relates the story of Peeps, those tasteless dyed-marshmallow chicks produced since 1953 by the Just Born company in Pennsylvania and now an Easter staple. The cute, ubiquitous confections have also spawned Internet sites offering tips on ways to ''torture'' a Peep. Mr. Warriner's favorite seems to be ''Peeps Jousting'': stick toothpicks in a pair of Peeps; place in microwave and set timer for several minutes; whichever Peep engulfs the opponent in hot goo is the winner. (The loser presumably has to scrub out the oven.)
 Eliza Rosen describes the futile efforts by Jewish leaders over the years to dress up Hanukkah, a holiday of minor religious import, with rituals so that it might compete with the razzle-dazzle of the American Christmas. By the 50's, companies were pushing everything from special blue-and-silver wrapping paper to Hanukkah bushes to Hanukkah bush ornaments. But efforts to preserve a distinct Judaic orbit beyond the gravitational pull of Christmas can be gauged by a 1989 item from a newsletter in Suffern, N.Y. It alerts the community to follow Santa Claus in the parade to ''the Village Hall where the menorah lighting will take place.'' 
 Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday is still largely free of ancillary merchandise. Only nonprofit and education foundations may benefit from his legacy. The King family tightly controls his image and words with regular lawsuits against unlicensed profiteers, and groups like the N.A.A.C.P. have spoken out against any hint of commercialization. Yet the absence of a full-blown consumer aura to the holiday may paradoxically prevent King from assuming his rightful place in the nation's life, alongside Washington and Lincoln. After all, you aren't an American icon until your silhouette can be slapped on a newspaper ad to sell a Toyota.
 Of course, there has hardly been a time or place when vulgar worldliness didn't mingle with -- or trump -- holy matters. Chaucer appreciated the joys of consumerism. The pilgrims in his tales are on their way to the shrine of the martyred St. Thomas a Becket at Canterbury, but it quickly becomes clear that a good number are making the journey primarily to eat and drink, slip marital bonds, and swap stories with strangers. 
 Organized religion has always needed revelers. Victor Hugo's ''Notre Dame de Paris'' opens on January 6, 1482, during Three Kings Day and the Feast of Fools. Hugo imagines the scene as a wild religious carnival, with bonfires and a maypole, that is less about prayer than whoop-de-do. 
 Innkeepers are often just as necessary. In Iraq earlier this year the merchants in Najaf couldn't wait for Muqtada al-Sadr and his armed men to vacate the city. Their belligerent presence was ruining the local economy, which relies heavily on income from streams of penitents to the Shia shrines. 
 Americans may have come late to the time-honored tradition of making money on any occasion of the year, but they've certainly embraced it with gusto. In ''The Business of Holidays,'' Alyson Priestap-Beaton writes about Festivus, the holiday invented by George Costanza's father on an episode of ''Seinfeld.'' Celebrated on Dec. 23, in response to the materialism of Christmas, it allows friends to air grievances and ''demonstrate feats of strength'' by hanging in the air while holding on to a bare silver pole, the holiday's only decoration. There is nothing to buy. 
 This didn't stop Ben & Jerry's from capitalizing on the show's immense popularity in 1999 by briefly introducing an ice-cream flavor called Festivus. Festivus is still observed by fans around the country, not to mention memorialized in this book and on the ''Seinfeld'' DVD's. That a fictional, anticommercial holiday on a television show ''about nothing'' would inspire a real holiday and a real product is more than a little bizarre. America's relentless consumption and frivolity may be one reason why the world envies and hates us. But for better or worse, that's who we are. Happy Festivus!

HEADLINE: Back to Russia, With Love

BYLINE: By Peter Landesman. 
Peter Landesman is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Paul Klebnikov was different from other foreign journalists in Russia not because of his brooding determination or his courage -- both of which he possessed in ample supply -- but because he thought of the country as a calling more than as a reporting post. Since the early 90's, he had been exposing in the pages of Forbes magazine the nexus of business, politics and gangsterism in the former Soviet Union with an almost missionary zeal. He knew that such work could be lethal: 10 Russian journalists had been murdered in contract killings since Putin came to power. But Klebnikov believed in Russian redemption. In an editorial in the first issue of Forbes Russia -- which began publishing in April, with Klebnikov as editor -- he declared that Russia had entered a more civilized stage of development. He started telling his friends and colleagues that he was sure the lawless days were over. He was even considering moving his wife and three children from New York to Moscow. But his hopefulness proved ill founded. On the night of July 9, Klebnikov, 41, was assassinated, shot four times from the window of a speeding Lada outside his Moscow office. 
 Those who were closest to Klebnikov understand that his doggedness in the face of grave risk was part of a lifelong quest to explain his personal attachment to Russia. Klebnikov spoke Russian fluently and grew up in New York, a scion of the White Russian diaspora, the czarist aristocracy and intelligentsia who fled the country ahead of the 1917 Revolution. He was raised to remember his revolutionary Decembrist ancestors, exiled in 1826 after being abandoned by their leaders. His great-grandfather, an admiral in the Imperial Navy, was murdered by mutineers during the Revolution. 
 After graduating from Berkeley, Klebnikov joined the Marines' officer training program ''to see if he was as tough as his ancestors,'' his wife, Musa, said. She remembers him describing the point-blank screams of his drill sergeants and the physical drain and that he seemed to glory in having survived it. The Marines offered Klebnikov a commission, but instead he left to pursue a Ph.D. at the London School of Economics. There he wrote his dissertation on Pyotr Stolypin, the Russian prime minister who was murdered in 1911 for his efforts to reform the country. The choice reflected his obsession with a recurrent Russian theme: how good men are often killed for their efforts.
 Klebnikov himself was convinced that a vibrant press in Russia was a necessary agent of reform and an antidote to tyranny. His passion was the chief reason Forbes opened a magazine in Moscow. ''He sensed Russia's troubled past, and he had no illusions,'' Steve Forbes, the president of Forbes, said. ''But he felt there were stirrings of a better modern Russia, and he wanted to encourage those forces. We followed him.''
 In the mid-90's, as a handful of Russians were seizing control of state assets on a scale never seen before, Klebnikov took aim at the king of the so-called oligarchs: Boris Berezovsky. First in a Forbes article and later in a book, ''Godfather of the Kremlin,'' Klebnikov exposed the way Berezovsky and the other oligarchs manipulated, bribed and murdered while consolidating a kind of power that equaled if not trumped that of Russia's president at the time, Boris Yeltsin. In May, in the second issue of Forbes Russia, Klebnikov published a list of Russia's 100 richest people. While an honor in the United States, the list in Russia suggests financial connivance and violence. His final book, ''A Conversation With the Barbarian,'' based on interviews with the suspected Chechen rebel financier Khozh-Akhmed Nukhayev, warned of Christian Europe's vulnerability to Islamic extremism. 
 But Klebnikov himself seemed not to feel threatened. ''He wasn't reckless at all,'' Musa said. ''He was fussy about safety, about his children being dressed warmly, about the door being locked at night. But he was feeling a change in the air.''
 Perhaps the greater measure of Klebnikov's importance was not the anger and sorrow felt in New York's journalistic circles on word of his death, but the grief expressed in Russia. Klebnikov had become a hero to ordinary Russians for speaking the truth in a place where the truth is elusive and dangerous at best. ''At his funeral, at the end, there was a receiving line, an open casket,'' Musa said. ''And this Russian woman came up with hands cupped in front of her and said, 'Forgive us.' She meant forgive us for killing Paul. A foreign journalist became a hero in the country he was writing about. And he went out and got killed for it.''

HEADLINE: The Governor's Five-Casino Monte

 BODY:
This page has long felt that the state plan to allow three gambling casinos in the Catskills could mean real trouble for New York. Gov. George Pataki's latest rethinking of that idea -- five casinos in the Catskills -- certainly will not make things any better. 
 Mr. Pataki, who envisions a network of Indian-owned gambling parlors in the aging resort areas of Sullivan County, has apparently decided that the gambling business will solve a lot of problems in the short term. He and his advisers seem to be betting that the long-term headaches -- the kinds seen in Atlantic City or Las Vegas or Connecticut over the years -- will not happen on his watch. The plan is intended to bring jobs to an area that has been in an economic slump for decades. And if contracts between the state and the tribes are negotiated as advertised, there is the prospect of the state getting a cut of casino profits. 
 There are still many hurdles -- state, federal and tribal -- to clear before the first chip falls. But many are already growing understandably wary, even at the designated site for the nation's newest gambling hub. Anthony Cellini, supervisor of the Town of Thompson and a casino supporter, told The Times that people are getting nervous now that the number of casinos seems to be rising. ''Five casinos could be a problem,'' he acknowledged in a clear example of understatement. 
 For gambling advocates and developers, five casinos is a jackpot. Having a cluster of gambling resorts in one area provides what a casino developer has called a critical mass. This particular critical mass would draw 30 million visitors a year to a leafy rural area about 90 miles from New York City. That's a lot of cars, a lot of buses, a lot of newly addicted gamblers, a lot more crime and instant poverty, more families in trouble, more pawnshops.
 Beyond the question of whether the kind of development that comes with casinos would be in the long-term interest of the Catskills, there's the larger issue of whether the state should be balancing its budget with money from gambling, an enterprise that bears a host of social problems in its wake. Mr. Pataki and his successors in Albany may find that gambling fever exacts a very high price.

HEADLINE: Retro vs. Metro

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 We were pleased to see the review of ''The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America'' (Nov. 28). However, we'd like to correct some misperceptions. 
 Our book argues that current politics is best understood through the lens of the Great Divide in American culture and economics. We argue that the Republicans are the dominant party of the Retro states and are very solicitous of their needs. Like it or not, Democrats must become the party of Metro America -- the interests of which are severely underrepresented in our present government. This does not mean Democrats should abandon their few strongholds in Retro states, but it does require that the party concentrate its resources in Metro states. 
 Solidifying a Metro base is no easy task. The bulk of our book illustrates in great detail the economic interests and cultural factors that led us to classify states as Metro or Retro. As for a moral code, we suggest inclusion, economic and national security, and science to counter the Republican ''values'' of God, flag and family. 
 We are not geographic determinists. We devote a quarter of the book to class analysis and call for strengthening labor unions in the United States through substantial increases in the minimum wage, legislative and administrative changes to increase the ability of workers to organize, and the enormous effort needed to unionize the professional and service sectors. 
 We do not long ''to be the political choice of new-economy winners,'' or seek to identify the Democrats with the new economy. Nor do we advise the Democrats ''to present themselves as the true party of business.'' 
 We do not let the managerial class off the hook, although our emphasis is on the Retro crony capitalist influence in the Bush administration. 
 We do not ''cast conservatism as a superstitious doctrine that undermines our international competitiveness.'' We level this charge at the radical right now running the Republican Party, and provide substantial evidence to support it.
 We are not centrists. In our last chapter we lay out a vision for the Democratic Party based on commonly held values and a progressive agenda derived from this vision.

HEADLINE: Finding the Savers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Quick Way to Build a Nation of Savers'' (Dec. 19):
 The article refers to ''saving'' and ''investing'' as if they were the same thing. The words have different meanings. Investing assumes risk, while savings may not.
 My friend works for a large communications company. His company's 401(k) plan offers one bond fund and four stock funds from the same mutual fund company. No ''savings'' option is provided (such as C.D.'s). Also, there are administrative fees the mutual fund company charges my friend's company, which are passed on to employees' accounts, as well as, of course, the administrative costs of each individual fund. 
 All risk falls on the employees while the mutual fund company (and possibly) the company will profit regardless of the economic climate.

HEADLINE: The Governor's Five-Casino Monte

 BODY:
This page has long felt that the state's plan to allow three gambling casinos in the Catskills could mean real trouble for New York State. Gov. George E. Pataki's latest rethinking of that idea -- five casinos in the Catskills -- certainly will not make things any better. 
 Mr. Pataki, who recently revealed his vision of a network of Indian-owned gambling parlors in the aging resort areas of the Catskill Mountains, has apparently decided that the gambling business will solve a lot of the state's thornier problems in the short term. As for the long-term problems? He and his advisers seem to be betting Mr. Pataki's legacy that those bigger headaches -- the kinds seen in Atlantic City or Las Vegas or Connecticut over the years -- will not happen on his watch. 
 The Pataki casino plan is intended to bring jobs to an area that has been in an economic slump since New Yorkers abandoned the old summer resorts for theme parks and trips abroad. 
 The governor's complicated deals with Indian tribes would also seek to wipe out ancient tribal land claims against the state. And finally, if contracts between the state and the tribes are negotiated as advertised, there is the prospect of the state getting a cut of casino profits and of winning agreements that taxes will be paid on cigarettes and other goods sold on Indian land. 
 So far, none of the five casinos has been built. There are still many hurdles -- state, federal and tribal -- to clear before the first chip falls. But many already are growing understandably wary, even in Sullivan County, the designated site for the nation's newest gambling hub.
 Anthony Cellini, supervisor of the Town of Thompson and a casino supporter, told The Times last week that people are getting nervous now that the number of casinos seems to be rising. ''Five casinos could be a problem,'' he acknowledged in a clear example of understatement. Five casinos will overwhelm Mr. Cellini and his fellow citizens -- their roads, their police, their way of life. 
 For gambling advocates and developers, five casinos is a jackpot. Having a cluster of gambling resorts in one area provides what a casino developer has called a critical mass. This particular critical mass would draw 30 million visitors a year to a leafy rural area about 90 miles from New York City.

HEADLINE: Next Year's Holidays? Better Reserve Now.

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
STUCK at home this holiday season because you tried to book a Christmas week vacation at Caneel Bay in St. John or the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Park City, Utah, last June, and got this response: ''Sorry, we were sold out back in January''?
 Join the crowd. As competition for prime holiday vacation spots becomes fiercer each year, more and more resorts and hotels, particularly those that cater to families, are finding they can fill all their vacancies nearly 12 months in advance, largely from people who return year after year. 
 ''Every guest who comes at Christmas, we ask them when they leave whether they're going to come back next year or not,'' said Eric Calderon, general manager of the Little Nell resort in Aspen, where a ski concierge will warm your boots, chill your skis and tell you which runs are groomed before you hit the slopes. About 90 percent of those guests say yes, he added. (But the resort does allow some latitude: Guests have to pay 50 percent of their room charge upon making the reservation, but the deposit doesn't become nonrefundable until 45 days before arrival.) 
 That time of year is so popular, Mr. Calderon said, that there is almost a waiting list for the waiting list. ''It takes some guests years to get in at Christmas,'' he said.
 That's because even though anyone can ask to be put on the waiting list for the coveted Christmas-through-New Year's time slot, when the resort starts filling any vacancies, it gives preference to people who have stayed at the Little Nell before, and those planning longer visits.
 At the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Deer Valley, Utah -- where about 60 percent of holiday guests are repeat customers -- even those checking out after the holidays have to put their names on a waiting list for the next year (the staff begins taking names on Dec. 25). Although the Stein Eriksen is technically fully booked by January, rooms aren't allocated until the beginning of summer, first to repeat guests, then those staying the longest or seeking the largest units, said Allie Kelly, the lodge's marketing specialist. (Suites go as high as $5,000 a night at Christmas).
 Guests must pay in full by September with little tolerance for a change in plans. ''Ninety days prior to arrival, we confirm the reservation, at which time the full amount is nonrefundable,'' Ms. Kelly said. ''Which is too bad, because occasionally we do get a cancellation and they're out $30,000,'' she added.
 But some resorts are more understanding of a last-minute wrench in a family's travel agenda. At Caneel Bay, Las Ventanas in Los Cabos, Mexico, Little Dix Bay in Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands, and Jumby Bay, off Antigua, (all managed by Rosewood Resorts and many of them sold out for the holidays by Jan. 1), hefty deposits are technically nonrefundable well before arrival. For instance, Little Dix Bay asks for a nonrefundable deposit of 50 percent of the total room charges by Dec. 1. 
 But Bob Boulogne, vice president of sales and marketing for Rosewood Resorts, said that policy isn't necessarily so strict if a regular guest has to cancel. ''If we did ultimately resell the room, we would probably refund the money,'' he said. (Holiday rates for the resorts vary depending on the room type, but ocean-view rooms generally range from $775 to $1,200 a night. Call Jan. 1 to add your name to the waiting list.)
 If you're just not ready to think about December 2005 a year in advance, all is not lost -- there are plenty of desirable hotels and resorts that don't sell out before the ball drops in Times Square. 
 Vivian Deuschl, a spokeswoman for the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, said its Caribbean and Florida properties weren't sold out for Christmas and New Year's until late October (partly because of hurricanes), and Robert Dallain, general manager of the Park Hyatt Beaver Creek, said his holiday schedule is usually locked down months in advance (call early just to be safe; the hotel gets 60 percent repeat guests for that period).
 David Roberts, regional vice president for Fairmont's Hawaii hotels, said the Fairmont Kea Lani in Maui and the Fairmont Orchid on the Big Island didn't sell out for the holidays until early fall and its hotels in the Canadian Rockies (in destinations like Banff, Whistler and Lake Louise) weren't fully booked until late October this year.
 That said, about 60 percent of the holiday guests at the Fairmont Kea Lani are repeat visitors, many of whom rebook before they shake the sand from their sarongs and pack to leave. At that point, a two-night deposit is required, which becomes nonrefundable after seven days; the full payment is due by early July. (Rates for the 2005 holiday season start at $435 a night for a one-bedroom suite.) Shana Passman, who has vacationed at the Fairmont Kea Lani during the holidays for the past 10 years, reserves two suites for the next December as she, her husband and their four children check out each year. They love the resort, and the familiarity of getting the same rooms, but that means forgoing the lure of a new beach or a different sunset.
 ''This year, the truth is, we were thinking about going someplace else -- Costa Rica -- but we didn't get around to booking it,'' Ms. Passman said. ''The nicer places were gone by May, so we decided to keep the reservation at the Kea Lani.''
 Another wrinkle is that most in-demand hotels and resorts require a 7- or 10-night minimum stay at the holidays, although there's occasionally some flexibility on those policies if you're a valued guest. That also means a less valued newcomer may be able to slip into a two-night hole in the calendar say Dec. 28 and 29, created when those on the A-list don't have back-to-back schedules.
 Other strategies to score a spot at the holidays are to build loyalty at a resort by staying there at a less peak time of the year (early December and early January are generally times when even exclusive hotels are looking for guests), or to try for the sister property of a hotel where you're a regular.
 Mr. Boulogne, of Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, said a frequent guest at the Carlyle in Manhattan would be given preference at one of Rosewood's other properties, as opposed to someone who has never stayed at any of the company's hotels. (''We have that information in our database,'' he said.) 
 Resorts usually turn to their waiting lists to fill any last-minute vacancies, but they also reach out to travel agents they deal with regularly. Working with a travel agent may also help you get a reservation earlier in the year. ''If somebody had a great travel agent who was one of our best bookers, they tend to put a little pressure on us,'' Mr. Boulogne said (although agents typically pull those strings for their best clients, and you'll pay a service fee in exchange for their time and connections).
 Of course, a downturn in the economy can create more late-season options, as Bob Young discovered when he first landed a holiday booking at Kona Village in Hawaii. ''Four years ago, my wife kept mentioning we ought to go to Kona Village,'' he said. ''She said, 'You know, the dot-com bubble has broken and a lot of people have lost money, so there could be a cancellation.'''
 Although he didn't call to make a reservation until early fall, there were three cottages available for Christmas that year (2000) on the ocean, no less. The family, now numbering nine, has gone back for the same week ever since.
 But most years, if you wait until after Thanksgiving to make your December plans, you'll probably find the pickings slim.
 ''For a four-star luxury all-inclusive resort, by the last week in November, I couldn't find a thing,'' said Maureen Taran, a New Yorker whose search for a late holiday getaway with her boyfriend was turning up only shared bathrooms and expensive plane tickets. 
 Ultimately, she threw in the towel or more precisely, put the beach towels away until next year. ''Now, we're just trying to figure out the best way to relax in the city,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Rockers: Take Two

BYLINE: By HUGH HART

 BODY:
AGING gracefully in public is a tricky proposition for most performers, but two 40-something rockers plan to shift gears, midcareer, by ringing in the new year with their own TV shows. On a recent afternoon in Los Angeles, the singer Vince Neil, 43, rehearsed with Motley Crue in preparation for the band's forthcoming reunion tour. He's been surgically ''refreshed'' courtesy of ''Remaking,'' a new reality-based series from VH1 that has its premiere on Saturday at 9 p.m.
 A few blocks away, the former punk-band front man Henry Rollins, 43, sat in his Hollywood Boulevard headquarters surrounded by half-empty cups of coffee and a 10,000-CD collection to talk about his new role as resident movie critic on ''Henry's Film Corner,'' shown the first Saturday of each month on the Independent Film Channel. 
 ''I've done a lot of rock 'n' roll,'' said Mr. Rollins, who joined the hard-core punk group Black Flag in 1981 and later led Rollins Band. ''But I've also written 14 books. I do 90 to 100 speaking dates all over the world every year. I have a radio show. I've acted in 20 films. I'm not really an actor, but I've learned how to hold my own. So if I can talk about films I'm enthusiastic about and directors that I'm really geeked on, then why not do it? This is not about Rock 'n' Roll Boy reinventing himself. This is: 'Fan Boy gets a show.'''
 In this Saturday's ''Corner'' -- the second of the series -- Mr. Rollins and Daryl Hannah will discuss Kevin Bacon's gritty new film,''The Woodsman.'' Ordinary people get to weigh in as well. A high school economics teacher will offer his take on the new ''William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice'' movie and a group of boxers, all women, will critique the 2000 movie ''Girlfight.'' In the Dec. 4 premiere episode, firefighters reviewed ''Ladder 49.'' 
 Besides serving as genial host, the fiercely opinionated Mr. Rollins displays his prowess as a free-associating wordsmith in a couple of unscripted rants called ''Teeing Off'' and ''Rollins' Revenge.'' ''I'm just winging it,'' he said. ''We do four takes and whichever one gets the biggest laugh and the loudest claps from the crew behind the camera, that's the one we use.''
 Mr. Rollins downplayed his qualifications as an official, bona fide reviewer. ''I don't want to be a film critic,'' he said. ''I'm not a Siskel-Roeper kind of guy.'' He credited his informal film education to a succession of cinema-loving roommates and musicians. ''My roommate Maya had me watch 'Yawl,' this film from Turkey: mind blown. The guitar player in my band hipped me to Kurosawa. 'Here's ''Seven Samurai'' -- Shut up and watch.' I became a huge fan of Kurosawa, Fassbinder, Wim Wenders, Coppola. We ended up digesting tons of movies, which makes me no expert, but it sure makes me love a good film.''
 Mr. Rollins isn't the only rocker who has used music as a springboard to other creative ventures. Michael Stipe produces films when he's not singing with R.E.M.; the former teen idol Shaun Cassidy produces television dramas. Kinky Friedman, ex-country singer, writes crime novels. The pop rocker Greg Kihn deejays for a San Jose radio station. Charlotte Caffey, former guitarist for the Go Go's, is working on a stage musical about the porn star Linda Lovelace. The 70's folk diva Joni Mitchell paints. Puffy Combs designs clothes. Rupert Holmes survived ''The Pia Colada Song'' to write novels and plays, including the music, book and lyrics to ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood.''
 In recent months, TV has become an especially hospitable environment for moonlighting musicians. The Sugar Ray singer Mark McGrath is the co-host of the syndicated entertainment news show ''Extra''; the singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb has a cooking show with Dweezil Zappa on the Food Network; and Mr. Neil's Motley Crue bandmate Tommy Lee will attend college in Lincoln, Neb., for his own reality series on NBC next summer. 
 Mr. Neil, on the other hand, will star in his own physical transformation on Saturday. ''Remaking,'' he said, reminded him that survival in the image-conscious pop music world often hinges on a well-timed makeover. For those who hesitate, there's VH1. The network is working on future ''Remaking'' interventions for Vanilla Ice and the R&B belter Taylor Dayne. 
 ''You have to keep changing,'' Mr. Neil said. ''If you look at Motley, we looked different on every single album. 'Shout the Devil' was leather and devil costumes. Then we were the glam boys in pink and white and frills. On the next album, 'Girls, Girls, Girls,' we're bikers. So me and the other guys, we always kept changing.''
 Mr. Neil admitted he'd grown a little complacent, and chubby, in recent years. ''I was about 15 pounds more than I wanted to be. I'd watch these shows with people who are a bit overweight and I'd think, 'God, I wish something like that would happen to me, to light a fire under my butt and get me into the gym.'''
 That's precisely what happened last February, Mr. Neil recalled. ''I'm in South Beach, where everybody looks really good, sitting by the pool with a cocktail when I get this phone call from VH1 and my managers.''
 They explained the concept and Mr. Neil signed on for a 90-day transformation. As cameras rolled, he changed his hair color from blond to brown, sang his first power ballad, stopped drinking vodka, gave up junk food, lost 30 pounds and spent at least eight hours under the knife. ''They did a lot of things,'' Mr. Neil said. ''Brow lift, upper-lower eyes, partial face-lift, cheek implants, nose job, jaw line sculpturing. A lot of people think once you get that kind of surgery you turn out looking like Ethel Merman, and it's not like that. You look refreshed, like every night you've had a great night's sleep.''
 Getting plenty of shut-eye would have ranked as a fairly low priority back in the 80's, when Mr. Neil and his Motley Crue bandmates excelled in the sport of extreme partying. But Mr. Neil said he was ready to embrace the regimen advised by his team of consultants -- with one exception, when he just said no to the Life Coach. ''When I got to this leadership seminar,'' he recounted, ''they were like drill sergeants, screaming at each other, and they want you to scream back at them. I got hoarse the first night. I was still on tour at the time. I couldn't see myself screaming for the next few days, so I was like, 'I can't deal with this. I've got shows to do.'''

HEADLINE: 'Magic' Fuel-Saving Buses Fall a Bit Short on Wonders

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
The fleet of hybrid buses that General Motors promised would save Seattle more than 750,000 gallons of fuel a year will actually save less than half that amount, according to the fleet operator, and although G.M. said the hybrid buses would show a fuel economy improvement of up to 60 percent, the savings around the country appear to be in the range of 10 percent to 20 percent, transit managers say.
 General Motors, which got a late start bringing hybrid technology to market in cars, has argued that buses are a better vehicle to convert to hybrid drive, because they are used more heavily than cars.
 ''We decided we would go after hybrids by going after the highest consuming vehicles first'' because that would save the most petroleum, said Tom Stephens, a G.M. vice president for powertrains. 
 The company is also creating hybrid versions of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, although their hybrid systems are relatively small adjuncts to the gasoline engines.
 But the fuel savings for G.M.'s bus hybrids, which it named ''magic buses,'' are more modest than for some bus hybrids already in use, and even at the current elevated price for diesel fuel the savings are unlikely to repay the cost premium for a hybrid, about $200,000, experts say. There are other benefits, however, including lower maintenance costs and smoother, cleaner operation. 
 All hybrids are powered by both an internal-combustion engine and an electric motor, but G.M. chose a ''parallel'' approach, in which the engine and the electric motor turn the wheels simultaneously, a technology more suited for freely flowing traffic. Some bus agencies report greater fuel savings using a ''series'' hybrid, in which the engine is connected only to an electric generator, with all the power to the wheels coming from an electric motor.
 Some of the best results for hybrid buses have been for series hybrids running in extremely congested cities. New York City, for example, has more than 100 series hybrids on the streets and next month will begin receiving the first of an additional 200 buses with a hybrid drivetrain built by BAE Systems of Johnson City, N.Y., with a fuel savings of 35 percent to 45 percent, according to transit officials. 
 Electric motors excel at getting a heavy bus moving from a standing start, and when it is time to stop again -- which in New York is often only a few yards later -- the hybrid system recaptures a lot of that energy by converting the momentum of the bus into electric current, which flows back into the batteries. The batteries are also directly charged by the diesel engine.
 But the series system is not well suited to buses in highway use, experts say, because converting the energy from the diesel engine into electricity, and then putting the electric current through a motor to turn the wheels, is not as efficient as simply connecting the diesel engine to the wheels through a conventional transmission. In the parallel system, the bus wheels are driven by both a conventional transmission and an electric motor. Either type can reduce air pollution, by cutting the amount of time that the diesel engine operates at very high strain and low revolutions per minute. As is obvious to any urban pedestrian, that is when diesels give off great clouds of dark smoke. With an electric motor to assist or take over at start-up, though, the diesel engine can run at a higher speed and lower strain, a range in which it is cleaner. 
 The buses in Seattle, which ordered 235 hybrids, were chosen mostly for cleanliness, said Jim Boon, the maintenance manager at King County Metro Transit. The buses go through a tunnel under the downtown section, a little more than a mile long, which has limited ventilation. 
 "We're quite happy, actually,'' said Mr. Boon. "We did not buy these for fuel economy." According to G.M., both the company and the King County transit authority concluded from early tests that a fuel savings near 60 percent was possible.
 Connecticut Transit, a state bus agency, is running two 40-foot buses with the G.M. hybrid transmission. They started in Hartford and have been running in Stamford since June. Stephen W. Warren, the assistant general manager for maintenance, said that drivers and customers liked them because they were smooth and fast. But, he added, ''We were slightly disappointed with the fuel economy,'' which he said was 10 percent to 15 percent better than new buses of conventional design.
 New Jersey Transit runs seven of the buses. The agency bought them believing they would save 20 percent to 40 percent on fuel, and the actual savings have been at the bottom of that range, said Penny Bassett Hackett, a spokeswoman. New Jersey paid $600,000 to $800,000 extra for each of its buses, and had no possibility of earning that back, she said, but paid for the extra cost with a grant meant to stimulate new technologies. ''The buses are achieving what they are intended to do, and that is emissions reduction,'' Ms. Bassett Hackett said.
 At the American Public Transit Association, an association of transit agencies based in Washington, Lurae Stuart, senior project manager of Bus Technical Programs, said: ''We don't define 'good' as fuel economy. We define good as the combination of emissions, brake savings and acceleration, which saves time and scheduling.'' 
 Still, many experts expected the hybrid to do better, and they disagree about why it does not. Mr. Boon, of Seattle, said that at the time his agency switched buses, it also switched to new engines, which comply with a 2004 Environmental Protection Agency standard for reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides and soot, and that the new engines were less fuel-efficient than the old ones. In fact, he said, an old engine would make the hybrid nearly 60 percent more fuel efficient. 
 But Caterpillar, the company that makes the engine used in the Seattle buses, said that while some competitors' engines that met the new standard were about 5 percent less fuel efficient, its engine used a different approach, which it has patented, that unlike the others did not reduce fuel economy. 
 An E.P.A. spokesman, John Millett, said his agency certified the engines only for emissions, not fuel economy, and did not know what effect, if any, its requirements had had on mileage. A more stringent set of emission rules takes effect in 2007.
 At General Motors, Larry Nitz, director of hybrid powertrain engineering, said the 60 percent estimate was based on a treadmill-type test, and the 750,000 gallon estimate was a separate calculation based on side-by-side tests using a hybrid and a conventional transmission, and older engines. ''I think we're doing what we expected to do in Seattle,'' Mr. Nitz said in a telephone interview.
 Others say that the technology has promise for several reasons, and that fuel economy could improve as the vehicles are tweaked, with better software controlling the hybrid powertrain. 
 In the Philadelphia area, the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is operating 32 G.M. hybrid buses but is not tracking their fuel economy, which would require precise comparison with conventional buses running on exactly the same routes. 
 But Patrick Nowakowski, the assistant general manager of operations, gave an indication of how well the buses were performing. ''We're not getting worse mileage,'' he said, ''but if somebody's justifying the cost differential based on fuel savings, it's a stretch.''

THE DICTATORS
Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia.
By Richard Overy.
Illustrated. 849 pp.
W. W. Norton & Company. $35.
 IN the immediate aftermath of World War II, scholars, led by Hannah Arendt, routinely compared the Nazi and Soviet regimes, labeling them both as ''totalitarian.'' Reacting against this school, a generation of revisionist historians has argued that it is unfair to tar the Soviet Union with the Nazi brush. For all its failings, they claim, the Communist government was distinctly different from Nazi Germany and, they say, it brought positive benefits to the Soviet population. In the United States, and in much of the world, Nazism rightly has served the function of a moral absolute zero -- a standard for evil -- but the Soviet Union brought literacy, urbanization, hygiene and international standing to a country that in 1917 was overwhelmingly backward. 
 The disintegration of the Soviet Union has finally freed historians from this sterile debate. Beginning in 1992 with the publication of Alan Bullock's vast dual biography, ''Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives,'' the comparative approach has returned in force. Now Richard Overy, best known for his fine histories of World War II and Nazi Germany, has weighed in with ''The Dictators,'' the most comprehensive, up-to-date and cogently argued comparison yet published. His approach is systemic rather than biographical: based on a prodigious reading of the scholarly literature, he compares and contrasts key features of the two regimes. The result is a richly insightful study (though one that, to be sure, demands a fairly high level of prior knowledge on the part of the reader).
 Overy understands that the two systems differ, but he concludes that their similarities far outweigh their differences. Both emerged in the wake of the chaos of World War I as a reaction against the apparent failure of liberalism and parliamentary democracy. Stalin and Hitler each saw his dictatorship as ensuring democracy of a higher order. Whereas Western political parties represented faction and class interests, Stalin claimed to serve the needs of the entire working class; Hitler promised that Nazism would free the entire German volk from the humiliations of defeat and the supposed exploitation of international Jewry. And both systems were based on utopian visions that, Overy explains, were ''similar in form,'' if ''profoundly divergent in purpose.'' Soviet Communism promised a ''sociological utopia''; Nazism held out the prospect of a ''biological utopia.'' 
 The two regimes understood where their true enemies lay: in Overy's words, ''the Western liberal ideal of progress, with its emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual, the virtues of civil society and toleration of diversity.'' Hitler's foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, pithily expressed this to Stalin in 1940: Russia and Germany, he wrote, ''were animated in the same degree by the desire for a New Order in the world as against the congealed plutocratic democracies.''
 And the enemies were everywhere. Overy is surely right to argue that Stalin's campaign against the supposed remnants of capitalism was, like Hitler's war against racial and biological enemies, ''an expression of weakness'' and fear, not strength, weakness that led in both cases to the ''empire of the camps.'' 
 Overy is especially strong on the economics of both regimes. Stalin had his Five-Year Plans; Hitler's were Four-Year Plans. In the mid-1930's, seven times as many government bureaucrats worked planning the German economy as were employed in the Soviet Union in the early 30's. Against the stereotypes of Teutonic organization and Slavic disarray, Overy shows convincingly that after the two systems clashed in 1941, the Soviets proved much more efficient than the Nazis. Moscow lost control over some 40 percent of its population and even more of its industrial base, while Hitler could draw on the resources of almost the entire European continent. Still, the Soviet Union outproduced its enemy in the basic sinews of warfare. 
 It is on the question of public commitment that Overy strikes his only unconvincing note. As a specialist in German, not Soviet, history, he exaggerates the extent to which both systems rested on a popular base of support, or at least acceptance. The Nazis came to power through quasi-electoral means. Their backing among ethnic Germans was strong and certainly grew with Hitler's initial successes. Even the terror apparatus depended on the active cooperation of the mass of Germans. Overy assumes that the same was true of Soviet society. 
 But the Soviet situation is more complex. The Bolsheviks came to power through revolution and maintained their grip through a bloody civil war and mass terror. In the only fair election held under the Communists, in late 1917, they polled less than one-quarter of the vote, and support for their rule plummeted during the ensuing years of famine and terror. The peasants violently resisted the lethal collectivization of Soviet farms in the 1930's, when millions died -- violence that Stalin himself compared to the war against the Nazis.
 Millions of Soviets were certainly ardent Stalinists. But other millions were bitter opponents. When the Nazi invasion came in 1941, many viewed the Germans as liberators. Millions of Soviet citizens, many from non-Russian ethnic groups, collaborated with the German invaders or served in the German Army. Overy points to a number of German camps where only a small minority of the prisoners were ethnic Germans (11 percent in Buchenwald in 1944, for example), whereas in 1939, 77 percent of prisoners in Soviet camps were ethnic Russians or Ukrainians. But he misses the significance of these facts: Hitler could rely on the support, at least tacit, of the vast majority of his domestic subjects; Stalin could not.
 The legacy of the two dictatorships is unrelievedly grim, far outweighing any transient social benefits either one conferred. As Overy writes, ''One or the other, they destroyed entire ancient communities, exterminated millions, deported millions from their homelands, uprooted religious belief, destroyed churches, smashed cities into premature ruins and eradicated some of the richest culture of Europe.'' 
 Overy's comparison of the two systems is thorough and persuasive. One thing he does not examine, however, is the two systems' international appeal. Hitler had his foreign admirers and imitators, but this was as nothing compared with the legions of foreign Communists and fellow travelers who idolized Stalin and excused his vast crimes. Perhaps, had Overy examined this question, he could have explained why the hammer and sickle still does not evoke the same shudder as the swastika.

HEADLINE: Finding a Fair Tax Plan

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''What If a Sales Tax Were the Only Tax'' (Oct. 17), an analysis of Representative John Linder's Fair Tax Plan, questions the wisdom of basing revenues solely on consumption. Unfortunately, the points in the article have little to do with Mr. Linder's proposal, and seem designed instead to create another straw man for the political debate over economic policy.
 A reading of the Fair Tax plan would have shown that it addresses virtually all of the issues cited in the critique. No exemptions are needed, because all Americans would receive a rebate covering taxes on spending up to the poverty line. 
 Effective tax rates on spending would go from zero at $25,000 to 21.9 percent at $500,000. Loss of the home mortgage deduction would be compensated by the rebate and by savings from elimination of the income and payroll taxes. Prices would likely go down, as a result of elimination of corporate income taxes, lower administrative costs, and investment from increased saving.
 Reformers have crafted a plan that retains its strength and simplicity yet is progressive in its effect.

HEADLINE: Is There Life After Blackjack? Ask MGM

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
JAMES J. MURREN doesn't play the tables or slot machines. But boy, does he love to gamble.
 About two weeks ago, Mr. Murren, the president and chief financial officer of MGM Mirage, the $4 billion hotel and gambling behemoth, was holding forth in his office here at the Bellagio, surrounded by antique slot machines and talking about his latest bet the way a high-roller might recount the story of a big hand. 
 The future growth of his company, he proclaimed, has little to do with gambling. So instead of developing a new megahotel and casino, he is spending some $3 billion of the house's money on a major real estate play to transform 66 acres on the Las Vegas Strip into a mini-Manhattan. Think condominiums, boutiques, restaurants and movie theaters, all within walking distance. 
 ''You won't see a Wal-Mart, but you will see Whole Foods,'' Mr. Murren said, briefly gazing into his hallway, where part of the movie ''Ocean's Twelve'' was filmed. ''The days of building the Bellagios and the Wynns are over,'' he added, referring to Steve Wynn's newest hotel and casino, which does not even open until April.
 Mr. Murren, whose company is about to complete its acquisition of Mandalay Resort Group and with it control of the city's most celebrated casinos, stands at the epicenter of the gambling universe. So why does he seem so determined to wager on virtually everything but gambling? 
 The answer reflects a new Las Vegas truism: The house may always win in blackjack, but the margins there aren't nearly as good as they are for $10 glasses of Grey Goose and tonic water or a $125 ticket to a Cirque du Soleil performance. Indeed, a quick look at MGM Mirage's revenue shows that the longtime economics of Las Vegas -- give away the food and entertainment to get people gambling -- have been turned on their head.
 ''If you were to look at our company -- putting all the pieces of it together -- 10 years ago about 65 percent or maybe more of our revenue would have been from gaming and 35 percent would have been everything else,'' Mr. Murren said. ''Today, only about 44 percent is gaming. And I bet that if you give us less than 10 years, the whole thing will have completely reversed: 35 percent will be gaming and 65 percent will be nongaming.''
 That is not to say that gambling is a losing business proposition -- in fact, revenue is up. It is just that nongambling revenue has risen a lot more. Consider that the average visitor to Las Vegas last year spent $193.92 on food and drink, $254.18 on accommodations, $83.53 shopping and $44.79 on shows for a total of $576.72 over about four days, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. 
 By comparison, the average visitor who gambled -- about 89 percent of visitors, but that number is steadily dropping -- had a ''gaming budget'' of about $500, meaning the maximum amount they were willing to lose. And those figures encompass the entire Strip, not just the high-end properties that offer visitors plenty of other ways to spend their money.
 Given the trend, Las Vegas may have to reinvent itself again. Part of the problem is that it may have simply run out of new gamblers. ''I think there has been a realization that the market for gamblers coming in on Thursday and flying out on Sunday is finite,'' said David G. Schwartz, coordinator of the Gaming Studies Research Center at the University of Nevada Las Vegas and author of ''Suburban Xanadu: The Casino Resort on the Las Vegas Strip and Beyond'' (Routledge, 2003).
 As Mr. Murren acknowledged, ''No one says, 'Let's go see the next 300 slot machines at Monte Carlo.'''
 IN one of the starkest acknowledgements of this new truth, Mandalay's newest property, called The Hotel, which resembles a giant version of a minimalist Ian Schrager boutique, does not even have a casino in the main building. (It's about a quarter-mile away, at the Mandalay Bay.) And blackjack tables and slot machines are conspicuously absent from the blueprint for Donald J. Trump's planned property in Las Vegas, Trump International. (During the finale of ''The Apprentice,'' you will recall, the winner, Kelly Perdew, turned down the opportunity to help Mr. Trump develop that property in favor of working on his development on Manhattan's West Side.)
 According to Mr. Trump, who boasted that his building would be -- surprise! -- the tallest in Las Vegas, real estate prices have jumped so much that it has become more profitable to simply be a real estate developer in Las Vegas than to run a gambling operation. 
 ''The margins on real estate in Las Vegas are much higher,'' Mr. Trump said. ''Gambling is too competitive.''
 Indeed, real estate prices are booming and appear to be one of the driving forces behind Mr. Murren's goal of creating a dense minicity as opposed to another large hotel and casino complex. 
 ''Steve Wynn bought this land that we're on for less than $500,000 an acre,'' said Mr. Murren, referring to the land the Bellagio sits on. ''That acreage now goes for $25 million an acre. That seven-acre lake out front, if the developers had to do it all over, they would never do that. We've been very piggy with land as a community because it has been so available.
 ''Look at it this way: to build Bellagio today would cost $2.5 to $3 billion for five million square feet,'' he added. The net cost of MGM's project will be about the same for 18 million square feet.
 The project, called CityCenter, will be the largest privately financed development project in the nation. The site, between the Bellagio and the Monte Carlo, is about the same size as Rockefeller Center, SoHo and Times Square combined. The first phase of CityCenter is to include a 4,000-room hotel-casino; three 400-room boutique hotels; about 550,000 square feet of retail shops, dining and entertainment space; and 1,650 luxury hotel, condominium and private residence club units. 
 ''You go to Aspen, they are selling hotel condos,'' Mr. Murren said. ''You go to Disney, they're selling hotel condos. Las Vegas had none of that product.'' 
 But it soon will. MGM is not the only player in the condominium game. More than 30 projects are in the works by an assortment of companies around the area, but most are not directly on the Strip. (Mr. Wynn, too, is expected to develop condominiums on the property behind his new hotel.)
 The inspiration for MGM to go full steam into the real estate business came in part from the company's involvement in The Residences at MGM Grand, a high-rise development under construction. For that project, MGM worked with a real estate developer, Turnberry, but the deal was structured in a way that mostly benefited Turnberry when the real estate market took off. This time, MGM will be in charge, though it does plan to seek partners for some of the projects. 
 Of course, Las Vegas has tried to reinvent itself before, most recently with its failed effort in the mid-1990's to appeal to families with themed hotels and things like the roller coaster at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino.
 Mr. Murren, an art history and urban planning major at Trinity College, said this latest effort was not a revived version of that plan. ''My personal view is that ship has sailed,'' he said of family attractions. ''We're not going to build more themed hotel-casinos.''
 For Mr. Murren, CityCenter is his chance to remake Las Vegas into a cosmopolitan city -- and just as important, keep the city and his current properties filled from Sunday to Thursday.
 ''If we create more volume in off-peak periods by having more people live here, you're going to see food and beverage go up in terms of margin,'' he said. ''It will help all of our buildings and everyone else's that's here too.''
 Mr. Murren, a former Wall Street analyst, describes the project in part as a way to protect the company's investment in its current properties. ''We've doubled down here on Las Vegas,'' he said, referring to the company's acquisition of Mandalay. That deal will give MGM more than half the 72,000 hotel rooms and gambling tables along the brightly lighted boulevard that snakes through the city, including some of its most celebrated properties -- like Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York. Circus Circus and Treasure Island. 
 By building a minicity, he is hoping that one day those properties will be thought as valuable as the Waldorf-Astoria or the Pierre, two storied Manhattan hotels. ''When Wall Street gets that ---- ,'' he says, ending his thought in midsentence.
 In the meantime, he harbors hopes that Wall Street will applaud the company's efforts to diversify its income. 
 Investors typically ascribe significantly higher multiples to luxury retailers and hoteliers than to gambling operations, which have always had a sort of sin discount associated with them, despite the 87.5 percent rise in MGM's shares this year. 
 Just this May, Sheldon Adelson, the owner of the Venetian, sold the Grand Canal Shoppes, a 500,000-square-foot shopping, dining and entertainment space within the Venetian, to an affiliate of General Growth Properties for $766 million, 20 times its annual cash flow. MGM trades at about nine times annual cash flow.
 ''THERE'S no question that one of the collateral benefits of the direction we're going could be a revaluation of our security,'' Mr. Murren said. He acknowledged that when management makes that argument, it sounds ''shrill,'' but he said he thought the move would diversify the company's income beyond that of some corporations that are valued more highly than MGM. 
 ''Intuitively, you would think that we might go higher but you never know,'' he said.
 But the real question will be whether having people living on the Strip will be as profitable as having people jet in for the weekend. Mr. Murren, who had McKinsey & Company study the situation for months (''We spent a fortune on those guys,'' he said), said residents would eventually prove to be more profitable than visitors.
 Others are less sure. Mr. Schwartz of the University of Nevada Las Vegas says he goes to the Strip when he has guests in town. ''Other than that, it's rare.''
 More than 40 percent of the Las Vegas population seldom, if ever, goes to the Strip to gamble, according to a survey conducted in 2002 by Las Vegas Perspective, an annual market analysis. And only 25 percent said they had gone to see a show in the last 30 days.
 But no matter how Las Vegas locals otherwise spend their leisure time, they still have to eat. According to the survey, 61.6 percent went to the Strip to dine. 
 And when people actually live on the Strip, they will need more than food -- toothpaste, for example. A CVS pharmacy on the Strip may be the best proxy for the potential of MGM's new project: its outlet there is one of the most profitable, if not the most profitable, of all of the chain's stores.

HEADLINE: The Allure of Downtown Continues to Attract Uptown

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
FOR some time, Lower Manhattan has been luring Upper East Siders with its loft apartments, spanking new condos, artsy scene and cobbled, sometimes desolate streets. 
 Frederic M. Poses, the chief executive of the American Standard Companies, would seem to have been well rooted in the Upper East Side. He lived in a prewar co-op in Carnegie Hill for several years and is a member of the board of the 92nd Street Y, the neighborhood's cultural mainstay. Now, Mr. Poses, 62, and his wife, Nancy, 56, have traded their eight-room, 14th-floor apartment at 1125 Park Avenue, at 90th Street, for a 5,244-square-foot duplex penthouse atop the Hubert, a new condominium building in TriBeCa, at Hubert and Collister Streets. 
 Records filed with the city show that Mr. and Mrs. Poses paid $12 million for the penthouse apartment in October. A few weeks later, in early November, tax records indicate they sold the Park Avenue co-op to Alan L. Jacobs and his wife, Barbara S. Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs is a principal at Neuberger Berman, the mutual fund company. 
 The records do not show how much Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs paid for the 14th-floor co-op, but the apartment had been listed with the real estate firm Gumley Haft Kleier with an asking price of $4.2 million. Michelle Kleier, the broker who represented the Poses family in both transactions, would not disclose the sale price of the co-op or other details of their relocation. 
 In trading uptown for downtown, the couple are getting views and plenty of space. The penthouse has five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms and is surrounded by a 4,258-square-foot terrace. It occupies the top two floors of the 15-story building. 
 Lisa Glover, a spokeswoman for American Standard, said Mr. Poses was on a boat in the Caribbean and could not be reached for comment. 
 Mr. Poses took the helm of American Standard, which makes air-conditioning and automotive equipment and plumbing fixtures, in 1999. This year he was ranked at No. 87 on the Forbes list of Best Paid C.E.O.'s, with a total compensation of $10.3 million, according to the magazine. Mr. Poses is also on the boards of the Raytheon Company and the Centex Corporation. 
 One of his occasional neighbors at the Hubert will be the singer Billy Joel, who recently bought a $3 million pied-a-terre in the building.

A Year of Rising Prices
 It was a big year for big deals. 
 The biggest of all was the $44 million contract signed by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch to buy the late Laurance S. Rockefeller's triplex penthouse at 834 Fifth Avenue, at 64th Street (below). If Mr. Murdoch is approved by the co-op board, he will probably be able to close the all-cash deal early next year. If the transaction is completed, it will be the highest price ever paid for a residence in Manhattan. 
 In the shadow of Mr. Murdoch's big number, several other noteworthy sales closed this year: 
 Two co-ops logged $25 million sales prices, tying for the second highest-price ever for a co-op closing, according to real estate professionals who track sales data. The first was the penthouse triplex at 740 Park Avenue, at 71st Street, (bottom) that George David, chief executive of the United Technologies Corporation, bought from Mercedes Santistevan de Noboa in June, according to public records and a person informed of the deal. (This is the same building where an apartment once owned by John D. Rockefeller Jr., Laurance Rockefeller's father, fetched $36 million in 2000. Until Mr. Murdoch's purchase closes, the sales price of the elder Rockefeller's apartment will remain the highest paid for a co-op. For the moment, the overall record, $42.25 million, is held by a condo, which was created by combining two units in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle.) 
 The other $25 million co-op was at 4 East 66th Street, at the corner of Fifth Avenue (top right). Howard Solomon, the chief executive of the drug maker Forest Laboratories, which markets the antidepressant Celexa, bought a full-floor apartment there from Leonard Goldberg, a producer and former television executive who was one of the creators of the TV show ''Charlie's Angels,'' according to people informed of the transaction. 
 The town house that sold for the most money this year, based on records filed so far with the city, was Woody Allen's Georgian mansion in the East 90's, which the financier Barry Volpert bought for $24.5 million in July. 
 The highest price paid for a condominium in 2004 was the $20.8 million that Richard P. McWilliam, president of the Upper Deck Company, which makes baseball cards, paid for a 9,455-square-foot, full-floor apartment on the 23rd floor of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Central Park South. It's hard to think of anything in that price range as a bargain, but apartments in the building have moved very slowly since the upper floors were converted to condos in 2001, and the unit bought by Mr. McWilliam had been on the market with an asking price of $28 million. 
 Downtown, the highest price paid for a condominium was the $12 million that Mr. and Mrs. Poses paid for their penthouse at the Hubert.
 Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, said the year's galloping market has finished strong. Based on data through mid-December, the median price for all Manhattan apartment sales in the fourth quarter was $675,000, 38 percent higher than the $490,000 median price for the same period a year ago, he said. 
 Much was made earlier this year when the average sales price for all Manhattan apartments passed $1 million, driven by the top end of the condominium market. But now, Mr. Heym said, the average price of both condos and co-ops appears to have surpassed the seven-figure mark for the first time. 
 Preliminary calculations put the average price for closed Manhattan co-op sales from October through December at $1,020,202, compared with an average of $758,476 a year ago, an increase of around 35 percent. 
 ''Condos were the big story for most of the year, and I think now co-ops are showing higher increases,'' Mr. Heym said. ''Now the co-ops have kind of stepped on the gas a little bit.'' 
 The average sales price for all apartments in the last three months of the year was $1,052,155, although the numbers could change slightly based on additional sales this month and transactions not yet recorded with the city. The average sales price for condos was $1,132,703. 
 Mr. Heym said there's no reason at this point to expect the market to dip in the new year, although prices probably will not rise at the same pace. ''There's no big glut of inventory, interest rates are still low, people are working,'' he said. ''The fundamentals haven't changed.''

HEADLINE: Sunday News Quiz

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
My wife constantly regales me about her favorite National Public Radio show, ''Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.'' The show features three journalists who have to answer questions about the week's news. Some of the news stories they are quizzed about seem totally unbelievable, while others are straightforward. Well, this is my last column for 2004, so let's play a little ''Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.'' I'll give you 10 news stories from the past few weeks and you tell me what they all have in common. 
 1. The report that Colin Powell told President Bush a few weeks ago that we do not have enough troops in Iraq and that we don't control the terrain. 2. The report that the Pentagon's $10 billion-a-year effort to build an antimissile shield, and have a basic ground-based version in place by the end of this year, ran into difficulty two weeks ago when the first test in almost two years failed because the interceptor missile didn't take off. 3. The report that the Bush-Republican budget for 2005 contained a $100 million cut in federal funding to the National Science Foundation. 4. The report that at a time when young Americans are competing head to head with young Chinese, Indians and Eastern Europeans more than ever, the Bush team is trimming support for the Pell grant program, which helps poor and working-class young Americans get a higher education. (The change will save $300 million, while some 1.3 million students will receive smaller Pell grants.) 
 5. The report this month that children in Asian countries once again surpassed U.S. fourth graders and eighth graders in the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. (U.S. eighth graders did improve their scores from four years ago, but U.S. fourth graders remained stagnant.) A week earlier, the Program for International Student Assessment showed U.S. 15-year-olds scoring below average compared with those in other countries when asked to apply math skills to real-life tasks, the A.P. reported. 6. The report this month that the Bush administration has reduced America's contribution to global food aid programs intended to help the world's hungry feed themselves. (The Bush team said the cut was necessary to keep our deficit under control!) 7. The report that U.S. military spending this year is running at about $450 billion.
 Wait, wait, don't go way; there's more: 8. The report that Donald Rumsfeld was confronted by troops in Iraq about the fact that they did not have enough armor on their vehicles and were having to scrounge for makeshift armor to protect themselves. 9. The report that among President Bush's top priorities in his second term is to simplify the tax code and to make the sweeping tax cuts from his first term permanent. (The cost to the Treasury for doing so, the A.P. reported, would be over a trillion.) And finally: 10. The report that the U.S. dollar continued to hover near record lows against the euro. 
 So what is the common denominator of all these news stories? Wait, wait, don't tell me. I want to tell you. The common denominator is a country with a totally contradictory and messed-up set of priorities.
 We face two gigantic national challenges today: One is the challenge to protect America in the wake of the new terrorist threats, which has involved us in three huge military commitments -- Afghanistan, Iraq and missile defense. And the other is the challenge to strengthen American competitiveness in the wake of an expanding global economy, where more and more good jobs require higher levels of education, and those good jobs will increasingly migrate to those countries with the brainpower to do them. In the face of these two national challenges, we have an administration committed to radical tax cuts, which, one can already see, are starting to affect everything from the number of troops we can deploy in Iraq to the number of students we can properly educate at our universities. And if we stay on this course, the trade-offs are only going to get worse.
 Something has to give. We can't protect America with the grand strategy George Bush has embarked on and strengthen our students with the skills they need and cut taxes, as if we didn't have a care in the world. 
 If we were actually having a serious national debate, this is what we would be discussing, but alas, 9/11 has been deftly exploited to choke any debate. Which reminds me of my wife's other favorite NPR radio show. It's called ''Whad'ya Know?'' It always opens the same way. The announcer shouts to the studio audience, ''Whad'ya know?'' And they shout back. ''Not Much. You?''
