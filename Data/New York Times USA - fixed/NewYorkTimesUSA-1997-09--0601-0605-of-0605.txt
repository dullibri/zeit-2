Statistics Indicate Prosperity

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
In another sign of renewed prosperity, the median income of New Jersey households during the past two years averaged $46,345, second only to Alaska among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to figures released yesterday by the United States Census Bureau. 
 The report also showed that an average of 8.5 percent of New Jersey residents were living below the poverty line during 1995 and 1996, the fourth-lowest average in the country. New Jersey is in the lower half of the pack when it comes to health insurance, however, with 15.5 percent of the state's residents still lacking any coverage. Thirty-five states had higher rates of coverage.

Comptroller Reviews Tax Breaks and Jobs

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a mixed job review for the city's Economic Development Corporation, Alan G. Hevesi, the New York City Comptroller, said yesterday that most of the large companies that have received tax breaks in exchange for keeping jobs in the city have honored their commitments.
But if the companies were not living up to their word, he said, the city might not know. That is because the Economic Development Corporation, charged with negotiating the tax breaks, has not followed up by monitoring the recipients' employment practices. 
 "E.D.C. must improve its monitoring of companies so that it can confirm these facts itself, rather than having my auditors do it," Mr. Hevesi said.
In a study, the Comptroller's staff looked at 13 of the largest companies that had received tax breaks -- a combined total of $258.1 million -- during the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Such breaks have become increasingly commonplace for companies that threaten to move jobs out of the city, but they have been criticized as a form of corporate welfare.
Most of the companies in the study satisfied a central requirement of the tax break policy: maintaining or increasing New York employment. Eight of the companies exceeded the employment levels they had promised, and two -- Avon and Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette -- added so many jobs that they qualified for additional tax breaks, the study found.
Five of the companies did not keep their employment promises, and one, the Republic National Bank, cut its work force steeply in 1996. The study found that the Economic Development Corporation was aware of the decline, and revoked 1996 tax breaks valued at more than $2 million that the bank was to have received.

HEADLINE: France Scoffs At U.S. Protest Over Iran Deal

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Lionel Jospin, the French Prime Minister, said today that he rejoiced in a $2 billion contract signed between a leading French oil company and Iran to explore natural gas fields and rejected what he called American attempts to impose its laws on the world.
"Nobody accepts that the United States can pass a law on a global scale," said Mr. Jospin, a Socialist. "American laws apply in the United States. They do not apply in France." 
 Nevertheless, the United States indicated today that it would invoke the Iran-Libya sanctions act, passed by Congress last year, which authorizes the President to impose sanctions on any company investing more than $40 million in either country because of their ties with terrorism. At a time when the Clinton Administration has expressed concern at what it sees as Iran's efforts to build a nuclear arsenal, the French decision to pour money into Iran is particularly sensitive.
Mr. Jospin said the Total Oil Group, which signed the contract on Sunday, was a private company and made its own decisions. But, he added, "personally I rejoice in it."
The disagreement appeared to open another stormy chapter in relations between the United States and France at a time when officials on both sides of the Atlantic have been trying to paper over the cracks. France, more than any other nation, has expressed alarm at American domination in what it calls a "unilateral world" and has expressed a determination to stand for a different economic model and a more multilateral global order.
Officials said France was confronted last week with a formal American protest urging the Government to stop the contract, but ignored the plea, delivered to the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, by the American Ambassador to France, Felix G. Rohatyn. Mr. Rohatyn's protest reflected the American view that the contract "represents a terrible precedent and should be stopped," an official said.
The French Government warned the United States today not to retaliate, but the Clinton Administration vowed to "take whatever action is appropriate under the law."
A spokesman for the European Union in Brussels said any American retaliation would be "illegal and unacceptable."
The exchanges underscored the marked divergence between Europe and the United States over how to approach Iran. They also revealed the recurrent French irritation -- intermittently shared by other European nations -- at what is sometimes seen as an American attempt to impose its policies in the post-cold-war world.
Defending the contract signed with the National Iranian Oil Company, Jacques Rummelhardt, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said today that it was "compatible with our policy toward Iran." He described the French policy as based on frank political exchange and the conviction that "it is counterproductive to impose restrictions on the development of commerce with Iran."
But in Washington, Christopher Bush, a State Department spokesman, said the United States intended to apply the law fully. "Our position on any investments in Iranian gas and oil fields is clear," he said. "Such investment makes more resources available for Iran to use in supporting terrorism and pursuing missiles and nuclear weapons."
Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economics, might come to Paris soon to express the Administration's irritation.
Total, a private company in which the French state long held a large stake and still retains some shares, last week sold its largest American unit, Total Petrol North America, to Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation in exchange for an 8 percent stake.
Thomas Fell, a spokesman for Total, said that the sale had long been planned and happened on the eve of the signing of the Iranian contract merely by coincidence. The sale would make it more difficult for any sanctions to be applied. Total also has limited interests in petrochemicals in the United States. Under the law, the French company could be denied credits, public contracts and the right to export to the United States, among other measures.
The law, pushed through by Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, has never been applied. Mr. Clinton may decide to waive sanctions in certain conditions, but he would have to demonstrate to Congress that France's policies toward Iran are generally acceptable.
Although American officials said Total was the instigator and dominant company in the transaction, Russia and Malaysia are also vulnerable to sanctions because they have stakes in the project to exploit offshore gas reserves in the Pars-e Jonubi field in Iran.
Mr. Clinton will be faced with the delicate task of steering a course between the outrage of European allies opposed to any extension of American law to their companies and the broadsides that will certainly be led by Senator D'Amato.
Mr. D'Amato said today that Total was trying to "precipitate a dispute" and "should be sanctioned to the fullest extent of the law."
In an interview with the French daily Le Monde, the president of Total, Thierry Desmarest, said the company had the full support of the Government. "These stories about financing terrorism are absurd," Mr. Desmarest said. "Iran produces 3.6 million barrels of oil a day. To say that the complementary production that will come from this new field in four years will permit Iran to finance terrorist actions, while the country gets most of its revenue from current production, has no sense whatsoever."
The new field, whose total reserves are estimated at 282 billion cubic feet of gas, is due to begin production in 2001. The next year, Total and its partners will cede control of production to the National Iranian Oil Company, which will compensate them with oil.

HEADLINE: Luxury Hotel Planned for 55 Wall Street

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Cipriani restaurant family, the owner of Harry's Bar in Venice and two restaurants in Manhattan, is planning to open a luxury hotel and banquet hall beneath the marble rotunda and Ionic columns of the landmark building at 55 Wall Street in the heart of Manhattan's financial district.
The Cipriani family and two investors bought 55 Wall Street yesterday for $27 million. They plan to spend $30 million converting the 155-year-old former bank building into a restaurant and 160-room hotel. The Ciprianis' partners are Sidney Kimmel, an apparel entrepreneur whose company produces a midprice clothing line for women, Jones New York, and T. Richard Butera, who owns the landmark Hotel Jerome in Aspen, Colo. 
 The Wall Street project was hailed as further proof that downtown is recovering from the recession of the early 1990's.
"It's a terrific thing for downtown," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. "It demonstrates the diversification now under way in lower Manhattan and the strength of the hotel industry."
Developers and hoteliers such as the Ritz-Carlton have long sought locations for a small luxury hotel in the downtown market, which is dominated by three large business-class hotels: the Marriott World Trade Center, the Marriott World Financial Center and the Millenium Hilton. The deluxe hotel market is booming, with the occupancy rate averaging 76.8 percent in Manhattan, and room rates at deluxe hotels average $309 a night, a 7.3 percent increase from last year's average, according to hotel consultants at Coopers & Lybrand.
"There's clearly a demand for luxury accommodations down there that is unfulfilled," said Arthur Adler, a lodging and gambling consultant with Coopers & Lybrand.
But some real estate executives question whether there is room for more than one high-end hotel downtown, where occupancy rates fall dramatically on the weekends. The Cipriani project may spoil Donald J. Trump's plans to lure a hotelier into his nearby tower at 40 Wall Street, they say.
The Cipriani family says it has no misgivings.
"It'll be the most exclusive hotel in America, with the most gorgeous banquet hall," said Giuseppe Cipriani, chairman of the Cipriani Holding Group, which also operates Harry Cipriani, a restaurant at the Sherry Netherland hotel on Fifth Avenue, and Downtown, a restaurant in SoHo.
Mr. Butera is enthusiastic about the prospects for converting the striking 30,000-square-foot rotunda, with its 70-foot ceiling, into a banquet hall and the six floors above into hotel rooms. He said the partners have been working with the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which oversees the building's landmark exterior and plans to designate the interior a landmark as well.
"We're custodians of a great property," Mr. Butera said, "and we need to recognize that and treat it with all the sensitivity that requires."
Despite the building's aesthetic value, 55 Wall Street has a troubled financial history. The Kajima Corporation of Japan paid $70 million for the building in 1990, but ran into trouble when its prime tenant, Citibank, left in 1993.
Last year, Kajima had a $23 million deal to sell the property to House of Blues, a theme restaurant featuring live music. When that deal fell through, Mr. Trump took over the sales contract and tried to lease the space to House of Blues and the Ritz-Carlton. Mr. Trump was later sued by Kajima when he tried to cut the price to $18 million, or back out, the lawsuit claimed. Ultimately, Credit Suisse First Boston bought the property for $21.15 million and began talking to the Cipriani family.
Since May, Mr. Cipriani has been talking to potential partners like the developers Harry Macklowe and Steve Witkoff. On Sept. 8, Mr. Cipriani bumped into Mr. Kimmel, who was having dinner at Harry Cipriani, and they began talking about 55 Wall Street. Mr. Kimmel called his friend Mr. Butera, and a deal was struck the next day to buy the property from Credit Suisse First Boston.
"We ended up closing with Mr. Kimmel because we had a similar way of looking at things," Mr. Cipriani said. "We are not real estate people. We have a more romantic approach to this project."

HEADLINE: Homage at Last for Blues Makers;
Through a Fan's Crusade, Unmarked Graves Get Memorials

BYLINE: By EMILY YELLIN

 BODY:
Memphis Minnie was renowned among the early blues musicians whose howling, rhythmic calls, piercing harmonica riffs and wailing slide guitar licks rose out of the gritty Mississippi Delta cotton fields in the 1920's and 30's.
Named Lizzie Douglas at her birth in 1897, she had toured the rural South in Ringling Brothers tent shows, worked in the Beale Street bars of Memphis in the 20's and moved on in the 30's to Chicago, where her peers bestowed the ultimate accolade: playing the guitar like a man. In the mid-50's, she resettled in Memphis. By the time she died in 1973, the music industry had passed her by, as had any profits from her work. Memphis Minnie was quietly buried in an unmarked grave beside the New Hope Baptist Church in Walls, Miss., about five miles south of Memphis, off Highway 61. 
 Last year, a large granite headstone was finally placed on her grave as family members, fans and journalists packed an elaborate dedication service in the tiny rural church. The British Broadcasting Corporation filmed the event. The musicians John Fogerty and Bonnie Raitt donated money for the grave marker. And through it all, the blues singer's little sister and oldest surviving relative watched in amazement.
"I was so happy," said Daisy Douglas Johnson, 82, who said she had had no idea how famous her sister had been."I felt she was getting the recognition she should have gotten in life." Next to Ms. Johnson, as the headstone was unveiled, stood Skip Henderson, the man who had helped make it possible.
Hers was the ninth marker erected by the Mount Zion Memorial Fund, which Mr. Henderson set up in 1990 to honor Delta blues musicians laid to rest in unmarked or poorly marked graves. The fund is named for the Morgan City church in whose graveyard its first memorial, to the Delta blues legend Robert Johnson, was installed. Later this fall, Sam Chatmon, the son of a slave, will become the 10th Delta blues musician to be memorialized.
Mr. Henderson, like many young white blues fans of the 1960's and 70's, was in college when he first encountered the early Delta blues, a blending of African-derived field hollers and work songs, gospel, minstrel show music, ragtime and pop music. Robert Johnson's songwriting credit on the Rolling Stones' version of "Love in Vain" led Mr. Henderson, now 46, to other Johnson classics from the 1930's like "Hell Hound on My Trail," "Crossroads Blues" and "Kind-Hearted Woman." All were recorded under the sort of royalty-free record deals most black performers of the time were given.
Then he found the even earlier music of Charley Patton, Johnson's mentor, who first took blues to juke joints and weekend fish fries through the Delta, singing songs like "It Won't Be Long," "Lord I'm Discouraged" and "Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues."
In 1989, Mr. Henderson was a burned-out social worker turned vintage guitar dealer in New Brunswick, N.J., when one of his customers, Billy Gibbons of the rock band Z. Z. Top, urged him to visit the Mississippi Delta, to see for himself where the music he had loved so long was born.
As Mr. Henderson drove south from Memphis, down Highway 61 into the heart of the Delta, he passed miles of flat, vast cotton and soybean fields punctuated by one-room shacks with dirt floors and ramshackle churches that had no steeples. Mr. Henderson, who thought he had seen it all during his many years working in the worst urban housing projects of Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., was stunned by this Delta-style destitution.
Despite the region's distinction for creating music that had inspired the lucrative rock-and-roll industry and had fattened the coffers of many record companies, Mr. Henderson noted that no rewards seemed to have made it back to where it all began. At home in New Jersey again, he was haunted by images of Mississippi. "I couldn't enjoy the blues anymore," he said. "I had to do something."
In 1990, he returned to Mississippi and managed to convince the Rev. James Ratliff and his congregation at Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Morgan City that a memorial to Robert Johnson, who had sung what many parishioners believed was the devil's music, could help their church, which was having trouble paying its mortgage. By chance, Mr. Henderson bumped into Mr. Fogerty, formerly of Creedence Clearwater Revival, in Mount Zion's overgrown graveyard. Both men were searching for Johnson's unmarked grave. They became friends, and every year since, Mr. Fogerty has made donations to the Mount Zion fund.
Mr. Henderson soon approached Columbia Records, which in 1990 had released a CD box set of Johnson's recordings that went on to become a Grammy-winning platinum seller. He persuaded Columbia to give $17,000 to erect the stone monument in the spring of 1991 and to pay off the debt on the rural church, whose congregation meets only every fourth Sunday, because that is all it can afford.
 
Younger Singers Find an Anchor
"That was a triumph," Mr. Henderson said. "If it had all ended there, I would have considered it a great success." But that was only the beginning.
In the summer of 1991, at the suggestion of Mr. Fogerty, the fund paid for a headstone for Charley Patton's previously unmarked grave in a big ceremony at the New Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church cemetery, between the cotton field and the cotton gin at the Robertson plantation in Holly Ridge, Miss.
Mr. Fogerty and one of his mentors, Pop Staples, were there. Mr. Fogerty wrote a song about that day, "A Hundred and Ten in the Shade," which appears on his latest album. "That big event for Charley Patton, it is an anchor for me," Mr. Fogerty said, "one of the really cool things I've done in my life."
The fund then paid for headstones for Sonny Boy Williamson, Elmore James and others. Mr. Henderson has also obtained music royalties for some of the honored musicians' remaining family members, from record companies that re-release classic blues music. And the nonprofit fund helps maintain the churchyards, because they are always in danger of being plowed over by neighboring farmers.
But Mr. Henderson's efforts have not been without personal regret. "If I hadn't ever started this," he said, "chances are I would still be living with my wife of 16 years and my four kids in New Jersey." After much traveling back and forth, he sold the guitar business and moved to Mississippi, alone, in 1996.
He soon returned to his roots as a social worker, as director of planning and development for Mississippi Action for Community Education, an organization in Greenville founded in 1967 by a civil rights activist, Fannie Lou Hamer. In addition to writing grants, one of his major responsibilities is to stage the annual Delta Blues and Heritage Festival, which ended on Sept. 20.
"The Mount Zion Fund is about outreach," he said. "I consider myself a social worker more than a blues fan."
Yet the blues continues to be what draws support. Ms. Raitt made her first donation to the fund in 1993, for her friend Fred McDowell's headstone. She said she was shocked to learn that some of the greatest blues musicians had been buried in unmarked graves.
"But when I thought about it," Ms. Raitt said, "it didn't surprise me, since blues were culturally a kind of stepchild. Still, I believe that if it weren't for the Delta blues, there would be no jazz, no R & B and no rock-and-roll."
 
An Era of Workers 'In a Hard Place'
The lack of recognition accorded the music stems from complex social and economic issues, said David Nelson, editor of Living Blues magazine."You have to look at the racial dynamics of the time," he said. "And as for the lack of gravestones, I think that has a lot to do with the effects of poverty."
Edward Komara, director of the blues archive at the University of Mississippi, said: "It was a fact of life on the Delta that the land was meant for economic development, not human development. The workers there were caught in a hard place, as sharecroppers, which wound up being a kind of economic slavery."
After World War II, the nature of cotton farming changed significantly as mechanization took hold. Fewer workers were needed on the plantations, and many black people migrated north, leaving the graveyards behind.
William T. Robertson, 76, who goes by the name Billy, owns the plantation where Charley Patton worked and is buried. Mr. Robertson's grandfather bought 800 acres in 1912, and the plantation has grown to about 5,000 acres. Forty families used to live on and work the Robertson land. Today, only about 10 men are needed to run the machinery. A few still live on the plantation, and their wives work at nearby catfish farms.
Mr. Robertson remembers hearing Patton playing his guitar on a bench outside the plantation store. "He was a real happy man," Mr. Robertson said. Recalling the sharecroppers who worked his family's land, he said: "Those people loved to sing. They were very happy. They had their own cows, their own milk and their own vegetable gardens. The work wasn't real hard. They didn't have much money, but they were well fed. They worked in the fields, where it was healthy, and they loved their churches."
But Mr. Ratliff, 48, the Mount Zion pastor, remembers it differently. He grew up harvesting cotton on Delta plantations, including the Robertsons', from the time he was 11. "We would work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., chopping and picking out in the bald sun," he said. "And for all that work, the man would only give us $3 a day, minus 50 cents to pay for our lunch."
In 1968, after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Mr. Ratliff left home, telling his sharecropper father he was not going to pick any more cotton. He became a preacher in 1980.
 
Even the Soil Has Resonance
Now, Patton's elegant granite marker stands tall in the large graveyard in the middle of the Robertson cotton fields. Most mounds in the cemetery have no headstones. The few that do often bear messages apparently carved with sticks on tongue-shaped concrete slabs, which have long since fallen over or are crumbling away.
On a recent afternoon, Leif Carlsson, 33, who grew up in Umea, Sweden, visited the Patton grave. He and a friend were touring Delta blues landmarks and had just come from the Johnson memorial. "I've been a blues fan since I was 9 years old," Mr. Carlsson said.
Out of his shirt pocket he pulled a small film canister filled with what he called "holy dirt" he had collected from the plantation where the blues star Muddy Waters grew up. "It has been a very emotional trip for me," he said. "In the land, you can hear the Delta; you can hear the bugs, the dirt, the cotton, and you can feel the music."
