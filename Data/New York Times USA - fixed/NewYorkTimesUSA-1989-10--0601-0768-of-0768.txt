HEADLINE: Koch Outlines 'Painful' Plan To Close Deficit

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Declaring that ''bad news can't wait,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch yesterday presented a program of spending cuts, fee increases and other measures to close a $530 million budget deficit this year and reduce an even larger one that had been expected next year.
Mr. Koch said the cuts were painful but necessary. The Mayor, however, will not be in office long enough to carry many of them out, and he acknowledged that his successor might choose to change or halt his program.
But at a City Hall news conference at which he outlined the fiscal problems facing the city, Mr. Koch warned, ''The law charges the mayor, whoever that individual is, to have a balanced budget.'' 
Asked about the Koch plan later in the day, David N. Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President and Democratic mayoral nominee, said he wanted ''time and opportunity'' to examine Mr. Koch's recommendations agency by agency, adding that he would do it as quickly as he could. $201 Million in Spending Cuts His Republican and Liberal Party opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said that he supported the Mayor's ''forthright response.'' ''I am pleased that he chose not to raise taxes,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''and instead made his difficult decisions in terms of budget cuts.''
The spending reductions in the Koch plan, which total $201 million out of the $27 billion budget for the fiscal year that ends in June, would affect virtually every city agency. There would be no layoffs, but the municipal payroll would be reduced by 3,182 workers through attrition.
The plan to hire 3,220 police officers, which would result in 2,000 additional officers, would go ahead, but the department would lose 457 civilian employees.
The city would save $162 million by refinancing municipal bonds and $40 million by reducing contributions to city worker pension funds. Under the plan, the city would eliminate its subsidy to the Water and Sewer Authority, which would save $102 million but would result in higher water and sewer rates, increasing the average homeowner's bill by $28 a year. The remaining $25 million in the deficit would be taken from the general reserve fund.
The Mayor said he preferred a property tax increase to the water and sewer charges, since the former is deductible on Federal tax returns and the latter are not. But he said he did not believe the City Council, which must enact a property tax increase, would do so.
Council leaders said they were not consulted about the Mayor's plan and expressed irritation that Mr. Koch sought to cut many of the programs the Council and the Board of Estimate added during budget adoption talks in the spring. They said they might wait until a new mayor is elected and negotiate with him. They also indicated that a property tax increase was a dead issue.
While the Council and Board of Estimate technically must approve that part of the Mayor's plan that constitutes a budget modification, Mr. Koch said yesterday that he has the power to put virtually all of it in place, since he has the authority not to spend funds even if they have been included in the budget.
Late in the afternoon, Paul Dickstein, the city budget director, said he was already moving ahead on the water and sewer fees. The bond refinancing is to take place in November.
 
Savings Depend on Attrition
The spending cuts, however, largely depend on attrition. And although the city has had a hiring freeze for a month, the bulk of the vacancies seem likely to occur after Mr. Koch leaves office on Dec. 31. The new mayor would be free to replace any workers who left, and could also roll back the water and sewer fees.
Even so, Mr. Dickstein said that Mr. Koch's successor will have to produce a financial plan to close next year's budget deficit of nearly $400 million - and find money to pay for most of the wage increases city workers are likely to receive - just two or three weeks after inauguration day.
The budget director said he believed that if anything, the next mayor would be under pressure to make even more cuts. ''The intent,'' he said of the Mayor's plan, ''was to make it easier for the next guy.''
In recent days fiscal issues have become more prominent in the mayoral campaign, with Mr. Dinkins suggesting that spending by city agencies other than the Police Department could be cut by 1 percent. Mr. Giuliani, criticizing Mr. Dinkins's approach as irresponsible, suggested several of the steps that the Mayor called for, including the refinancing of bonds.
 
Koch Criticizes Dinkins's Plan
In his comments yesterday, Mr. Koch also took issue with Mr. Dinkins's across-the-board approach to spending cuts. ''In the real world,'' the Mayor said, ''some services are more essential than others, and therefore have to be treated better than others.''
Administration officials also noted that the Mayor's plan envisioned more cuts than Mr. Dinkins would realize through his plan for a 1 percent reduction in the agencies whose spending can be controlled by the city.
While Mr. Giuliani was generally supportive of the Koch plan, he said in his statement he had ''concern'' about reductions in the Police Department's civilian staff and in day care.
For Mr. Koch, yesterday was most likely the last chance to display a characteristically tough-minded fiscal approach that many believe will be his legacy. ''I have previously said that the city's budget would not be 'out of whack' on January 1,'' the Mayor said in his news conference, quoting himself. ''The plan I am announcing today insures that it will be balanced.''
 
Clean Team Is Hit Hard
Among the agencies hardest hit is the Sanitation Department. Its Clean Team, which had been cut from 1,400 workers to 505 workers in recent years, would decline to 354 workers. Spending for parks, libraries, cultural institutions and foster would also be reduced.
There were three main reasons why the Koch Administration felt forced to act. One was a slowdown in the rate of growth of the city's economy, which led to tax collections that lagged behind expectations. Another was unanticipated spending, mostly for health care.
The third factor was the administration's assumption that the sale of New York Coliseum site to Boston Properties would not be concluded during the fiscal year because the developer's plans to build an office and apartment complex with twin towers are being challenged in court. A $247 million payment the city expected was pushed back into next year's budget.
Mr. Koch said he was also acting now ''to address the uncertainty inevitably associated with a change in administration'' and to reassure the financial institutions that rate city bonds. He noted that Moody's Investors Service had confirmed its A rating for general-obligation bonds.
The managing director of Standard & Poor's, Hy Grossman, listened to the Mayor's presentation yesterday in the Blue Room and said afterwards that he did not ''see anything in the near term'' to change his company's rating of A-.

BYLINE: By Edward B. Fiske

 BODY:
Ever since tuitions at private colleges began soaring in the early 1980's, college officials have been bracing for a revolt.
The only question was when parents and students would conclude that designer label diplomas from Old Ivy - or even Potted Ivy - had become so costly that they were not worth the loans, second mortgages and deferred vactions they required.
The much-anticipated counterattack has now begun, but not from the direction colleges expected. Instead of facing economic resistance from potential students, colleges are under political assault from the Federal Government. 
An investigation announced in August by the United States Department of Justice into how colleges set tuitions, allocate financial aid and determine salaries and whether these activities violate antitrust laws has sent shivers through the higher education establishment.
For public universities, tuition-setting has always been a political process because the decisions are made by legislatures. But in the independent sector things get complicated.
One theory holds that selective colleges compete with each other by selling high quality, not low cost, and that tuitions are pegged to what the market will bear. Sticker prices are high, but plenty of discounts (scholarships) are offered to families who cannot afford full price.
William G. Bowen, the former president of Princeton University who now heads the Mellon Foundation, said colleges may act this way when it comes to fund-raising - raising as much as they can and spending it on quality programs - but that tuition-setting involves a delicate balancing of economic and educational objectives. ''High tuitions affect the composition of your student body -and thus the educational process,'' he said. ''You deliberately hold tuition as low as you can.''
Robert Zemsky, director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania, said colleges practice ''cost-plus'' pricing - taking current expenses, adding enough to cover inflation and new programs and pegging tuition at a level that will generate the needed revenue. Since tuitions are the end-product of these calculations rather than a basis for them, he said, this approach ''provides few incentives to trim costs.''
The Justice Department has now come up with its own possible explanation: collusion among colleges and universities. By September, it had asked at least 30 of them for explanations of how they set tuitions.
Whatever the method, the results are troubling. A study published by the College Board in August showed that between the 1980-81 and 1988-89 academic years, disposable personal income per capita in the United States rose 66.8 percent. By contrast, the cost of attending college rose 118.1 percent at private universities and 82.2 percent at public ones.
With the perceived economic value of college degrees - especially prestigious ones - well acknowledged, families have little muscle to resist soaring tuitions. And colleges, caught in their own cycle of competition, are loathe to break the pattern. Now the Justice Department is doing what neither party could on its own.
The changing political tide was signaled by William J. Bennett, the former Secretary of Education, who waged a public relations war against high tuitions. ''At first I dismissed Bennett's attacks because I didn't think the great public was listening,'' said David Breneman, the former president of Kalamazoo College in Michigan, now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''But I'm reassessing my view.''
The investigation seems to have friends in high places. Ten college presidents who met with President-elect Bush in December were reportedly treated to a lecture on high tuitions from John Sununu, the White House chief of staff.
Some scholars compare the situation to the public pressure that has developed against soaring health-care costs. ''The public will not - and should not - accept the inviolability of large tuition increases in the cause of 'educational excellence' any more than it has accepted, or will accept, ever-increasing charges to obtain high-quality medical care,'' said Arnold R. Weber, president of Northwestern University.
Mr. Weber argues that colleges should begin to think in terms of ''comparative advantage'' - specializing in certain activities rather than going for across-the-board prestige. Too many presidents, he said, agree with the adage of Mae West that ''too much of a good thing is wonderful.''
Mr. Zemsky suggests that by deciding tuition rates at the beginning of the budget-making process, colleges can become more productive. ''The public is deciding what is a fair price for higher education and telling colleges and universities, 'Don't step beyond that line without fear of enormous discomfort,' '' he said.
The Justice Department may or may not find evidence of price-fixing, but it has already altered the climate in which tuitions are set.
Caveat vendor.

The Mainstreaming of Marxism in U.S. Colleges

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
As Karl Marx's ideological heirs in Communist nations struggle to transform his political legacy, his intellectual heirs on American campuses have virtually completed their own transformation from brash, beleaguered outsiders to assimilated academic insiders.
It could be considered a success story for the students of class struggle, who were once regarded as subversives. But some scholars say that as Marxists have adapted, their ties to the 19th-century German philosopher have fragmented into a loosely knit collection of theories with little in common. And in the past decade, while the prosperity of Western economies has made Marxism irrelevant to many, new rival radical theories have arisen to challenge the Marxists themselves. 
''A Marxist revolutionary is hard to find,'' said Loren Graham, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Marx has become relativized. He's no longer a battle cry -just a great figure in economics and history, along with a number of other great figures.''
 
An Uneasy Relationship
Even though today's Marxists may be establishmentarian, they are still not at ease.
''For a long time Marxists were virtually excluded,'' said Eugene D. Genovese, whose growing array of prestigious academic titles - Sunderland Fellow at the University of Michigan Law School, Distinguished Professor of Arts and Sciences at the University of Rochester - bear witness to the mainstreaming of Marxists since the blacklists in the 1950's.
''Then for a long time it was fashionable to be a Marxist,'' he continued. ''Now it's getting unfashionable again, and many are retreating. There are a lot of people who don't want to call themselves Marxist or anything else.''
Indeed, non-Marxist scholars are asking whether Marxism is assimilating itself out of existence.
''It's been diluted to the point where it's a very thin gruel,'' said the Princeton historian Lawrence Stone. ''Some of my young colleagues call themselves neo-Marxists. I can't see much difference between their views and mine, and I call myself a liberal Democrat.''
 
Upheaval in Eastern Bloc
Recent interviews with a dozen historians, sociologists, literary critics, economists and legal scholars show that the upheaval in Poland, Hungary and other Eastern bloc nations has lent a new sense of excitement to discussions of class analysis and debates about whether capitalism will give way to socialism or whether socialism will rediscover capitalism.
But several scholars say the excitement has not brought increased enrollment in courses that focus on Marxist analysis, although it has made Soviet and Eastern European studies popular. Where Marxism is thriving, these scholars say, is less in social science courses, where there is a possibility of practical application, than in the abstract world of literary criticism.
It is also in this field that new radicals - from feminists who say class analysis leaves women out, to deconstructionists who say historical truth does not exist - have posed the sharpest challenge to those who back Marx's theories of class struggle.
''Marxism and feminism, Marxism and deconstruction, Marxism and race - this is where the exciting debates are,'' said Jonathan M. Wiener, a professor of history at the University of California at Irvine.
 
Omissions in History
In response to feminists' claims that all the categories of Marxism are organized around male concerns and experience, Professor Wiener said, ''To understand women's history you need a completely different set of analytic categories.'' A new group of Marxist feminist historians is now trying to reconcile the differences, he added.
But deconstructionists deny that one can understand any experience of the past because the evidence for any conclusion comes from people's observations, most of which appear in a text. Deconstructionists maintain that texts are only stories told by people who leave out what they deem unimportant, and that such omissions keep written history from being reliable evidence about reality.
This philosophy is ''very upsetting to people who think there is one historical truth and there is one way to discover it,'' Mr. Wiener said, adding, ''Marxism believes there is a real world and it's really possible to understand it.''
Some scholars try to incorporate the cacophonous pluralism of radical theories into their work.
Asserting that ''relieving anxiety is not the object of academic work,'' Gayatri Spivak, a literary critic who is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh, uses elements of deconstructionist theory, Marxist theory and feminist theory in her work.
''The three are not married in my use of them,'' she said. ''They are always bringing each other to crisis.''
 
A Matter for Analysis
Whatever anxiety may spring from the theoretical wars, Marxist scholars greet the apparently robust vitality of capitalism with equanimity. For Mr. Wiener, this is a matter for analysis, not anxiety.
''Marxism needs to account for the continuing vitality of capitalism as capitalism embraces more and more of the world,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean there aren't capitalists and there aren't workers and this class relation doesn't provide a key to what's going on. We need to look more at how the ideology of consumerism has overpowered class consciousness.''
Far from producing anxiety, the transformation of the Communist landscape delights American socialists, who said decades ago that the Stalinist system was a perversion of Marxism, and now join conservatives in applauding the economic and political changes taking place in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
''These things show that a fundamentally Marxist mind is capable of creativity and change,'' said Mark Mancall, a history professor at Stanford University.
 
The Salvation of Socialism
John Roemer, an economics professor at the University of California at Davis, said: ''I'm very happy with what's happening in these countries. I think it's going to save socialism, rather than kill it.''
And diversity is now the signature of once-monolithic Marxism. Professor Spivak calls herself a Marxist feminist, Professor Roemer designs Marxist market-driven economies, and Erik Olin Wright, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin, calls himself an analytic Marxist, seeking to break Marx's grand theories down into their components.
Like many contemporary Marxists, Professor Wright is a bit uncomfortable with his establishment credentials.
''It makes me nervous,'' he said. ''I feel it shouldn't have been as easy for me in a big university as it has been. I don't see myself as having compromised my beliefs, but I'm not so naive as to believe that I'm more immune from the pressures of an institution than anyone else.''

HEADLINE: Rumors Lift UAL After $33 Plunge

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Rumors of stock purchases by two major investors and of a revival of the original buyout offer helped the stock of the UAL Corporation recover strongly yesterday after it plunged by $33 a share earlier in the day.
After falling as low as $145 a share, the stock of the parent of United Airlines closed at $170, down $8.375 from Monday's close, After a block of more than 800,000 shares was traded this morning. rumors began circulating that Donald J. Trump, the New York developer, or Coniston Partners, an investment group that already holds many UAL shares, might be buying large amounts of stock.
A spokesman for Mr. Trump said he would have no comment. A partner at Coniston did not return a phone call seeking comment.
 
Quarter of Stock Traded
More than 4.9 million shares - almost a quarter of UAL's common shares outstanding - were traded in one of the most active days for a stock that has been extremely volatile for months, rising from around $120 in June to a high of $294 in early September, after the announcement of a $300-a-share buyout offer led by UAL's management and the airline's pilots' union. 
The stock has plunged since Oct. 13, when it became clear that sufficient financing for the deal could not be arranged.
''This deal may not be dead,'' said one Wall street arbitrager who did not want to be identified, voicing a hope of many UAL investors who had gambled that the $300-a-share proposal would be completed.
On Monday, UAL's 12 independent directors agreed in a five-hour meeting in Chicago to direct management and employees to concentrate on running their airline and to wait to see whether another bid emerged or the original deal could be salvaged.
 
Pivotal Roles for Directors
Three people familiar with the UAL board said that as it wrestled with what to do next, pivotal roles could be played by three directors who have tended to be outspoken leaders on the board and another three who have known each other a long time and see things from a similar perspective.
These people said that Andrew F. Brimmer, a financial consultant; Neil A. Armstrong, the former astronaut who now heads his own computer systems company, and Frank A. Olson, the chairman and chief executive of the Hertz Corporation, who presided over the last reorganization at UAL, tend to be the most outspoken on what should be done next.
The three directors who are old friends and in the past have been allies are John F. McGillicuddy, the chairman and chief executive of the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company; E. Mandell de Windt, the retired chairman and chief executive of the Eaton Corporation, a diversified maker of electronic equipment, and James J. O'Connor, the chairman and chief executive of the Commonwealth Edison Company of Chicago.
''They may end up the core group,'' said one person familiar with the board and its members. ''They pal around, they have the same outlook on life. You see them congregate during cocktail time.''
While Mr. McGillicuddy has often been outspoken, he may stay in the background during this round. His bank decided against lending money for the deal, placing him in an awkward position.
On the other hand, there was also agreement on the board that the major reason for the collapse of the financing attempts was the way the lead bank, Citibank, a Citicorp unit, had handled the financing arrangements for the buyout and thus the role of Mr. McGillicuddy, as a banker, could increase.
 
Seeker of Consensus
Richard P. Cooley, the chairman and chief executive of the Seafirst Corporation, a Seattle banking company, presides over the board's deliberations. The people familiar with the board said Mr. Cooley, the senior member of the board, would listen and then seek a consensus.
When the 12 directors met on Monday it quickly became apparent that they wanted time for the dust to settle before taking any action, said a participant in the meeting who did not want to be identified.
That person said that contrary to suggestions on Monday by a Wall Street executive, the board had set no conditions for any possible bidder. The person added that Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's chairman, president and chief executive, and John C. Pope, a senior vice president and the chief financial officer, had not been asked to take themselves out of the buyout group. And he said that contrary to a previous report, Mr. Wolf and Mr. Pope had not pulled out of the buyout effort to focus exclusively on running the company.
Both executives are under pressure to leave the board from some major stockholders and some arbitragers who have taken big losses since the stock plunged. Their critics argue that they were too tough and aloof in their dealings with the banks during negotiations for the financing.
A large investor who sought this week to organize a vote to oust Mr. Wolf and Mr. Pope said that although there were some investors who wanted to join an effort to remove them, ''nobody wants to lead.''
 
Experienced on Difficulties
Among the board members who have played important roles in the past is Mr. Brimmer, an economist who was on the Federal Reserve Board from 1966 to 1974 and now heads a financial consulting firm in Washington. He has much experience with companies in difficulty and is a member of the boards of the BankAmerica Corporation and the Navistar International Corporation, formerly International Harvester. Both companies have been on the way to recovery after hard times.
Mr. Armstrong, the former astronaut and chairman of Computing Technologies for Aviation Inc., played a significant role in the last restructuring of UAL. In June 1987 the board removed Richard J. Ferris as chairman and decided to sell off major divisions of the company, including Hertz, now a unit of the Park Ridge Corporation, and two hotel chains, distributing the proceeds to stockholders.
Mr. Olson, of Hertz, has been a UAL director since 1985, when Hertz was acquired by UAL. He took over as chief executive after Mr. Ferris was ousted. Mr. Olson guided the company through the divestiture of Hertz and the hotel chains.
Other board members are expected to play more low-key roles. They include Juanita M. Kreps, an economist and a former Secretary of Commerce; Fujio Matsuda, executive director of the Research Corporation at the University of Hawaii; Nicholas R. Petry, the president of the Petry Company of Denver, an investment firm that specializes in energy companies; William M. Jenkins, the retired chairman of Seafirst, and Harry Mullikin, chairman emeritus of the Westin Hotel Company.
Of the board as a whole, the person at Monday's meeting said that ''they are a pretty close group and they have been together a long time.''
Mr. Wolf and Mr. Pope did not participate in the meeting because they are part of the buyout effort and they are considered inside directors. The 15th board member, Ralph Strangis, a partner in the law firm of Kaplan, Strangis and Kaplan in Minneapolis, is Mr. Wolf's attorney and was put on the board at his request. He also worked on the buyout proposal and is considered an ''inside'' member.

HEADLINE: Dow Ends 3.69 Lower In Wild Day

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
The stock market fluctuated wildly yesterday on heavy volume. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 85 points in the first hour of trading but recovered in the late afternoon to close only 3.69 points lower, at 2,659.22.
The early plunge, with investors' emotions still fragile after the 190-point tumble on Oct. 13, spurred speculation that the market had not returned to normal and prompted widespread selling. Declines on the New York Stock Exchange, at 1,222, outpaced the 382 advances by a ratio of more than 3 to 1. 
Also, in the broader markets, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.13, to 343.70, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.52, to 461.70.
Volume on the Big Board soared to an exceptionally strong 238 million shares from a slow 135.9 million on Monday.
Traders said the initial impetus for yesterday's decline was a 33-point plunge in the price of UAL, parent of United Airlines. UAL's board announced on Monday after the close of trading that it wanted to keep the company independent.
UAL's slide pushed other airlines down too, and the Dow transportation average fell nearly 80 points in early trading. The indicator finished 25.96 points lower, at 1,210.70, while UAL rebounded to close off 8 3/8, at 170, after rumors circulated that Donald J. Trump, the developer, was accumulating shares. Other airlines also closed above the day's lows. AMR fell 1 3/4, to 68 7/8; Delta 1 1/2, to 66; USAir 2 3/8, to 40 1/8, and Pan Am 1/8, to 3 1/2.
Computer programs that send out trading sell signals based on how various futures and options stand in relation to stocks were also a factor in early selling yesterday as the S.&P. 500 futures and the S.&P. 500 cash index both tumbled. Shortly afterward, the stock market began to rally, bolstered by buy programs. Stocks remained stable through midafternoon before short covering pushed stocks up in the last half-hour.
Hectic, heavy trading of stock index futures, with wild price gyrattions, contributed greatly to huge swings in stock prices. [Page D18.] ''Since Oct. 13, the market has been dramatically futures driven, obviously affecting the big stocks in the Dow and S.&P. 500,'' said David D. Bostian Jr., managing director and chief investment strategist at Jesup & Lamont in New York. ''There are two forces at work here. In terms of the bigger picture, there is a growing recognition that we may be headed for a recession and lower corporate profits than had been expected. On the other hand, it appears that one of the reasons we had the rally in the afternoon is that there is also a growing hope that the Fed might make a more overt move to lower interest rates.''
Kenneth S. Hackel, president of Systematic Financial Management Inc. in Fort Lee, N.J., said, ''I think program trading is turning off the public at large from the small investor to professional portfolio manager,'' adding that program traders had ''beaten the market down to undervalued levels, especially in light of current bond yields.''
 
Recession Fears a Factor
Recession fears also came into play early in the day. Durable goods orders were reported down one-tenth of 1 percent for September, well above the 1.8 percent drop expected by most economists. There was cause for concern, however, because, excluding the often-volatile military sector, orders fell 3.9 percent.
About 9:50 A.M. yesterday, the Dow was off only 15 points. By 10:10, however, the Dow was off 25 points, and 25 minutes later it was down 68. It then slipped to an 80-point drop before it began to recover. By 11:30, it had snapped back to a decline of only 44 points.
About 2:30, the Dow began to falter again, falling to a 60-point-plus loss before beginning another recovery. About 3:20 P.M., a wave of program buying in blue-chip stocks and stocks showing good earnings fundamentals pushed the Dow from a 35-point decline to a 3-point gain. Selling resurfaced almost immediately, however, and stocks fell about 15 points in the next five minutes.
 
Merger Stocks Down
Merger-related stocks outside the airlines that were hit yesterday included Ramada, off 1/2, to 10 3/4; Kollmorgen 5/8, to 12 3/4; MGM/UA 3/8, to 17 1/2; Hilton 2 3/4, to 93 1/4; McGraw-Hill 1 1/4, to 65 7/8; Paramount Communications 1, to 57 3/4; Woolworth 5/8, to 57 5/8; Time Warner 1 1/8, to 137 1/2; Rorer Group 7/8, to 41 3/4; Upjohn 5/8, to 37 7/8, and Telerate 3/8, to 19 1/4.
Among active blue chips, Philip Morris rose 5/8, to 44 1/2; Phillips Petroleum gained 1/2, to 23 5/8; Chase Manhattan slipped 7/8, to 38 7/8; McDonald's was up 1 3/8, to 32 3/4; Bristol-Myers slipped 1/8, to 52 1/4; A.T.&T. added 1/8, to 43 1/8, and BankAmerica dropped 1 1/4, to 29 1/2.
Security Pacific was the most active stock, slipping 7/8, to 44 1/2, on a volume of 14.8 million shares, in an apparent dividend capture play. The stock, which has an annual yield of 5.02 percent, goes ex dividend today.
Dow Jones jumped 5 3/4, to 41. The company's management said that it knew of no reason for a rise in the stock.
While down sharply, the secondary averages did not come back nearly as much as the Dow. On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index dropped 3.10, to 376.36, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.52, to 461.70.

HEADLINE: New S.E.C. Chief Defines Goals

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
In his first public discussion of the future policy of the Securities and Exchange Commission since he took office as chairman two weeks ago, Richard C. Breeden sent reassuring signals to the markets today, saying that his agency would not press Congress to grant the commission power to close the nation's securities markets in times of crisis.
''Circuit breakers'' put in place after the stock market crash of 1987, which require temporary trading halts if the market drops a certain amount, had diminished the need for the S.E.C. to be given summary authority to close down trading, he said.
''Moreover, my personal view is that a decision of that economic consequence should not be made by the commission alone,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''It should ultimately be a decision the President makes.''
 
Would Support Registration
In a broad-ranging interview about how he plans to conduct the business of the agency that regulates Wall Street, Mr. Breeden outlined an agenda that could both increase the agency's reach in some areas while checking its influence in others. 
Reflecting the thinking of his mentor, President Bush, he said: ''We want to be a fair cop. But we also want to be a tough cop.''
For example, he said he would strongly support any initiatives that require banks and savings and loan associations that issue stock and other securities to the public to register with the S.E.C., a measure that would bring thousands of financial institutions under the regulation of the commission. The issue has been debated in Congress, but there has been no legislation.
But at the same time, he said he was not prepared to continue the fight of his predecessor, David S. Ruder, to wrest regulation of stock-index futures from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.
And, in addressing the recent volatility in the market - stock prices gyrated wildly today alone - and fears raised in Congress and in the investment community about the proliferation of leveraged buyouts and corporate takeovers, he declined to take a strong position.
 
A Difficult First Day
''I don't know what the right level is,'' he said, referring to takeover activity. ''The marketplace should decide those questions.''
For the 39-year-old former assistant to the President for issues analysis in the Bush White House and main architect of the savings and loan bailout, Mr. Breeden's first two weeks on the job have been a period of intensive training. Sworn in on Oct. 11, his first day at work was Oct. 12, but a security guard at first refused to let him into his office because he did not have a pass.
The next day, Oct. 13, Mr. Breeden did not have any trouble getting into his office, but the stock market tumbled, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling nearly 200 points. The day was chaotic, he said, because he was unfamiliar with the telephone system and did not have a computer terminal in his office. ''People had to run out and run back in to give me stock quotes.'' he said.
But in general, he expressed confidence that the market systems put into place since the Dow plunged 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, had worked well so that orders were not backed up and investors got accurate price information.
 
Few Changes Outlined
''There is a perception that there were no changes, and that is erroneous,'' he said. ''A great deal was done.''
Indeed, Mr. Breeden outlined plans for very few changes in the market beyond those that the agency has already submitted to Congress, such as requiring brokerage firms to report large trades by their major customers and permitting the S.E.C. to get information on the financial condition of affiliates of broker dealers.
He said even though the commission had requested authority from Congress last January to shut down the securities markets without the President's intervention, the consensus of current commissioners was that such a dramatic new level of power was not needed and that effort would be abandoned.
But Mr. Breeden is not expected to tread lightly when it comes to advocating new policy initiatives that he feels are needed.
 
Savings and Loan Losses
He said today that he would strongly support any effort to force banks and savings institutions to register their securities with the S.E.C., adding that if savings and loan associations had been forced to use generally accepted accounting principles in the 1980's, the huge losses at the savings institutions would have been discovered much sooner and at a lower cost to the taxpayer.
And he said that he would strongly support dramatic changes in Federal laws that currently prohibit banks from owning securities firms and vice versa to make United States firms competitive with European financial institutions.
Though Mr. Breeden did not seem to be overly concerned about the market's ability to deal with wide swings in prices because of computerized trading, he said he was worried about the confidence of the small investor.
He said that even though the level of volatility in the market had greatly increased, stock prices in general had risen strongly in recent years.
 
Concern for Small Investor
Pulling out a chart he had asked his staff to prepare for testimony he is scheduled to give on Wednesday to a House subcommittee, he noted that if an investor had bought the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average in January 1987, the value of those holdings as of Monday would be up more than 40 percent, despite the market's volatility over those 34 months.
''While people focus on the volatility that exists in some of the short-term trading,'' he said, ''I would not like to have a situation in which people who are saving for college education or for retirement read about volatility in the markets and get scared away.''
He acknowledged that a key to maintaining small-investor confidence in the markets was to insure that the public perceived the S.E.C. as effectively enforcing the securities laws.
While promising to be a ''tough cop,'' Mr. Breeden refrained from outlining a specific enforcement agenda, saying he would present an outline of his thinking at a later date. ''The commission's record is generally a good one and I want to see it stay that way,'' he said.
 
Salaries Not Competitive
But he said that the agency does have an Achilles' heel - insufficient staffing levels and pay scales so low that it has had problems keeping talented lawyers.
''I've already got problems trying to compete for graduates of law schools,'' he said, because the S.E.C. can only offer ''$27,000 versus $82,000 by a Wall Street law firm.''
And he acknowledged that the savings and loan bailout law, which he had a big hand in devising, has only made that problem worse.
Under that law, all Goverment banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration are exempt from Government pay caps and can begin to offer competitive salaries. But the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C., he said, were still under the salary restrictions, which has led to the agency losing as many as a third of its lawyers in a single year and experiencing a turnover rate double that of the other agencies.
''I think that over the long run we will have a very significant problem in maintaining the traditional excellence of the commission staff if we are not able to be competitive even with other Government agencies, much less the private sector,'' he said.
''It can really effect litigation if you end up having to change your lawyers on the case every 18 months.''

Unleashing Ma Bell

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
COULD A.T.&T.'s rivals in long-distance phone service survive no-holds-barred competition? Since the breakup of the telephone monopoly in 1984, the Federal Communications Commission has kept A.T.&T. on a short leash to prevent the giant company from chewing up the ''small fry.''
But now two of those small fry have grown into profitable multibillion-dollar corporations, and A.T.&T. is asking the regulators for the freedom to fight for market share. If the F.C.C. agrees - a crucial decision could come as early as tomorrow - high-volume telephone users are likely to reap a bonanza from lower prices.
When the Bell System was dismembered, analysts generally agreed that rivals would need a lot of help from Washington to gain a secure foothold in the long-distance market dominated by the ultimate name-brand company. The analysts were right: After A.T.&T.'s competitors lost their discounts on regulated charges for hookups to local telephone exchanges, all of them took a financial bath and some went broke. 
But in the ensuing consolidation, a few companies emerged with both the technical capacity to match A.T.&T.'s service and the marketing savvy to sell themselves to once-skeptical consumers.
MCI Communications now has 12 percent of the long-distance market and in the last year has grown four times as fast as A.T.&T. U S Sprint Communications, with its much-ballyhooed all-fiber-optic system, has an 8 percent share and is the principal carrier for 117 of America's 800 largest companies. Joel Gross, a communications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, believes a fourth network, assembled from a half-dozen smaller companies, will soon emerge.
One reason A.T.&T.'s rivals have managed to do so well in the last few years is continuing regulatory discrimination. Last summer, the F.C.C. switched A.T.&T. from traditional fair-rate-of-return regulation to a more flexible ''price-cap'' system that gives the company discretion to adjust individual rates within a narrow price band.
But neither the old price regulations nor the new ones apply to MCI, U S Sprint and other smaller long-distance companies. And they have taken advantage of A.T.&T.'s inability to cut prices, offering volume discounts where A.T.&T. is most vulnerable to customer defections.
A.T.&T. has fought back, convincing the F.C.C. to allow it fast-track approval for rate concessions needed to hang onto its biggest customers. And it is now asking the commission for broad discretion to cut rates by more than the 5 percent permitted under the price-cap rule. If the F.C.C. agrees, it is a sure bet that A.T.&T. will price aggressively, accepting sharp reductions in its fat profit margins to check its loss of market share.
It is obvious why MCI and U S Sprint are unhappy at the prospect of an A.T.&T. unleashed. But it is not so easy to see how the public would lose from the ensuing donnybrook.
One worry is that A.T.&T. would slash prices by enough to drive rivals out of business, and then be free to price-gouge. But as Peter Pitsch, a former F.C.C. staff member who now consults for A.T.&T., points out, such ''predatory'' pricing is only a plausible option if the predator can hope to make up the inevitable short-term losses with long-term monopoly gains. And two considerations make such a calculation unlikely.
Once the cables have been laid and the switches installed, it costs very little to operate a long-distance phone system. Thus even if A.T.&T. were able to drive MCI and U S Sprint into bankruptcy, their creditors would find it advantageous to continue to sell long-distance services. And if A.T.&T. somehow did manage to shut down its rivals, the F.C.C. would hardly be likely to reward it with permission to charge monopoly prices.
Another concern is that price-cutting would make long-distance service unprofitable for all, discouraging further investment. That, however, might not be such a bad thing. Losses are capitalism's way of telling businesses to slow down: There is enormous overcapacity in long-distance communications and more investment anytime soon is unlikely to be productive.
Does all this mean the commission will hang tough and permit A.T.&T. to flex its competitive muscles? A year ago, when the F.C.C. was dominated by Reagan-appointed free marketers, the answer would have been easy.
Today, with a Bush-appointed majority led by a chairman, Alfred Sikes, of less certain ideological bent, it is hard to say. MCI and U S Sprint have managed to squeeze a lot of regulatory mileage out of their underdog status, and certainly will not give up the privileges that go along without a fight.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Down In September

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Orders for ''big ticket'' durable goods edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in September, but the drop would have been more pronounced if not for the second-biggest increase in military orders on record.
Analysts attributed the big jump in military demand to a rush by the Pentagon to place orders in September, the last month of the Government's budget year. They said the weakness in the nonmilitary categories provided fresh evidence that the nation's manufacturing sector was headed into a slowdown. 
Over all, orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, dropped by $147 million last month, to a seasonally adjusted $126.68 billion, after a 3.9 percent rise in August, the Commerce Department said today. The drop of one-tenth of 1 percent was the first decline since a 2.5 percent drop in July.
 
Biggest Drop Since May
Without the huge 56.3 percent surge in military orders, orders would have fallen 3.9 percent, the biggest decline in civilian demand since May.
''This is a weak report showing that the industrial sector has lost momentum,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. ''The only thing that held orders up in September was defense, and that category is volatile and not indicative of underlying economic trends.''
In September, manufacturing employment had its biggest drop in seven years, and many economists predicted that the weak orders report would lead to more layoffs in coming months.
''This report points to a sharp slowdown in industrial activity during the final quarter,'' said Gordon Richards, senior economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
 
Particularly Ominous Sign
Many economists pointed to a big 5.6 percent drop in demand for nonmilitary capital goods in September as a particularly ominous sign, especially since it followed an even larger 10.3 percent August decline. This area, which reflects business investment plans, has been one of the key sources of strength over the last year.
In September, orders in the transportation category fell by 4.7 percent, to $34.78 billion, after a 7.3 percent August rise. The September weakness was attributed to a $3 billion decline in orders for new cars as manufacturers cut back on production plans in the face of sluggish sales.

HEADLINE: End Sought to Trade Barriers in Some Services

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The Bush Administration put forward a blueprint today for ending trade barriers in a large number of services that account for more than a quarter of the world's $2 trillion of annual trade.
The proposal, affecting areas ranging from financial and communication services to construction and tourism, opens a new phase in global trade talks in Geneva. It is the first comprehensive effort to establish rules for services similar to those that apply to manufactured goods under the 42-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The initiative is likely to spark lively debate and opposition, and its prospects are uncertain. The European Community and other developed nations are expected to support the plan's general points while seeking some modifications, but third world nations are likely to object to attempts to strip their nascent services industries of protection. 
 
Question of Labor Exports
Brahm Dutt, commercial and financial counselor at the Indian Embassy here, said his country wanted the liberalization to include the export of semiskilled labor, such as carpenters and blacksmiths, to foreign construction sites. But such exporting of labor is not covered by the American proposal.
India and other developing countries are also seeking greater flexibility to adjust to competition from service industries of the developed countries, such as banks, insurance and travel companies.
The Bush plan would set up a legal framework to assure that foreign services are treated on a nondiscriminatory basis.
The new arrangement, for example, would provide for openness in promulgating laws and regulations affecting services. It would also give service providers the right to establish an office in a host country and would ban subsidies that cause injury to foreign service providers.
Further, guidelines would be established to limit restrictions that countries impose on payments in service transactions.
 
Fast-Growing Sector
Much as trade in manufactured goods expanded sharply after the establishment of the GATT, so Washington's hope now is to further the expansion of trade in services, which is already the fastest growing sector of activity in the United States and in many other countries.
In the United States, services employ about three-quarters of the work force and account for two-thirds of the gross national product and a quarter of total exports. Exports of services last year yielded a positive trade balance of $20 billion.
Allied with the United States in negotiating objectives are most of the developed countries. Yet publication of the American proposal shows some subtle differences between the United States and the European Community. The Europeans are pressing for a somewhat less sweeping accord.
The American services plan and previously reported parallel efforts to get rid of trade barriers and market distortions in agriculture were formally announced here at a news conference by the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, and the Secretary of Agriculture, Clayton K. Yeutter.
''These proposals are a microcosm of our broad goal in the round - to eliminate the hundreds of ways governments distort trade and restrict fair competition,'' Mrs. Hills said.
Domestic companies that provide services strongly backed the American draft plan.
''This is a very powerful document and should have an important catalytic function,'' said Gordon J. Cloney, president of the International Insurance Council, which represents the domestic insurance companies on international trade matters.
Harry L. Freeman, executive vice president of the American Express Company, said he believes compromises will be struck with developing countries. With so many of them developing service industries, there is an increasing convergence of interests, he said.
 
Phase-Out of Farm Subsidies
The agriculture plan calls for a substantial reduction in trade barriers and the phasing out of export subsidies.
It would also phase out internal support or subsidy measures that have the most distorting effect on trade. It also calls for the harmonization of health and sanitary measures, which many countries use to unfairly restrict trade.

HEADLINE: Car Sales Are Down 19 Percent

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Sales of United States-built cars plunged 19 percent in mid-October and sales of domestic light trucks dropped 22.8 percent as auto makers continued to feel the effects of earlier aggressive discounting.
The drop was not surprising to Big Three auto companies or to analysts, who said they had expected a sales ''payback'' from the summer months of the third quarter, when buying was stronger than normal.
''Anyone who didn't buy in the third quarter and decides to buy in the fourth must be desperate to be the first one on the block with a 1990 model,'' said Ron Glantz, an analyst for Montgomery Securities Inc. 
Harvey Heinbach of Merrill Lynch pointed out that retail car and truck dealers now have relatively few 1989 models left on their lots. Although manufacturers have put rebates on 1990 models, too, the deepest discounts tend to be for 1989 models.
 
Estimates on '89 Sales
Mr. Heinbach said slower-than-normal sales could continue for the rest of the fourth quarter unless auto makers unleashed another wave of deep discounts.
He estimates that about 10.1 million domestic and imported cars will be sold in the United States in 1989, compared with 1988 sales of 10.6 million. And he expects sales next year to drop further to 9.4 million because of a softening economy.
The eight domestic manufacturers, which consist of the Big Three and five Japanese automotive companies, sold 158,863 cars in the period from Oct. 11 to 20, compared with 196,196 sold in the comparable period last year.
The General Motors Corporation posted a 24.8 percent decline, selling 69,980 cars, compared with 93,086 cars a year ago. The Ford Motor Company posted sales of 46,995 cars, a 21.2 percent decline from last year's 59,613. The Chrysler Corporation sold 22,336 cars in the latest period, down 23.7 percent from a year ago.
 
Japan Surpasses Chrysler
Results were mixed for the five Japanese companies, but their combined sales of cars made in this country were substantially ahead of a year ago, mostly reflecting increased production at the Toyota Motor Corporation's new assembly plant in Georgetown, Ky., and the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation's joint venture assembly plant with Chrysler in Normal, Ill.
Significantly, combined United States car production by the Japanese auto makers now surpasses Chrysler's total car production. In the mid-1980's production of the so-called Japanese transplants was far smaller.
Sales of domestic light trucks, which include mini-vans and utility vehicles and double as personal transportation for a growing number of Americans, were 94,543 for the mid-October period, down from 122,468 a year ago.
Ford sold 31,143 light trucks, down 24.2 percent from last year's 41,097. G.M. sold 37,860 trucks, down 25.6 percent from last year's 51,134, and Chrysler sold 22,925 trucks, down from 27,795 a year ago. The Nissan Motor Corporation managed a slight gain, pushing truck sales to 2,615, from 2,442 last year.

HEADLINE: Market Place Added Volatility Expected in 'Junk'

BYLINE: By Anise C. Wallace

 BODY:
AFTER going their separate ways most of this year, the ''junk bond'' and stock markets now seem to share anxieties. When the Dow Jones industrial average plunged almost 86 points yesterday morning, prices of some high-risk, high-yield bonds fell sharply as well. Then when stock prices later recovered, junk bonds rose slightly.
''When the stock market gets strong, we get strong; when the stock market gets weak, we get weak,'' said David M. Feinman, a junk bond trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Beverly Hills, Calif. 
For much of 1989, the junk market and the stock market moved apart, with the stock market rising despite signs of stress in the junk market.
As volatility in both markets increases, many investors expect the junk market's disarray to continue indefinitely. ''There are going to be continued fluctuations because there's a lot of confusion,'' said Kingman D. Penniman, head of junk bond research at McCarthy Crisanti Maffei, a bond research firm in Montpelier, Vt.
This volatility and skittishness in turn are making it difficult for underwriters to place some of the new offerings being marketed, investors say. Indeed, the amount of new offerings could be cut to $5 billion from the planned $11 billion, said Peter F. Karches, managing director and head of junk bond securities at Morgan Stanley & Company.
Yesterday morning after the Dow plunged, arbitragers who had lost money in the UAL Corporation and who needed to raise cash began selling bonds of RJR Holdings, traders said, and that selling spilled over into the rest of the junk bond market. Traders in the secondary market reacted by selling bonds like RJR, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and Duracell. Prices of some RJR bonds, considered to be a source of trading liquidity for investors who need to raise cash quickly, fell 3 points, or $30 for every $1,000 face amount. They recovered slightly, ending down 2 1/2 points for the day. The bellwether RJR bond is yielding around 13 percent.
''To me, it's clear the whole junk market was affected by the UAL situation,'' Mr. Feinman said.
At the same time, junk bond investors continue to be extremely selective about providing credit to new issuers. Companies that have a demonstrated cash flow record, like Imo Industries, an electronics concern, are finding buyers willing to spend some cash they have in their portfolios. On Monday, Morgan Stanley successfully sold $150 million of Imo bonds, which had a 12 percent coupon.
However, other companies trying to raise cash from junk bond lenders could face a tougher time. Several investors said yesterday that a scheduled $1.6 billion bond offering by the West Point Acquisition Company, needed to help finance the acquisition of West Point Pepperrell by Farley Industries, would be difficult under these market conditions.
Yesterday a spokesman for Drexel, Farley's investment banker, said the firm planned a ''road show'' for the West Point offering but had not yet selected the dates for these meetings with portfolio managers and analysts around the country.
Investors also said that the $1.1 billion offering of bonds of TW Services could be hard to sell. Investors are nervous about companies where cash flow is closely tied to the overall health of the economy, like housing and retailing. As a result, some money managers said they were unlikely to buy bonds of TW, a food service company whose operations include Denny's, a restaurant chain.
To help pay off its debts, TW may have to sell some of the assets, a practice that was once tolerated by the credit markets but that has suddenly become suspect. ''TW needs to do a lot of things that the market doesn't want to see,'' Mr. Penniman said. A spokesman for the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, the underwriter, declined to comment.
In this market climate, portfolio managers are becoming more demanding. Investment bankers at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., who are trying to sell $150 million of junk bonds for the R.P. Scherer Company, are finding that investors are trying to force them to include equity in the deal, as well as better ''call'' protection. A banker at the firm said yesterday that the Scherer deal had not yet been structured and that he did not know whether it would be offered this week as originally planned.
 
Paine Webber to the Rescue
Stock and stock index futures traders say trading by Paine Webber brokers helped stem the stock market's rout yesterday morning.
The firm's trades - executed for a large institutional client engaged in a ''tactical asset allocation'' shift between stocks and bonds - were behind some of the big moves in the futures contracts yesterday, market sources said.
The buying of stock-index futures contracts began when the Dow was down about 80 points. That buying attracted futures traders in Chicago and helped turn around a plunging market. Paine Webber officials declined to comment.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Index-Contract Gyrations Buffet Underlying Stocks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stock index futures prices gyrated wildly in hectic, heavy trading yesterday, contributing greatly to huge swings in stock prices on Wall Street.
A heavy burst of selling, much of it inspired by speculators in UAL Corporation stock seeking to hedge their positions, pushed the nearby December Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures contract down its 12-point limit by 9:33 A.M., Central daylight time.
Further sell orders would have led to a 30-minute suspension of trading because the 12-point decline triggered the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's circuit-breaking mechanism. But buy orders, reportedly from Paine Webber, emerged as the S.&P. futures index hit its intraday low of 335.95, and within minutes the contract had regained half of the 12 points it had lost. 
The abrupt turnaround did not immediately lead to a rebound in stock prices, however. Shortly after the S.&P. contract hit its downside limit, the Dow Jones industrial average went into a near free fall and was down more than 85 points at one point.
 
'Panic in the Stock Market'
''When we went lock-limit down in futures, there was some panic in the stock market,'' said Jeffrey Tabak, a partner at Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company in New York. ''But as soon as a buyer in the futures markets emerged, the market began to jump back.''
Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Management Inc. in Princeton, N.J., said: ''Arbitrage-related program trading is exacerbating the up and down movements in stock prices. But everything we have seen since Oct. 13 is being driven by fundamentals. The stock market is in the process of adjusting to lower-than-expected corporate earnings, weak economic news and continued problems in the 'junk bond' market.''
Compared with the market's early gyrations, the next few hours in the stock index futures pits were fairly stable. But additional buying emerged later in the day when, contrary to earlier rumors, problems in the high-yield ''junk bond'' market did not emerge.
 
Trump Rumors Spur Prices
Rumors that Donald J. Trump, the developer, might be preparing a bid for either United Airlines or American Airlines also helped to push index futures prices higher. The rumors, along with the movement in the futures markets, helped underlying stocks. By the end of the session, the Dow index had lost just 3.69 points for a close of 2,659.22.
''This is a completely spastic market,'' said Richard L. Sandor, an executive vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''The market is incredibly sensitive to rumors. I haven't seen it like this in years.''
Helped by the late burst of buying, the nearby December S.&P. 500 futures contract closed at 346.50, down 1.45 on the day. Meanwhile, the underlying index of the 500 stocks that make up the Standard & Poor's cash index closed at 343.70, down 1.13.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Day Lower; Sales Spurred by Stock Dip

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished lower against most leading currencies yesterday, depressed by the volatility of stock prices and by expectations of lower United States interest rates.
A steep morning plunge of more than 80 points in the Dow Jones industrial average touched off a heavy but brief flurry of dollar sales. Those subsided once the stock market started to recover.
David Jaques, a vice president at Barclays Bank P.L.C. in New York, said the dollar did not manage to recover all of the ground it lost during the temporary stock market selloff. The Dow industrials closed at 2,659.22, a loss of 3.69 points.
Mr. Jaques said currency dealings were lethargic in the early going, with traders lacking a compelling reason to buy or sell. News of a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in September orders for American durable goods created barely a ripple in the currency markets because the figure virtually matched previous estimates.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 141.50 yen, down from 141.90 yen. A pound cost $1.6075, compared with $1.6030 on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the quotes of late Monday, included: 1.8358 West German marks, down from 1.8470; 1.6095 Swiss francs, down from 1.6190 Swiss francs; 6.2370 French francs, down from 6.2740; 1.1713 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1704, and 1,345.75 Italian lire, down from 1,356.00.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $370.20 an ounce, up $3.20 from Monday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a gold bid of $368.70 an ounce at 4 P.M., compared with Monday's late bid of $366.25.

2 Hotels Build For Business Travelers

BYLINE: By Shawn G. Kennedy

 BODY:
BUSINESS travelers have long been the bread and butter of the hotel industry in Manhattan, but competition for this segment of the traveling public is heating up as the city's overall hotel occupancy rate drops and more hotels go up.
One way some operators are staking their claim to a bigger share of the Manhattan hotel market is by providing larger and more sophisticated meeting spaces. Two of the most ambitious projects are nearing completion in midtown.
The New York Hilton and Towers Hotel, the largest convention hotel in New York, with 2,121 guest rooms and just under 100,000 square feet of ballroom, meeting and banquet space, will open a 36,000-square-foot expansion of its three-level convention area next month. The new space will be on the second and third floors of an office building under construction just west of the hotel. 
In the other project, the developer Harry Macklowe is putting a 100,000-square-foot conference center in the mixed-use hotel and office building that his company is constructing on the block between 44th and 45th Streets near Broadway in the Times Square area. The hotel and conference center are to open in April.
Industry analysts expect the number of first-class transient rooms in Manhattan to grow by 10 percent by 1991. The current count is 45,000 rooms. Occupancy rates now are running at about 75 percent, a slippage from 78.7 percent two years ago.
Hotel industry analysts say the Hilton and Macklowe projects illustrate not only an increased demand for meeting space in Manhattan but the changing nature of the hotel industry as well. According to Thomas McConnell, a manager of the hotel industry group of Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting and consulting firm, most hotels view these meeting space components as drawing cards rather than profit centers.
''On a per-square-foot basis,'' Mr. McConnell said, ''the cost of building guest rooms or meeting or conference space comes out to be about the same - around $400 to $415 a foot in the city. The extra expense comes in the operation of these facilities.''
Stephen W. Brener, a Manhattan-based hotel consultant, said two factors were behind the lower occupancy rates: rooms added in recent years and budgetary belt-tightening in the corporate world.
''The individual business traveler is still the most valuable customer for most hotels at the upper end,'' he said. ''They represent the largest segment of the market and they pay the highest rates. But the business traveler is harder to get now because companies are economizing by cutting back on travel expenses.''
John F. Power, general manager of the Hilton hotel, said: ''This addition will significantly increase our ability to host groups that we could not accommodate before. Not only will it give us more room, but the new space will have state-of-the-art technology that will allow both those gathering for meetings as well as exhibitors maximum flexibility and advanced audio-visual capabilities.''
The Hilton's new space, which the hotel is calling Americas Hall, is in the 35-story office building being built next door by Edward J. Minskoff and A. Alfred Taubman. They bought the site a few years ago from Hilton Hotels and the Prudential Insurance Company after Hilton decided not to go forward with a plan to build an addition. As part of the deal, the developers agreed to provide specially built space with high ceilings and reinforced floors for the hotel's convention space expansion.
A glass-enclosed bridge will link the new convention halls with the existing meeting and ballroom space on the hotel's second and third floors. Each floor has 18,000 square feet of open space that has been fitted with power lines, 132 telephone jacks, 10 cable televison outlets and the technology needed for satellite or in-house video transmissions. Mr. Power said the new space could accommodate up to four different groups at one time.
With its new venture, the Macklowe organization is seeking to attract a different segment of the meeting market. Rather than trade shows and large conventions, the developer hopes the conference center will appeal to corporate clients that want to hold small meetings but do not want to leave town to do it.
The Macklowe Conference Center will occupy five floors in the 638-room hotel and will incorporate the adjacent Hudson Theater, a landmark auditorium that Mr. Macklowe bought for the air rights that allowed him to raise his new building to 52 stories. The 1,100-seat theater, built in 1904, will be be restored by the developer and will serve as an auditorium for the conference center. It will also be rented for independent events.
The main entrance to the conference center will be on 45th Street, while the lobby for the hotel will be on the 44th Street side of the building. The conference space will include 33 meeting rooms featuring video and rear-screen projection equipment.

HEADLINE: An Ohio Fair Where Big (and Orange) Is Beautiful

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STOFFEL

DATELINE: CIRCLEVILLE, Ohio

 BODY:
AS the time approached to set his entry on the scales for the city's 83d Pumpkin Show weigh-in, David Mangione, an agricultural extension agent in nearby Chillicothe, shook his head.
''It just hasn't been a good year for pumpkins,'' he said. ''It rained so much, and the fruit didn't set on until August. We probably lost a good 45 days off the growing season.''
It was Mr. Mangione's first time in the competition and he wanted to appear casual about it. His was the first of the 10 giant hybrid pumpkins that had been brought to the town square for the Oct. 18 weigh-in and judging, the unofficial opening of Circleville's four-day pumpkin festival. 
Four men slid Mr. Mangione's giant faded-orange entry onto a blanket, then lifted it off the back of a pickup truck onto the scales. It stood more than 2 feet tall and 4 feet wide. There was silence from the crowd. Mr. Mangione's mottled and slightly lopsided squash came in at 274 pounds. He smiled.
Pumpkins and Circleville have been synonymous since the turn of the century, when farmers began planting pumpkins among their corn to supply local canneries. The show began as a produce sale set up along Main Street in 1903, and has been held every year since except for three years in World War II. These days the festival is nothing less than a pumpkin extravaganza, even though the popularity of freezing forced the last of the canneries to close many years ago. Nowadays the crop goes to farm stands and to out-of-state canneries. The four-day Pumpkin Show, one of the oldest of Ohio's agricultural fairs, inundates this county seat of 14,000 people with more than 300,000 visitors. Whole families from southern Ohio and West Virginia are drawn, some coming back year after year. Many show up dressed in orange.
Aside from the estimated 100,000 pounds of pumpkins on display here, a visitor this year could take in seven parades, beginning with the Oct. 18 parade of the Little Miss Pumpkins and culminating with the Oct. 21 Parade of Queens, when farm festival queens from across the state were invited, among them the Sweet Corn Queen from Millersport and the Apple Festival Queen from Jackson.
In between, awards were handed out for everything pumpkin: pumpkin pie eating, pumpkin face decorating, pumpkin fashions and pumpkin floral arrangements. On the unseasonably cool opening day this year, another crowd gathered at noon outside the Pumpkin Show Building to await the judges' choices among the dozens of baked-goods entries.
The prize for best pumpkin recipe went to Pat Young for her pumpkin drop cookies. The best pumpkin layer cake was Marion Jones's. The champion pie was submitted by Dorothy Norman. The winners in the pumpkin categories are all from Circleville.
But in Circleville pumpkin is not reserved merely for pies, cakes, breads and cookies. At the Pumpkin Show, churches and other local organizations sell pumpkin ice cream, pumpkin fudge, pumpkin waffles, pumpkin soup and even pumpkin sloppy joes. Considering the nutritional merits of pumpkin - it is rich in vitamin A, phosphorus, calcium and iron - this is not a bad thing.
Linda Ballou, a local dog breeder, has been a judge in the baking contests for 10 years. She said she eats pumpkin only this one time.
For Circleville the show is not only the biggest entertainment event of the year, but also a tremendous economic opportunity. Schools close; exhibits and carnival rides are set up in front of the courthouse; the city's five hotels are quickly filled.
A 1984 survey by Pumpkin Show officials found that the show added more than $6 million to the local economy. While the event is promoted as the Greatest Free Show on Earth, Ned Hardin, the owner of the Chevrolet dealership here who has been the event's publicity director for 49 years, said, ''We give them every opportunity to spend their money while they're here.''
He said people keep coming because they get ''bitten by the pumpkin.'' Many former residents choose this time of year to come back the way other families gather for major holidays. ''It's kind of a reunion,'' Mr. Hardin said. ''About every home in town is full of visitors. I myself have 14 people in from out of town.''
The pumpkin weigh-in remains the most important event. It has had its share of controversy through the years. The real giants, including one earlier this decade that set a Circleville record at 510 pounds, are not technically pumpkins, but rather have been crossbred with squash.
To qualify as a true pumpkin, an entry at Circleville must have a hard, five-sided stem, a standard set by Ohio State University. Squash have round, soft stems. Separate weigh-ins are held for pure pumpkins and for hybrids to please both factions of competitors, and separate awards are given. The largest pumpkin this year was 45 pounds, entered by Burness Scarbro. The Circleville record was a 134 1/2-pounder in 1964. But the real crowd pleasers in Circleville are the truly huge entries, even if their breeding is suspect.
Growing the vegetable to such proportions is not easy. These giant hybrids are extraordinarily sensitive. Too much heat or too much rain, conditions growers have had to deal with in succession in the past two years, have kept the weights way below the records. The hybrids are also highly susceptible to fungus that can damage them overnight.
Exact cultivating methods, closely guarded secrets among competitors, include a combination of special fertilizers, near continuous watering and patience. Nick Wohrer, a grower from nearby Lancaster who hauled in a 189-pound entry this year, said he spent at least 30 minutes a day all summer tending his great pumpkin and nipping new blossoms off its vine; he said he even went so far as to talk to it. Other growers spoke of their fear of vandalism and would not reveal the locations of their patches.
Good seeds are also considered among the keys to success. The winner here not only takes home a prize of $1 a pound, but can also make twice as much as that by selling the thick, thumbnail-sized seeds.
It was clear that these vegetables are not judged on shape, color or tenderness. Many were only slightly orange, leaning toward gray with more than a hint of green, conceding their squash relations. And sure enough, this year's champion, a 280-pounder entered by Latta Shaeffer, was mostly green and yellow, and severely flattened across the bottom.
Accepting his loss, Mr. Mangione said, ''There's always next year.'' With that he was off to help lift Mr. Shaeffer's champion onto the truck where it was displayed until the end of the Pumpkin Show.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev, in Finland, Disavows Any Right of Regional Intervention

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, Oct. 25

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared today that the Soviet Union has no moral or political right to interfere in the affairs of its East European neighbors, and held up neutral Finland as a model of stability in stormy Europe.
His spokesman embroidered the theme jokingly, saying that Moscow had adopted ''the Sinatra doctrine'' in Eastern Europe. ''You know the Frank Sinatra song, 'I Did It My Way?' '' said Gennadi I. Gerasimov to reporters. ''Hungary and Poland are doing it their way.''
''I think the Brezhnev doctrine is dead,'' he added, using the Western term for the previous Soviet policy of armed intervention to prevent changes in the Communist governments of the Warsaw Pact, In talks with Finland's President, Mauno Koivisto, at the beginning of a three-day state visit, Mr. Gorbachev was reported to have said that the current political upheavals in the East bloc must be allowed to run their course. 
 
Of Regional Interest
Mr. Gorbachev has repeatedly pledged a policy of noninterference, but his emphasis on the point - and his lauding of the Finnish example - were striking in a week when Hungary was joining Poland in a retreat from orthodox Communist rule, and East Germany was boiling with demands for political liberty.
''The events that are now taking place in the countries of Eastern Europe concern the countries and people of that region,'' the Soviet leader told the Finnish President, according to Mr. Gerasimov, whose formal position is that of spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry. ''We have no right, moral or political right, to interfere in events happening there. We assume others will not interfere either.''
Finland, once an autonomous part of czarist Russia, gained its independence in 1917. It was invaded by the Soviet Union late in 1939, after the formal outbreak of World War II, and was forced to cede some territory to the Russians. The Karelian Autonomous Republic, which borders on Finland, is largely populated by Finnish-speakers.
Today, as Mr. Gorbachev moved through largely friendly crowds, there were some cries of ''Give us back Karelia,'' but no indication that he heard them.
Mr. Gerasimov, who served for many years as a correspondent for the Soviet news-feature agency Novosti in New York, has used the ''Sinatra doctrine'' expression before to explain the willingness of the Soviet Union to allow its allies to follow different political lines.
 
A Deft Response
Mr. Gerasimov declined a direct answer when asked how Moscow would respond if its allies wanted to move toward neutrality. He noted that Hungary and Poland still have obligations as members of military and economic alliances with the Soviet Union.
''We may witness a change of government in Warsaw or Budapest, but international obligations do not necessarily go away with a change of government,'' Mr. Gerasimov said.
He added that Moscow has long proposed a mutual breakup of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, but he did not say how the Kremlin would react if the Warsaw Pact showed signs of breaking up on its own.
Still, Mr. Gorbachev's remarks today seemed to suggest that Moscow is open to more fundamental changes in its relations with East bloc allies.
Both Poland and Hungary have said they do not plan to leave the alliance, but some officials in both countries favor drastic military changes, including withdrawal of Soviet forces now based on their soil.
In recent months, Finland - with a largely free-market economy but reliant on Soviet trade, formally neutral but always attentive to Soviet security concerns - has loomed large in the minds of East bloc countries. Hungary has sent several delegations to study Finland's economy, its laws and its relations with Moscow.
Asked during a brief walk in downtown Helsinki this evening whether he considered Finland a model for countries in Eastern Europe, Mr. Gorbachev replied, ''To me, Finland is a model of relations between a big country and a small country, a model of relations between states with different social systems, a model of relations between neighbors.''
As if to underscore the advantages of good-neighborly relations, Soviet officials this week are to sign an agreement to sharply reduce sulfur emissions that have been poisoning Finland's forests.
Kaj Barlund, the Finnish Minister of the Environment, said in an interview today that it was ''the most radical'' anti-pollution agreement ever signed between a Communist and a non-Communist country, but he conceded that the Soviets would probably require costly technological help from the Finns to live up to their end of the deal.
The treaty calls for reducing the two countries' 1.4 million tons a year of sulfur-dioxide emissions by half before 1995. The largest share of the noxious emissions comes from two Soviet nickel smelters a few miles east of the Finnish border.
Mr. Gorbachev also made a significant concession to Finland's pride tonight when he said at a banquet speech, ''I want to greet neutral Finland.''
It was the first time that a Soviet leader had given full weight to this country's policy of neutrality in world politics. Moscow's reluctance to directly acknowledge that Finland is neutral has long been resented here as an implication that Finland owes special deference to the Kremlin.
 
A Finely Tuned Ear
In turn, Mr. Koivisto, the Finnish President, demonstrated the kind of sensitivity to the Soviet Union that the Kremlin prizes in this relationship. He included in his banquet speech an implicit but unmistakable message of non-support for separatist movements in Soviet Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, across the Baltic Sea from Finland.
Mr. Koivisto said that although tensions are now erupting in the Soviet Union, ''underneath the surface, there is every reason for confidence in the ability of this community of peoples to solve its problems in a way that enables the distinctiveness of the parts to be increased while strengthening the whole.''
Finland and Estonia, which face each other across the Gulf of Finland, have longstanding ties that are now expanding. Direct air connections and a new, second ferry line across the gulf are due to open this winter, adding to an already fast-growing business and tourist traffic. Finnish bankers and businessmen say they see promising investment opportunities if Estonia gets greater economic independence from Moscow.
 
Russian Praises Baker
MOSCOW, Oct. 25 (Reuters) - The Soviet Union today welcomed what it said was a new American approach to security relations outlined by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, and said Washington's view was close to its own.
A Foreign ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliyev, said that recent speeches by Mr. Baker in New York and San Francisco ''clearly demonstrate a new U.S. approach to relations with the Soviet Union.''
After a wait-and-see attitude in Washington during the Bush Administration's early months, the Secretary of State said that American interests lay in the success of Mr. Gorbachev's program of political and economic change.
''The stated principle of stability and predictability in strategic relations completely coincides with our own views,'' Mr. Perfiliyev said, alluding to Secretary Baker's speeches.
But Mr. Perfiliyev also said that his Government could not accept all of Mr. Baker's propositions without qualification. He said Moscow rejected the idea that continued development of cruise missiles and strategic bombers could serve as stabilizing factors because of their slow speed.

HEADLINE: BONN GIVING POLES AID OF $1 BILLION

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's trip to Poland, delayed by a dispute over the amount of economic aid he will offer, is to begin Nov. 9. Mr. Kohl will arrive in Warsaw with more than $1 billion in aid to help rebuild a devastated economy, according to West German officials.
The money, in the form of a package of credits, is meant to buy breathing room for the Solidarity-led Government's economic and political changes. Bonn is also heralding the visit as the beginning of a new era in West German-Polish relations. The trip was originally planned to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, on Sept. 1, 1939, which began World War II. 
 
Substantially More Offered
The size of the aid package, the largest by a Western nation since Solidarity in August formed Poland's first non-Communist Government of the postwar era, also signals what West German officials said was a special obligation toward Poland rooted in the history of turbulent relations between the two nations.
Mr. Kohl postponed his visit in July after Poland rejected West Germany's original aid offer as insufficient. Although Bonn is withholding details of the new aid package until they are officially announced in Warsaw during Mr. Kohl's stay, West German officials said it was substantially larger than the amount Warsaw rejected.
A three-year French aid package announced today totals $642 million, weakenening West Germany's contention that other Western nations are not providing their share of aid for Poland's program of political and economic change.
Mr. Kohl's center-right coalition Government strongly supports the idea that Western industrialized nations must provide financial support for Eastern European nations, like Poland and Hungary, willing to undertake political and economic changes, West German officials say.
The Bush Administration asked Congress for $455 million in aid for Poland and Hungary over three years. The House of Representatives voted last week to provide $837.5 million to the two countries over three years. The Senate is expected to take up a $989 million, three-year package soon.
The new West German credit package was designed to deflect domestic criticism that the generosity toward Poland, which already has a huge foreign debt burden, is excessive.
West German officials and economists said that the amount of aid has been raised substantially and that the new package will total between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. But rather than provide large new lines of open credit, Bonn will instead guarantee bank loans to help finance specific foreign-exchange-earning projects, officials said. It will also encourage joint ventures between West German companies and Polish concerns.
Poland has given West Germany a list of industrial and agricultural projects that total more than $1.5 billion. While it is highly unlikely that all of them will come to fruition, West German officials said a substantial number could be approved.
 
'A Lot of Verbal Support'
These officials are also mildly critical of the reluctance shown by the United States, Britain and other industrialized nations to provide as much financial aid to Poland as Bonn is offering. ''There has been a lot of verbal support from the Western industrial nations, but not much money,'' an official said. ''With winter approaching, economic aid is vital.''
Volker Ruhe, a member of Parliament and secretary general of Mr. Kohl's party, the Christian Democratic Union, expanded on that view. ''One of the reasons we can't wait with aid for Poland is that if we fail to support the reform movement this time, what hopes are left for Poland?'' he said ''It's the same with Hungary. If we want democracy to succeed, they also need goulash.''
When German and Polish officials failed to reach agreement on an aid package in July and Mr. Kohl was forced to delay his visit, Bonn blamed turmoil in the Polish Government and differences over tying West German economic aid to better treatment of the German minority in Poland. Polish officials said the aid package was simply not enough.
Mr. Kohl's policy toward Poland has drawn sharp criticism from right-wing politicians in West Germany. They have raised the issue of German territory lost to Poland after World War II, and played to resentments among lower-middle-class West Germans of the number of ethnic Polish immigrants, asylum seekers and black-market laborers.
Bonn last gave its backing to loans for Poland in 1986, but the credit line was rapidly closed when Poland failed to keep up with payments on its $39 billion in foreign debt.
 
French to Give $642 Million
PARIS, Oct. 25 (Special to The New York Times) - Three days after Lech Walesa criticized France for not doing enough to aid Poland, the French Government announced today that it would provide $642 million in emergency assistance to Poland over the next three years.
France made the announcement hours before President Francois Mitterrand gave a speech to the European Parliament calling on the nations of Western European to coordinate their aid programs for Eastern Europe.
Mr. Mitterrand also urged that Western European nations form an investment bank to provide loans to help Poland modernize its economy.
Under the plan announced today, Paris would provide $145 million in investment credits to Poland, and $320 million in trade credits.
On Sunday, Mr. Walesa said France's tardiness in providing aid to Poland was ''scandalous.''

HEADLINE: Mary McCarthy, 77, Is Dead; Novelist, Memoirist and Critic

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.
In her long and prolific career as a novelist, memoirist, journalist and critic, Miss McCarthy earned recognition for her cool, analytic intelligence and her exacting literary voice - a voice capable of moving from the frivolously feminine to the willfully cerebral, from girlish insouciance to bare-knuckled fury.
In 1984, she was awarded both the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contributions to literature and the National Medal for Literature.
 
'A Subversive Soul'
''If there were any real ancestor among American women for Mary McCarthy it might be Margaret Fuller,'' the critic Elizabeth Hardwick, a friend, once observed, referring to the 19th-century American editor, essayist, poet, teacher and translator. ''Both women have will power, confidence and a subversive soul sustained by exceptional energy.'' 
Miss McCarthy's accounts of sexual shenanigans in ''The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt'' in 1941 and ''The Group'' in 1963 created something of an uproar when they first appeared. But her notoriety in literary circles stemmed less from the scandal quotient of her fiction than from her adversarial literary and political stands. She had celebrated public skirmishes with Philip Rahv, Diana Trilling and Lillian Hellman; issued vitriolic pronouncements on Watergate and the Vietnam War, and became known for the ferocity of her book and theater reviews.
 
Perverse Opinions
At their worst, those reviews pointed up Miss McCarthy's weakness for catchy one-liners and her taste for willfully perverse opinions. Of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' she wrote, ''His work reeks of literary ambition as the apartment reeks of cheap perfume,'' and of Eugene O'Neill and ''The Iceman Cometh'' she declared, ''He is probably the only man in the world who is still laughing at the Iceman joke or pondering its implications.''
Yet at her best (as in ''The Stones of Florence'') Miss McCarthy was an erudite cultural historian, using her familiarity with history, politics and the arts - and the application of some plain old-fashioned common sense -to draw surprising connections and to make her readers reconsider their preconceptions.
''A career of candor and dissent is not an easy one for a woman; the license is jarring and the dare often forbidding,'' Ms. Hardwick said. ''Such a person needs more than confidence and indignation. A great measure of personal attractiveness and a high degree of romantic singularity are necessary to step free of the mundane, the governessy, the threat of earnestness and dryness. Moderating influences are essential.''
In the case of Miss McCarthy, she said, ''the purity of style and the liniment of her wit, her gay summoning of the funny facts of everyday life, soften the scandal of the action or the courage of the opinion.''
To Robert Lowell, Miss McCarthy was ''our Diana, rash to awkwardness,'' blurting ''ice clear'' sentences above the ''mundane gossip and still more mundane virtue'' of her colleagues. To Alfred Kazin, she was the owner of ''a wholly destructive critical mind,'' a critic with an ''unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or inconsistency in any literary effort and every person.'' And to Norman Mailer, she was ''our First Lady of Letters'' -''our saint, our umpire, our lit arbiter, our broadsword, our Barrymore (Ethel), our Dame (dowager), our mistress (Head), our Joan of Arc.''
 
Heroines Were Self-Portraits
The most tireless mythologizer of her life, however, remained Miss McCarthy herself. There were her memoirs: ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' (1957), the beautifully observed portrait of her painful youth, and the later, more workmanlike ''How I Grew,'' published in 1987. In addition, the heroines in Miss McCarthy's fiction form a sort of continuing portrait of the author: Meg in ''The Company She Keeps'' (1942), the clever Vassar girl, ''a princess among the trolls''; Martha, ''the bohemian lady'' in ''A Charmed Life'' (1955), whose need to ''tell the truth'' continually gets her into trouble; Kay, the skeptical iconoclast in ''The Group'' (1963), and Rosamund, the esthetic mother figure in ''Birds of America'' (1971).
These novels also included sharp-edged portraits of many of Miss McCarthy's friends and lovers: her second husband, the critic Edmund Wilson, was portrayed as a loud, unappealing intellectual in ''A Charmed Life''; and Rahv, her roommate and mentor as editor of The Partisan Review, turned up in ''The Oasis'' (1949).
Yet if Miss McCarthy's novels often read like thinly disguised exercises in autobiography, they also attempted to provide an idiosyncratic chronicle of American life - at least within her own intellectual set - as it changed over some five decades. Sexual freedom in the 1930's, radicalism in the 40's and 50's, Vietnam and the social upheavals of the 60's, Watergate and terrorism in the 70's - these are the larger issues that flicker in the background of the novels.
 
Fiction Was Difficult
There is a certain didacticism to these books, a feeling of willed creation, and Miss McCarthy herself acknowledged that she found it considerably more difficult to write fiction than essays or reviews.
Each novel, she once said, had its genesis with an idea. ''Birds of America,'' which chronicled the coming of age of a teen-age ornithologist, was meant to be ''a novel about the idea of equality and its relation to nature''. ''The Groves of Academe'' (1952), a satiric portrait of a scheming scholar and his colleagues, was intended to address the question ''Where is the justice for an impossible person?'' ''The Group,'' a chatty gossip sheet about the lives of eight Vassar women, was conceived as a study of the illusory idea of social and political progress that captivated so many young people in the 1930's.
That last novel, which brought Miss McCarthy both a popular audience and a movie sale, enhanced her almost legendary reputation for enraging old friends and acquaintances who thought they saw themselves as the thinly disguised and gleefully skewered characters in her fiction.
 
A Painful Childhood
Throughout her career, Miss McCarthy seemed preoccupied with two themes: what she called ''the idea of justice'' and the idea of self-reliance. Both impulses originated in her painful childhood, and both, in a sense, led to her later attempts to invent an identity true to her platonic conception of herself.
Mary Therese McCarthy was born on June 21, 1912, in Seattle, the daughter of Roy Winfield McCarthy, a member of a prominent Roman Catholic family in Minneapolis, and the former Therese Preston, whose father, a transplanted New Englander, was one of Seattle's most successful lawyers. She had three brothers, Kevin, Preston and Sheridan.
The early years of Miss McCarthy's life seem to have been a romantic idyll; she would later portray them as a lovely succession of parties and holidays, with May baskets and valentines.
''Both my parents were handsome, winning and romantic,'' she wrote. ''Their marriage was opposed by both families, partly for religious reasons, and partly because my father was an invalid, with an invalid's febrile vitality. He had a bad heart, and it was prophesied, from the first, that he would die young and leave his wife with a pack of children.''
 
'Dickensian Cruelty'
In fact, both he and his wife died in the great flu epidemic of 1918, and the 6-year-old Mary and her three brothers were sent to live with their great-aunt Margaret and her husband in Minneapolis. There, they experienced what she once called ''circumstances of almost Dickensian cruelty and squalor.'' The children were made to stand outdoors for three hours at a time in the snow, and they were regularly thrashed with a razor strop; Miss McCarthy recalled being beaten in one instance for receiving a school prize, lest she become ''stuck up.''
Miss McCarthy's bitter recollection continued: ''Two blocks away, my McCarthy grandparents, dwelling in sumptuous middle-class style, instilled in us the contrast between wealth and penury by occasional treats and vacations; it was thought beneficial that we should know we were orphans and fitted for a different destiny than our well-tended cousins.
''Today, some of my relations allege my literary successes and my brother Kevin's career as an actor as proof that the harsh formula followed in our upbringing produced results; nevertheless, I cannot feel grateful. Nor do I believe that artistic talent flowers necessarily from a wounding of the stem on which it grows.''
When she was 11, Miss McCarthy was rescued from her misery in Minneapolis by her maternal grandfather, Harold Preston, who took her to Seattle and gave her a fine education at the Forest Ridge Convent and the Annie Wright Seminary.
 
Puritanism vs. Romance
As ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' and ''How I Grew'' indicate, the twists and turns of Miss McCarthy's melodramatic childhood would develop two distinct sides to her personality: on one hand, the puritanical student who wants to win prizes for her scholarship and dreams of becoming a nun; on the other, the die-hard romantic who writes moody stories about suicide and prostitution and dreams of becoming an actress. In fact, before she left for college in 1929, Miss McCarthy took some acting classes at the Cornish Drama School in Seattle, where she met the actor Harold Cooper Johnsrud, whom she married a week after her graduation from Vassar. She would divorce him three years later.
By the time Miss McCarthy left Vassar in 1933, she said, she had become ''a wayward modern girl,'' determined, in the words of her colleague William Barrett, ''to hold her own with men - both intellectually and sexually.'' Her finely observed collection of interconnected stories, ''The Company She Keeps,'' would chronicle - in slightly disguised fashion - many of her adventures in these early post-college years, including the breakup of her first marriage, her desultory love affairs and her dabbling in Trotskyite politics.
Writing of that time, Mr. Barrett described the girlishly pretty writer as ''a Valkyrie maiden, riding her steed into the circle, amid thunder and lightning, and out again, bearing the body of some dead hero across her saddle.''
Two influential men of letters, Rahv and Wilson, would play important roles in the shaping of Miss McCarthy's career. Rahv, with whom she lived during the 1930's, helped her to get her first literary job - writing theater reviews for the magazine; Wilson, whom she married in 1938, persuaded her to try writing fiction. He put her in a room, she recalled, and told her to stay there until she finished a story. Their tempestuous marriage produced one son, Reuel, and ended in divorce in 1946. Later that year she married Bowden Broadwater, a writer and teacher.
 
Satiric Wit
With a clinical eye and an apparently total gift for recall, Miss McCarthy used her satiric wit to illuminate the pretensions and prejudices of her fellow intellectuals. Much of her writing was devoted to exposing what she regarded as the ignorance, bigotry, dishonest sentimentality and affectation that cluttered the intellectual marketplace.
She defended Hannah Arendt and William Burroughs when it was fashionable to assail them, and attacked J. D. Salinger, Kenneth Tynan and Arthur Miller when others were singing their praises.
The litigious Lillian Hellman was so incensed, in 1980, by Miss McCarthy's description of her in a television interview as a ''dishonest writer'' that she instituted a $2.25 million defamation suit.
Hellman's death in 1984 placed the lawsuit in limbo, making Miss McCarthy feel somewhat put out. ''I still feel disgusted by the amount of lying that didn't stop,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I wanted it to go to trial, so I was disappointed when she died.''
 
Busy Despite Health Problems
Miss McCarthy married James Raymond West, a former director of information for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in 1961. They divided their time between an apartment in Paris and their house in Maine.
In addition to her husband and son, Miss McCarthy is survived by two stepsons, Daniel West of Los Angeles and Jonathan West of Lodz, Poland; a stepdaughter, Alison West of Manhattan; two brothers, Kevin, of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and Preston, of Millsboro, Del., and two grandchildren.
In recent years, Miss McCarthy had several operations for hydrocephalus (water on the brain), but maintained a hectic schedule, working on another volume of memoirs, contemplating a study of Gothic architecture, teaching literature at Bard College and learning German. She recalled telling a friend some two decades ago that she ''never woke up in the morning without a feeling of intense repentance and a resolve to be better.''
''I don't do that anymore - or almost never,'' she said in a recent interview. ''But I do have this idea of improvement, if not in one's powers, at least in one's vision, in one's understanding. I suppose it's all tied up with the American belief in progress. Not that I have that as an idea, but I certainly have it in my personal life. I couldn't live without feeling I know more than I did yesterday.''

HEADLINE: MEDICARE CUTBACK EXPECTED TO ADD TO PRIVATE RATES

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Insurance experts and members of Congress say millions of older Americans will face higher health insurance costs if Congress repeals or cuts back the Medicare program that pays for the catastrophically high costs of a major illness.
The higher expected costs would come in the form of higher premiums on policies offered by many private insurers to cover the difference between the total cost of an illness and what the Government pays under Medicare.
The planned Medigap increases were not unexpected by the health insurance experts. Private insurers had said earlier this year that they were holding down increases because many benefits had been picked up by the Federal program. The proposed increases are subject to approval by individual state insurance regulators. 
 
Increases Up to 43%
Industry officials and members of Congress said in interviews over the past two days that private insurers have proposed or plan to propose increases in premiums ranging from 10 percent to 43 percent to compensate for an anticipated increase in coverage if Congress, as expected, repeals or sharply curtails the program to pay for major illness.
The officials said they could not precisely estimate the number of older Americans who would face higher payments, but they noted that 25 million of the 33 million Medicare recipients carry the additional insurance.
Congress passed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in June 1988 to help the elderly avoid financial ruin from the cost of a major illness after President Ronald Reagan proposed the plan. But Congressional curtailment is near because of strong protests from elderly taxpayers opposed to the income tax surcharge that helps finances the program.
 
Sullivan Opposes Repeal
President Bush has not taken a position on the issue. But Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, opposes repeal.
Some companies are awaiting final Congressional action before proposing the amount of their increases. The legislation is now before a Senate-House conference committee. The House voted to repeal the program that places a ceiling on elderly patients' payments for hospital and doctor bills and would pay much of the cost of prescription drugs. The Senate voted to retain only the hospital benefits.
Premiums for Medigap policies range from about $200 to about $1,300 a year. The Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association estimates that repeal or cutback of the Medicare program to pay for major illness will increase monthly premiums in its policies by an average of 43 percent, or $21, in the North; 26 percent, or $14.22, in the West; 26 percent, or $12.38, in the East; 21 percent, or $11.40, in the South, and 15 percent, or $8, in the Midwest.
These increases would be in addition to increases that Blue Cross says would be to cover the cost of inflation in health care of 33 percent in the North; 14 percent in the West; 5 percent in the East and 10 percent in both the South and Midwest.
Under the Medicare program to pay for major illness, an elderly American who earns more than $15,000 annually pays the mininmum surtax, which is $22.50 for every $150 of income taxes paid, while an elderly citizen with an income of more than $35,000 pays the maximum of $800. The program is also financed by a $4 monthly premium deducted from the Social Security checks of all Medicare beneficiaries.
Many of those who pay the surtax said they resented paying to finance a program that duplicates the private coverage they have as retirement benefits.
Congressional authorities estimate that about 20 million elderly taxpayers with incomes below $15,000 would receive the benefits under the program without paying the surtax. This group is among those who now face the prospect of going without Medigap policies or having to pay for benefits they would have received under the Government program at little cost.
 
Very Poor Are Unaffected
Insurance industry officials said that repeal or curtailment of the program is unlikely to affect the very poor, whose health benefits are covered by Medicaid.
''The people who are mostly going to be hurt by this are the 20 million who wouldn't have paid any surtax,'' said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, the chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee and a co-sponsor of the program. Mr. Stark said he did not believe the prospect of premium increases would cause Congress to preserve the program, because those who would be hurt most were the least influential politically.
Mr. Stark said, ''These companies all told us this year that they raised their premiums less than they would have otherwise because the government's catastrophic coverage plan had taken over some of the exposure that their plans had covered.''
The proposed rate increases for private insurance have stirred renewed controversy on Capitol Hill about the lobbying campaign waged by those who sought to repeal the surtax and ended up nearly destroying the program, which was passed with bipartisan support. The program pays for hospital costs above $560. Beginning Jan. 1 it would pay doctor bills of more than $1,370 and beginning in 1991 it would pay for half the cost of prescription drugs of more than $600.
The Health Insurance Association of America, which represents the health industry, estimates that supplemental insurance is held by more than 25 million people, or 78 percent of the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries, of whom 30 million are 65 and over and 3 million are disabled.
A majority of those with such insurance pay for it themselves. Three out of 10 older Americans receive some Medigap insurance as a retirement benefit, but many of them purchase additional Medigap insurance from private companies, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
 
Empire Blue Cross Waiting
Albert A. Cardone, chairman and chief executive officer of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which covers New York City and suburbs, said, ''If the Federal government covers less and we have to cover more, it would make sense to have a premium increase.'' He said that his organization would await final Congressional action on the program before applying for a rate increase.
Officials of the American Association of Retired Persons said that the policy that the organization offers through the Prudential Insurance company will probably seek an increase 25 percent above inflation if the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was repealed and 15 percent if the program is drastically curtailed.
Representative Brian J. Donnelly, Democrat of Massachussetts, and a sponsor of the House bill that would repeal the program, was asked about the rate increases sought by his home state and elsewhere, and said, ''These are only rate requests.''
''These companies always go to the high mark,'' Mr. Donnelly said. ''We're going to keep a close eye on these people to make sure that they don't gouge the seniors. I hope these insurers don't think they can take advantage of the elderly.''

HEADLINE: H.U.D. Economist Says Bosses Pressed Him to Approve Grants

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
The economist for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in New York says two former regional administrators improperly pressured him and other subordinates several times to support favored grant applicants. Two examples that he cited as the worst involved projects with ties to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
The two regional administrators, Joseph Monticciolo and Geraldine McGann, are longtime associates of the Senator. Both were sponsored for their H.U.D. jobs by Mr. D'Amato. All three have denied any impropriety.
The H.U.D. regional economist, David Burns, spoke in a recent interview. He is the first high-ranking New York H.U.D. official to talk extensively in an interview about how the troubled office was run. 
In 1987, Mr. Burns said, Mr. Monticciolo ordered him to approve a project site proposed for the Lower East Side of Manhattan that Mr. Burns was going to reject.
''He said, 'Look, David, you're going to have to change your recommendation,' '' Mr. Burns recalled.
 
'Caved In'
Mr. Burns, in his own words, ''caved in.'' Within months, a Long Island-based construction company, Jobco, was chosen general contractor for the Lower East Side project. Jobco is a major campaign contributor to Mr. D'Amato, and it employs the Senator's brother as a lawyer.
Mr. Burns's account contradicts sworn testimony Mr. Monticciolo gave before Congress last summer, when he said he had never pressured his technical staff members to change their recommendations.
Mr. Monticciolo's lawyer, Robert Hill Schwartz, who is handling all questions for him, did not reply to a list of questions submitted in a telephone call by a reporter. Mr. Schwartz did not return frequent follow-up calls.
In 1988, Mr. Burns recalled, Mrs. McGann pressured him to approve a senior-citizen housing project at 105th Street and First Avenue in Manhattan that Mr. Burns had planned to reject because he thought the area already had too much subsidized housing. Again, Mr. Burns says, he gave in, and the project was approved for a nonprofit group whose board includes the Senator's mother and a former aide to Mr. D'Amato.
Mr. Burns, who has held his post for 15 years, said the two projects were ''the worst sites I'm aware of that were approved'' by the H.U.D. office in recent years. He described the neighborhoods as already filled with subsidized housing and abandoned buildings, and he called them dangerous for the elderly.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for the Senator, said that neither Mr. D'Amato nor his staff had spoken to H.U.D. officials about the Lower East Side project. ''We had absolutely no knowledge who the developer was going to be,'' Ms. Mucha said.
A lawsuit by a neighborhood group has prevented construction on the Lower East Side project.
Mr. D'Amato, a New York Republican, has said that while his staff has given ''technical'' aid to the nonprofit group sponsoring the 105th Street project, the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens, he never pressured H.U.D. on its behalf. Reports of Pressure Are Denied Asked by members of a House Government Operations subcommittee who were investigating political favoritism at H.U.D. if he ever pressured his technical specialists to change their decisions for ''your own justifiable or unjustifiable reasons,'' Mr. Monticciolo testified, ''I've never tried to change the outcome.''
In an interview, Mrs. McGann said the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens was chosen on its merits, and it ''didn't make a difference'' who was on the board. Representatives of Jobco and the foundation also said they were chosen on merit and knew of no pressure applied on their behalf.
Mr. Burns's assertions, taken along with recent Congressional testimony by another former high-ranking New York administrator, Alexander Naclerio, portray an office where H.U.D. regulations were often bent, broken or waived to justify and mask political or personal favoritism.
Mr. Burns recalled being sent to work on a H.U.D. project in Seabrook, N.J., and being told by Mr. Monticciolo: ''Don't do anything improper. These are not my people.''
In September, Mr. Naclerio testified that Mr. D'Amato's influence was so extensive that Mr. Monticciolo made sure ''things were cleared with Senator D'Amato,'' and that his H.U.D. phone had a rapid-dial button to the Senator.
Mr. Monticciolo and Mr. Naclerio were recently subpoenaed to appear before a Federal grand jury in Brooklyn investigating H.U.D.'s New York office.
This month, the Housing Secretary, Jack F. Kemp, disciplined Mrs. McGann, moving her from New York to the Washington office, after an internal investigation concluded that she had violated ethics rules in connection with a program in her hometown of Island Park, L.I., in which her son and a cousin of Mr. D'Amato were among those awarded subsidized houses.
The regional economist is one of the top 20 staff members in H.U.D.'s New York office, which includes 950 employees. He evaluates potential housing sites, determines the feasability of projects and sets rents for the government to charge.
Mr. Monticciolo was the fourth regional director that Mr. Burns worked for as economist, and Mr. Burns said he had never been pressured this way before. He said he felt the pressure was improper because he was being asked to issue a false recommendation. Mr. Burns said the interference occurred most frequently on Section 202, a program for building senior-citizen housing. Both the Lower East Side and the New York Foundation projects are under Section 202. Winning Applicants Had D'Amato Ties There were other indications of problems and favoritism with the 202 program. In 1985, H.U.D. officials in Washington were so displeased with the projects chosen for grants by the New York office, they revised the list, something that had never happened in H.U.D.'s nine other regional offices.
An examination of H.U.D.'s New York records indicated that about two-thirds of the successful applicants for Section 202 grants during 1986-88 had at least one major participant who was a D'Amato contributor. Several of those contributors said in interviews last summer that they gave because they believed Senator D'Amato had major influence in the office.
One project knocked off the list by H.U.D. officials in Washington in 1985 was sponsored by the senior-citizens foundation. The Senator's mother, Ann, and his former aide, Deborah Smith Bernstein, joined the foundation's 29-member unpaid board that year. The next year, New York again approved the project, and this time it won a $5.7 million grant.
In an interview last summer, Senator D'Amato said his staff might have gone ''to extra lengths to help a great, great group, and it's one I'd continue to help because they do great work.'' He said his staff had given similar ''technical'' assistance to other worthy groups seeking Section 202 grants.
Each applicant for a senior-citizen project was supposed to be ranked by H.U.D. on a rating system, which gave points for quality of the site, management team and architectural and engineering plans. Typically, 100 nonprofit groups vied for 15 grants each year in New York and its suburbs.
Mr. Monticciolo told Congress that everything was done by the book, that he followed his specialists' recommendations.
'Take Another Look At the Site'
Representative Donald Lukens, an Ohio Republican, asked, ''Do you remember at any time ever pressuring any staffer who contributed to the merit system in terms of changing their rating?''
Mr. Monticciolo said he sometimes asked, ''Why did you give these points?'' ''Or in some cases,'' he continued, ''sites were turned down, and then we would get them to go back and take another look at the site or send the superior out to look at a site to determine whether or not it was acceptable.''
''You might have once or twice attempted to change the outcome for your own justifiable or unjustifiable reasons?'' Mr. Lukens asked.
''I've never tried to change the outcome,'' Mr. Monticciolo replied.
Mr. Burns called Mr. Monticciolo's testimony ''misleading and untruthful.''
As economist, Mr. Burns had the power to reject a site if the area was ''unduly concentrated'' with subsidized housing. ''You don't want another Yonkers,'' he said, ''with all the subsidized housing loaded in one area.'' He said he only rejected a site if it was ''a complete disaster.''
In 1987, Mr. Burns intended to reject a site in Manhattan, at Ninth Street and Avenue C, proposed by the Lower East Side Coalition Housing Development. His rejection would almost certainly have killed the project, he said, because there are few available sites that meet H.U.D. criteria in the area where the coalition wished to build.
''It was a low-income area with an overriding concentration of assisted housing,'' at least 60 percent, he said. ''Putting it there was almost a policy of segregation. This is exactly what the law didn't want to happen.''
First, he said, he was asked to change his decision by two of ''Monticciolo's lieutenants in the housing department.'' Then, he said, he was called in by Mr. Monticciolo's assistant at the time, Mrs. McGann, who showed him a memo supporting the site.
To make sure he wasn't being unreasonable, Mr. Burns said, he asked several colleagues to evaluate the site, including John Kemp, the H.U.D. economist for New Jersey, who is not related to the current Housing Secretary. In an interview, John Kemp said he, too, thought the site should be rejected.
''Then Monticciolo told me we were going to take a ride and look at the site, and took along McGann and Jerry Blue,'' Mr. Burns said. Mr. Blue was a special H.U.D. assistant whom Mr. Monticciolo had hired from Senator D'Amato's office.
A Car Ride Changes a Rating ''They really wanted this project for whatever reason,'' Mr. Burns recalled. ''We hadn't left the garage, when Gerri McGann said to me, 'David, try to be objective.' I said, 'You try to be objective.' Monticciolo told me to shut up.
''We got near the project, and Monticciolo said, 'This doesn't seem bad.' And then there was block after block of devastation. He got very quiet. All of a sudden he wasn't talking. Almost glum.''
''I went into his office afterward. I said: 'Joe, I'd like to get along with you, I'd like to be a loyal employee. But it would make a farce of everything I do to change my recommendation. It would make my job meaningless.' He said, 'We'll see.'
''Two weeks later, Monticciolo saw me. He said, 'Look, David, you're going to have to change your recommendation.' ''
Mr. Burns gave it a passing rating. ''When you're in any organization, you want to belong and not just be considered an outcast,'' he explained. ''And I hate to admit it, the bonus system was a factor. You're rewarded for getting along with the boss.''
Mr. Burns said there is nothing wrong with the administrator overriding a technician, if he takes responsibility for the decision. ''But Monticciolo would have had to provide something in the record, and Washington would be able to look at it. He'd rather have his technicians lie for him.''
The Lower East Side project was financed from Secretary Samuel Pierce's discretionary list, which was often used to satisfy political requests. A H.U.D. spokesman in Washington said no documents could be found indicating whether the project had a particular political advocate.
Representatives of the Lower East Side housing coalition said they knew of no elected official who pressured H.U.D. on their behalf. Ms. Mucha, Mr. D'Amato's aide, said that the Senator's staff gave the project no ''technical or special help,'' but that they may have written the type of form letter that the Senator routinely sends for groups seeking his support.
Mrs. McGann said she recalled no involvement by the Senator's office. She said there had been an honest disagreement among staff members, and the car ride was made to discuss the site. Asked why they didn't just overrule Mr. Burns, she said, ''You'd have to speak to Mr. Monticciolo.''
On Aug. 26, 1987, Mr. Monticciolo informed the Lower East Side Coalition of the approval, and a few months later the group selected Jobco of Great Neck, L.I., as general contractor. No bidding is required by H.U.D. in such selections.
Favoritism Charged In Hiring Jobco According to Federal election records, Jobco's owners have given $9,600 to Mr. D'Amato's campaigns and were the hosts of a fund raiser for his 1986 campaign. Armand D'Amato, the Senator's brother, has done legal work for Jobco for years.
At the Congressional hearings last summer, committee members questioned whether Mr. Monticciolo had shown favoritism in picking Jobco for a White Plains housing project. Though Jobco was the third and last choice of White Plains officials and was not the low bidder, H.U.D.'s New York office intervened and Jobco was picked.
Mr. Monticciolo told the panel he had followed his specialists' advice. But when Mr. Naclerio, who supervised the specialists, testified last month, he said Mr. Monticciolo ''urged and told me he wanted Jobco.''
The former director of the Lower East Side group, Luis Nieves, said three companies had responded to requests for proposals. He said Jobco was selected by his board based on its 40 years in the construction business. ''I had no discussions'' about Jobco, Mr. Nieves said. ''No one asked me to call them, to pick them.''
The president of Jobco, Robert Pascucci, said no one from H.U.D. or the Senator's office had aided Jobco in getting the Lower East Side job. He pointed out that Jobco had been doing Federal housing work for a decade before Mr. D'Amato became Senator. He said Jobco withdrew from the project last month because studies of the site showed ''bad subsoil'' conditions that would require expensive below-ground piles, so the project would not be profitable. He said Jobco had not received any compensation.
Paul Terry, a member of the group opposing the project, said the opponents had called Mr. D'Amato's office seeking help in stopping it but were told the Senator supported the project.
Mr. Terry recalled that while examining H.U.D.'s files, he found a letter of support from Mr. D'Amato and became ''really depressed.''
After 20 Years, A $2,000 Bonus In 1988, Mr. Burns said, when Mrs. McGann succeeded Mr. Monticciolo as regional administrator, she began pressuring him on three new projects.
''McGann's aide, Francine Kellman, said, 'Please, David, just look at these again,' '' he said. ''I knew what was happening. I knew it would be McGann next. I didn't want to drag the fight out again.''
He said he caved in quicker this time. That year on his evaluation, Mrs. McGann gave him the top rating, his first ''outstanding'' in 20 years at H.U.D. and his biggest bonus ever, worth nearly $2,000.
''She told me I was loyal,'' Mr. Burns said. ''It made me almost sad. I felt that I had to some extent prostituted myself, and I was getting a bonus.''
If Mr. Burns had rejected the senior-citizen foundation site, it would have killed the project. ''The area was 90 percent subsidized housing,'' he said. ''It wasn't a place for the elderly. I can tell you emphatically, we've got plenty of sites in the city much better.''
After the foundation received H.U.D. approval, the site was opposed by local residents. Ultimately, the nonprofit group decided to seek a location in another part of Manhattan. But because of H.U.D's 1988 approval, it is still eligible for the grant.
Linda Hoffman, director of the foundation, said she ''called the Senator's person in 1988 to find out when'' she would hear on funding for the project. ''I certainly never asked for anyone to pressure on the board's behalf.''
She said Mrs. D'Amato and Mrs. Bernstein had been named to the board because ''we're really looking for people who really care about what we're doing and people who can give their time and help.''
Mrs. McGann said she had never been pressured or exerted pressure on behalf of the foundation. Many sites for H.U.D. senior-citizen buildings in Manhattan are on city-donated land, which is usually not well located, she said, and compromises must be made if housing is to be built.
Asked whether she had sent her aide, Ms. Kellman, to question Mr. Burns's decisions, she said, ''I don't recall.''
Ms. Kellman said that she did not remember the specific project, but that hers is a ''go-fer'' job. She said that she regularly relays messages from the regional administrator asking staff members to reconsider projects, and that no pressure is intended when she does so.

HEADLINE: Rebels Step Up Killings in Peru to Disrupt Election

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Oct. 25

 BODY:
A leftist rebel group is mounting the biggest terror campaign in its history in an effort to disrupt Peru's municipal and presidential elections.
With the municipal elections scheduled for Nov. 12, the guerrillas have assassinated 123 mayors and other local officials, political leaders and candidates this year.
It is estimated that more than 400 candidates have resigned in fear, and Government officials expect many more to withdraw before election day.
''This is the first stage in a political military campaign whose ultimate objective is the presidential elections next April,'' said Raul Gonzalez, a political scientist and one of the leading authorities on the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla movement known in Spanish as Sendero Luminoso. 
 
Terror More Widespread Now
The Shining Path, founded in 1970 by Abimael Guzman, a philosophy professor at the University of Huamanga in Ayacucho, began its violent effort to take power in Peru with an attack on a rural voting station in the elections in 1980 that brought a civilian President to office after 12 years of military rule.
''The Sendero terror campaign is more widespread now than in any previous year, and it is widespread throughout Peru,'' a United States official said.
About half of the country's 21 million people live in emergency zones where the army is given broad powers to combat the guerrillas. In recent opinion polls terrorism has ranked as the country's greatest concern, a few percentage points ahead of the economy, which declined by 20 percent last year. Narcotics trafficking, the greatest concern of the United States in Peru, was a distant third.
Six months ago, in a demonstration of Shining Path's growing strength, about one million people obeyed the group's demand for a three-day ''armed strike'' in the country's mining and farming heartland, cutting all supplies of food, electric power and export minerals from three Andean provinces to Lima on the Pacific coast.
 
Greater Protection Urged
''They have been getting stronger and stronger,'' said Senator Enrique Bernales, a Socialist. ''They are installing a network in the whole country. This is the most serious threat Peru has ever faced.''
Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian novelist and front-running presidential candidate of the center-right Democratic Front coalition, called on the Government this week to provide more protection for candidates against ''those who want to destroy our democratic system.''
Though the Shining Path imposes an ascetic personal code on members that forbids the use of drugs, it is financing its revolution with earnings estimated at as high as $30 million a year from Peru's cocaine industry. Serving as broker to obtain better prices for growers, it extracts taxes from peasants and fees from traffickers for the use of airfields.
American and Peruvian officials say they do not believe that the Shining Path, with an estimated 4,000 armed members, is capable of blocking either of the coming elections. But its strategy, the officials believe, is to reduce the number of candidates and voters so that the validity of the elections is thrown into doubt, raising the possibility of a return to power for the military.
''The idea is to get the military to step in, with the expectation that the usual repression of a military government would improve the climate for the Senderos, push more people in their direction,'' a United States official said.
 
Military Accused of Abuses
International human rights oganizations have accused Peru's armed forces of widespread abuse of human rights in the name of maintaining order.
The Peruvian Senate's Committee on Violence and Pacification, the most widely relied upon source of statistics on violence here, says Shining Path terrorism is running at an all-time high.
So far this year 1,016 civilians and 293 soldiers and policemen have died in political violence, compared with 1,030 civilians and 289 soldiers and policemen for all of last year. The Shining Path has lost 1,026 dead this year, compared with 667 last year, the committee said.
As the elections approach, the tempo of violence has been picking up. Last month, the committee said, 155 people died in political violence, compared with more than 270 so far this month.
Today, Shining Path guerrillas shot to death an official of the Education Ministry and his nephew in the Andean village of Acobamba, 185 miles east of Lima, The Associated Press quoted the police as saying. In Lima, Reuters reported dynamite attacks today on the Soviet and Chinese Embassies. It said the police blamed the Shining Path in the attacks, which caused minor damage at the two embassies.
In 1984, as the army carried out a major campaign against the Shining Path, civilian deaths were higher than this year. But Western diplomats and some Peruvians say they believe that many of the civilians were killed by the army.
''Without question, this is the most violence we've seen from Sendero,'' an American official said.
The greatest disruptions in the November elections are expected in seven departments along Peru's Andean spine. One of them, Junin, is at the point where the main road from the mountains leads into Lima. Junin is also the location of the main hydroelectric plant for the capital and the source of much of its food.
''Fifty percent of the voters in those areas will probably not be able to vote,'' said Agustin Mantilla, the Minister of Interior, who oversees the nation's police.
Most of the slain mayors have been killed in towns with only a few hundred people, but fear has spread across the nation.
''They are killing some and giving others a time frame in which they will be killed if they don't resign,'' Senator Bernales said. ''Every day we are getting calls and letters from people saying they are resigning their candidacies.''
In Ayacucho, where Shining Path was founded, two of the three candidates for mayor have resigned and the third has moved into a hotel in Lima, 220 miles to the northwest.
''Outside the department capitals the candidates are doing very little campaigning,'' Senator Bernales said.

HEADLINE: Reagan Sees Virtue in Sale of Studio to Sony

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Former President Ronald Reagan told Japanese audiences today that he welcomed Japanese investment in the United States and that Sony's recent takeover of a big motion picture studio might even ''bring back decency and good taste'' to American movies.
Speaking at midpoint in his nine-day visit to Japan, Mr. Reagan addressed one of the most delicate recent issues in Japan-American relations by saying it was hypocritical for Americans to invest in other countries around the world and then oppose Japanese investment at home.
''Some of those people don't know what they're talking about,'' the former President told an audience of corporate executives and other wealthy business people at a black-tie dinner this evening, referring to critics of the proposed takeover of Columbia Pictures by Sony, the Japanese electronics company.
''If America looks like a good investment, why, we should be pleased and proud of it,'' Mr. Reagan said. He added that the United States remained the largest global investor in other countries and then commented, ''Who are we to bellyache about somebody else wanting to do that?'' 
The former President made his comments in a speech and a television interview featuring some of his most freewheeling thoughts since leaving office in January. He appeared to be in a buoyant mood as a result of the affectionate greeting he has received since arriving here on Friday.
 
Grateful for Quake Aid
On several occasions, he told the Japanese how grateful he was as a Californian that $6.5 million had been raised privately so far to help victims of the northern California earthquake.
He also used his platform to challenge Japan to use its enormous economic resources to increase aid to Poland, something that the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is considering. The Government is said to be uncertain and divided over how much aid to give.
Addressing several other recent issues, Mr. Reagan defended President Bush's recent actions in Panama, saying Mr. Bush was correct in declining to use American troops stationed in Panama to back a military coup to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. ''I think we'd lose most of our friends in Latin America had we done it that way,'' Mr. Reagan said.
Mr. Reagan, as he has before, also criticized China for cracking down on protesters in June. But in an unusual aside, he also suggested that the students might have been partly to blame for pressing their own claims too fast and too far, undercutting those who favored progress in China.
''I love those young people, and I agree with what their feelings are, but did they handicap people who were quietly trying to do what they want?'' he asked in the television interview.
 
Cost of Trip Is $6 Million
Mr. Reagan arrived here on Friday as the guest of the Fujisankei Communications Group, a news media conglomerate whose owners are politically conservative supporters of the former President and his policies. The group is paying more than $6 million to bring Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, to Japan, including a $2 million fee to Mr. Reagan himself.
Spokesmen for the Fujisankei group and for the Foreign Ministry have made no secret of their hope that Mr. Reagan would speak out against what Japanese fear is a growing protectionist sentiment in the United States. The former President stuck to generalities until now, but today he fulfilled the hopes of his Japanese hosts.
In the television interview for the Fuji network, owned by Fujisankei, he was asked about the negative reaction in the United States to the Sony deal. ''I don't feel there's anything wrong with that,'' Mr. Reagan interjected, adding that as a former actor ''I'm not too proud of Hollywood these days, with the immorality that is shown in pictures and the vulgarity.''
''I just have a feeling that maybe Hollywood needs some outsiders to bring back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that are being made,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Jordan Vote Stirs Fervor Where Fiat Is the Rule

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT, Jordan, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Six months ago, many of the young men of this town were throwing rocks at the police in what they called their version of the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands across the Jordan River.
These days, those same young men are hoisting banners and streamers aloft in preparation for Jordan's first parliamentary general election in 22 years - a ballot called precisely because the rocks were thrown in an outpouring of rage and frustration over what many saw as the authorities' mismanagement of the nation and distance from the people.
The vote, set for Nov. 8, is laden with portents that go beyond the borders of this small, economically ailing kingdom of three million people that frequently figures in United States diplomacy, sandwiched between Arab dictatorships and the turmoil of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
 
Expectations Are Raised
The ballot will choose a legislature empowered to reject and generate laws and force governments out of office. But its powers are severely limited by other rules that permit the King to dissolve it, as he has done in the past when deputies became too troublesome, or to invoke martial law and keep it in force for decades. 
Despite those frailties, the election has raised expectations and the question of whether it is possible to implant democratic tendrils in a region ruled more by force and coercion than by the ballot.
And it raises anew the uncertainties and frustrations of Jordanians of Palestinian stock, who represent the majority of the population. Some face a difficult problem: by voting in an election apparently aimed at supporting the Hashemite monarchy of King Hussein, they also dilute the argument that the Palestine Liberation Organization is their sole representative.
 
Maneuvering of British
It was in this town in 1920 that the British, embroiled in maneuvering with France for influence in areas that had once formed part of the Ottoman Empire, announced that the country should be given self-government, thereby rewarding the Arab nationalist they had enlisted on their side against the Turks allied to Imperial Germany in World War I. In 1921, the British installed the Emir Abdullah, King Hussein's grandfather, in Amman to found the Hashemite dynasty of a land then called Transjordania.
There are few here who argue that the King could avoid an election. ''The Government is in trouble, the regime is in trouble,'' said Kamel Abu Jaber, a political scientist from Jordan University. ''We have always had political crises. But we have never before had a political and an economic crisis together at the same time.''
 
'Share With the People'
''The King has come to the conclusion that he cannot control the country in the way he did in the 60's and 70's,'' Dr. Abu Jaber said. ''If he wants to maintain the continuity of the regime, he must share with the people.''
Despite those complexities, there is great fervor in Jordan's cities at the unaccustomed prospect of a vote. The newspapers are filled with advertisements placed by would-be legislators from a dizzying array of backgrounds that range from Muslim fundamentalists to Communists.
It is, some candidates say, a gamble for King Hussein that will determine whether he can buttress his regime against the region's and his own country's tensions, or confront new instability like the protests that seized parts of the country, including this town, last April. The King has ruled Jordan for the 37 years since he was enthroned at the age of 18. The vote presents a wider test, too, of Arab leaders' reluctance to countenance even limited loosening of control.
''The more democracy Hussein allows to take place, the less Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia will like it,'' a Western diplomat said, referring to the highly centralized and authoritarian governments on Jordan's borders and suggesting that a quasi-democratic example might stir passions in Jordan's neighbors.
Within the harsh conventions of Arab politics, few Jordanian analysts expect more than a gradual change, and an acknowledgment of popular sentiment. ''Sharing power is a very strong demand among the voters and the candidates,'' said former Foreign Minister Taher al-Masri, a Jordanian of Palestinian descent who is running for parliament. ''It will be very gradual, but the Parliament will change the concept of political life.''
''I don't think anybody is interested in making a change in the regime,'' said Laith Shubeilat, an Islamic candidate running as an independent.
 
Election and Coup in 1956
Jordanians last held a general election widely accepted as fair in 1956. A year later, an attempted coup by leftists provoked the King to bar political parties, dismiss Parliament and jail legislators. In 1967, Jordanians faced another election shortly before the Six-Day War with Israel, but that was widely held to be rigged and many voters boycotted it.
There has been no general election since then because the King argued that a vote was impossible while the West Bank of his kingdom was under Israeli occupation. In July 1988, however, the monarch severed Jordan's ties with the West Bank in response to the Palestinian uprising there. The action unnerved Jordanians of Palestinian descent, who are at least 60 percent of the population, and who increasingly voiced apprehension that they had become second-class citizens.
The decision coincided with other dynamics. King Hussein's land had slid into economic crisis with an $8 billion foreign debt. The monarchy and its chosen governments were perceived by many as aloof and uncaring. Some ministers were widely seen as corrupt.
 
A 'Shaken' Image
''Many things were exposed - corruption, debts, the abuse of authority, bad management and so on,'' said Jemal Shair, a Christian Jordanian campaigning in Salt on behalf of his small Union of Democratic Unity. He said the King's ''political image, even in the eyes of his friends in the West, was shaken.''
Then, last April, austerity measures imposed to meet the terms of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund ignited riots that spread from the southern town of Maan to Salt. Palestinian Jordanians generally steered clear of the protests, leaving the authorities with the conclusion that discontent had infected the East Bank Jordanians who had been seen as a bedrock of loyal support.
Prime Minister Zaid al-Rifai, a longtime associate of the King, was dismissed and new elections were promised.
Under a new electoral law, Parliament will be expanded from 60 to 80 seats and the West Bank Palestinians, who held 30 of the seats in the old legislature, will no longer be included or vote. The law, however, has drawn new electoral boundaries that weight the outcome of the election heavily in favor of the relatively conservative and loyalist countryside, against the more politicized and restive cities, particularly Amman, the capital, where the bulk of Jordan's Palestinians live.
 
Palestinian Registrations
''Palestinians are being asked to vote to show loyalty, but not be properly represented,'' said Ibrahim Abu Ayyash, a Jordanian of Palestinian descent who is a member of the Palestine National Council, which the P.L.O. calls a parliament in exile.
Up to 60 percent of Jordan's Palestinians did not register to vote, according to Mr. Abu Ayyash and others, though most of them hold Jordanian passports. ''The general attitude among people was that the elections will be rigged, so why bother?'' he said. ''The King's men will be everywhere, so why register?''
Another reason, Mr. Abu Ayyash said, was that ''since July 1988, Palestinians have been treated differently.'' ''There's discrimination against Palestinians,'' he continued.
The P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, is said by Western diplomats to have told King Hussein that he will not interfere in the vote. But a Western diplomats said the P.L.O. might well ''drop hints about the suitability of candidates.''
By many accounts, the King called the election in an effort to broaden the base of his regime, and thus its legitimacy, effectively surrendering some power to maintain control. But his motives remain inscrutable to most candidates and voters.
''In secret, people do not believe the King is sincere,'' said Yacoub Zayadeen, leader of Jordan's outlawed Communist Party.
''There's a lot of skepticism that the King will clamp down,'' said Dr. Abu Jaber, the political scientist. ''But what alternative do we have? This is a test. It is a test for the regime. It might give it new life or it might cause its death.''

Prosperity Threatens Refugee Of Vietnam

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., Oct. 25

 BODY:
Kham Dinh Do is a survivor.
In 1949, he opened a jewelry store in the northern Vietnamese port of Haiphong, naming it Dat Hung, or ''Attaining Prosperity.'' It lived up to its name.
When the Communists took over the upper half of Vietnam in 1954, Mr. Do fled south to Saigon, opening a second Dat Hung store there. It too lived up to its name. 
Twenty years later, just four days before the Communists seized Saigon, Mr. Do fled once again, this time landing in this northern Virginia suburb just across the Potomac from Washington. Today he runs a third, prospering Dat Hung, one of the economic anchors of ''Little Saigon,'' a section of Arlington where Vietnamese refugees have established three dozen or so shops and restaurants over the past 15 years. Today 40,000 Vietnamese have settled in the Washington area, the largest concentration of Indochinese refugees on the East Coast.
But Mr. Do's struggle may not be over. He may be forced to flee still again, not from the Communists but from the wrecking ball.
It is a matter of economics. A subway station in Little Saigon, officially known as the Clarendon section of Arlington, has begun to draw upscale developers.
Back in the days when there was no subway and only struggling Vietnamese refugees were interested in Clarendon's run-down commercial properties, store space could be rented for as little as $5 a square foot. Today, it goes for upward of $25 a square foot in new buildings, and many of the old buildings are being emptied so that they can be demolished and replaced.
A number of businesses have already been forced to move, with several going to suburban shopping malls where other Vietnamese-operated stores are situated. The merchants who remain say that while business is still good, the disappearance of those stores and restaurants has cost Little Saigon some of its popularity as a major social gathering place for the Vietnamese.
''The streets here are not as crowded with Vietnamese at night or on weekends as they once were,'' said Emerson H. Lee, a former Saigon tax official. Mr. Lee, who like many refugees has Anglicized his name, Le Huu Em, now works as an accountant in Little Saigon, watching over the books of many of the section's merchants.
''Vietnamese refugees do not tend to live in specific neighborhoods,'' he added, ''but they tend to shop and gather in certain places, like Little Saigon. In most of these places, the Vietnamese businessmen have only small stores or offices, so they cannot pay big rents. Here in Little Saigon, we have formed a committee to work on the problem, and what we would like is for the local government officials to help us persuade developers to put up some buildings that small merchants can afford. We have been good for Arlington. We have struggled and made success.''
Mr. Lee was attending a tax seminar in Washington when Saigon fell. Rather than return, he found work as a bus driver and began studying accounting, finally passing the examination and setting up his own business in 1983.
Arlington officials say they do not want development to destroy Little Saigon. That is also the position of the Clarendon Alliance, a coalition of neighborhood developers, residents and business people.
''We would like for the Vietnamese to stay because they have helped make the neighborhood a place where people not only work but also live and shop,'' said Andrea Grenadier, the group's executive director. ''We don't want just a bunch of tall office buildings. We like the ethnic flavor. But keeping the right balance is a little tricky. We're working at it.''
Mr. Do, bent over his jeweler's bench, says he is optimistic that the coalition will achieve its goal and that Little Saigon will endure. But if not, he will not despair.
''Nothing stops me, nothing,'' Mr. Do said in clear English.
''I have moved before. I can do it again. I can survive.''

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
Bush on Capital Gains: A Matter of Experience

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Like other mortals, Presidents have only so much time and so much energy (although George Bush spent his vacation this year trying to disprove that self-evident proposition).
So from the dozens of issues that confront their Administrations, they all choose a few to concentrate on. And they all make the choices for one of two reasons, singling out either problems they care about in a visceral way or problems with potential electoral appeal.
President Bush, to the surprise of many people in Washington, seems to have settled on the reinstatement of a tax break on capital gains, eliminated as part of the tax law enacted in 1986, as one of the symbolic issues of his first year in the White House. 
He has been pushing the idea since early in the Presidential campaign last year, and he kept at it since then even though the smart money said he was wasting his time.
It will look like an increase in the budget deficit when we're supposed to be cutting it, the experts said. The Democrats will call it a rich man's perk, the experts said, and the Democrats did precisely that.
Yet the President managed, with the help of Southern Democrats, to maneuver the capital gains tax cut through the House, and he thinks he has the votes in the Senate. Even leading Democrats think he may ultimately get what he wants.
Mr. Bush called a group of Republican senators to the White House on Tuesday, then sent them out into the driveway to attack the Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill. Today he pressed a few Democratic senators who have expressed some interest in the subject to help him get an up-or-down vote on his idea - to no avail.
The President makes his pitch to anyone who happens along. He told an interviewer this week that the nation had given him a mandate for his capital gains proposal by voting for him last November after debates made it clear that ''Bush is for it; his opponent is against it.''
The Senate leadership, he insisted, has been ''frustrating the will of their own majority.'' Completing his pitch, he asked intently: ''Did you get all that down? It's very important.'' How come? For one thing, Mr. Bush shares the conventional Republican view that lower taxes on capital gains stimulate economic growth for all by putting more money into the hands of entrepreneurs who can invest it in new job-generating projects.
But quite apart from that, an old friend said, Mr. Bush's experiences as a young oil executive shaped his views.
''Ronald Reagan paid 91 percent income taxes during his peak years as an actor, and that made him a crusader for lower rates,'' the friend said. ''George Bush didn't take much salary out of his company down in Texas. He took stock, hoping for big capital gains, and he has believed passionately ever since that people who take chances to build things ought not to be penalized.''
Mr. Bush's already strong convictions, the friend said, were reinforced by those of former Representative William A. Steiger, a Wisconsin Republican who died in December 1978. Mr. Steiger, who served with Mr. Bush on the Ways and Means Committee and was his best friend in the House, pushed through the capital gains tax cut of 1978 almost by himself.
Seeking to make publicly palatable what the President instinctively favors, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady asserted recently that three-fourths of the benefits of a cut in the capital gains tax would flow to people with annual incomes under $50,000. But the nonpartisan staff of the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation calculated that 80 percent of the benefits would go to those with incomes of more than $100,000 a year.
In political terms, it probably doesn't matter. Although Americans harbor a deep-rooted belief that their taxes are too high, they haven't focused sharply on this debate.
A poll of 1,000 adults taken early this month by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman for Time magazine and CNN, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, showed that only 23 percent had paid a lot of attention to the capital gains issue, with 40 percent paying some attention and 35 perent paying none at all. And opinion was pretty much split - 45 percent for a tax cut, 37 percent against and 18 percent not sure.
Not much electoral oomph there.

 BODY:
Washington sets the pace for contributions to international aid agencies, and once again it is dawdling. The International Development Association - the World Bank agency that lends to the world's neediest - needs another refill. But the Bush Administration can't seem to find $100 million in next year's budget to keep I.D.A. lending at current levels. Stalling in the face of starvation sets a sorry example. 
To be poor enough to qualify for an I.D.A. loan, a country's per capita income must be less than $790 a year. Can any country be that poor? Yes. Some 90 countries have qualified for almost $55 billion of I.D.A. assistance in the 28 years it has been in business. Among the 34 current contributors are two that once got I.D.A. aid themselves - South Korea and Colombia.
I.D.A. is restocked every three years. For the next three, it seeks $14.5 billion. While that's $2 billion more than the last replenishment, it would only maintain I.D.A.'s lending capacity in step with inflation. The United States used to provide one-quarter of I.D.A.'s funds, but the Reagan Administration allowed it to slip. The U.S. is still the largest donor, though, at $958 million a year. An increase of just $100 million a year for 1991-93 would keep the U.S. share from slipping further.
In five negotiating sessions so far, the other main donors have indicated they'll increase their donations proportionately if Washington comes up with the $100 million. But the U.S. delegation has still made no commitment. Another negotiation is scheduled for next week in Kyoto. If there is no agreement then, it is feared that the others will redirect their funds to agencies that directly serve their special interests - Western Europe's in Africa, and Japan's in Asia.
While Congress is usually tight with funds for foreign aid, the Administration can't use that excuse in I.D.A.'s case. In 1986, when President Reagan wouldn't contribute to a special I.D.A. fund for Africa, Congress voted $225 million anyhow. I.D.A. has special appeal to Congress's black caucus. And it's one agency whose loans can't be said to be ''bailing out the banks.'' Countries that borrow from I.D.A. are so poor that banks won't lend to them. These countries are desperate. For $100 million, the United States can show that it cares.

HEADLINE: In Capital, Jersey Rivals Behave Like Statesmen

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD D. MAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
During the months they have been vying for New Jersey's top office, James J. Florio and Jim Courter have appeared as likely adversaries if not natural enemies. But here in Washington, where both candidates for governor are members of the House of Representatives, they do not seem to be cut from very different cloths.
Both are lawyers raised in New Jersey and New York. Both project images as bright, dynamic, youthful Congressmen, though Mr. Florio comes off as rough-hewn and rather earthy, in contrast to Mr. Courter who appears polished and a bit aloof.
Each was elected to Congress just after his 37th birthday. Mr. Florio, at 52 years old, is four years older than Mr. Courter and preceded him on Capitol Hill by two terms. Both have been concerned about the crime, illicit drugs and soaring automobile-insurance premiums. 
 
Similar Political Traits
Mr. Courter serves on the Armed Services Committee, a fitting assignment for a no-nonsense, mainstream Republican. Mr. Florio serves on Energy and Commerce, equally appropriate to a no-nonsense, mainstream Democrat. Both sit on the Select Aging Committee. (Mr. Florio has a third seat on Veterans Affairs.) ''They have very similar political characteristics,'' said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University and the author of ''House and Senate,'' just published by by W. W. Norton. ''Both are serious legislators. Neither is viewed as a lightweight. I've seen both debate on the House floor and they're both good at it.''
One more thing they have in common: Despite their statesmanlike demeanor on Capitol Hill, both have been willing to wage an unusually mean-spirited campaign against one another in New Jersey, one that has included sharp and sometimes loosely substantiated attacks on the honesty and integrity of the other.
''It's interesting and disturbing to me,'' said Richard V. Sinding, president of the Center for Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton. ''Florio and Courter have clearly worked hard to carve out reputations in Washington as gentlemen of some substance. And yet in this race they have gone at each other like a couple of party hacks.''
As members of Congress, the differences between Mr. Florio and Mr. Courter stem largely from divergent interests and priorities. In recent months, the pressures of the campaign have caused both to miss many debates and votes in the Capital.
But today, Mr. Florio - who has been endorsed by abortion-rights groups - did make a brief appearance in Washington to vote for an override of President Bush's veto of a bill expanding Federal payments for abortion in cases of rape and incest. The override effort fell short of the two-thirds majority needed. Mr. Courter, who has said he opposes abortion in most cases but would not ''impose my views on the people of the state,'' decided not to interrupt his campaign schedule to participate in the vote.
Mr. Florio's voting record wins the support of liberals and unions. He is widely regarded as a leading expert on the environment; most significantly, he receives primary credit for championing the establishment in 1980 of a Federal Superfund to pay for toxic-waste cleanups.
His ''community right to know'' law has for the first time required corporations to tell local residents and authorities precisely what potentially hazardous substances they are producing. Three years ago, Florio legislation established a system for removing asbestos from the nation's schools.
Transportation and consumer affairs have been other areas of concentration. Mr. Florio fought against cutbacks for Amtrak and for the upgrading of the passenger and freight rail system along the Eastern corridor.
He has also stood out as one of only a few Democratic Congressmen to push for legislation to reduce the influence that special interest groups wield through political action committees. But such bills have not passed. An articulate proponent of limited government, low taxes and free-market economics, Mr. Courter is also considered an expert on defense policy.
But unlike most Republicans who focus on the Pentagon, he has held the generals' feet to the fire on wasteful spending. In particular, legislation he wrote has sought to increase the percentage of military contracts awarded through competitive bidding.
Mr. Courter has also favored more money for military projects he considers worthwhile, like the Strategic Defense Initiative - also known as Star Wars - and he has argued for military aid to the contra rebels battling the Nicaraguan Government.
 
Some Failures by Both
''He's a smart guy and he's been a serious player on the Armed Services Committee,'' said Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of that committee. ''He's been a chief water carrier for the Administration on all the defense bills we've come out with in recent years.'
Occasionally, each man has made forays into the other's sphere. Last summer, for example, Mr. Courter pushed for a bill to ban oil exploration off the New Jersey coast for the next decade, and he has advocated stricter measures for controlling acid rain.
Mr. Florio was a co-author last year of an amendment to the Omnibus Trade bill authorizing the President to block any acquisition of a military supplier by a foreign company if it would jeopardize national security.
Both Congressmen have also suffered what might be interpreted as failures. For example, over the 14 years that Mr. Florio has represented Camden - where he is also the leading local political power - it has continued to decline and decay.
 
'They've Both Done Well'
Mr. Florio does not deny the deterioration, but he suggests that the onus belongs more with the Republican Administrations in Washington than with him, Congress or local officials.
''The cities of our state and nation have not fared well over the last eight years,'' he said. ''At a time when cities are in a state of disrepair, the Federal Government has bailed out on making efforts to rehabilitate them.''
As for Mr. Courter, even though he serves on the Military Installations and Facilities subcomittee, he failed to prevent Fort Dix, the nation's second-largest military training base, from being included among bases scheduled for scaling-down or closing.
''Overall, I think they've both done well in Washington,'' said Richard Roper, director of the Program for New Jersey Affairs at Princeton. But one important difference, he added, is that ''Florio's concerns have been much more home-based, and that's got to be an advantange for somebody running for governor.
Another factor working to Mr. Florio's benefit and Mr. Courter's detriment is that the Democrats have been the majority party in Congress throughout their tenure.
Neither Congressman maintains a presence in Washington as they do in New Jersey. Mr. Florio generally stays in the capital only three nights a week, he said. When he is in Washington, he lives in a one-room efficiency apartment above the International Liquor Store, a few blocks from his Capitol Hill office. Mr. Courter rents a one-bedroom apartment in a renovated town house in Arlington, Va.
Mr. Courter generally stays in Washington from Tuesday till Thursday, the days that the House is actually in session.
Both politicians explained their desire for wanting to exchange the House of Representatives for the State House by saying that they had experienced larger than anticipated frustrations trying to translate their ideas and arguments into policies and practice in Washington.
''As governor I think you could accomplish things in a way that's very difficult to do as a legislator, particularly one from the minority party,'' Mr. Courter said.
Mr. Florio echoed that thought: ''In Washington you're one among many, many Congressmen. As Governor, I think I could really make an impact.''

HEADLINE: Region and State at Odds Over Adirondack Park

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARANAC LAKE, N.Y., Oct. 25

 BODY:
Concerns about the environment and home rule run deep here in the heart of the Adirondack Park, a place that is both the year-round home of 130,000 people and the greatest surviving wilderness east of the Mississippi. On Tuesday its residents had a chance to speak their minds.
More than 1,000 people, some driving for hours to get here, crowded into a college gymnasium to present their views to a state panel charged with forming a plan to guide the Adirondack Park into the next century.
The panel, the Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century, is to present its recommendations to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo on April 1. Its members are traveling around the state this month and next, asking people from Long Island to Buffalo what their hopes are for the park, which is now 40 percent state-owned. 
 
Checkerboard of 6 Million Acres
''The Adirondack people have been excellent stewards of this land for generations,'' John McIntyre, Supervisor of the small town of Westport, said at the hearing. ''This land is just as special to us, if not more so, than to those so-called visionary environmentalists out there.''
Arthur Potter, who lives in Washington, Conn., and owns land in the town of Long Lake, said: ''We're opposed to any additional acquisition of land by the state. We feel we're protecting our piece of the Adirondack Park better than any state agency could.''
The park is a six-million-acre checkerboard of state and privately held land, within a boundary known as the Blue Line. Since 1973, when the Adirondack Park Agency was set up to regulate land use and zoning within the Blue Line, residents have complained that they are losing control over their property. Policy in the park, which covers one-sixth of New York State and is about the size of Vermont, must answer to often-conflicting forces.
There are environmentalists who would have the state buy more land and leave it untouched; tourists who want both easy access to the park and a pristine setting when they get here; foresters who make their living from the park's trees; developers looking for quick money; sportsmen who balk at restrictions on hunting and fishing, and full-time residents, who juggle a complex set of feelings about the land and their place on it.
Many of the people who spoke at Tuesday's seven-hour hearing, said they resented being told what they can and cannot do on their property. ''Every time you turn around, you've got to fill out some paper work,'' said Daniel Reilly of Franklin Falls.
Bruce Phillips, a retired airline employee from Westport, said he and his parents had put most of their money into land, hoping to build on it and make a profit some day. But now, he said, he probably cannot. ''I wish they'd leave us alone,'' he said.
 
Concern Over Economy
At the same time, residents said, they want limits on large developments, which they associate with places that have been built out of control.
In a region where unemployment sometimes reaches 18 percent, people are worried about how they are going to survive economically under increased restrictions.
The residents said they want to encourage tourism because the region depends on it. But they bristle at tourists' attitudes that they have as much right to the land as year-round residents.
People here resent that only two of the commission's more than a dozen hearings were scheduled within the park.
Members of the commission point out that the state pays taxes on its 40 percent of the park's land. ''The park has been a park for the people of New York State for 25 years,'' said Peter A. A. Berle, chairman of the commission. ''We're all taxpayers, and there's a vested state interest.''
As the evening wore on, some residents charged that the state's mandate to keep state-owned land in the park ''forever wild'' was keeping the state from properly managing it. The trees grow so thick, they said, that animals die and the land is of no use to visitors.
''We hear the scenic vistas are going to be lost if we don't buy them up,'' said J. Vernon Lamb of Lake Placid. ''But if they're left forever wild, there won't be scenic vistas any more.''

HEADLINE: The California Quake;
From Homes to Hospitals, Dimension of Loss Emerges

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25

 BODY:
As the dust continues to settle, public officials and the insurance industry are beginning to get a clearer picture of the vast toll of the earthquake that struck Northern California last week.
State officials say damage to private property has reached $6 billion. Several hundred to a thousand homes have been destroyed, more than 100,000 homes are damaged and about 14,000 people have been displaced. In addition, more than 1,000 businesses have been damaged or destroyed. 
Damage to public property increases the official state estimate of losses to $7 billion. Dozens of public buildings have been damaged, and six major highways have been rendered unusable for periods that are expected to last from a few days to a few years.
Virtually everyone agrees that the damage estimates are not exact or complete and that it is still too soon to get a clear picture.
''It seems everyone in the world has gone into the business of estimating dollar losses,'' said James A. Snyder, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, a trade association. ''Anything that's going to be available this soon is going to be a guess, an educated guess perhaps, but nevertheless a guess.''
He said a total damage estimate of $10 billion ''would be reasonable.''
Teams of insurance officials have moved in to estimate the losses, but have not yet announced their findings. In part, this is because many people are still too stunned to have filed claims.
Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services for the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill., an insurance trade association, said many people whose property was damaged or destroyed ''haven't really come to grips with their own personal lives.''
''Because of that,'' he said, ''they are simply not notifying the insurance companies that there may be a claim.''
 
Some Specific Estimates
Still, some fairly specific estimates are being compiled, including these:
* The State Transportation Department estimates that road and bridge repair will cost $700 million to $1 billion. The Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, whose collapse killed at least 39 people, will cost $50 million to $100 million to raze and replace. In addition, it will cost $200 million to $300 million for structural improvements to about 700 bridges and elevated highways throughout the state to make them more earthquake resistant, a job that had already begun before the tremor last week.
* In San Francisco, city officials estimate the damage to homes and businesses at $1.5 billion. Of those buildings inspected so far, about 250 were destroyed or have been declared unsafe, and 750 to 1,000 others are in need of major repairs.
* Damage to public property in San Francisco has been estimated at $500 million, although that figure could drop if two badly damaged public hospitals can be repaired instead of replaced. Nine public buildings have been declared unsafe. At San Francisco International Airport, a runway, the control tower and 20 percent of the gates were damaged. Repairs are expected to cost $7 million.
* In Santa Cruz County, which includes Santa Cruz and Watsonville, damage estimates have been put at $1.5 billion and continue to grow. In Watsonville, which has a population of 30,000, at least 195 homes have been destroyed and 235 sustained heavy damage. Elsewhere in the county, more than 400 homes have been destroyed or declared unsafe. Landslides caused by recent heavy rains have already destroyed 100 houses, and geologists warned today that more landslides are likely.
* In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose and the high-technology area of Silicon Valley, officials estimated that 104,000 homes sustained structural damage. Total damage in the county was put at $670 million.
* In Alameda County and Oakland, officials estimated property damage at $1.5 billion, not including the Nimitz Freeway. More than 3,500 homes were damaged; three public buildings were destroyed and 22 were damaged. The Port of Oakland, the Bay Area's major shipping center, had more than $100 million in damage.
* Stanford University in Palo Alto estimated its damage at $160 million. Several dormitories remain unsafe for habitation, and Memorial Church, which was rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake, is again in need of major repairs.
 
Hurricane Damage Cited
Still, the damage from the earthquake was heavily concentrated only in certain areas.
''I spent time in Charleston before coming here,'' said Mr. Strawn, the catastrophe investigator, referring to the South Carolina city that was hit by Hurricane Hugo last month. ''The damage there was far more widespread than here.''
But he said that, in terms of economic interruption and damage to structures like highways and bridges, ''this may be more costly.''
One thing already clear is that much of the earthquake damage will not be covered by insurance. Industry officials say only about 20 percent of homeowners have earthquake insurance, and damage to public structures is usually not covered by insurance.
The State Farm Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, the largest home insurer in the Bay Area, estimates that its payments for the quake will be $300 million. The company insures 316,000 houses in the Bay Area, 83,000 of which have earthquake protection. It also has earthquake policies for 39,000 businesses in the area.
Analysts estimate that State Farm might have 18 percent of the market for homeowner's insurance. If its experience is typical, that could mean that total earthquake insurance payments would be about $1.5 billion for homes and small businesses.
Joseph Wahed, chief economist at the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, said that if there is a bright side to the damage, it is that even $10 billion is small compared with the size of the area's economy.
''Within six months' time, the Bay Area economy will be off and running at full speed'' he said.

HEADLINE: HEALTH;
Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
As the influenza season nears, doctors are issuing their annual warnings that people at risk of life-threatening complications should get flu shots. But the vaccinations can also be valuable for otherwise healthy people.
A common notion is that the shot is primarily for those who are old or already sick, because the potential benefits to the young and healthy are minimal and perhaps no greater than the risks. But doctors say there is no medical reason not to get the vaccine, even if you are young and healthy.
Although I am healthy, middle-aged and not in a high-risk category, I have already made an appointment for my shot this year. One reason is that I tend to get very sick when attacked by the influenza virus, and my illness typically lingers for two months. Past attacks have been complicated by secondary infections. In addition, like many people, I simply don't have time to be sick, especially for the lingering aftermath of an infection like influenza. 
The flu is usually debilitating and painful. The symptoms include a fever, coughs and muscle aches throughout the body, and may include gastrointestinal upset. Complications, like bronchitis and pneumonia, can be serious and sometimes fatal.
The illness is also debilitating on a wider basis. In an epidemic year, the flu can cost the nation more than $6 billion, about 20 percent of which is in direct medical costs, while the rest involves lost wages and production.
The Centers for Disease Control, the Federal agency responsible for containing communicable diseases, says those at high risk of complications include everybody 65 years of age and over, and people of all ages who have chronic lung or cardiovascular problems like asthma, emphysema, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes or sickle-cell anemia.
The doctors also recommend the shots for children on long-term aspirin therapy for a problem like rheumatoid arthritis because a child taking aspirin after the flu can develop Reye's syndrome, an often-fatal swelling of the brain.
Anyone who, because of illness or medical treatment, has a poorly functioning immune system is also considered at high risk. And some flu experts recommend the vaccine for pregnant women, especially those who will be in their last three months of pregnancy in the winter. The experts say pregnant women face a greater risk of complications from the flu, and the risk of reactions to the shot are outweighed by potential benefits.
The vaccine is also recommended for people in jobs considered indispensable, like health care workers and police officers, as well as for others who are in close contact with high-risk people.
 
Vaccine and Its Effects
Dr. Edwin D. Kilbourne, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York and author of ''Influenza,'' which was published by Plenum Press in 1987, said the main reason for limiting the vaccine recommendation was a matter of availability.
''Manufacturers only produce about 20 million doses a year, and that's not even enough to cover the high-risk population,'' he said, adding that more than 50 million people are thought to be at risk. ''If millions of healthy people started demanding vaccine, there wouldn't be enough to go around. So public health authorities are reluctant to push universal immunization.''
But, he conceded, it is a Catch-22 situation. With the demand for vaccine low - only one-fourth of the people regarded as high risk get the shot each year - producers are reluctant to make more vaccine and take the risk of ending up with unsold vaccine at the end of the flu season.
Making the vaccine is no minor undertaking. Each summer a new vaccine must be devised to cover the strains of flu virus expected to predominate in the coming winter. This requires months of planning and the cooperation of thousands of chickens, since fertile eggs are needed in which to grow the flu viruses.
And since the natural viruses do not grow well in chick embryos, each year Dr. Kilbourne's laboratory genetically ''reassorts'' the viruses to infuse them with genes that foster efficient growth in the laboratory. The viruses grown in the chick embryos are then killed to produce a vaccine that can stimulate an immune response without actually causing influenza in those who receive it.
After the vaccine has been produced, usually by early fall, the companies disband their flu vaccine operations until the following year.
 
Selecting Viral Strains
If the flu watchers have guessed right in selecting viral strains for the vaccine, it will be 70 to 90 percent effective in preventing flu in those exposed to the infection in the next flu season. This immunity takes effect within 10 to 20 days and lasts about a year.
This year's vaccine was designed to protect against the three viral strains expected to cause illness in North America. They are two A strains, Shanghai '87 and Taiwan '86, and one B strain from Japan, Yamagata '88.
Many cities provide the shots free to elderly people and the chronically ill. For others, a shot usually costs $10 to $15, not including what the doctor charges for an office visit.
As vaccines go, the flu shot is considered very safe. Dr. Mark D. Denison of the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia who is an expert on infectious disease, said side effects are minimal. About 25 percent of those who get the shot develop a localized ache where the vaccine was injected, and 1 to 2 percent develop a slight fever and a more severe ache in the arm that lasts a day or two.
But the vaccine can be dangerous for people who are highly allergic to eggs.
Although toxic reactions are more common in children under 2, the vaccine is recommended for those over 6 months who have lung or cardiovascular ailments. To help prevent side effects, children are usually given a vaccine made from a virus that has been disrupted to decrease toxicity.
To minimize adverse effects from the vaccine, doctors advise people who are already suffering from an infectious illness to wait until they recover to get a flu shot.
''The vaccine is not ideal,'' Dr. Kilbourne said. ''The hope is to get one that will produce a longer-lasting immunity. Currently, even if the prevailing viruses don't change from one flu season to the next, the immunity induced by the vaccine only lasts one year.''
A longer-lasting vaccine would make mass immunization much more practical and economical, he said.
Although the ''official'' flu season does not begin until mid-December, Dr. Kilbourne and other specialists say it is wise to be immunized before December. Thus, the push is on to get all who need it vaccinated in October and November.
But Dr. Kilbourne noted that even after a flu outbreak has begun in a community, it is not too late to administer the vaccine to high-risk people, many of whom will be protected within 10 days of the shot.
 
The Path of Illness
Children who have not been previously exposed to flu virus are the primary vectors of influenza, which spreads through virus-laden droplets, like from a sneeze or a cough.
In children, the disease is sometimes misdiagnosed at first. Unlike adults, children often develop gastrointestinal distress along with the more typical flu symptoms of fever, muscle aches and coughs. And children do not usually get as sick as adults do from this viral infection.
During the holiday season, when people tend to mingle in close quarters, the virus begins to take hold among adults. In January, when children return to school, the disease peaks among all age groups, as infected children bring it home to their parents, who in turn may expose co-workers and others before they realize they have the flu.
A prescription drug, amantadine, or its derivative, rimantadine, may help people who have not received the vaccine but who may have been exposed to type-A influenza virus. In people who already have the flu, the drugs can diminish the severity of the illness and reduce the risk of complications. But they work best in people who are not yet sick but who have been exposed to the virus or may be exposed before the vaccine can develop effective protection. Because of possible side effects, the drugs are not recommended for otherwise healthy people, nor are they recommended for pregnant women.

HEADLINE: Extra Innings for Some Veterans

BYLINE: By JEFF SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POMPANO BEACH, Fla., Oct. 22

 BODY:
Fourteen years after his finest moment, pitching a shutout for the Boston Red Sox in the opening game of the 1975 World Series, Luis Tiant found himself working for the Massachusetts State Lottery, uncomfortable in a business suit and unhappy that his life seemed to be behind him.
So when a letter came asking if he would be interested in playing professional baseball in a new league for players older than 35, the 48-year-old Tiant, who left the majors in 1982, jumped at the chance. And so did more than 200 other people, many of them former major league players, coaches and managers, including Vida Blue, Rollie Fingers, Graig Nettles and Earl Weaver.
Last week, on eight baseball fields in Florida, some of the big names in the game's history put on uniforms once again, uniforms with strange team labels like Tropics and Gold Coast Suns, but uniforms nonetheless.
 
'You Never Forget It'
Stretching and grunting and never taking off the caps that would reveal their bald spots and gray hair, they began to practice for a three-month, 72-game season that will begin Nov. 1, maybe even before the World Series ends. It will be a season that its sponsors hope marks the beginning of a longstanding league and that, coupled with major league spring training, will make baseball a Florida attraction throughout the winter tourist season. 
Some players showed up because they need the money. The salaries in the league, which is called the Senior Professional Baseball Association, range from $2,000 a month to $15,000. But many of the players came because they need the glory and the camaraderie even more than money. Their memories are no longer enough of a substitute for the real thing.
''You never forget it; there's nothing like the big league,'' said Tiant, who was wearing a rubber shirt to help him shed some pounds as he worked out for the Gold Coast Suns. ''And after it's over, it's hard to adjust.''
''I've been hunting and fishing and building a house in Tahoe,'' said Dave Kingman, 40, the former home-run hitter for the San Francisco Giants, the Mets, the Chicago Cubs and the Oakland Athletics, whose major league career ended three years ago. ''But after you played ball for 17 years, you miss it. It's good to see the guys and know the competition is still in me.''
Most of the players, coaches and managers said that for once in their lives, they were going to play baseball their way, free of the high-stakes pressures that took away from the fun of the game in the majors, free of interference by the big league bosses.
''Let me make clear that we're playing to win,'' said Dick Williams, the 60-year-old former manager of six major league teams, including Boston, Oakland and the San Diego Padres, who will manage the West Palm Beach Tropics. ''But now we can finally have some fun and not have to worry about baby-sitting the millionaires.''
 
A Goal Like the Big Leagues'
Make no mistake, this is not a charitable endeavor. The owners of the eight teams, mostly lawyers and businessmen in their 30's, are novices at professional baseball and awed by the stars they have attracted. But while they may give their managers a freer hand, their chief goal is the same as that of the owners in the majors: to make a profit.
They'll do that, they hope, through ticket sales to tourists and elderly retirees and through the sale of broadcast rights to cable television. Prime Network, which reaches 18 million homes nationwide, has agreed to carry 30 games a season for three years. In the New York City area, the games will be broadcast on the MSG cable station.
The state of Florida has its financial interests at play in the enterprise, too. Eighteen major league teams have their spring training camps in Florida in February and March, generating tourism that, by state estimates, brings in $16 million a year to each of the 18 local economies. If only a fraction of that is generated by the new seniors league, state officials say, it will be an appreciable boon to local businesses. And the combination of the seniors league and big league spring training, they hope, might generate enough momentum to win a major league team for Florida.
Much of the long-term success of the seniors league depends on its ability to go beyond nostalgia and produce serious baseball. Wiseacres in Florida are already talking about its being ''the linament league.'' But if the last week's practice sessions are any indication, that might turn out to be a misnomer.
 
Some Fairly Young Players
For one thing, some of the players are relatively young, about half of them in their late 30's, some fresh out of the majors. And not all have given up hope of returning to the majors. Some free agents, like the 36-year-old Paul Mirabella, who was on the Milwaukee Brewers' roster last season but didn't pitch because of shoulder surgery, said they wanted to use the seniors league to show scouts that they were back in form.
And the older players - most of them in their mid-40's -seem trim and in surprisingly good shape, although there's no question that there have been some cramps.
''I'm starting to feel better,'' Mickey Rivers, the 41-year-old former Yankee outfielder, who last played in the majors in 1985, said at the end of last week after practicing for the Palm Beach Tropics. ''But there's a lot of soreness. It's going to take some time.''
On the field, the action seems quick and enthusiastic. On the first day of practice for the Winter Haven Super Sox, there was one stolen base, a triple with a play at third and two double plays. On the first day of batting practice for the Bradenton Explorers, Willie Mays Aikens, 36, hit 11 consecutive balls over the fence.
After two weeks of practice, each team roster will be cut to 24 players.
 
'No Potbellies'
''I think a lot of people who are laughing now are going to be surprised,'' said Weaver, who in his years with the Baltimore Orioles was regarded as one of the best managers ever and who is now managing the Gold Coast Suns. ''The guys are in great shape. They've worked out, no potbellies. You wait: they're going to be drafting some of these players back into the majors.''
The spectators, as might be expected for the first days of practice, were sparse, fewer than a hundred at each park. Mostly they were old men who, like little kids, brought bats and balls to be autographed. They cheered not so much the plays as the sight of men triumphing over age.
''Go, Mickey, go!'' Joe De Vuono, a 63-year-old retired Pepsi Cola deliverer formerly of Long Island and now of Boynton Beach, Fla., shouted to Rivers as he made a base hit. ''Show Steinbrenner he was wrong. You're not too old!''
The idea for the league was that of Jim Morely, a 33-year-old real-estate developer and former outfielder for a San Francisco Giants farm team in Fresno, Calif. He said the idea came to him while he was lying on a beach in Australia reading about a Senior PGA Tour golf tournament.
Morely sent letters of inquiry to 1,250 ballplayers over the age of 35 - or, in the case of catchers, over the age of 32 - and 730 wrote back that they would be interested. These included former players in the majors and the minors, as well as some who had been in semipro ball.
 
Looking for 8 Stadiums
He then looked for stadiums in central and southern Florida, with the criteria that each seat at least 5,000 spectators and that they be near enough to each other that players would have to travel no more than two hours by bus to each game.
With all that in place, Morely solicited groups of private investors for seven teams (he backed the eighth team himself), and 72 individuals or partnerships applied. Each has had to put up about $1 million to buy into a franchise. League officials will not say how much they are getting for the cable-television deal. But the real money for the owners will come, if it comes, from the franchises' catching on and eventually expanding, perhaps to Arizona and southern California.
To protect the owners, total salaries for the three-month season are capped at $550,000 for each team. Ticket prices will run from $5 to about $10 a game.
Richard B. Horrow, a lawyer who is president of the league, said that in organizing each team, the original intent was to create ''a family-reunion atmosphere'' that would keep former members of the same team together, ideally in the same towns where they had practiced in the spring. To a limited degree, it has worked out that way.
 
Bill Lee Is Back
In Winter Haven, where the Boston Red Sox hold spring training, the team is called the Super Sox and has the former Red Sox pitchers Ferguson Jenkins, Jim Willoughby, Bill Lee and Rick Wise. In Bradenton, where the Pittsburgh Pirates train, the Bradenton Explorers lay claim to the former Pirates Al Oliver and Manny Sanguillen.
In Port St. Lucie, where the Mets train, the St. Lucie Legends at least include some former New Yorkers, among them Graig Nettles and Jerry Grote.
And in West Palm Beach, the Tropics are building a team around some former Oakland A's, including Rollie Fingers (still sporting his handlebar mustache), Kingman, Tom Underwood and Rodney Scott. But one of Oakland's biggest legends, Vida Blue, wound up elsewhere, in Port St. Lucie.
The Gold Coast Suns have taken on several Hispanic players in an effort to appeal to the large Hispanic population of southeastern Florida. The team, which will play in Pompano Beach and Miami, includes Tiant, Ed Figueroa and Cesar Cedeno.
But for the most part, the teams - the others are the Fort Myers Sun Sox, the Orlando Juice and the St. Petersburg Pelicans - are pretty much a hodgepodge of players from everwhere.
How the players and managers can interrupt their lives for three months to work in the league varies from man to man. Some, like Bert Campaneris of the Gold Coast Suns, have been playing in other countries, like Japan, and have been looking for something in the United States. Others, like Rivers, have been working with youth groups and can take time off.
 
Golf: 'Enough'
A few, like Fingers, who represents a sports-entertainment concern, can do their business by phone. Many, like Tom Underwood, an investment banker, live in south Florida and merely take an extended lunch hour to come to practice.
And then there are those who have all the time in the world, the retired stars.
''I love golf, but after you play 25 straight days, you say, 'Enough,' '' said Weaver, who joked about being ''close to 70'' but is listed as 59 years old in the Baseball Encyclopedia. ''So when this came along, I said: 'Why not? Why not one more time?' ''
A fan shouted down to him, asking if Weaver, who was ejected from 91 games in his major league career because of his raging against umpires, would be thrown out of games in the new league, too. Weaver turned around and winked at him.
''I'd be surprised if I wasn't,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Senators See Delay in Capital Gains Tax Cut

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Senate Democrats who generally favor reducing capital gains taxes warned President Bush today that his only realistic hope of achieving a lower rate was to include it in a broader budget compromise, one that might have to wait until next year.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, one of eight Democrats invited to the White House to discuss the issue, said, ''We told him that if he expects Senate Democrats to walk away from the majority leader and violate the Senate rules to accommodate a capital gains tax cut, he was wasting his time and hurting the substance of the issue.''
The blunt assessment came as Senate Republicans expressed increasing apprehension about the political risks of tying a capital gains proposal to a bill raising the national debt limit, and began searching for other legislation to carry their cause.
In an unexpected move this evening, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, chief sponsor of a capital gains tax cut, offered his proposal -which would cut the tax for corporations as well as for individuals - as an amendment to pending legislation that would provide economic aid to Poland and Hungary. 
Mr. Packwood, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, made it clear that he intended this as a test vote to demonstrate that a majority of senators support a gains-tax reduction even though the number might not reach the 60 votes needed to assure passage by breaking a threatened filibuster. A test vote could come as early as Thursday.
In order to get 60 votes, Senate Republicans need to draw support from a pool of 10 to 20 Democrats who generally favor reducing capital gains taxes. But the President's meeting today, along with a similar one yesterday with 10 other Democrats, suggested that expected Democratic support for Senator Packwood's proposal was not forthcoming.
Without a timely increase in the debt limit, the Government would not be able to make Social Security payments on Nov. 3, and Republicans were clearly worried about the political implications of linking the two issues.
''We don't want to be placed in a political box of holding up Social Security checks for one issue,'' said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican. ''It's not that cutting the capital gains tax isn't a major issue, it's a question of what gets impeded in the process.''
In addition, some key Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee are deeply concerned about the wisdom of pursuing capital gains tax reduction at all this year, when there do not appear to be the 60 votes needed to assure Senate passage.
 
Not Just a Tax Issue
''Most of the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee favor capital gains reduction, but almost none of us agreed with the President to do it this year,'' said Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican on the panel. ''When the President was up here earlier this month, we told him, 'You're going to get capital gains, but you may not get it this year.' ''
Mr. Durenberger said the White House response was that cutting the capital gains tax was not just a tax issue, but a political issue that could be used to make the Democrats a minority party by dividing them.
''We're in two different ball games here,'' Senator Durenberger said. ''We're trying to make tax policy, and John Sununu is trying to make the Democrats a minority party.'' Mr. Durenberger was referring to the President's chief of staff, who along with the budget director, Richard G. Darman, and the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, have been involved in planning political strategy on the capital gains issue.
 
Packwood's I.R.A. Plan
Senator Packwood said he still favors an attempt to attach the proposal to the debt-limit bill, but said he was waiting for the President and the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, to make a decision. Mr. Packwood said he thought he would win a majority of Senate votes, and that such a vote would strengthen the Senate's bargaining hand with the House, which has approved a temporary reduction in the capital gains tax.
The Packwood proposal includes a plan to permit tax-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts once their owners reach the age of 59 1/2.
Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, the chief Democratic supporter of a capital gains tax cut, calculated the odds for passage this year as 1 in 3, with the odds improving next year to 2 in 3.
 
Robb Cites Deficit
Senator George Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, persuaded Mr. Boren not to offer a gains tax cut of his own and not to sign on as a co-sponsor of Mr. Packwood's plan. He also won a pledge from Senator David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who generally favors capital gains tax reduction, that he would vote against attaching such a tax cut to the debt-limit bill.
Senator Charles Robb, a Virginia Democrat whom the White House has considered as a possible supporter for a capital gains tax cut, said deficit reduction had to be the first priority. ''There are a number of us who don't want to address this until we do something about deficit reduction,'' he said.
The difficulty for Republicans in deciding whether to make their stand on the debt-limit bill is compounded by the legislative logjam that has developed as the House and Senate try to sort out other differences over deficit reduction plans.

HEADLINE: Alaska Spill Jolts Chevron, Too

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Public outrage over the 11 million gallons of crude oil that the Exxon Valdez spilled into Alaska's Prince William Sound in March has lashed the industry in many ways. But perhaps no company, Exxon included, has been jolted as badly as the Chevron Corporation.
The troubles at the nation's No. 3 oil company have spurred speculation about possible asset sales or even a takeover. This talk has helped the stock. Chevron's shares, which had fared badly in recent years, have been trading heavily in the last three weeks. It had reached a record high of $66.875 a week after the market plunge on Oct. 13. [The stock, the fourth most active on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, closed at $66.625, up $1.75.] Profits, which have seesawed in the last four years, are down. The company said recently that it earned $1.1 billion in the nine months ended in September, a 31.3 percent drop from $1.6 billion in the comparable period last year. In the third quarter, profits fell slightly, to $417 million, or $1.22 a share, from $420 million, or $1.23 a share, a year ago. Sales rose to $8 billion in the quarter from $7.2 billion in the period a year earlier. 
 
Reserves Blocked
Basically, the company's problem is that it has spent a lot for oil reserves, but a backlash of protest after the Exxon spill has kept it from getting at the oil still in the ground.
Two months ago, regulators in California revoked Chevron's permit to begin shipping oil 100 miles by tanker to Los Angeles from a gleaming new processing plant near the Point Arguello field west of Santa Barbara, Calif. The plant, completed and idle for two years, was designed to process enough crude for refining to fuel two million cars a day on the West Coast.
Chevron and 17 partners, including Texaco, Phillips Petroleum and Pennzoil, invested more than $2 billion in the project over the last 10 years but have yet to produce a drop of oil. Earlier this month, they filed a lawsuit to contest the latest in a long string of bureaucratic and political obstacles.
 
Setback in Alaska
In Washington, a storm of protests persuaded Congress to turn its back on Chevron's pleas to drill in the coastal plain of the Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska. Industry executives had expected Congress to open the area for exploration in 1989, but now some fear that drilling will be banned there for years.
Chevron is the largest leaseholder in the coastal plain, along with its partner, British Petroleum. They have not disclosed results of a well drilled two years ago, but experts estimate the region's recoverable crude at 3 billion to 7 billion barrels, which would make it the nation's largest new oilfield since Prudhoe Bay, with 10 billion barrels, was opened 20 years ago.
If these endangered projects are not rescued, it could take a heavy toll. Exxon put its tab for the Alaska cleanup at more than $1 billion, but write-offs and unrealized profits at Chevron would be much higher if the projects are scrapped. Its stake at Point Arguello alone exceeds $800 million.
Chevron could withstand the blow. A globe-straddling giant with $34.5 billion in assets, $15 billion in equity and $1.4 billion in cash, it is the nation's third-largest oil company as ranked by assets, after Exxon and Mobil. But the last thing Kenneth T. Derr, chairman and chief executive of Chevron since January, wanted as he started out was more delays.
 
'Very, Very Frustrating'
''After all this money's been spent, we've got oil sitting there unable to be produced,'' Mr. Derr said in an interview. ''This was an absolute reaction to the Exxon Valdez. Meanwhile, oil imports are hitting new highs every month. It is a very, very frustrating situation.''
Environmentalists in Santa Barbara argue that Chevron and its partners could not handle a spill a thousand times smaller than the one in Prince William Sound. They also say Chevron has not seriously studied opportunities to trade oil pumped from the Point Arguello fields.
Carole Ann Coles, public affairs director of Get Oil Out, an anti-oil group, said a pipeline under construction from Gaviota, Calif., to West Texas would enable Chevron to exchange its Point Arguello crude for oil shipped by existing pipelines to its refinery in El Segundo, Calif. [A study on trading oil from Point Arguello is to be released on Friday by Arthur D. Little, the consulting firm. Chevron, which paid $500,000 to underwrite the analysis, said earlier that trading was not a practical economic or technical option.] A Pledge to Stockholders Earnings and dividends at Chevron lagged during the industry's roller-coaster ride through the 1980's. Mr. Derr acknowledged early the urgency of turning Chevron around but boasted before the Valdez incident that Chevron's total return to stockholders would lead the industry over the next five years - a pledge he has not abandoned.
Most analysts agree that Chevron, the nation's largest refiner and marketer of petroleum products, has the assets and prospects for Mr. Derr to deliver more to the bottom line.
Chevron ranks sixth among the world's owners of oil and gas reserves and has properties in 98 countries, including high-potential fields in Angola, China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Somalia. It wants to be the first Western oil giant to develop fields in the Soviet Union and hopes to obtain an equity stake to explore in the Caspian Sea next year.
 
Debt Reduced
After buying Gulf Oil in 1984 for $13.3 billion, Chevron pared its payroll by 25,000, to 53,000, and sold $6 billion in assets to cut debt to $6.8 billion at the end of September, a moderate 31 percent of capital.
In California, Chevron has narrowed the sales lead this year in gasoline that the Atlantic Richfield Company wrested from it five years ago. Chevron trailed ARCO in the first seven months, averaging a market share of 16.2 percent against ARCO's 18 percent, and edged past ARCO in July.
Frederick P. Leuffer, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell in New York, and Bryan Jacoboski of Paine Webber Inc. said Mr. Derr must cut payroll and other costs further to improve Chevron's earnings but had moved too deliberately.
''There has been very little followthrough,'' Mr. Jacoboski said. ''He decentralized the company, but the results so far are fairly meager.''
In a report issued last month, Mr. Leuffer said corporate raiders or unwelcome bids from within the industry could force Mr. Derr to sell assets or repurchase stock to bolster Chevron's stock price. ''There is tremendous value in the company,'' Mr. Leuffer said.
To be sure, bidders would need at least $26 billion to buy Chevron, which would make it the most costly takeover ever. Some analysts see as possible suitors British Petroleum, nearly twice Chevron's size, and Nippon Steel of Japan. But others say Chevron is too large to be acquired.
 
Distressed by Rulings
Mr. Derr, a blunt-spoken mechanical engineer who rose to Chevron's top job by the age of 52, declined to discuss takeover rumors or possible asset sales. He appeared more distressed by local regulators in California and by Congress, pointing out that Chevron had spent millions to guard against spills, leaks and other potential damage to California's scenic coastline near Santa Barbara.
Now, he said, as protests block new production from huge domestic reservoirs, more tankers filled with foreign oil are plying America's waterways. The nation's dependence on foreign oil reached 47 percent of all oil deliveries for the nine months ended Sept. 30, and experts say it could exceed 50 percent as early as next year. Mr. Derr said protests against drilling in the United States had, perversely, resulted in more tanker traffic, raising the odds for another bad spill.
''Somehow the process has to work better,'' he said. ''If we were starting all over again, we'd just say there are better places. We'll go spend our money in the North Sea or somewhere else where if we find oil, we can develop it.''
 
Toxic Gas Problem
Chevron discovered oil in the Point Arguello field in 1981, two years after it paid $333.6 million for a Federal lease, the highest ever recorded for offshore drilling rights. Geologists initially thought 500 million barrels could be produced from the field, but later said 300 million was a better guess. Worse yet, concentrations of lethal hydrogen sulfide in natural gas reserves were triple the level Chevron had estimated.
An outcry over the higher levels among local property owners near the Chevron-operated processing plant at Gaviota forced Chevron early in 1988 to install, at a cost of $7.5 million, a smaller pipeline above the main gas pipeline in the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains. Its purpose is to monitor for traces of hydrogen sulfide in surrounding dirt.
Before that, Chevron and its partners added many other safety and civic-related features into their three offshore production platforms, pipelines in the ocean and beneath the coastline, and the processing plant. These are some of the projects:
* Members of several American Indian tribes were paid $25 an hour to sift the dirt dug from onshore-pipeline trenches for relics or artifacts that would warn construction workers that they had entered ancient burial grounds.
* Landscaping at the plant site included shrubs, grasses, eucalyptus trees and other vegetation that met Coastal Commission guidelines.
* A payment of $7.5 million was made to relocate 70 children in a temporary school, and an additional $12 million was spent for a new building.
* A gas turbine co-generation plant was built on the site, It produces all the steam and electricity required to operate the oil and gas units, with some of the excess to be sold to Southern California Edison.
 
Protests Bar Tankers
Santa Barbara County commissioners approved the plant for start-up in April after the pipeline was in place to monitor toxic gas leaks. But by then the League of Women Voters and Get Oil Out asked the Coastal Commission to keep tankers from docking at the Gaviota plant. On Aug. 8, the commission agreed. Chevron and its partners recently asked a county court in Santa Barbara to throw out the ruling.
Chevron does not expect any action from regulators or the courts until early next year. Meanwhile, Mr. Derr said the costs at Point Arguello, mounting by $3 million a day, were so high that the project would probably generate little profit even if it did go forward. But he has vowed to keep up the fight.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Supports Anti-Inflation Legislation

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that ending inflation in the next five years might lead to higher interest rates and lower economic growth temporarily, but would not lead to recession.
He said that stopping inflation, now running at an annual rate of around 4.5 percent, was ''a prerequisite for, over time, maximizing economic growth and standards of living,'' and added, ''I see no reason why over a five-year period we cannot restore price stability without incurring recession as a consequence of those actions.''
Testifying before the House Banking Committee's subcommittee on domestic monetary policy, Mr. Greenspan welcomed legislation that would instruct the central bank to adopt a monetary policy to ''eliminate'' inflation over five years. But he vigorously opposed another bill intended to make the bank more politically accountable. 
The second measure, he said, would discourage the Federal Reserve from taking unpopular steps that might be in the best interest of the country -like raising interest rates.
''We all know what happens when you have someone looking over your shoulder,'' he declared.
 
Enactment Called Unlikely
Mr. Greenspan's views on these matters were generally known before today, but this was the first time he had articulated and defended them publicly.
Neither bill is likely to become law. But the hearings, which are to continue into next year, provide a forum for a rare public examination of the operations of the Federal Reserve, one of the most powerful and secretive institutions in the Government.
In answers to lawmakers' questions, Mr. Greenspan made these other points:
* Tension between the Fed and the Bush Administration over interest and exchange rates has been overstated. The only disagreement, he said, revolves around ''relatively minor issues of tactics.''
* He would like to see a lower capital gains tax rate, but not if the political price were an eventual increase in overall income tax rates.
* He is concerned about a trend toward increased corporate debt.
Mr. Greenspan was treated with a degree of respect that Congress rarely grants public officials.
One after another, members of Congress from both parties praised the Fed's monetary policies, and asked gentle questions.
The anti-inflation measure under consideration today is sponsored by Representative Stephen L. Neal, a North Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee on domestic monetary policy.
The bill offers no specifics on how the five-year goal should be reached and provides for no penalties if the Fed falls short. Its purpose, Mr. Neal said, is to give political muscle to the Fed's anti-inflation efforts.
 
Closed-Door Meetings
The other measure is sponsored by Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, both Democrats. Mr. Hamilton has said they want to stimulate discussion of the Fed's structure and practices in relation ''to the normal standards of government accountability in a democracy.''
Despite its power, the Fed is more independent from the political process than any other part of the Government outside the judiciary.
The meetings of its Federal Open Market Committee, where policy decisions are made, are held behind closed doors. The decisions are not announced for six weeks, and even then only a skeletal summary of what happened is made public. No other branch of Government can veto the decisions.
The proposed measure would require the Fed's policy committee to meet formally three times a year with the Treasury Secretary, the budget director and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; would allow new Presidents to appoint their own Fed chairmen; require immediate disclosure of policy decisions; permit Congressional accountants to audit the Fed, and require its budget to be published with the rest of the Government's budget .
Mr. Greenspan argued that such restrictions would limit the Fed's capacity to ''resist short-term inflationary biases that might be inherent in some aspects of the political process.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower; Gold Prices Off in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower against major foreign currencies in thin, narrow trading yesterday.
Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $369.10 an ounce, down $1.10 from Tuesday. 
Currency dealers said the dollar got an early lift from comments from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, but edged lower mainly on technical factors. They said many dealers were awaiting today's release of third-quarter gross national product data, which should shed more light on the direction of the economy and interest rates.
 
Comments on Inflation
In testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan hinted that the central bank was unlikely to ease credit by lowering interest rates any time soon because the current inflation rate of 4.4 percent was too high to be ignored.
Firm interest rates are seen as bullish for the dollar partly because they make dollar-denominated securities more attractive to foreigners, thereby increasing the need for those investors to convert their money into dollars.
In late New York trading, the dollar was at 141.57 yen, up from 141.50 yen on Tuesday.
But it was weaker against the British pound, which brought $1.6143, up from $1.6075 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.8350 West German marks, down from 1.8358; 1.6075 Swiss francs, down from 1.6095; 6.2270 French francs, down from 6.2370; 1.17545 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17135, and 1,345.00 Italian lire, down from 1345.75.
Silver prices lost ground. On the Comex silver bullion for current delivery dropped to $5.114 an ounce from $5.148.

HEADLINE: Home Resale Rise Is 4.3%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes rose for the second consecutive month in September, climbing 4.3 percent to the highest level this year, a real estate trade group said today.
The National Association of Realtors credited lower mortgage rates for the spurt in home sales, which rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units. 
The September increase followed a 4.5 percent rise in August and marked the third time in the last four months that rates have increased since hitting a low point this year in May.
At the end of last week, fixed-rate mortgages had dipped below 10 percent, averaging 9.92 percent, according to a weekly survey conducted by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Last spring, mortgage rates hit a peak of 11.22 percent.
''Many people who were forced to put off trading upon entering the market earlier this year are making their move now,'' said Ira Gribin, president of the realtors association.
The national median price for an existing single-family home fell by $1,400 from August to September, to $93,400. This was still 5.5 percent higher than a median-priced home sold for a year ago. The median is the point at which half the homes sell for more and half for less.
Regionally, the sales advance was paced by a 12.7 percent increase in the West. Sales were up 3.7 percent in the South and 1 percent in the Midwest. Sales were unchanged in the Northeast.
The national sales pace of 3.63 million units was the fastest since homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.92 million units last December.

HEADLINE: JAPAN LEADING U.S. IN RAISING CAPITAL FOR CORPORATIONS

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 26

 BODY:
At a time when volatile swings and uncertainty on Wall Street have made it increasingly tough for American companies to raise money, the comparatively stable and strong Japanese stock market has been churning out record levels of fresh capital for Japanese corporations.
But in the United States, the amount of money raised from the sale of stock, the fuel for corporate expansion, has been shrinking from a peak three years ago. In the first eight months of this year, Japanese corporations raised more than $110 billion, compared with $20 billion by American companies, by far the largest gap ever between the countries, according to figures from the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Securities Data Company in New York.
 
A Profound Message
The boom in raising capital in Japan carries a profound message for competition between American and Japanese banks and corporations: Japanese companies are finding it easier to raise relatively cheap capital to modernize, increase productivity and expand. That could benefit them as they prepare for increasingly tough competition in the global marketplace. 
''The really awesome thing is what this will mean in three or four years, when the Japanese begin to realize the benefits of their investments and their productivity shoots up,'' said Eric Rasmussen, an economist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
In some ways, companies prefer selling stock to borrowing, because they do not have to repay the money, as they do with a loan. Of course, stock prices and interest rates can be volatile, which sometimes makes it more advantageous for companies to borrow funds. But because equity capital is permanent, managers can generally plan for the long term in a more stable environment.
 
The Rewards of Patience
Much depends on how patient the company's shareholders are in waiting for a return on their investment. That is another big difference between Japan and the United States: Japanese shareholders have been far more willing to hold their stakes for the long term. The short-term perspective of American shareholders, and their desire to take quick profits, is regarded as one important reason for the takeover and buyout boom in the United States.
Every month there are more huge offerings of stock here. For example, Sanwa Bank's announcement last week that it would issue stock to raise nearly $2.5 billion seemed such a commonplace that Japanese newspapers barely took notice. The deal would have made headlines in the United States, where such issues have been few and far between. The stock market crash in October 1987 marked a watershed in this capital-raising trend. In 1986 American companies raised a record $67.9 billion from the sale of stock and similar securities - money known as equity capital. That was more than double the level in Japan that year. In 1987 the two nations were nearly equal, with slightly more than $60 billion raised in each market.
That was when the uncertainties from the market turmoil took their toll. Equity-raising in the United States withered, while it rose sharply in Japan, where the market weathered the market crash with far less volatility and a swifter recovery. A stronger economy and greater stability in shareholdings in Japan, along with the firm hand of Government regulators, helped the Japanese market hold its ground and then resume its upward course.
 
More Than a Casino
What the contrast in the amount of newly raised capital underscores is that a strong stock market provides more than a casino for speculators.
Of course, many people criticize the Japanese market for shortcomings like high fixed commissions on trades and paltry dividend payments. In addition, extensive networks of cross-holdings, in which groups of corporations own large blocks of shares in each other, tend to reduce the voice of smaller shareholders.
But the market is performing the classical economic function of providing a means for investors to channel their savings into productive enterprises. Japanese save far more than Americans. And Japanese companies are feverishly translating that money into more productive operations.
''It's clear that this is helping Japanese companies in no small way,'' said Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. He said that the American market, unlike the Japanese market, has devoted much more time to takeover battles rather than capital-raising.
''It's true that in our country the focus has been much more on asset management and not raising capital,'' said John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, who is visiting Tokyo this week. ''Capital is pouring into Japan because of their economic growth rate, and it's looking for a home.''
 
'Massive Amounts' for Banks
Particularly for commercial banks, where capital can play an even more critical role in competitive strength, the difference between the markets has been lopsided.
Since the crash of 1987, American banks have raised $5.7 billion in equity, according to Securities Data; in the same period, just eight major Japanese banks have raised more than $22 billion, a study by Salomon Brothers found.
''The buoyancy and discipline of the Tokyo capital markets have enabled the banks to raise massive amounts of capital - sums beyond the wildest dreams of Western bank chiefs,'' Salomon Brothers wrote in the report.
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have risen spectacularly over the last decade, prompting criticism in Japan and on Wall Street that it is built on a foundation of soap bubbles that could burst at any moment. While Japanese stock prices trade on average at more than 40 times the companies' earnings per share, American shares trade for only slightly more than 10 times earnings.
As a result, it takes significantly fewer shares in Japan to raise the same amount of capital. And by issuing fewer shares, there is less dilution of the holdings of existing shareholders and of the company's earnings per share. In other words, the lofty level of the Japanese stock market makes it far cheaper to raise equity capital.
 
Interest Rates Low, Too
And when Japanese companies want to borrow money, they also have an advantage over American companies: Japan's relatively low inflation rate - less than 3.5 percent - and low interest rates make borrowing relatively inexpensive as well.
With its strong gains, the Japanese market has defied doomsayers for more than five years, particularly during moments of enormous stress, as at the time of the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, and two weeks ago, when Wall Street suffered its second-biggest drop ever.
The Tokyo stock market hardly skipped a beat when the New York Stock Exchange fell nearly 7 percent on Oct. 13; it dropped less than 2 percent and then bounced right back, causing no delay in Sanwa Bank's long-planned new-share issue.
Whatever the reason for that stability - and few agree on just what is behind it - the benefits to Japanese corporations are clear.
Nowhere is the difference between the two countries more pronounced than in commercial banking, where there is a worldwide struggle to build capital to meet strict new regulatory standards and to compete in the emerging international marketplace.
A study by Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. found that since the stock market crash two years ago, Japanese banks have nearly doubled their equity capital. About three-fourths of the gainis directly related to the strength of the Japanese stock market.
 
'Enormous Flexibility'
''If you can raise these funds in such massive amounts this easily, it gives you enormous flexibility in terms of expanding your business,'' said James Russell, Merrill Lynch's banking analyst here. ''This trend has all sorts of implications for even the average American company, in terms of where it's going to be getting its banking services in the future.''
For instance, after its just-announced offering, Sanwa Bank's shareholders' equity will stand at about $11.2 billion, more than double the $4.5 billion at the end of March 1987.
To be sure, Japanese banks face significant hurdles in their international expansion. Their major problem is that they have grown up in a highly protected domestic market. As a result, they lag behind their foreign rivals in developing high-margin new products and more sophisticated services. But their ability to invest heavily is allowing them to close this gap quickly.
The Japanese banks have benefited in two ways from the strong stock market. The first, of course, is that they have issued new shares and billions of dollars worth of bonds that later are converted to stock. The second is that their own portfolios of stocks have sharply risen in value.
 
The Rules Are Different
While American banks are restricted from owning shares in other companies, unless the holdings are in businesses that relate directly to their financial operations, Japanese banks can own up to 5 percent of other corporations.
Historically, the Japanese banks have used their shareholdings to reinforce ties to clients and other members of integrated financial and industrial groupings, known as keiretsu. Over time the value of those holdings has exploded.
That gain has generally not been recognized, because the banks reflect only what they paid for the stock on their balance sheets. But if they sell a fraction of those shares, they realize the gains to bolster their earnings and capital base.
And that well of capital runs deep. For instance, in a recent public filing in the United States in which it had to disclose the value of its stock portfolio, Mitsubishi Bank said that as of last March 31 it had the equivalent of $28.5 billion in unrealized stock gains, at current exchange rates.
 
Impact of Stock Profits
Salomon Brothers estimated that Japan's major banks earned $7.9 billion, or just under half of their pretax profits in the fiscal year 1988, from selling small amounts of their stock holdings.
And Mr. Russell found that 75 percent of the $24.4 billion increase in the shareholders' equity of Japan's seven largest banks from the end of March 1987 to the end of March 1989 had been accounted for by the issuance of new shares and the sale of some stock from their portfolios.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth in 3d Quarter Maintained Pace of Early 1989

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The economy grew at a 2.5 percent rate in the quarter that ended in September as a surge in consumer spending offset weakness in exports and the industrial sector, Commerce Department reported today.
The overall advance, which was somewhat higher than expected, matched that of the April-June period. And economists found reason to cheer in the report's indication of lower third-quarter inflation, even though that was mostly a reflection of falling energy prices.
The Bush Administration said it found little of concern in today's report on the gross national product - the total of goods and services generated by the economy - and portrayed the latest data as essentially positive. 
''The news is good,'' Michael J. Boskin, the President's top economic adviser, told reporters at a White House briefing. ''The economy has sustained its moderate growth through the third quarter. We expect it to be able to continue to do that for some time to come.''
But a highly pessimistic dissent was registered by C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics and a Treasury official during the Carter Administration.
 
No Growth in Exports
He said the trade data in today's report, which showed no growth in exports and a 15.1 percent rise in imports, were ''really bad news.'' The United States, he said, is in danger of moving suddenly from years of export-led expansion to ''import-led recession.''
Michael R. Darby, Under Secretary of Commerce for economic affairs, acknowledged ''disappointment'' over the trade data, but he said recent surveys of corporate purchasing managers indicated that export orders were starting to rebound. He added, however, that the strike against the Boeing Company, a top exporter, could undermine that trend.
The dominant sentiment among private analysts was that growth is likely to slacken significantly in the current quarter.
''When you look at the sources of strength,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist at Pittsburgh National Bank, ''it seems to me you won't be able to repeat many of them in the fourth quarter.'' Prominent among the strengths was a boom in sales of bargain-priced automobiles as the model year ended.
The inflation data in today's report were largely favorable. Combined with evidence of a slumping industrial sector, this suggested to many that the Federal Reserve would shortly take another modest step to reduce interest rates. In the credit markets today, however, bond prices edged lower, sending interest rates up slightly as market participants were generally unmoved by the report. The stock market had a broad-based decline that traders said was in part a reaction to negative aspects of today's statistics.
The G.N.P report's fixed-weight price index, which reflects the changing prices of a constant basket of goods and services assembled in 1982, climbed at a rate of just 2.9 percent in the third quarter, down from a 5 percent increase in the spring quarter. Falling energy prices contributed significantly to the improvement.
The G.N.P. price deflator, a less precise inflation gauge since it makes adjustments for changes in composition of the basket, also rose at a 2.9 percent rate during the quarter, down from 4.6 percent in the April-June period, the report showed.
Reflecting the heavy spending by consumers, who account for about two-thirds of economic activity, personal savings as a percentage of disposable income slipped to 5.1 percent, from 5.4 percent during the spring and 5.6 percent in the first quarter.
 
Spending Remains Heavy
Personal consumption spending increased by $37.5 billion in the third quarter from the second, or at an annual rate of 5.8 percent. This was slightly more than triple the 1.9 percent rate of gain posted during the spring and was the biggest jump since the first quarter of 1988.
Purchases of cars and other durable goods, which are items intended to last three years or longer, rose $15.1 billion, after a $5.6 billion increase in the second quarter, while nondurables jumped $8.9 billion, after a drop of $5.3 billion in the previous quarter. Spending on services climbed more slowly, by $13.5 billion compared with $12.3 billion in the second quarter.
But this bounce in the consumer sector was largely offset by a rise of only $6.6 billion in business investment in plant and equipment, down from a $10.4 billion increase in the second quarter; a decline of $2.3 billion in housing construction after a second-quarter drop of $6.3 billion; a $7.7 billion downward move in the Government's purchases of goods and services, and a $22.9 billion decline in the net export sector, in sharp contrast to a $3.8 billion gain in the second quarter.
 
A 'Split Personality'
In all, suggested Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist for Carroll McEntee & McGinley, a firm that deals in government bonds, the data ''reveal an economy with a severely split personality.'' He said the corporate and manufacturing sectors are weak, a situation that is likely to produce a third straight quarter of declining corporate profits. The report on third-quarter corporate profits is due to come out a month from now, when the first revision of today's G.N.P. data is released.
Weakness in profits, other analysts have suggested, could become an obstacle to lower interest rates as companies are forced to borrow money they had hoped to earn. In some cases, those borrowings may have to be used to service other debt.
Another worrisome sign, analysts said, was an acceleration in inventory buildup, much of it apparently involuntary. Business inventories added $11.1 billion to the third-quarter G.N.P. - $6 billion from the farm sector and $5.1 billion nonfarm - despite a sizable decrease in car and truck inventories.
Mr. Darby of the Commerce Department contended that in general ''inventories do not appear to be high relative to sales,'' but private economists said that car sales in the first 20 days of this month have been poor and that a fresh round of price concessions would probably be needed to move the vehicles.
 
Hurricane's Effect 'Negligible'
The report said that Hurricane Hugo, which battered the Carolinas in the quarter, had only a ''negligible'' effect on G.N.P. but that it had cut personal income at an annual rate of about $4 billion.
The latest figures put the annualized figure for gross national product at $4.16 trillion, compared with $4.13 trillion in the second quarter, after adjusting for inflation.
Because the figures are the first estimate for the quarter, various assumptions had to be made about the month of September. One, officials said, was that inventory buildup in September was about the same as in August. And another was that the trade deficit was about $9.9 billion in September, higher than July's $9.3 billion but well below August's $11.3 billion.
Today's report also showed that G.N.P. expressed in current dollars, rather than adjusting output for inflation, climbed at a rate of 5.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with a 7.1 percent increase in the spring.

HEADLINE: Aquino Reaffirms Her Pledge to Not Run for a Second Term

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Oct. 26

 BODY:
With her approval rating slipping in the opinion polls and criticism of her administration rising, President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines is saying more unequivocally than ever that she will keep her pledge not to run again in 1992.
In an interview today, on the eve of her second state visit to the United States, she dismissed the pressure here on her to run and said she had done her duty in helping to restore democracy to the Philippines. After 1992, she said, she intended to write her memoirs and work with the poor. 
Asked whether she wanted to leave herself any opening for a change of mind, she said: ''If you ask me about an opening, well, in this world, of course, we cannot be 100 percent sure. But I guess I would say 99.9 percent, I am sure.''
Mrs. Aquino continues to be dogged by charges that she is indecisive and reactive and has allowed Government policy to drift and corruption to go unpunished. In the last eight months, according to an opinion poll published last week by Ateneo University, Mrs. Aquino's approval rating has slipped from 64 percent to 57 percent.
Mrs. Aquino said that criticism was endemic in a flourishing democracy, and that many other leaders would envy approval ratings of nearly 60 percent. ''I always knew this job was a difficult one,'' she said, but added: ''I did not know it would become more and more difficult.''
After Benigno S. Aquino, her husband and the country's leading opposition figure, was assassinated at the Manila airport upon his return from exile in 1983, Mrs. Aquino became the focus for the country's resentment of the 20-year rule of Ferdinand E. Marcos. Mrs. Aquino took power in February 1986 in a military-led civilian revolt after presidential elections generally seen as having been stolen from Mrs. Aquino. Mr. Marcos went into exile in Hawaii, where he died last month.
She has overseen the writing of a new constitution and free elections at every level of Filipino life, she said. She had restored the economy to moderate growth, attracted new investment and had gained the upper hand in the war against the indigenous Communist insurgency, she said.
Mrs. Aquino leaves on Nov. 4 for Canada and the United States on a visit largely devoted to the search for new foreign investment.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Plans to Destroy His A-Armed Subs in Baltic

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, Oct. 26

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced plans today to destroy four Soviet nuclear-missile submarines based in the Baltic Sea, as a step toward ridding the region of nuclear weapons.
The Soviet leader also said Moscow had withdrawn all of its short-range nuclear missiles to sites beyond range of northern Europe.
Mr. Gorbachev's announcements, in a speech to Finnish leaders tonight, was the latest in a series of concessions aimed at building good will in the region and increasing pressure for wider disarmament in Europe.
Western military specialists said the moves were significant political gestures but would not have a major effect on the military balance in the region. 
 
European Summit Urged
Mr. Gorbachev also called for a summit meeting of the leaders of Europe, the United States and Canada here in 1992, to take a fresh look at the future of Europe.
The Soviet leader has been using his three-day visit here to expand a northern disarmament campaign that he began two years ago with a speech in Murmansk, and to focus attention on neutral Finland as a model neighbor at a time when tumultuous change is shaking Communist Eastern Europe.
Underscoring his pledge that Moscow will not intervene in Eastern Europe, Mr. Gorbachev signed a joint declaration of principles today with President Mauno Koivisto of Finland, advocating ''absolute respect'' for the internal affairs of other countries.
The document endorses ''absolute respect for the principle of the freedom of social and political choice, de-ideologization and humanization of the relations between states, adherence to international law in foreign policy activities, and giving priority to human interests and values.''
''The use of force of any kind cannot be justified: neither by a military alliance against another alliance, nor within these alliances, nor against neutral countries from any quarter,'' the Soviet and Finnish leaders agreed.
 
Subs Will Not Be Replaced
Mr. Gorbachev told the audience tonight at the sleek Finlandia Concert Hall here that Moscow would retire its last four Golf-class nuclear missile submarines in the Baltic Sea by the end of 1990, destroying them along with their payloads and not replacing them with newer models.
They are the last of six submarines deployed in the region in 1976, and are the only vessels in the Baltic armed with nuclear ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union announced last spring that the two others were being withdrawn from operation.
Norman Polmar, a leading American naval analyst, said the submarines were nearly 30 years old and thus approaching the end of their useful life. The removal of their nuclear missiles - three per ship, with an estimated range of 900 nautical miles - still leaves many other submarines in the Baltic Sea able to carry nuclear cruise missiles and nuclear torpedos, he said.
''I look at this as a political gesture to the Baltic states - to West Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and certainly it would also be a gesture to Poland and East Germany,'' Mr. Polmar said.
 
Nuclear-Free Baltic Urged
Mr. Gorbachev said Moscow ''is prepared to come to agreement with all the nuclear powers and the Baltic States on effective guarantees for the nuclear-free status of the Baltic Sea.''
The Soviet leader said Moscow had made ''unilateral steps'' to pull back its land-based nuclear missiles from Northern Europe. The Soviet Union is eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles as part of an agreement with the United States, but his report tonight indicated that Moscow had also moved back short-range tactical weapons not covered by that treaty.
''As of now, we have no medium or shorter-range missiles on operational status in areas adjacent to the north of Europe,'' he said. ''Soviet tactical nuclear systems are now deployed in areas from which they cannot reach northern Europe from any given site in Soviet territory.''
Officials in the Finnish Foreign Ministry praised this as a sign of Moscow's commitment to reduce tensions in the region, although tactical nuclear weapons, being quite portable, could be quickly returned in a time of crisis.
 
Finland's Neutrality Backed
In his speech tonight, Mr. Gorbachev said Moscow ''unreservedly recognizes Finland's neutral status and shall continue to do so in the future.''
Soviet leaders have previously equivocated on Finland's neutrality, suggesting that Finland owes special deference to its giant eastern neighbor, so Mr. Gorbachev's statement was an important point of pride for Finns.
The two nations also signed an array of agreements promising cooperation on environmental protection, in economic development of the Kola Peninsula and in resolving trade difficulties.
While Mr. Gorbachev was pressing his case for nuclear disarmament, United States officials said today that new intelligence reports showed that the Soviet military had begun a long-expected upgrading of its anti-missile defense system around Moscow.
The ring of anti-missile defenses is permitted under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and the Pentagon had recently predicted that improvements in the system might begin this year.
American officials said the more advanced system included two layers of nuclear-tipped missiles to stop attacking missiles either inside or outside the earth's atmosphere.

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Is Divided Over Move to Halt Global Warming

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is facing increasing pressure from other nations, Congress and environmental groups to take more aggressive action on the problem of global warming. But members of the Administration are divided on what course to follow.
On one side is the Environmental Protection Agency, which favors bolder steps by the United States, including stabilizing the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to a rise in temperatures worldwide, said people familiar with the Administration discussions. Several European countries have already set such goals, and others are considering similar action. 
Other top Administration officials, among them the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and the President's science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, acknowledge that global warming is a threat. But they have resisted setting specific goals on carbon dioxide emissions before there is more conclusive scientific evidence on the problem.
At the same time, the State Department official responsible for coordinating Government policy on global warming, William Nitze, said this week that because of growing international pressure, the United States would probably have to accept a goal of stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions.
 
Expense of Reducing Emissions
The carbon dioxide emissions are produced by burning fuels like coal and oil, the nation's major sources of energy, and are believed to be warming the earth by trapping heat in the atmosphere in a process like that in a greenhouse. Reducing those emissions would be costly to the nation's businesses, which are lobbying against quick action. The United States contributes about a fifth of the world's annual carbon dioxide emissions, according to Government statistics.
The division in the Administration on global warming has become more apparent in recent days as officials discussed what position to take at an international conference that begins late next week in the Netherlands. The conference is expected to endorse at least stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions.
William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, proposed that the United States support the stabilization measure at the Netherlands conference but was rebuffed at a meeting last Friday of a working group of the White House Domestic Policy Council, several people familiar with the meeting said.
White House officials favor a worldwide agreement that would initially acknowledge the problem of global warming and later work out specific steps to deal with it. Such a process is similar to the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol that produced an agreement to phase out use of the chemicals that deplete the earth's ozone layer.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations-sponsored group, is currently working on ways to deal with possible global warming and is expected to produce a report next year that could lead to negotiations. Members of Congress and environmentalists assert that the process will take at least five years to complete.
 
Criticism of White House Stance
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, today reiterated the President's support for that process and defended the Administration against criticism that it is moving too slowly.
''I think there are very legitimate concerns about what these policies mean for long-term economic impact and, well, economic impact in the macro sense,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''And those issues need to be considered and are being considered. But that does not diminish our overall commitment to deal with the global warming problem. There are economic aspects of this that cannot be ignored just blindly in the search for global warming solutions.''
The White House position was criticized today by 11 environmental and energy groups. ''President Bush said during the campaign that he would use the 'White House effect' to combat the greenhouse effect,'' the groups said in a statement. ''But a year later, the White House team hasn't even come out of the dugout.''
The environmentalists are concerned that the Administration has not moved quickly enough to fulfill a commitment it made in July with six other industrial nations at the Paris Economic Summit to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases.
On Capitol Hill, the President's policies on global warming are being challenged by both Democrats and Republicans. Members in both houses have proposed legislation that would force reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.
 
'Dragging Its Feet'
On the Senate floor Tuesday night, Senator Tim Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, accused the Administration of ''dragging its feet'' on the issue, which he says is the most urgent facing the nation and world.
''We're getting the wool pulled over our heads by a group that has its head in the sand,'' Mr. Wirth said.
In a letter to Mr. Bush this week, Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and four other Republican Senators, urged the President to use the Netherlands meeting to ''put the United States in a position of world leadership.''
''We are concerned that, unless you provide personal leadership on this issue, the United States will continue to send mixed signals to the world community,'' the senators wrote.
They proposed aggressive action calling for the signing of an agreement on global warming no later than March 1991 and a commitment to freeze carbon dioxide emissions in the United States at 1988 or 1989 levels.
Mr. Nitze, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, told a conference on global warming Tuesday that resisting a commitment to stabilize the emissions may prove difficult.
''The pressure for some sort of stabilization effort is going to be very strong and very hard to resist,'' Mr. Nitze said. He said his comments reflected his personal views and not a change in the Administration position. But environmentalists said the statement is the first in which an Administration official has publicly suggested that the United States may have to change its stated position.
In an interview, Mr. Nitze said his view on the subject had changed since he attended a meeting in Geneva earlier this month on climate change. More than a third of the 43 countries at the meeting expressed support for an agreement that included at least an initial goal of stabilizing emissions.

HEADLINE: Medicare and Social Security Aren't Welfare;
Benefits Will Increase

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Phillip Longman declared in his book, ''Born to Pay,'' that the ''moral'' flaw of Social Security is that it frees parents from the need to take care of their children in order to earn their support later in life. That seems unfounded and extreme, to say the least. In his Oct. 10 Op-Ed article, he repeats that Social Security unduly favors the elderly over the young, to their detriment, because the beneficiaries paid so little for their benefits, and that future retirees, those now at work, will get a poorer return. 
It is Mr. Longman's vision that is morally flawed. In his book, the family seems not to exist. But it does, especially for children. When current earners were children, their working parents' Social Security earned them life insurance coverage of enormous value - greater, in total, than that of private life insurance. It earned them income protection in the event of a working parent's disablement. Social Security gave - and gives - that protection to almost all children, except for the small percentage with neither parent working in a covered job. And it pays benefits to about 3 1/2 million children or those who became disabled as children.
Moreover, the children of today's retirees participated in the good deal their parents got: low Federal Insurance Contribution Act rates meant more take-home pay; comparatively substantial benefits for today's retired mean less financial load on today's employed.
Mr. Longman decries the ''windfall'' that early participants in Social Security and Medicare got. But that is a characteristic of any new program that produces decent benefits. Most defined benefit private pension plans did the same. More important, each generation derives financial benefit from the efforts of its predecessors -their parents' generation - who helped build the society and the economy and, indeed, suffered privation in World War II to protect it.
Future retirees will obtain Social Security benefits that replace the same portion of former income as current beneficiaries do. But, and it's a big but, future incomes should be more substantial than those earned by those now retired. Hence, the Social Security benefits of future retirees will be greater.

HEADLINE: What the New West Germans Can Expect

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Flight to West Germany, despite its appeal to many East Germans (front page, Oct. 4), may not be quite what they expected. Der Spiegel, the West German newsweekly, reported Sept. 18, even before the most recent wave coming through Czechoslovakia, intense controversy about the influx of East Germans.
With housing in shorter supply than since the early post-World War II period, and with nearly two million unemployed, not all West Germans share what one official has called the ''policy of open arms.'' Der Spiegel reported a poll finding that 46 percent of West Germans opposed a further influx of East Germans. Meanwhile, the conservative government is considering a bill to restrict their freedom of entry. 
Coverage of their reception in the West has focused almost exclusively on West German employers' enthusiastic offers of work. Some employers, Der Spiegel notes, have restricted job openings exclusively to East German refugees. The reason is obvious: like most immigrants, they must often work harder and accept greater sacrifice to make it in their new home. However, that is not always enough; social workers in Frankfurt and Hamburg estimate that 40 percent of those without a permanent address are immigrants from East Germany. The charity organization Caritas in Wurttemberg reports that one-third of all beggars are East German emigres.
Most American reporting of the emigration wave portrays the economic problems these people are fleeing, particularly substandard housing, as failings unique to Communism. But the poor in America experience the same problem. And while the poor may work, they do so at wages too meager to lift them out of poverty. The lack of affordable housing in both the United States and West Germany has been attributable to the same abandonment of public housing construction in favor of greater reliance on the market.
The desire of East Germans to share in the abundance and political freedoms in West Germany is understandable. But will they have jobs and a place to live?

HEADLINE: Exxon Will Move Its Headquarters To Texas

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation said yesterday that it would move its corporate headquarters and 300 employees from the Exxon Building in Manhattan to a 132-acre office park near Dallas.
Exxon's chairman, Lawrence G. Rawl, said the company had concluded that ''the Dallas area offered the best combination of factors from the standpoint of our employees' personal and professional lives and from an overall business standpoint.''
The company, which had already reduced its work force in New York to 300, from 2,100, would not say how much money it would save by leaving town. 
The company's move did not surprise real-estate analysts who said there was no longer a compelling reason for Exxon to have a headquarters with a New York address.
 
Corporate Exodus Continues
''If you have a good fax machine and a decent airport, it doesn't matter where you are,'' said L. Clinton Hoch, the president of the Metropolitan Consulting Group, a relocation and real-estate affiliate of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
Exxon's departure next fall will make it the latest company to join the continuing corporate exodus from Manhattan. J. C. Penney & Company, once a neighbor of Exxon's among the steel-and-glass towers and bubbling fountains on the Avenue of the Americas, closed its headquarters and sent 4,000 employees to the Dallas area in 1987, saying the move would save $60 million a year in rent.
Exxon has been the last of the large oil companies with corporate headquarters in Manhattan, far from the oil wells that produce its wealth. But now it, too, is going the way of other large petroleum producers that have called in the movers.
The Mobil Corporation moved to Fairfax, Va., in 1987. Texaco, which once had offices in the Chrysler Building, relocated to White Plains in 1977. Among the other major energy companies based in Texas - mainly in Houston - are the Shell Oil Company, an affiliate of the Royal Dutch-Shell group of companies in the Netherlands; Tenneco Inc., and the Coastal Corporation, a pipeline company.
 
'An Individual Relocation'
At City Hall yesterday there were few damp eyes. Officials said Exxon had not called to discuss leaving town before it made the announcement, and Stanley Grayson, the deputy mayor for finance and economic development, contended that the departure was not a sign of economic trouble ahead, either for the office-rental market or the city's overall economy.
''This is an individual relocation,'' he said. ''It's part of an industry which I think is generally perceived as a southwest, Texas-based industry. It's part of an industry that's half the size it was 10 years ago. Its outlook is not necessarily bright and it's not perceived as a tremendous growth industry right now.''
Real-estate experts say that Exxon - with only six floors in its Rockefeller Center building, down from 23 in the 1970's - had become a relatively small player in a soft market.
Mr. Rawl said the company would lease temporary office space in Dallas before moving into permanent offices that will be built in Irving, close to the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.

HEADLINE: Daily Flights to Be Offered at Stewart Airport

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y., Oct. 26

 BODY:
In a deal that State Economic Development Commissioner Vincent Tese said was worked out with ''smoke and mirrors and no money,'' American Airlines reversed its position and announced today it would begin daily passenger service from Stewart International Airport to connecting hubs at Chicago and Raleigh/Durham, N.C.
The service is to begin April 17 and will be the first regular civilian passenger flights from the former Stewart Air Force Base, which is just west of Newburgh and about 60 miles north of New York City.
On Aug. 12, American said it could not spare any of its 482 planes for service at Stewart because it was trying to accelerate its plans to create a new major operations hub in Miami. James Brown, a spokesman for American, said then that American did not rule out service at Stewart eventually, but that it would come ''at no time soon.'' Today, Mr. Brown said American's situation had changed.
Mr. Tese said the state expects American to remain at Stewart for at least two years to determine whether there is a sufficient market for it in the Hudson Valley. The agreement followed a long effort to use the large former military base, which closed two decades ago and now houses the Air National Guard and several air freight and other companies. 
 
Ease Congestion at Other Airports
The state, which owns the airport, hopes that it will both serve the Hudson Valley and help relieve congestion at the three major New York City area airports. Hudson Valley residents now travel two hours or longer to the New York area airports.
In a sun-drenched ceremony near the main runway, Melvin E. Olsen, American's vice president for capacity planning, told Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and hundreds of other invited guests that the airline would make six round trips a day out of Stewart - three each to its hubs at Chicago and Raleigh/Durham.
The negotiations to bring American to Stewart were complex. Mr. Tese, who has been trying to induce the airline to start service at Stewart for months, said that originally, American wanted to be indemnified by the state for up to $6 million in annual losses. Mr. Tese said the state rejected the proposal and then, with the cooperation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, offered to sweeten the deal by arranging for American to get six extra gates at Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Airports.
Mr. Tese said it was not clear whether any airlines would be asked to give up their gates at the three airports. He said that with the exception of one concession, the deal to bring air service into Stewart would not cost New York State anything. The one concession, he said, is that American will not have to pay state sales tax on any materials it buys in the state for an addition to the passenger terminal at Stewart.
 
Lawsuit Filed
But not all of Stewart's problems are behind it. The airport, which has been run by the State Department of Transportation since 1986, has become the subject of a lawsuit brought by several groups of environmentalists led by the Stewart Park and Reserve Coalition, a local organization. The coalition is being aided by the Sierra Club, the Hudson River Fishermen's Association, Scenic Hudson and Orange Environment.
The environmentalists say they are not opposed to all development at the airport, but charge that the state has been violating the State Environmental Quality Review Act by permitting piecemeal development and failing to assess the impact of what it is doing. The lawsuit, filed last July, is pending in State Supreme Court in Albany.
Recently, environmentalists were angered when they heard that an airport employee shot and killed a bald eagle. The employee reportedly mistook the bird for a turkey vulture and shot it because he thought it would interfere with aviation. State and Federal authorities are investigating the incident.

HEADLINE: Rivals in Nassau Offer Differing Visions of County

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Oct. 25

 BODY:
As Richard Korn travels through Nassau County, campaigning for its highest office, he says he sees a place where people who came to pursue the American dream are being driven out by rising taxes.
Thomas S. Gulotta, the incumbent County Executive who is running for re-election, has a different vision. He sees an area envied by the rest of the country, where the good life is still obtainable.
Mr. Korn is a Democratic businessman who has never held public office. Mr. Gulotta is a longtime Republican politician who won his last election in a landslide. As they approach Election Day, their perceptions of the county have become an important part of the campaign. 
Mr. Korn, who gained attention when he sued Nassau County in 1987, forcing Mr. Gulotta to rewrite his $1.5 billion budget, is seeking to draw on residents' frustration over the increasingly high cost of living on Long Island. He points to what happened last spring, when voters balked at increases in school taxes and rejected more than one-third of the Island's proposed school budgets on the first ballot.
 
Middle-Class Issues
''Everyone is fed up with high taxes, with being misused and abused by Gulotta,'' Mr. Korn said in an interview during a recent campaign swing, as he smiled, gulped down coffee and shook hands with people coming in and out of a supermarket in Merrick.
''I'm addressing the issues that affect the middle class,'' he said. ''The response has been extremely gratifying.''
But Mr. Gulotta, who has promised a $10 million cut in county taxes for next year, says that Long Island remains one of the country's most desirable places and that its residents are hanging on to their dreams.
''The economy in Nassau County is extremely strong, one of the strongest economies in his nation,'' he said in an interview in his office, filled with expensive-looking furniture that his aides said he bought with his own money. ''Property values have come down a little recently, but compared to five years ago, they've dramatically increased.''
 
'Stronger Than Ever'
Mr. Gulotta said, however, that the county faced some tough issues - including taxes, the environment and illegal drugs and crime - that he was prepared to deal with in the next term.
''One of our biggest assets is that people have not lost their dream for the future,'' he said. ''The spark and the ability to dream of a better life is still there. If anything, it's stronger than ever.''
From the moment Mr. Korn announced his candidacy last spring, he knew the race would be difficult. Mr. Gulotta is an established figure in county politics, the son of a local District Attorney who later became a State Supreme Court judge. Formerly a state Assemblyman, he has come up through the Republican ranks as Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato did, serving as Hempstead Presiding Supervisor before becoming County Executive.
Registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats 3 to 2 in Nassau, which has not had a Democratic County Executive in 20 years.
 
'Tough Race, Tough County'
Mr. Korn, who runs his campaign out of a cramped office next to a bakery in the small community of Williston Park, has been hampered by worries about money and by difficulties in getting recognition. He said he has spent $114,000 on his campaign, all but $17,000 his own. Mr. Gulotta said he has spent $510,144.
The business community, hurting from a downturn in Long Island's economy, has not lost its initial scepticism about Mr. Korn. But Democratic leaders remain hopeful. ''It's a tough race in a tough county,'' said John Marino, chairman of the New York State Democratic committee. ''But I don't regard it as a race that can't be won.''
Republicans say Mr. Gulotta is a formidable opponent in a race that plays to his strengths. And incumbency is always an advantage.
Referring to radio announcements in which Hempstead's Presiding Supervisor, Joseph N. Mondello, and Mr. Gulotta are heard promoting tourism, Hemspstead's Democratic leader, Edward A. Grause said, ''You hear Mondello hawking road maps on the radio, and then Gulotta comes along and hawks other road maps.''
 
Never Lost Election
Aides say the County Executive, known for his grueling schedule, is a hands-on leader who runs a 20,000-employee county government carefully and efficiently. He is cool and measured, and as he makes stop after stop at civic meetings and awards ceremonies on a typical night, seems to draw strength from being recognized and greeted.
Mr. Gulotta, 45 years old, was born on Long Island and educated at Trinity College in Hartford and at Columbia University Law School. He lives in North Merrick with his wife, Betsy, three children and a variety of pets, including a large white cockatiel. Mr. Gulotta has held public office since 1969 and has never lost an election.
Mr. Korn, 39, an owner of a video-editing business, was born in the town of Ellenville, in Ulster County, N.Y. He graduated from Adelphi University and received a law degree from Hofstra, settling in Long Island in 1968. He now lives in Glen Head and separated from his wife last winter. In 1976, Mr. Korn made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the State Senate.
A personable, excitable man, Mr. Korn has approached politics as an outsider from the beginning. His first contact with Mr. Gulotta, he says, was as a ''homeowner and a taxpayer'' - when he stood up at a Board of Supervisors meeting in 1987 and accused the executive of illegally concealing surplus money in the county's budget.
''He basically told me to sit down,'' Mr. Korn said. But he sued, and the matter went all the way to the State Court of Appeals, which ruled that Mr. Gulotta's budget was illegal and forced him to rewrite it.
Mr. Korn calls his effort a ''victory for all taxpayers.'' Mr. Gulotta says that the lawsuit was a waste of taxpayers' money, and that all it did was force a cosmetic accounting change.
Whether or not Mr. Korn wins, other Democrats say his candidacy has helped the party in Nassau County.
''We're really excited about seeing Nassau Democrats together,'' Mr. Marino said. ''They've had a history of killing each other within the party.''

HEADLINE: Profits on Autos Sales Off Sharply for Big 3

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The downturn in the United States automotive industry was clearly evident today as the Big Three auto makers posted third-quarter results that showed each had sharply lower profits from domestic car and truck sales.
Moreover, industry executives and analysts said, prospects for renewed profit growth should remain dim until at least next year.
The poor earnings from vehicle sales reflected steep discounting by the manufacturers in the third quarter to reduce inventories on dealer lots, as well as scattered production cuts at several assembly plants.
Without profits from diversified and overseas operations, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company would have posted only marginal profits or a loss for the period. As it was, G.M.'s earnings dropped nearly 40 percent and Ford's fell 44 percent. The Chrysler Corporation had a one-time gain from the sale of part of its stake in the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation and that caused third-quarter profit nearly to triple from last year's quarter. But without the gain the company barely made money. Chrysler is much less diversified than its domestic rivals. 
While the results were not a surprise, they indicated that auto executives are running out of ways to prop up sales.
''Volumes are lower and incentive costs are higher, and that's a deadly combination,'' said Harvey Heinbach, an industry analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company. Mr. Heinbach estimated that fourth-quarter production schedules of domestic auto makers would be down 16 percent from a year ago, meaning scattered shutdowns of assembly and component plants for a week or more. In the third quarter, the industry's production was down 13 percent from the period last year.
 
Fewer Vehicles Shipped
Executives said that a weakening economy may keep vehicle sales depressed for several more months. All three companies shipped fewer vehicles in the third quarter than they did a year earlier. Such shipments are the basic measure on which they record revenue and profit.
In addition to a softening economy and declining demand, earnings typically are weak in the third quarter because so many plants are closed for model changeovers.
G.M. reported net income for all operations of $517 million, which was off 39.8 percent from the $859 million earned in last year's third quarter. Earnings per share were 72 cents, compared with $1.23 a year earlier. Revenues rose slightly, to $28.8 billion, from $28.2 billion last year.
G.M's non-automotive subsidiaries also reported earnings yesterday. Its Electronic Data Systems Corporation had a 16 percent increase in profit, while its GM Hughes Electronics Corporation had a 17.7 percent decline.
G.M.'s stock fell 50 cents today, to $44.375 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
G.M. declined to say whether its United States automotive operations were profitable in the quarter, but it said all major operating groups were profitable for the first nine months of the year. Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman, said in a prepared statement that the company's North American operations were affected favorably by ''improved operating efficiencies.''
 
Ford Profit Declines 44.3%
Ford earned $477.1 million in the third quarter, or $1.03 a share, down 44.3 percent from the $856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, earned in the same quarter last year. Revenue slipped to $20.24 billion, from $20.38 billion a year earlier.
Referring to Ford's United States automotive business, which had a $37 million loss in the period and has been down 36 percent for the first nine months of the year, Donald E. Petersen, chairman, said in a prepared statement that the quarter's financial results ''show the challenges facing all auto makers in the domestic market, which is being affected by a slight downturn at the same time that competition is increasing and marketing costs are rising.''
Ford's financial services subsidiary, which includes the Ford Motor Credit Company and the First Nationwide banks and savings and loan institutions, earned $190 million in the quarter, about even with last year's $193 million.
David McCammon, Ford's treasurer, said the nation's No. 2 auto maker is expecting fourth-quarter profit to be off, but to a lesser degree than in the third quarter.
Ford's stock fell 37.5 cents today, to $47.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Stock Sale Lifts Chrysler
Chrysler's third-quarter net income was up 192.9 percent, to $331 million, or $1.42 a share, from $113 million, or 50 cents a share last year. Revenue was flat at $7.88 billion. However, the latest profit figure was affected by a one-time after-tax gain of $309 million, or $1.32 a share, from the previously announced sale of 75 million Mitsubishi shares. Without the gain, Chrysler's net fell nearly 81 percent.
''It's been a tough quarter,'' said Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, in a prepared statement. ''Our earnings have been squeezed by a softer retail market and by unprecedented sales incentive costs. We expect these extreme cost pressures to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.''
Chrysler's stock fell 37.5 cents, to $22.25 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange today.

HEADLINE: President's Gains Tax Maneuver

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
In an effort to regain momentum in its battle to cut capital gains taxes, the Bush Administration today announced extraordinary Government borrowing measures to insure that next month's Social Security checks would not be delayed by the political fight.
The Administration's decision means that the Government will have enough money to make the scheduled Social Security payments on Nov. 3, even if Congress has not approved legislation to extend the Government's borrowing authority.
The $2.87 trillion temporary debt ceiling will expire on Oct. 31, and Senate Republicans have been agonizing over whether to attach a proposal to cut capital gains taxes to legislation to extend the debt ceiling.
 
Few Remaining Opportunities
Republicans view the debt-ceiling bill as one of their few remaining opportunities to press for a cut in capital gains taxes this year. But they do not want to appear to be holding up Social Security payments or risking a Government shutdown while battling over the tax measure. 
In a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the Treasury would move up its regular borrowing schedule to raise $17 billion in the financial markets before Oct. 31. The department said it would announce procedures on Friday for the special auction.
Mr. Brady's letter said that although the Government's borrowing authority would revert to $2.8 trillion after Oct. 31, the special borrowing would raise enough money to make the Social Security payments and to keep the Government operating through Nov. 7.
''It's obvious that politics are driving their decisions,'' said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee. ''They are so determined to win the capital gains cut that they are resorting to extraordinary financing. This is unprecedented, and it will cost the Treasury an extra $20 million to do it.''
 
Treasury's Practice
A senior Treasury Department official confirmed that the financing procedure was unprecedented. As a matter of practice, the Treasury does not borrow up to its debt limit, but instead leaves a cushion.
Mr. Bentsen said that Mr. Brady had called him this afternoon to disclose the Treasury's plans and that he, in turn, immediately notified the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine. Mr. Mitchell, who has said that he would like to see a ''clean'' debt-limit bill with no amendments of any sort, had been planning to bring the debt legislation to the Senate floor on Monday or Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear how the Treasury announcement would affect the Republicans' strategy for attaching a proposal to cut capital gains taxes to the debt legislation. But it will almost certainly strengthen their position by removing the issue of Social Security benefits from the political calculations.
The Treasury's announcement also gives Republicans another week to decide how to proceed, but at the same time it intensifies the capital gains battle that is already under way as the Senate considers a bill providing economic aid to Poland and Hungary.
 
Mitchell's Accusation
Mr. Mitchell accused Republicans and the Bush Administration today of delaying aid to Poland and Hungary by seeking to attach a capitial gains tax cut proposal to the aid package.
''This unfortunate action could delay or could permit defeat of the aid to Poland and Hungary, which we thought was the President's priority,'' Mr. Mitchell told reporters. He added that it could be a week or more before the Senate returns to the assistance measure.
Republican leaders, who see their chances dimming for getting a capital gains tax cut approved this year, took a calculated political risk Wednesday night and offered their proposal as an amendment to the Eastern European assistance package. The practical effect of the maneuver is to create parliamentary gridlock for at least the next week, with the aid package and the capital gains tax cut in limbo while the Senate runs against the Oct. 31 deadline for raising the debt limit.
 
Dole's Defense
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, defended their effort to amend the aid package, insisting that if Republicans had not made their move, they would have been ''shut out completely'' from voting on a capital gains tax cut.
But the political consequences of the delay could be particularly severe for President Bush, who has already been criticized by Congressional Democrats and the press for appearing timid in his response to Eastern European needs.
At the White House today, Mr. Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said that while the White House had not planned the capital gains maneuver, it was aware of it and approved it. ''This was not our decision; it was the Senate leadership,'' he said. ''We do support it.'' Republicans admit that they do not have the 60 votes needed to overcome parliamentary obstacles that prevent them from attaching a capital gains tax cut amendment to other pieces of legislation with a simple majority of 51 votes.
 
Forcing Test Votes
As a result, they are prepared to force test votes on the amendment procedure to demonstrate that a majority of senators favor cutting the capital gains tax and that the will of the majority is being thwarted by the Senate Democratic leadership.
Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and the chief sponsor of the proposed capital gains tax cut, conceded today that even this point would be difficult to make. Mr. Packwood said 44 of the Senate's 45 Republicans and 12 of the 55 Democrats support the substance of his plan, but many of the Democrats would be unwilling to buck Mr. Mitchell on a procedural vote.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Changes Forced by Deficits

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE White House and Congress still pay lip service to the importance of getting rid of the budget deficit. But virtually nobody believes that the Government will come close to balancing its budget in the foreseeable future. This means that with the budget deficit subtracting from the already low national savings rate, the United States has been compelled to sell assets to foreigners to maintain its existing level of consumption and investment.
How long can this go on? Nobody knows, but a lot of non-economists instinctively feel it cannot go on indefinitely. In a speech to the United Nations Association in New York this week, H. Ross Perot, the Texas entrepreneur, held up a recent cover of Time magazine, showing George Washington with a tear rolling down his cheek, to mourn ''the death of Government.'' 
Mr. Perot said the United States was surrendering its world economic and political leadership role and, by refusing to discipline itself, piling unsustainable burdens of debt on its children.
There are still some economists who share this anxiety. At an international banking conference at Pace University in New York this week, Robert Triffin, professor emeritus of economics at Yale and a prime mover in the construction of the European Monetary System, observed that foreigners have been financing about 80 percent of the United States external and internal deficits, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. ''Such an absurd pattern of international financial policies cannot continue indefinitely,'' he said.
But a great many economists and policy makers, at home and abroad, argue that this circular pattern, with the United States running big trade deficits, foreigners recycling the dollars and buying up American assets, and Americans emitting i.o.u.'s, can go on for a long time and that there is no urgent need to get rid of the budget and trade deficits.
At the Pace conference, Sylvia Ostry, special adviser to Canada's Secretary of State for External Affairs, said the threat of a dollar crisis, which she called ''the best international argument to spur U.S. budget action,'' had become ''embarrassingly less credible in the face of reasonable exchange rate stability and, indeed, recent dollar strengthening.''
Politically here at home, there is little prospect of decisive action to get rid of the deficit by steeply increasing taxes or cutting expenditures. Gramm-Rudman is simply forcing more spending off budget, as with the bailout of savings and loans.
And President Bush holds to ''read my lips, no new taxes'' harder than ever; David Broder, the political columnist of The Washington Post, says that having lost ground with his party's right wing on the two crucial issues of anti-Communism and anti-abortion, Mr. Bush is less willing than ever to change his anti-tax position, vital to retaining the support of his political base.
Does all this mean that with the true fiscal deficit (counting tax expenditures and off-budget as well as on-budget spending) likely to persist and even widen, Americans and their political representatives will simply settle down to enjoy the trade deficit, the deficit in the balance of payments on current account, the continuing inflow of capital and the transfer of assets to foreigners?
Mrs. Ostry suggests they cannot and will not. ''In the absence of fiscal action, the stalled current-account adjustment process will once again create mounting popular demands to 'do something,' '' she said. What will that ''something'' be?
One thing it is likely to be is more Japan-bashing. The Japanese themselves are worried about that trend and have begun some America-bashing of their own. Their importation of former President Ronald Reagan for healing speeches appears designed to head off an American anti-Japanese attack.
Another American response, directed more broadly at not only Japan but also the newly industrialized countries in Asia and the uniting Europe, will be a tougher trade policy, already labeled, among other things, ''aggressive reciprocity,'' ''bilateral activism'' and ''unilateralism.'' But as the current trade talks in Geneva show, the United States is still holding the line against out-and-out protectionism and instead seeking to open markets for trade in services and agricultural products, where it has strength.
A third area where the United States may press harder is on the ''competitiveness'' front, which may mean more government-industry research, as in semiconductors or other high-technology fields, and less antitrust resistance to collaboration by private companies.
Further, the United States is likely to press its allies harder to take over military and foreign-aid and foreign-loan burdens that this country has been carrying since the postwar period, when its economic strength was dominant. But there is uncertainty and anxiety here about what the consequences would be of trying to transfer such responsibilities to Japan, West Germany and others.
Thus, the startling changes in the United States' economic and financial position, exacerbated by the failure of the country to discipline itself at home, is forcing a fundamental and potentially hazardous restructuring of America's external and domestic policies.

HEADLINE: U.S. Divided From Allies on Easing Export Bans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 26

 BODY:
As a meeting of high-level trade officials ended today, the United States remained divided from most of its allies over proposals to relax controls on shipping machine tools and other high-technology goods to Eastern Europe.
Nonetheless, American officials said Washington and its allies would continue studying whether and how to shorten the list of goods that Western companies are not permitted to sell to Eastern Europe.
''This is something that needs to be studied in light of developments there,'' said a United States official, who asked not to be identified. 
 
U.S. Seen as Isolated
European officials said that at the meeting of the 17-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom, the United States was largely isolated, with most of its allies wanting to move faster to relax export controls, especially with regard to Poland and Hungary.
European officials have accused the United States of clinging to cold-war attitudes on trade and not responding to the changes in Eastern Europe. Cocom, based in Paris, was formed more than 40 years ago, when the cold war had just begun. The 17-nation organization, consisting of NATO members, Japan and Australia, seeks to define and enforce limitations on what sophisticated goods can be shipped to Communist nations.
The advocates of relaxing export controls are led by West Germany, which has a strong machine tool industry and is eager to improve political and economic ties with Eastern Europe.
 
Strained Relations in NATO
Some European officials said the United States does not feel pressed to liberalize the rules because its machine tool industry is lagging and it has little to lose by keeping the rules strict.
Machine tools are essentially machines that make other machines. The more advanced tools are computer-operated, with a dozen or more cutting axes, or cutting directions, and are able to shape metal to an accuracy of 10 one-thousandths of an inch.
American officials have accused European companies of dodging Cocom's rules in order to get an inside track in developing trade relations with Western Europe. These differences have strained relations within NATO.
 
Charges Against Olivetti
The head of the American delegation, Reginald Bartholomew, Under Secretary of State for security affairs, traveled to Rome before the Paris meeting to voice charges that Olivetti S.p.A., the Italian office equipment company, had improperly sold goods to the Soviet Union.
American officials said Olivetti might be prohibited from selling certain products in the United States because of accusations that it had sold the Soviet Union machine tools that could be used to produce jet fighter engines.
This accusation followed a storm that erupted last year over the Toshiba Corporation's shipping sophisticated machine tools to the Soviet Union that were said to have helped it develop submarine propellers that could not be detected.
 
Bar to Development Cited
The greatest tensions at the meeting came over Europe's push to ease restrictions on machine tool exports. Some European officials said the restrictions cover many items that are not sensitive and hold back development in Poland and Hungary.
Some officials said the United States was outnumbered by 16 to 1 at the meeting. An American official denied this, however, saying, ''The fact that there are pulls and tugs at various times over precisely what should be done, and how, is normal in an organization like this.''
France has long backed the United States' view on export controls, but the French Government, eager to increase trade with Eastern Europe, has sided with West Germany.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
N.A.M., in Shift, Picks Economist as President

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
Jerry J. Jasinowski became president of the National Association of Manufacturers this week, setting a sort of precedent. Normally the association recruits an executive of a manufacturing company to be president. Mr. Jasinowski is the first economist named to the group's top job, and he has never even worked in the private sector, except for odd jobs while in college.
But times have changed in manufacturing. Service companies have gained in importance and the manufacturing association, in reaction, is drawing on economics to argue that manufacturing should be nurtured as the biggest source of wealth for the American economy. 
''We've got to raise the decibel level about the key role of manufacturing,'' said Mr. Jasinowski, who had been the association's chief economist for nine years. ''Without a strong manufacturing sector, there's no solving the trade or budget deficits - and manufacturing is the chief source of new technology.''
Mr. Jasinowski, who is 50 years old and 6 feet 3 inches tall, replaced Alexander Trowbridge, a former vice chairman of the Allied Company, who retired. But as chief economist and executive vice president, he had already become its most-quoted spokesman, sometimes criticizing the Federal Reserve (for high interest rates) and leveraged buyouts (they disrupt manufacturing).
Mr. Jasinowski's installation as president on Wednesday - an event that took place at the association's board of directors meeting in Indianapolis - was a sweet, emotional victory for him.
He grew up in LaPorte, Ind., not far away. His widowed mother, who still lives there, raised four children and to supplement her meager income from many jobs, she collected welfare for the family for 10 years. She was present for the installation, and her son introduced her during his acceptance speech, and thanked her.
Mr. Jasinowski was the first member of his family to graduate from high school, and he is still the only one with a college degree - from Indiana University in 1962. He had gone there for business courses, thinking this was the ticket to a big income later, but switched to economics ''because it offered a better framework'' for understanding the country. Economics has also paid off; his new salary is more than $200,000 a year.
Soon after college, Mr. Jasinowski joined the Air Force as an intelligence officer and remained in the service into the 1970's, serving for a while in Vietnam and later teaching economics at the Air Force Academy.
Research work on Federal subsidies brought Mr. Jasinowski to the attention of former Senator William Proxmire, and he became an economist on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. He played a role in drafting the Humphrey-Hawkins full employment bill and later headed a transition team for the incoming Carter Administration. His last job, before joining the manufacturers association in 1980, was as an Assistant Secretary of Commerce.

HEADLINE: Number of Untaxed Companies Is Said to Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Many large and profitable companies that once managed to pay little or no Federal income tax have been pushed back onto the tax rolls by the 1986 overhaul of the tax code, Citizens for Tax Justice said today, citing its own survey.
''Tax reform is working,'' declared Robert S. McIntyre, president of the labor-financed research group.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 cut both corporate and individual rates while broadening the tax base through the elimination or reduction of various preferences and incentives. It also imposed a minimum tax of 20 percent, one of the main factors in insuring that almost all companies pay some Federal income tax, the study said. 7 Paid No Tax Only 7 of the 250 profitable companies examined in the survey paid no income tax in 1988, the group said, in contrast to an average of 50 such companies annually in the 1981-85 period. The seven were Kroger, Pinnacle West, CSX, Illinois Power, Media General, Santa Fe Southern Pacific and Gulf States Utilities. All but Gulf States got refunds, which totaled $120 million. A corporation can have a profitable year and still get a net refund on its Federal taxes, giving it, in effect, a negative tax rate. There are various ways for a company to get a net refund including carrying forward credits or losses from prior years or using some special credits for investment that the 1986 changes did not eliminate. 
As additional evidence that corporate taxes are up, Citizens for Tax Justice said its survey put the average effective tax rate for all 250 companies last year at 26.5 percent, nearly double the 14.3 percent average during the 1981-85 period for a largely identical list of companies.
The maximum tax rate for corporations was cut by the new law to 34 percent from 46 percent.
''The reforms enacted in 1986 put many of the most notorious corporate tax avoiders back on the rolls and cut the number of no-tax companies dramatically,'' Mr. McIntyre said.
John Makin, a tax specialist for the American Enterprise Institute, a centrist policy group in Washington, said that while he supported the 1986 changes, he doubted whether their effect had been as great as Mr. McIntyre's study suggests. Mr. Makin said that much of the rise in corporate taxes reflected a jump in profits that was more a result of the business cycle than of changes in the tax law.
 
Some Doubts Expressed
Others questioned the study's linking the tax changes to what the coalition said was a marked shift in investment ''away from tax shelters and toward the types of business machinery and equipment that are most crucial'' to the nation's economic future.
An oil industry executive, whose company was among those included in the study, said, ''Corporate investment is based on many things, of which taxes is only a part.'' This executive, who declined to be identified, said that the investment effects of tax code changes made in 1986 would not be too evident yet because oil projects, for example, could take as long as eight years from planning to completion.
Nonetheless, there appeared to be little doubt that the 1986 law is causing corporate America to pay more income tax, mainly because of the imposition of a much tougher corporate minimum tax, repeal of the investment tax credit, a tightening of credits for foreign taxes paid and sharp restrictions in the use of the completed-contract method of accounting that had been of particularly great benefit to military contractors.

Treasury Prices Move Downward

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities edged lower in sluggish trading yesterday, despite another drop in stock prices, a larger-than-expected advance in economic activity in the third quarter and a stable dollar.
''There is a fair amount of activity in other markets, but not so much in ours,'' one Government bond trader said. ''But there is a terrific underlying bid to the bond market, and at some point we are going to explode out of here.''
Market participants were unmoved by a preliminary report from the Commerce Department that showed that the economy expanded at a 2.5 percent rate in the third quarter. Important components of the report, including a large buildup of inventories and a modest 2.9 percent rise in a key inflation measure, should have also cheered traders. 
 
Oil-Related Improvement
''Some of the improvement in inflation was oil-related, and as a consequence may have been a bit perverse, but they were better numbers than expected,'' said Bob Ried, president of Ried Thunberg & Company, an economic analysis and consulting firm in Westport, Conn.
Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert, said the buildup in inventories ''suggests that fourth-quarter production numbers will continue to be weak and there will be no need to add workers to manufacturing payrolls until the first quarter of 1990.'' She added, ''This factor alone will keep the Fed's bias on the easier side.''
Market participants said that a large overhang of corporate, agency and mortgage-backed securities had prevented prices of Treasury issues from moving markedly higher in the face of what otherwise would be favorable developments.
 
Bidders on Huge Issues
In recent weeks, market participants have been bidders on a number of huge issues, including the $4 billion offering earlier this month from the Tennessee Valley Authority and Wednesday's sale of $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds from the Resolution Funding Corporation. In addition, next week the Treasury will announce that it expects to raise an estimated $30 billion at its quarterly refunding auctions early next month.
''There has been a real need on the street to hedge against that stuff,'' one trader said. ''But that activity will end once the supply gets absorbed.''
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 102 25/32, down 1/ 32, to yield 7.88 percent.
Secondary Treasury note issues posted similar declines. In late trading, for example, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 27/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.87 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes sold at auction earlier this week were offered on a when-issued basis at 99 23/ 32, down 1/32, to yield 7.78 percent.
Meanwhile, short-term Treasury bill rates rose modestly. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.56 percent late yesterday, up six basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, to an offered rate of 7.45 percent. One-year bill rates also rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.25 percent.
 
Talk of Japanese Investor
An unnamed Japanese investor, who in recent days has made unusual public bids for up to $3 billion worth of the 8 1/8 percent bonds, was absent from the market yesterday, but talk among market participants about his activities continued, Much of that talk centered on the nature of the purchases and their size. One indication that the purchases have been large, and that the 8 1/8 percent bonds are in short supply, is the unusually low rate at which the bonds are being lent in the market for Government repurchase agreements.
Holders of these bonds were able to borrow money overnight at rates as low as 2 percent yesterday, market participants said. Yesterday, the overnight offered repurchase agreement rate on most Government securities was 8.70 percent.
In a repurchase agreement, holders of the security agree to simultaneously sell the security and repurchase it at a specified price at a specified time. The difference between the selling price and the repurchase price represents the interest rate on the transaction.
Mr. Ried estimated that the investor, who is rumored to have sold some securities early this week, has a net investment of about $1.5 billion in the 8 1/8 percent bonds.
''He has taken the issue and is holding it,'' Mr. Ried said. ''He could be betting that the November refunding will be delayed, or that the junk bond market will continue to be troubled and that Treasury issues will be the beneficiary.''
 
Thin Corporate Trading
In other developments, prices of secondary investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed in extremely thin trading yesterday, dealers said.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities said that prices of most issues dipped by about a quarter of a point.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Oct. 16.
The rise in the money numbers was larger than most analysts had anticipated. But economists said the bigger-than-expected gains were due in large part to the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, which sent money out of equities and into instruments like money market mutual funds, which are part of the weekly monetary aggregates.
The report had no effect on prices in the credit markets, and analysts said it was not likely to influence the Fed's handling of monetary policy.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Wheat Drops Amid Dismay Over Russian Grain Deal

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wheat futures prices fell below $4 a bushel for the first time in a month on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, reflecting disappointment that a newly expanded Soviet grain deal contains no incentives to increase wheat sales.
Wheat futures settled 1 3/4 cents to 7 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December at $3.98 1/2 a bushel, its lowest settlement price since Sept. 28.
Corn futures were 3/4 cent to 2 1/2 cents higher, with December at $2.44 3/4 a bushel, while soybeans were 1 1/2 cents lower to 3/4 cent higher, with November at $5.66 1/2 a bushel. 
The Agriculture Department announced late Wednesday that it had given the Soviet Union approval to buy an additional 4 million metric tons of grain in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, raising the ceiling to 16 million tons. But the expanded deal does not require the Soviets to fulfill a 4-million-ton wheat purchase requirement contained in the original program.
The original deal also requires the Soviets to buy at least 4 million tons of corn but they have already exceeded that amount. Soviet purchases of United States corn totaling 4 million tons were announced last week alone.
Meanwhile, the Russians have bought just 1.2 million tons of wheat since June 1, said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
Cocoa futures plunged to new 16-year lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange after news that Brazil, the world's second-largest producer, was suspending a 10 percent tax on cocoa exports. The move is likely to add more cocoa to an already overburdened market. Cocoa settled $24 to $38 lower, with December at $961 a ton.
Copper futures sank to new two-and-a-half-month lows on New York's Commodity Exchange as the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 39.55 points, contributing to fears of a recession-related drop in copper demand. Copper settled 0.25 cent to 1.6 cents lower, with December at $1.142 a pound.
Energy futures worked lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid a dearth of fresh market developments.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher, While the Pound Plunges

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained against most major currencies in New York trading yesterday, while the British pound plunged after Nigel Lawson, the country's top finance official, announced his resignation.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $372.50 an ounce, up $3.40 from Wednesday. 
Currency dealers sold the pound and bought dollars and West German marks after news of Mr. Lawson's decision to leave Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet.
Mr. Lawson, who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer since 1983, said he was resigning because of differences with the Prime Minister's economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, who himself resigned later in the day. Mrs. Thatcher announced that her Foreign Secretary, John Major, would take over at the Treasury.
 
Pound Sinks After Announcement
The pound, which had been quoted at $1.6130 when most trading ended in London, sank to $1.5995 on the few European markets still open after Mr. Lawson's sudden announcement. Later, in New York, the pound brought $1.5780, down sharply from $1.6143 on Wednesday.
Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, reportedly bought the pound to cushion its collapse, dealers said.
Even though the British Government quickly appointed a replacement for Mr. Lawson, the pound was expected to remain under pressure, with participants in the financial markets questioning the stability of Britain's economic policies. Mr. Lawson had recently stressed the importance of a firm pound as part of the Government's fight against inflation.
John McCarthy, chief dealer at the New York office of the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, said that apart from the impact of the pound selloff, the dollar did not do much during most of the session.
''We were having a rather quiet day'' until word came of Mr. Lawson's resignation, Mr. McCarthy said, noting that a report on United States economic growth elicited little response from traders.
 
G.N.P. Growth Rate Expected
The report that the economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter was consistent with expectations. The Commerce Department's reading on the gross national product, the broadest gauge of economic health, matched the second-quarter increase.
In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 142.12 yen, up from 141.57 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.8410 West German marks, up from 1.8350; 1.6115 Swiss francs, up from 1.6075; 6.2545 French francs, up from 6.2270; 1.17545 Canadian dollars, unchanged, and 1,351 Italian lire, up from 1,345.
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $5.194 an ounce from Wednesday's settlement of $5.114.

HEADLINE: ORTEGA DECLARES HE WILL ABANDON NICARAGUAN TRUCE

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Oct. 27

 BODY:
As leaders of the Western Hemisphere gathered for a meeting here, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua said today that he would end a 19-month-old cease-fire with the Nicaraguan rebels and order the Nicaraguan Army to resume military operations next week.
The Sandinista leader, who is under pressure to bring greater democracy to his country, said he was forced to make the decision because of what he called increasing attacks by the United States-backed rebels, who operate from bases along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border and in Nicaragua.
Mr. Ortega disclosed his plans in an interview here as 16 Presidents, including President Bush, began a two-day meeting to celebrate the centennial of Costa Rica's democracy and to discuss ways to promote peace in Latin America. He said he would announce the end of the cease-fire at a news conference on Saturday morning. 
 
Nov. 1 Offensive Planned
''I have made the decision that on the 31st of October we won't renew the cease-fire,'' President Ortega said. The President said Sandinista troops ''will go on the offensive'' on Wednesday against the rebels now in Nicaragua. He estimated their number at 2,500. But reports from north-central Nicaragua today indicated that Government troops had already begun what appeared to be a coordinated combat operation against the contras. Heavy fighting was reported. [Page 5.] ''We are facing a terrorist offensive from a counterrevolution endorsed by the UNO and financed by the United States,'' Mr. Ortega said, referring to the National Opposition Union, a coalition that is challenging the governing Sandinistas in elections set for Feb. 25. ''The contra attacks are endangering the electoral process,'' he said. ''We want to guarantee the electoral process by taking these measures.''
 
Arias and U.S. Surprised
The Sandinista leader emphasized that the halt to the truce was not a precursor to pulling out of the regional accords or canceling or postponing the elections.
The decision, which was announced in an interview with one European and two American reporters here, could be a major setback for the two-year-old Central American peace plan.
The host President, Oscar Arias Sanchez, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for drafting the regional peace plan, criticized Mr. Ortega's decision.
''Something like this would be lamentable,'' he said. ''The ball is in the political court, not in the military court.''
Officials with President Bush, who is attending the meeting here, appeared surprised by the report.
In a press conference late this evening, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said President Ortega had made no mention of his intention to suspend the cease-fire during a three-hour meeting of the presidents today.
''If he has made this decision, it is a bit less than honest to sit through three hours of meetings with other heads of state and not mention it,'' Mr. Baker said. ''If indeed he goes forward with this, it might be just as an excuse to deny his people a free and fair election.''
Mr. Baker said the United States would try to work with other leaders in the region to renew the cease-fire. He repeatedly said that the United States believed that Mr. Ortega was ending the cease-fire because the Sandinistas fear losing the February elections.
The Arias plan required the five Central American countries that signed it in August 1987 to cease hostilities and called for the demobilization of the Nicaraguan rebels and other insurgent groups in the region.
In response to the Arias plan, the two sides signed a cease-fire at Sapoa, Nicaragua, in March 1988. That agreement called for a halt to military operations while the two sides negotiated a permanent end to the war and put a regional peace plan into place.
The United States continues to give the rebel army non-weapons assistance.
The meeting here is supposed to discuss debt, deforestation, democracy, development, disarmament and drugs - the ''Six D's,'' as the topics are called by participants. But the meeting, the first in almost a quarter of a century, has been overshadowed by feuding between President Bush and President Ortega. The American delegation insisted that the meeting be largely ceremonial because it did not want to appear to be negotiating with President Ortega, diplomats here said.
Mr. Bush is to meet with Nicaraguan opposition leaders here on Saturday morning. He vetoed plans for a final communique because of fears that the statement would provide new legitimacy to the Sandinista Government.
In the interview in his hotel suite here, Mr. Ortega indicated that he planned to talk to President Bush. ''Obviously, when heads of state meet, it is customary that they greet one another,'' he said.
President Ortega accused President Bush, who this month announced that he would not lift economic sanctions against Nicaragua, of trying to wreck the Government's electoral campaign by destroying the economy and supporting the contras and the opposition coalition. He also critized the opposition coalition for failing to denounce the rebel attacks.
The decision to end the cease-fire seemed to be an attempt to focus attention on the contras. The rebels are viewed by many Latin leaders as an anachronism of a failed United States policy that has caused extraordinary suffering in the region.
Mr. Ortega is under considerable pressure from the leaders gathered here to continue opening the Nicaraguan political process. Several observers from the United Nations and other monitoring groups, among them Elliot L. Richardson, a former Attorney General under President Nixon, have said the preliminary preparations for the February elections seem fair.
 
Criticism From Arias
But Mr. Arias, who carries great political weight in the region, has criticized Nicaragua's electoral laws. In his opening speech to the summit meeting, he made several thinly veiled attacks on the Nicaraguan leader.
''We have often seen how those who led struggles against dictators themselves use the name of freedom to establish dictatorships of a different ideological view,'' Mr. Arias said.
President Ortega said he made the decision to abandon the cease-fire after the killing of two Sandinista organizers on Wednesday and the Oct. 21 attack on two trucks carrying Sandinista reservists on their way to register to vote. Nineteen soldiers were killed and six were wounded in the ambush.
''The army can no longer remain with its hands tied while contras operate with impunity,'' Mr. Ortega said.
President Ortega said the contras have repeatedly violated the cease-fire, saying they had killed 736 Nicaraguans and wounded 1,153. He also blamed the rebels for the kidnapping or disappearance of 1,481 others.
The rebels, most of whom remain in their Honduran camps receiving food and medical aid from the United States, have acknowledged sending patrols into Nicaragua.
''We are going to guarantee the elections,'' Mr. Ortega said. ''If we didn't take measures like this, the electoral process would be endangered.''

HEADLINE: In Beijing, the 'First Terror' Fades As the Crackdown Seems to Ease

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 27

 BODY:
He is still jittery, still afraid that every policeman can peer into his heart and see the fervor with which he supported the democracy movement, but the young university teacher has given up life as a fugitive. After spending months visiting friends and relatives in other cities, he sent his wife back to scout around and recently returned himself.
''The situation seems a little calmer now,'' said the teacher, who was closely associated with the democracy movement. ''Nobody from the police has come looking for me, and for now life is less frightening.''
For the teacher, and for many other participants in the democracy movement interviewed recently, the raw fear of imminent arrest or even execution has dissipated. They say the atmosphere of terror has subsided, replaced by a dull apprehension that the next few years will be painful ones, economically and politically, for the nation and for themselves. 
''The fear of immediate arrest, that first terror, is gone,'' said a Communist Party official who supported the democracy movement. ''We're afraid, but now the fears are different. People are concerned that their work is wasted. They're afraid of losing their jobs or of being transferred to the countryside.''
There are few arrests these days, and many of those who were detained shortly after the crackdown in June and July have been released - with instructions not to discuss their experience or talk to foreigners.
Today the authorities loosened rules against private enterprise, encouraging the unemployed to go into business or form collectives. [Page 3.]
But repression continues in spasms, and one Chinese intellectual was arrested just 10 days ago, according to a colleague who asked that the man's name not be published for fear of getting him in worse trouble. The arrested man had not been detained previously, although in June his passport was seized just two days before he was going to fly to the United States.
For the most part, however, participants in the democracy movement say they now believe that they probably do not face imprisonment. This belief is giving them new courage to emerge from hiding and to meet foreigners and tell their stories.
''Maybe I'll be kicked out of the Communist Party,'' a lawyer said last week after resuming contact with a foreign friend for the first time since the crackdown. ''But at least I'm pretty sure I won't spend the next two years in prison.''
 
Feeling Less Intimidation
The lawyer, who played a role in the democracy movement, fled the capital after the killings in Beijing in early June. He recently returned and has been forced to write self-criticisms, but so far his case is being handled only by his work unit's authorities, not by the police.
Indeed, he is so little intimidated that his self-criticisms have been mostly criticisms of the Government. The latest version that he submitted will probably make things worse, he acknowledged, but he is reluctant to repudiate his beliefs.
Another intellectual said this to his interrogators: ''I'm not going to recant my views this time. In the anti-rightist campaign and in the Cultural Revolution, I made self-criticisms even though I didn't mean what I said. But I'm not going to do that again. This time I'm going to say what I think. I'm through with lying.''
The renewed courage does not appear to have inspired organized resistance so far, and the sometimes violent resistance to martial law troops has diminished in recent months. Most people interviewed, however resentful, say it is best simply to wait out the storm and try to make money or perhaps find a way to go abroad.
They say that terror faded during the autumn as people realized that the crackdown was not as comprehensive as had been originally feared. Most estimates of the number of people arrested range from 10,000 to 20,000, many of whom have since been released. The majority of these appear to have been workers who were accused of taking part in violence, rather than intellectuals who helped organize the protests.
The intellectual bulwarks of the democracy movement experienced relatively few arrests. At the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, with a staff of more than 5,000, about five people were arrested. About a dozen journalists are known to have been arrested in all of China.
At Beijing University, estimates of the number arrested range from about a dozen to nearly 100, and other major academic institutions have had only a few arrests each. Among Beijing's artists, many of whom joined the unrest, no one is known to have been arrested.
In the last few days, the Government has prepared a new arrest warrant for seven people it terms ''criminal ringleaders of the counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' but the document does not signal any extension of the crackdown. On the contrary, it seems to reflect the Government's frustration that dissidents have been so successful in slipping through the authorities' dragnet.
The warrant, which was obtained in Beijing from a Chinese with connections in the Public Security Bureau, names people who have been wanted for some time.
The most prominent person on the list is Chai Ling, a 23-year-old psychology student whose tearful interviews earned her a measure of fame abroad. There had been rumors that Miss Chai had either been arrested or had fled abroad, but the warrant indicates that she has not been arrested and that the Chinese authorities believe that she is still in the country.
 
Tension Eases at the Top
Even high officials are breathing somewhat easier. When a senior official who was associated with the democracy movement was summoned to a top-level meeting shortly after the crackdown, he feared it was a ploy to arrest him quietly. His aides told his driver that if there were no other cars at the supposed site of the meeting, then he should immediately leave without stopping.
There were other cars, and it really was a meeting. The official found himself criticized and humiliated before his peers, but he was not arrested. These days, his influence is gone and life bears little joy, but he has been allowed to retain his title and most of his privileges.
Within the Communist Party bureaucracy, there have been a few people arrested - including Wu Jiaxiang, a theorist and essayist, who was seized on July 17, a friend of his confirmed this week - but now cadres say the fear is more of party disciplinary measures than of arrest.
''The situation is getting a little easier, and I don't think I'll get into trouble,'' said a party official who expressed sympathy for the student demands in May and consequently spent the summer searching for an escape route to the United States. ''I think I'll stick it out.''
In these circumstances, the mood is far from cheeful, and some believe that the punishments will come later, after investigations are complete. For many intellectuals who felt that they were involved in the grand enterprise of rebuilding China, it is little consolation that they are at liberty if their ideas are ignored.
''I think I'll be able to resolve my problems,'' said a social scientist who has been reproached for his conduct in the democracy movement. ''But who will dare publish my book?''

HEADLINE: THE CHOICES FOR GERMANS;
Unless Liberalization Takes Hold in East, Bonn Fears a Swelling Tide of Emigres

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Oct. 26

 BODY:
As change sweeps across Eastern Europe into East Germany, officials in West Germany are growing anxious about the possible consequences. Their preoccupation is not reunification, which might be possible if the transformation in the East succeeds, but a flood of emigres if the changes fail.
The concern that this would burden West Germany more than its allies also underlies Bonn's urgent pleas to the United States and its Western European neighbors to help formulate a common Western strategy and provide money and political support for advocates of change in Poland and Hungary.
If they fail, Bonn argues, change will never have a chance in East Germany, and rising discontent could prompt a million East Germans to leave for the West as more than 50,000 did in the last month. 
 
Allies Notified
Officials of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government say that since the new East German leader, Egon Krenz, took over from Erich Honecker last week, they have drawn the attention of the United States, Britain and France, the three Western occupying powers after World War II, to their worries.
''No one really knows what Krenz will do,'' Mr. Kohl's foreign policy adviser, Horst Teltschik, said in an interview. Mr. Krenz was better known as a Communist hard-liner than as a reformer, Mr. Teltschik said, ''but we have to give him a chance to surprise us.''
''The demonstrations are continuing, showing that there are still expectations that can't be satisfied,'' he said. ''There could always be a crisis, a violent demonstration with bloody repression. The Western allies have a responsibility if this happens, for Berlin and Germany as a whole.'' How Many Is a Strain? Some West German officials wonder whether the Americans, the British and the French have contingency plans for dealing with a march of angry East Berliners on the crossing points in the Berlin wall. ''We estimate that 150,000 East Germans will have arrived here this year alone,'' Mr. Teltschik said. The new arrivals, mostly young and skilled, are being absorbed into the West German economy and society without great disruption.
''But what happens if 500,000 come?'' he asked. ''The more things change in East Germany, the more political and economic reform there is, the less the likelihood that such a massive emigration will take place. There is only one solution for this problem: fundamental reform in the German Democratic Republic.''
Mr. Teltschik agreed with President Bush's statement, made in an interview this week with The New York Times, that he did not fear the idea of German reunification but thought it would take time. ''The fear is a united Germany that belongs neither to East nor West, which would lead to an international imbalance,'' he said.
''Americans are geographically farther away from the real problems, and so they say, 'Why not?' We believe it will take a long time, and that for the immediate future, the only realistic policy is thorough reform in the G.D.R.,'' Mr. Teltschik said.
Chancellor Kohl, who faces elections sometime next year and obviously would prefer to not to face the voters and an immigration crisis simultaneously, promised ''comprehensive and far-reaching'' support for political and economic change in East Germany in a speech to a group of German business leaders on Wednesday. ''Our goal,'' he said, ''is to improve living conditions in the G.D.R. so that its people will feel at home and wish to remain there.''
The same sort of goal underlay Bonn's ''Eastern policy'' - improving relations with all its Soviet bloc neighbors, which was first carved out in the early 1970's. The neighboring countries have sizable ethnic German minorities, and hundreds of thousands of these people have left for West Germany during the last year. What Sort of Reunification? Officially, West Germany welcomes them all as Germans. Unofficially, the Government fears ''reunification on West German soil,'' a fear shared by many in the Social Democratic opposition who see risks as well as benefits in the new East German leadership's promise to grant its citizens freedom to travel to the West.
Egon Bahr, a Social Democratic member of Parliament and one of the architects of the ''Eastern policy,'' said: ''There are estimates that between 1.2 and 1.4 million East Germans have made applications for exit visas in the past. If they all came, it would be very difficult. The G.D.R. has to create a situation in which people want to stay, but that will only happen if there's freedom of speech and the media, a prospect of raising the standard of living, and the freedom to travel as well.''
The Government and the opposition in Bonn agree that a joint Western strategy to deal with change in all of Eastern Europe is urgently needed, and that Western offers of aid to Poland and Hungary so far have been insufficient.
Mr. Kohl will go to Warsaw on Nov. 9 with a package of aid and Government investment-credit guarantees worth more than $1 billion. His Government will pledge about the same amount as President Bush promised, $200 million, toward a $1-billion currency stabilization credit that Poland wants to help bring its inflation under control, and it supports Poland's request for a moratorium of at least three years on payments on its $39 billion foreign debt, Mr. Teltschik said.
Polish officials and experts have been scurrying all over Western Europe in recent weeks lobbying for more government and private investment to help them succeed, but they also make it evident that they are not altogether sure how to do it.
Britain has promised $40 million each, over five years, to Poland and Hungary to help train the managers, investment bankers, economists and joint-venture experts it needs, and Mr. Teltschik suggested an international institute in Warsaw, with experts to tell the Poles ''not what to do, but how to do it.''
''All these bilateral measures have to be coordinated, or they will just dissipate,'' he said, ''and they should not be limited in scope. Besides Poland and Hungary today, the G.D.R. could join tomorrow, or Czechoslovakia, or Bulgaria. One country alone cannot satisfy all of Eastern Europe's needs, even if it wanted to.''
But he also conceded that Bonn has some items on its own agenda. Among the agreements Mr. Kohl will sign in Poland when he visits next month is an accord establishing the rights of the ethnic German minority there, Mr. Teltschik said, creating conditions that the West Germans hope might make it more attractive for such people to stay in Poland rather than come to West Germany and compete for jobs and scarce housing.

HEADLINE: DINKINS IS SEEKING TO WIDEN APPEAL

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
In an effort to assure voters that his administration will be broad-based, David N. Dinkins has told associates that he will appoint Victor L. Kovner, a longtime ally and a politically active Manhattan lawyer, as his corporation counsel if he is elected mayor of New York City.
Mr. Kovner, 52 years old, has served on mayoral and bar association screening panels for judges in recent years and is identified with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. He is also a member of the Metropolitan Council of the American Jewish Committee and of the board of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue.
Aides to Mr. Dinkins confirmed the offer, the first one Mr. Dinkins has made for his prospective administration, and said they believe it will send a signal to voters, particularly Jews, that Mr. Dinkins is a mainstream Democrat. 
 
Competitive in Fund Raising
Mr. Kovner, who earlier this year headed a committee that advised Mr. Dinkins on whether to run for mayor, has told friends that he would be eager to join a Dinkins administration.
As Mr. Dinkins moved to broaden his appeal to the city's voters, the latest campaign finance reports showed that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, has become competitive with Mr. Dinkins in fund raising and appears assured of maintaining a reasonably financed campaign in the final stretch, a change from the financial problems that have plagued him for months.
The Giuliani campaign treasurer, John H. Gross, credited the brighter financial picture to the candidate's jump in various polls and the fund-raising efforts of President Bush and members of his Administration.
In leaking the Kovner announcement, Mr. Dinkins's campaign aides acknowledged that they were risking accusations that they were being presumptive and even arrogant. Weighed against that was the need to assure voters that Mr. Dinkins will include a broad range of Democrats in his administration.
 
Transition Committee
''We thought it important to drop some names,'' said a Dinkins adviser. Earlier, Mr. Dinkins named as economic advisers Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier; James Robinson of American Express, and Joseph Flom, the lawyer who was chairman of Mayor Edward I. Koch's campaign finance committee.
Mr. Dinkins has also designated Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center and a onetime Koch deputy mayor, and Gordon Davis, a lawyer, a former City Parks Commissioner and longtime friend of Mr. Dinkins, to serve as an unofficial transition committee. But both men said yesterday that they were dealing with transition procedures rather than finding officials for a new administration. They also said they would not be interested in returning to government.
Mr. Kovner was an associate in Mr. Koch's law firm in the mid-1960's, but he and his wife, Sarah, have been identified in recent years with the liberal, anti-Koch wing of the Democratic Party.
Governmentally and politically, Mr. Kovner was recently appointed chairman of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct.
 
'One of the Biggest Law Firms'
Peter L. Zimroth, the present Corporation Counsel, said he had spoken with Mr. Kovner and added that he would be ''very pleased'' if Mr. Kovner took the post, which Mr. Zimroth called ''the best law job in America.''
He said ''The variety of things we do is unparalleled.'' He pointed out that the job includes supervision of a staff charged with a wide variety of legal matters. ''It is one of the biggest law firms in the country,'' Mr. Zimroth said.
Time is also critical in the transition. Mr. Dinkins - or Mr. Giuliani - will have less than two months to set up a new administration presiding over a $27 billion budget and 224,682 workers under its direct control.
With only 10 days until the election, the latest campaign financial reports showed Mr. Dinkins still ahead of Mr. Giuliani in donations and spending, including a stunning $1,160,000 in used or reserved television air time, more than Mr. Dinkins spent for the whole primary campaign.
Mr. Giuliani spent about $781,000 on commercials during the same 20-day period ending last Monday, and Roger Ailes, his media adviser, said he was comfortable with the advertising spending available for the final days of the campaign.
Mr. Dinkins reported contributions for the period from Oct. 3 to Oct. 23 of $1,376,479, while Mr. Giuliani reported contributions of $1,245,226. In the previous period, Mr. Dinkins raised $554,926, triple Mr. Giuliani's $180,000.
On the expenditure side, Mr. Dinkins spent $1,610,586 in the latest period while Mr. Giuliani's figure was $1,107,132. Mr. Dinkins claimed $257,143 in public matching funds and Mr. Giuliani, $205,826.
One measure of the frenetic fund-raising and spending was the estimate of Mr. Gross, the Giuliani campaign treasurer, that Mr. Giuliani had raised $450,000 in the last four days - after the latest reporting period ended.
Some of the money was raised yesterday at a breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria featuring Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Kemp then toured an apartment project on the Lower East Side that had been rehabilitated.
 
'Driving Around in the Car'
Mr. Giuliani criticized his opponent as a politician who ''hides from problems, from decisions.'' He said Mr. Dinkins ''wants moratoriums on decision-making so he can have fun being mayor.''
Later, asked to elaborate, he said: ''What I meant was something that I said before, which is that David seems to enjoy driving around in the car, with the sirens on, and he seems to have enjoyed, until we stopped him, traveling on jet planes and that sort of thing. He was the candidate usually out of New York rather than in New York. He doesn't seem to be as willing to face up to the problems of New York City.''
Mr. Dinkins later responded, ''That's rather sad.'' He added, ''We all ought to want to be mayor to provide the best life for the citizens of New York.''
Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Dinkins said he was ''committed to exploring ways to restore free tuition to the City University.''
''Let's be clear,'' he said from the steps of City Hall. ''Free tuition is not going to come tomorrow. It's not going to come in the near future.''
Rita Rodin, director of public information for the City University of New York, said it would cost the city about $60 million to restore free tuition.
The university, which now includes 21 institutions and has an enrollment of 194,000 students, had free tuition from its founding in 1847 until 1976, when that practice was ended because of the city's fiscal crisis. Tuition is now $1,225 annually for students at community colleges and $1,250 for students at senior colleges.

HEADLINE: San Salvador Journal;
Where Dollars Talk, Unfettered by Law or War

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR

 BODY:
Outside the main post office here, the noise and the bustle recall the stock market on a busy day. As customers come and go, on foot or in cars, with letters or checks in hand, they are immediately set upon by dealers waving wallets or pocket calculators, elbowing each other aside as they shout the latest exchange rates.
A decade of civil war has left the Salvadoran economy largely in a shambles. Some fields, planted with mines, lie fallow. Many factories are shuttered. But for those who make their living from the country's not-so-clandestine black market in dollars, these are boom times. 
''When I first started here 10 years ago, there were six of us,'' Edelmira Artiga de Romero, a money-changer, said as she sat in the shade in front of the post office, handing out currency from a $13,000 wad of dollars and Salvadoran colons to a subaltern serving a client in a nearby car. ''Now there are 300 just around here.''
 
Sending Money Home
What has put them in business are the dollars sent back here by the enormous number of Salvadorans who have gone to the United States since the start of the war. Studies conducted here and in the United States estimate that of the one million Salvadorans in the United States, more than 80 percent arrived in the last 10 years. There are also communities of Salvadorans in Canada, Australia and Western Europe.
Exactly how much money these Salvadorans abroad send to their 5.25 million compatriots at home is difficult to determine. A 1987 study conducted by the University of Central America here put the figure at more than $1 billion a year, but United States Embassy officials say that amount would swamp the economy and estimate that the flow does not exceed $400 million annually.
 
'I Hope They Don't Come Back'
Either figure, however, would be large enough to make remittances from abroad the largest single source of foreign exchange for the battered Salvadoran economy. Coffee, traditionally the country's largest export product, earned $369 million last year, while direct economic assistance from the United States came to $314 million.
''I hope they don't come back, at least not right now,'' a leading businessman said, referring to his compatriots abroad. ''These people are our No. 1 export source, and the economy needs the money they send back if it is to function.''
Segundo Montes, a sociologist who directed the university study, said his data indicated that more than one-third of all Salvadoran families have relatives in the United States and that each Salvadoran wage-earner abroad sends an average of $115 home monthly.
''The most profitable investment you can have is a relative in the United States,'' Dr. Montes said. ''With a recession in everything else, that's what is sustaining the life of the people.''
Indeed, the black market for dollars has become so important that it now appears to be the principal source of foreign exchange for those who wish to do business overseas or to travel. ''There is virtually no liquidity in the banking system itself,'' a diplomat here said, estimating that net foreign reserves have fallen to as low as $25 million this year.
 
'Psychological War'
In a recent speech on the economy, President Alfredo Cristiani said that when he took office on June 1, he found that ''65 percent of all imports were being financed in the non-bank market, the parallel market, if you prefer.''
But Mr. Cristiani has also taken a series of steps aimed at restoring public confidence in the official banking system so that it can be more competitive with the black market. ''There's a tremendous psychological war going on,'' an ''unofficial'' money dealer said.
The new Government's first step was to abandon efforts to sustain the colon at a value of 5 to the dollar. That official exchange rate has given way to a ''managed float'' of the colon at about 6.4 to the dollar, as compared to 6.5 to the dollar on the black market, thereby closing the gap between the two markets from 30 percent to less than 1 percent.
Economists and diplomats here say the Government is considering other measures, like broadening eligibility to open dollar accounts in local banks, which might discourage Salvadorans from depositing the dollars they acquire here in accounts in the United States. A plan to legalize and regulate money exchange houses is also said to be under study.
But while those who wish to sell dollars now get a better price with no questions asked, importers and prospective tourists complain it is still virtually impossible to buy dollars through the official system.
''Cristiani is trying to hoard dollars,'' said a money-changer who does business from a boutique here. ''The banks will buy them, but they don't like to sell them because the Government has a deficit it needs to make up.''
 
Private Postal Services
With the rise in the importance of remittances has also come what Ricardo Siman, president of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, calls ''a boom in courier services'' that compete for the lucrative traffic in checks and other money instruments between El Salvador and the United States.
Salvadorans routinely complain that checks and money orders that are sent through official channels but never reach their destination nevertheless end up being negotiated on the black market, and blame postal workers for the problem.
Late last month, postal officials threatened to shut down the parallel mail services and arrest their owners, saying ''the receipt, transport and delivery of correspondence is a function of the state.'' Postmaster General Rafael Uribe accused the couriers of defrauding users with false advertising and high tariffs.
''The people have remained loyal to our service,'' Mr. Uribe wrote to the newspaper recently. ''Thousands of letters containing checks are delivered daily and immediately exchanged by the hundreds of money- changers who swarm the blocks near our offices, thereby offering themselves as faithful testimony that the postal service is achieving its objectives.''

HEADLINE: COSTA RICA GAINS LOAN AGREEMENT

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
After years of negotiations, Costa Rica and its commercial bankers agreed yesterday on a proposal to reduce the country's foreign debt substantially and provide new incentives for bankers to take part.
The agreement was reached even though Costa Rica is behind in its interest payments by more than $300 million. Bankers are usually reluctant to negotiate with countries that are not meeting their interest payments. The proposal includes provisions aimed at assuring speedy repayment of this unpaid interest. 
Under the plan, Costa Rica will be able to reduce its $1.8 billion debt to American and foreign banks by more than $1 billion by buying back loans at a discount and paying lower interest on the remaining loans.
 
Significant Savings
Costa Rica's total debt, including loans from governments, international lending agencies and other sources, is about $4.5 billion. The country would save about $100 million a year, a significant amount.
President Oscar Arias announced the agreement as he welcomed President Bush in San Jose for a two-day meeting of Central American leaders. The agreement was negotiated under the Bush Administration's new debt strategy, which strongly emphasizes debt reduction.
Under the plan, the third reached under the new debt strategy, Costa Rica would buy back 60 percent of its $1.8 billion of debt at a discount of around 80 percent. Costa Rican loans are privately trading at 17 cents to 19 cents on the dollar. $288 Million in Aid The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and several donor countries, including the United States and Japan, will provide $288 million in assistance to pay for the repurchase of the debt and to make a down payment on the $300 million in unpaid interest that Costa Rica owes the banks.
If a bank sells back 60 percent or more of its debt, the remaining portion will receive preferred treatment. That portion would be rolled into a 25-year bond paying 6.25 percent, which will add to Costa Rica's debt reduction because this is below the current market rate of around 9.5 percent. But the bank will get a one-year, renewable guarantee on the payment of interest. Banks that sell back less than 60 percent of their debt will not receive this guarantee of interest.
To deal with the unpaid interest, the Costa Rican Government will use $60 million of the $288 million in foreign assistance to make an immediate interest payment. The remaining interest will be paid over 15 years at market rates. The interest on these bonds will have a three-year renewable guarantee. If no interest payments are missed in the three years, the guarantee will be extended for three years.

HEADLINE: WAR-POWERS CURB ON KREMLIN SEEN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
A top adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that the Soviet President could not order military intervention in another country unless he first consulted closely with the new Soviet Parliament.
The adviser, Yevgeny M. Primakov, said that in the future, unlike the past, ''there can be no decision of that sort without the involvement of the Supreme Soviet,'' the national legislature.
Thus, he said, ''there would be no situation that would result in what happened when our troops were sent into Afghanistan'' in 1979. ''There can be no repetition of the situation where a very small group of leaders take a decision that is not endorsed by the legislative authorities,'' he said. 
Mr. Primakov, who is visiting the United States at the invitation of Congressional leaders, said the Supreme Soviet was trying to clarify legislative and executive powers, including the power to use force and make war. Under the War Powers Act, he noted, the President of the United States can send troops to a war zone, but must withdraw them if Congress does not authorize their use.
 
'A More Democratic Spirit'
''We would act in a more democratic spirit,'' requiring the Soviet President to consult the legislature in advance, Mr. Primakov said. He reported that the Supreme Soviet was drafting legislation to establish such a requirement.
Mr. Primakov met Thursday with President Bush and gave him a letter from Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Primakov said the letter included a ''very positive'' assessment of Soviet-American relations.
Mr. Primakov, an economist, is chairman of the Council of the Union, the upper chamber of the Soviet Parliament. He is also a nonvoting member of the Politburo, a post to which he was appointed in Mr. Gorbachev's recent shake-up of the Kremlin leadership.
Speaking today at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Primakov presented himself as a champion of legislative authority. He said members of the Supreme Soviet delegation uttered ''a cry of indignation'' when Senator Bob Dole told them that he ranks lower than his wife in the American system of protocol. The Senate Republican leader's wife is Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
''The Supreme Soviet may tend to be a little overly chauvinistic in its relationship to the executive branch,'' Mr. Primakov said. ''Maybe that's an infant disease, but we have it.''
Mr. Primakov also made these points:
* Soviet politics have become more open and competitive because ''we wanted to show that we stand close to civilized behavior and that everything was being done on the basis of law.'' The Supreme Soviet no longer rubber-stamps legislation drafted by the Politburo, but writes laws on the basis of its own hearings and investigations.
* The Supreme Soviet has demonstrated its new vigor by rejecting some of the people nominated for positions in Soviet ministries.
* The Soviet Union sees ''no formidable obstacle'' to the eventual unification of Germany if the people of West and East Germany make that choice. But ''stability in Europe would not gain if one of those German states were to consume the other.''
* Despite an acute shortage of consumer goods, the Soviet Government will continue its program of economic restructuring. It will not go back to a system in which all major economic decisions are made by the Government, nor will it move immediately to a free-market system. Mr. Primakov said leaders of the Communist Party reserved the right to criticize or dismiss editors and journalists who were party members. The chief editor of Pravda was removed from his job last week, and the party ideology chief asked for the resignation of Vladislav A. Starkov, chief editor of the weekly tabloid Argumenty i Fakty.
Mr. Primakov said: ''I offered Starkov a job as editor of the press organ of the Supreme Soviet. That is, of course, a promotion.''

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN STOP: Harlem;
Dinkins Bid Rekindles Community Hope

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
Harlem has been both dream and nightmare.
At one time it was known as the capital of black America, a place that, despite its poverty, was still a glittering magnet for writers, artists and entertainers.
More recently, though, Harlem has seen crack and despair settle over it like the soot of an arson fire.
Through good times and bad, however, the Manhattan neighborhood has remained a center of black politics in New York City. It has produced a string of prominent black elected officials but never a mayor. 
Now one of its own, David N. Dinkins, could win City Hall in less than two weeks and Harlem is aglow with pride and anticipation.
Mr. Dinkins's red, blue, green and white campaign buttons are pinned to countless lapels and caps in Harlem. ''There's no question I feel proud,'' said Eric Matthews, a 31-year-old track worker for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ''He's one of us. It's going to go down in history.''
Mention the name of Mr. Dinkins's Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and many people in Harlem flash a look of disgust.
Ethnic solidarity no doubt plays a large role in the reaction. But party loyalty is important. Black people have voted overwhelmingly Democratic for 50 years.
Indeed, finding a Republican in Harlem is almost as hard as finding a street paved with gold. ''Giuliani don't care nothing about poor people,'' said Albert Crumes, 31, an unemployed construction worker. ''He's a Republican. We need somebody in office who is going to speak for us.''
 
Opposition Overwhelmed
Mr. Dinkins, Harlem residents, politicians, and community advocates said in recent interviews, is that voice.
They listened to Mr. Dinkins's message during the Democratic primary in September. He overwhelmed his opposition in the 70th Assembly District, which includes central Harlem, by polling 21,740 votes to 1,279 for his closest rival, Mayor Edward I. Koch.
The recent uproar over how he handled his personal finances appeared to be of little importance in Harlem, where the candidate spent much of his boyhood.
''That's not of any interest to me,'' said Gertie Green, 59, a retired nurse. ''Picking on that petty stuff is a way to keep away from talking about the issues.''
 
Overrun by Problems
''What we want,'' she added, stabbing the warm afternoon air with her cigarette, ''is somebody to clean up the streets. We have a lot of real problems. You name it and we got it.'' Dr. James L. Curtis, director of psychiatry at the Harlem Hospital Center, said a community famous for its shining cultural renaissance in the 1920's has been overrun in the 1980's by crack addiction, infant mortality and AIDS.
Central Harlem has one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the nation.
About 1,500 patients at the hospital and its various clinics are receiving methadone for their heroin habits, and heroin's impact on Harlem, a major problem 20 years ago, is benign compared to the devastation of crack, the doctor said.
''The insurgence of crack made its first stop in Harlem,'' David A. Paterson, the community's state senator, said. ''This was the epicenter of the epidemic.''
 
Years of Disappointment
Poverty, Dr. Curtis said, invaded Harlem long ago and it appears to be getting worse.
''Demoralization, depression and despair are widespread,'' he said. ''But I think there is a strong feeling of hopefulness inspired by Dinkins's candidacy, hope that he will provide a fresh and strong leadership.''
But any hope is tempered by years of disappointment, said Jerry Hendrix, 36, a lifelong resident of Harlem.
''There's a lot of tension and frustration,'' he said. ''We're tired of promises. As you can plainly see, some of our biggest problems are unemployment and housing.''
He swept his hand toward a knot of young able-bodied men talking on the corner of 125th Street and Lenox Avenue. It was late morning. The men had few places to go except the next corner. ''Since the presidency of Reagan, this country has really been bad,'' he said. ''Reagan sold this country out. Giuliani falls under the same umbrella.''
 
Streets of 'Entrepreneurs'
Asked about the controversy surrounding Mr. Dinkins's transfer of stock to his son, David Jr., Mr. Hendrix said it was a non-issue.
''It's all part of the muck the Republicans is trying to stir up,'' he said. ''This is how I look at it: All have sinned and fallen short of the glory.''
Nearby, two signs were taped to a lamp post, illustrating the war between despair and hope raging through the streets. ''Women Can Get AIDS Too,'' one warned. ''A Thanksgiving Weekend Gospel Extravaganza,'' the other, taped just above it, read.
An old man, his back bent, his rough hands filled with knit caps he hoped to sell, walked slowly down 125th Street, mumbling, ''A dollar, a dollar.''
Earl Holt, 47, said the old man was part of a growing army of ''entrepreneurs,'' who roam the streets selling whatever they can to survive. ''This is how he gets food,'' Mr. Holt said, pointing to the old man. ''He'll do the same thing tomorrow and the next day.''
Mr. Holt, who has been unemployed for five years, said he too is a solider in the army of hustlers. ''This is the pits,'' he said. ''Harlem U.S.A. You have to hustle to survive. Pekple are walking around here like zombies. That's why I'm for Dinkins. It's time for a change. Most of the people I see coming through here are depressed.''
''They've had a foot on their necks so long they don't know what to do,'' he said. ''If he gets into office he will make a change. People will brighten up. They will get more self-esteem.''
A few blocks away, Guy Wellington, 29, kept one eye on his wash in a laundry and the other on his son, Andrew, 3, who was playing on the sun-soaked sidewalk. Mr. Wellington, who spent nine years in the Navy, grew up in Harlem and returned only last year. He said a major issue is child care.
He said he worries about his son all the time. The streets of Harlem, he said, can swallow up a child's dreams in the blink of an eye.
 
Talk of Issues
''We got drugs on mostly every corner,'' Mr. Wellington said. ''If one crack house gets torn down, another grows next door.''
Mr. Wellington said he had not decided yet who he would support on Nov. 7. He said as the spring turned into summer, he had been impressed with Mr. Giuliani's reputation as a ''crime buster.''
''I'm leaning towards Dinkins now,'' he said. ''He seems more concerned about the issues. All Giuliani is worried about is talking about Dinkins. But both of them are pointing fingers at each other. That's not going to make it. It disgusts me that they're not talking about the issues more.''
Dolores Jones, 30, a theatrical wardrobe assistant, stood waiting for a cab in front of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue.
''I've chosen to support David Dinkins,'' she said. ''He's been in the community. He's walked the streets. I like his views.''
Ms. Jones said drugs and education are crucial issues for Harlem. ''Our children are being miseducated,'' she said. ''And for every junkie that gets help, 10 more children are recruited. But David Dinkins will give our children another positive role model.''
Despite its problems, there is a spirit and bounce to Harlem's step that refuses to be hobbled.
The writer and educator, Arna Bontemps, wrote about that spirit after he arrived in Harlem in 1924 from Los Angeles. He wrote about Harlem's broad avenues, its bright lights, and a warm sea of people that swept him away.
''I looked over the rooftops of Negrodom and tried to believe my eyes,'' he wrote. ''What a city. What a world.''
Today, Harlem's wide avenues have been renamed for black heroes: Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Frederick Douglass.
Along 125th Street and on a half-dozen street corners, open-air book stands are often set up, offering a steady diet of books on black history and culture.
''So people know that we have a lot to be proud of,'' Mr. Holt said.
The Apollo Theater, where countless black entertainment stars first began their climb, has been brought back to life. Tourists from around the world pour out of their buses and vans to sample Harlem's cooking and music.
Harlem has been bloodied. Mrs. Green, the retired nurse, said she refuses to let it be defeated.
She said no matter who wins the election next month, she will remain in Harlem.
''People think we're running away from Harlem,'' she said. ''No one is running away. This is home. My job now is to make it better.''

HEADLINE: Mayoral Candidates Walk Away From Koch's Idea for a Tax Rise

SERIES: DINKINS AND GIULIANI ON THE ISSUES - Second of three articles

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In the New York City mayoral primaries, the incumbent, Edward I. Koch, was alone among the six candidates in endorsing a tax increase - a proposal to pay for more police officers.
Other factors may have been instrumental in Mr. Koch's defeat. But neither David N. Dinkins, the Democratic nominee, nor Rudolph W. Giuliani, his Republican-Liberal rival, is taking any chances. Both indicate they would defer even their promises to increase the size of the police force rather than raise taxes, though they imply that a tax increase would be preferable to compromising public safety. ''See, it's one thing to add cops,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''It's quite another to reduce the number we have.'' 
If his administration tries for six months or a year to improve police efficiency but the crime rate rises, Mr. Giuliani said: ''You're going to need more and you can't cut. And then, if you have to, you raise taxes in order to accomplish that goal.''
 
Admitted Delays Probable
In separate interviews, the two candidates outlined their spending priorities as mayor - some of which, they acknowledged, would probably have to be delayed because of projected budget deficits.
The painful search for places to cut spending seemed to lead to an inconsistency by Mr. Giuliani. This week, he ridiculed Mr. Dinkins's proposal for a 1 percent across-the-board budget cut, except in the Police Department.
''What this city needs is a mayor, not a formula,'' Mr. Giuliani said at that time.
But in the interview, which was conducted earlier, Mr. Giuliani cited potential savings from improved productivity, from a hiring freeze and from other economies that he detailed, and then he added: ''After you've gone through that process, to close the gap you impose an across-the-board decrease of a percent, half a percent, a quarter of a percent - whatever's needed to do it, on each one of the agencies that you believe are nonessential and you let your commissioners work out how to accomplish that.''
Explaining the apparent inconsistency, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Dinkins had seemed in a television interview to be relying solely on an across-the-board cut. Actually, Mr. Dinkins had also mentioned potential productivity savings and said he was prepared ''to see where else we have to cut'' beyond the 1 percent.
The Koch administration, its budget director, Paul Dickstein, said yesterday, has surgically cut spending when necessary but has never imposed across-the-board cuts.
Mr. Dinkins, as Manhattan Borough President, has had modest administrative experience in city government; Mr. Giuliani, a former Federal prosecutor in Manhattan, has had none.
 
Balancing a Budget
Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that ''people have expressed their concern with whether or not I recognize the need to balance a budget,'' but he said his appointment of fiscal moderates as his economic advisers and of Nathan Leventhal, a former deputy mayor under Mr. Koch, to handle the transition between administrations ''suggests the people, the quality of the persons'' he would recruit for his cabinet and his commitment to a balanced budget.
Mr. Giuliani said he preferred to be measured by his performance in previous public offices. ''Candidates for public office have track records,'' he said, ''and one of the questions that you have to ask is 'Have they distinguished themselves and risen to the top in the things they've done in the past, or have they been mediocre, lackluster and have they failed in things they've done in the past?' ''
 
Signal to Business
Both candidates said bridging projected budget gaps, along with reducing crime, were among their top priorities. Mr. Giuliani said another would be to restore ''the sense of hope and a can-do attitude to New York.''
Both agreed that any tax increase would send a dangerous signal to the city's businesses.
''I don't want some corporate soul to read 'Dinkins contemplates taxes,' '' Mr. Dinkins said when asked under what circumstances he would raise them.
''The very last,'' Mr. Giuliani replied to the same question.
Neither candidate would specify which taxes he would resort to, if necessary, though Mr. Giuliani said he would begin with ''the easy ones,'' which he defined as those on cigarettes and other discretionary purchases rather than those on income, sales or property.
Both said they were leaning away from a so-called dedicated tax whose revenues would be reserved to pay for more police officers.
Mr. Dinkins said taxpayers might be willing to support such a ''revenue enhancement.''
Mr. Giuliani proposed that a portion of the state capital gains tax be earmarked to subsidize mass transit. Otherwise, he said he generally opposed taxes set aside for specific purposes. And he said raising taxes undermines an opportunity that austerity presents.
''If what you say to all your commmissioners is, 'I'm going to get you out of a hole by raising taxes, don't worry about it,' they don't go through the discipline of really analyzing what's there, what can be cut, how can we make it more productive?'' Mr. Giuliani said.
Projected deficits, he said, represent ''an opportunity to reform, restructure, analyze our government better, make it more productive, and also, if you understand it, to use it as a way of getting people to be more reasonable about the demands they would make on the government.''
New York City is facing a combined budget gap of more than $1 billion in the current fiscal year and the next one, beginning July 1, 1990. Last week, Mr. Koch proposed selective cutbacks and taxes to meet this year's projected deficit but retained his plan to increase the police force.
The current deficit was swollen by $247 million that the city had anticipated from the sale to a developer of the New York Coliseum site at Columbus Circle. The sale was blocked by several lawsuits supported by, among others, three West Side legislators who are allies of Mr. Dinkins, whose reputation as a conciliator could be enhanced if he persuades them to withdraw.
Neither candidate would identify a specific agency or program that he would eliminate. Rather, each suggested that the government, including its program to rebuild public works, could be run more efficiently.
Mr. Giuliani said he would exempt the police force, firefighters and child welfare programs from cutbacks. Mr. Dinkins said he would spare the police.

HEADLINE: Reagan Warns Japanese on Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Saturday, Oct. 28

 BODY:
In a tougher warning on trade than he issued as President, Ronald Reagan said today that Americans did not think their products had fair access to Japan and that trade barriers must be lowered to avoid rising anger in the United States.
''As a friend, I tell you that Americans are not as patient as the Japanese,'' Mr. Reagan said in the text of a speech scheduled to be delivered at the end of his nine-day visit in Japan. He added that the principle of fairness had been ''a very strong strain'' among Americans since the Boston Tea Party.
''We don't want a Japanese tea party,'' he said. ''Yet fairness is a real issue when it comes to trade between the U.S. and Japan.'' [In Washington on Friday, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, called on Japan to take a series of sweeping domestic actions to avoid new American trade sanctions. Page 32.] 
 
Warns of Possible Boycott
 In another criticism of Japan's policies reserved for his last day in Japan, Mr. Reagan warned that Japan faced a possible boycott of its products unless it corrected certain environmentally dangerous policies.
''No country is without blame when it comes to the environment,'' Mr. Reagan said. But he cited, as the focus of worldwide protests, Japanese logging in tropical rain forests and drift-net fishing, in which nets dozens of miles long are said to be depleting large areas of the ocean of marine life.
Until today, Mr. Reagan's comments have generally avoided criticism of his hosts. His speech today was likely to be taken highly seriously in Japan, where Mr. Reagan remains enormously popular. His visit here has brought an outpouring of affectionate tributes and a special award from the Japanese Government that had been given to only one other American President, Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Aides traveling with Mr. Reagan have said repeatedly that he has been speaking for himself and not for the Bush Administration, although they suggested that he had been in touch with relevant officials on the substance of his remarks. There were no comments from American officials here.
Mr. Reagan did endorse a previous statement by the Ambassador to Japan, Michael Armacost, that Japan's $50 billion annual trade surplus with the United States ''is simply not politically sustainable,'' particularly because the United States has recently improved its trade balance with other nations.
In a more familiar vein, Mr. Reagan told Japanese audiences that contrary to much of what is written in Japan, the United States was not a declining nation and was ready to face its future challenges. He appealed with some emotion for greater efforts to resolve common problems.
 
'Breathtaking Plan'
 ''We are the two greatest economic powers in the world,'' he said. ''Let us leap beyond no-win squabbling by undertaking a breathtaking plan. Let us make our goal a free-trade zone between the U.S. and Japan.''
The former President's visit has been sponsored by the Japanese Government and the Fujisankei Communications Group, which has spent between $6 million and $8 million, including a $2 million honorarium for Mr. Reagan. In return, both Mr. and Mrs. Reagan have given exclusive interviews in the company's outlets.
Mr. Reagan has also raised money for his Presidential library at a ''friendship concert'' in an arena in Yokohama and in meetings among Japanese industrialists, some of whom are on the board of his library fund-raising committee.
The Reagan speech today was scheduled to be delivered before a luncheon group at Osaka, after which Mr. and Mrs. Reagan were planning to return to their home in Los Angeles.
Because the Reagan visit has come at a time of unusual strain in Japanese-American relations, the former President's comments have received unusual attention in both countries, particularly among political and business leaders who fear that the two countries may be on a collision course on trade and other issues.
Japanese politicians, diplomats and business executives were hoping that Mr. Reagan, as a respected figure at home, would help to quiet what they fear may be growing anti-Japanese feeling in the United States.
People here are especially concerned, for instance, about the negative news coverage of Japanese business and real estate acquisitions in the United States, including the proposed takeover by the Sony Corporation of Columbia Pictures, owned by the Coca-Cola Company. Surveys showing that Americans think Japan poses a greater threat to the United States than does the Soviet Union have been widely discussed in Japan.
In the beginning of his visit, Mr. Reagan spoke generally about Japanese-American friendship in a way that cheered his hosts. Today Mr. Reagan continued many of his upbeat themes but also showed that he had at least been listening to reports of American concerns.

HEADLINE: Hills Urges Japanese To Act to Lift Imports

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, called on Japan today to take a series of sweeping domestic actions, including the slapping down of companies that fix prices and the restructuring of retail distribution, to avoid new trade sanctions from Washington.
She reasserted the view of the Bush Administration that Japan should become an import superpower instead of an export superpower to prevent a contraction in trade and a weakening of the global economy.
Mrs. Hills avoided talking about specific new sanctions, but did say that if the Japanese ''pull the string so tight that they force us to retaliate and restrict our market access to them, they will cause a contraction because they are so large and we are so large, and they will literally be the cause of the peril that results.''
 
First Details in Public
 It was the first time she has gone into detail publicly about the changes the Administration is looking for inside Japan to increase its propensity to import. 
Among other things, she said Japan should devote greater energy to stop collusion in its beef, construction and soda ash markets; should repeal legislation permitting small shops to block the opening of large department stores, and should buy more computer chips.
Her remarks were largely seen by business executives and certain lawmakers as seeking to dispel business concerns that she might be softening her trade stance against Japan. The concern arose after a trip she made to Japan earlier this month.
 
Reports of Retreat
 News accounts from Tokyo at the time suggested that she was backing away from the approach tied to results that has marked trade policy to date, apparently to enlist stronger Japanese support for the Uruguay Round of negotiations that seek a broad opening of world trade.
Corporate officials and some lawmakers fretted that the more moderate tone in Tokyo would diminish pressures to cut trade barriers, while little progress was being made in cutting the $50 billion American trade deficit with Japan. Heightening this concern were predictions that the deficit would grow again next year.
One manifestation of the unease was a letter to Mrs. Hills last week from Senator J. James Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, spurred by a published report that she had ''distanced'' herself from a 1986 agreement on computer chips. The Senator reminded her that while she did not negotiate the accord, it was her ''obligation to uphold the U.S. position on this important matter.''
 
'I Want the Market Open'
 Mrs. Hills seized the occasion today, at a breakfast meeting of the United States Chamber of Commerce, to state her intention to ''enforce the semiconductor agreement to the hilt.''
''My discussions with the Japanese were very clear,'' she said. ''I want the market open.''
Her comments on the enforcement of price-fixing laws came as a report circulated on Capitol Hill that six of Japan's biggest banks were holding regular ''informal'' meetings, with Finance Ministry officials present, at which they talked about setting deposit rates and other banking matters.
The report in the Far Eastern Economic Review said the meetings had been kept secret to avoid possible antitrust action by Japan's Fair Trade Commission.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, a former banker himself, called attention to the article in Senate floor remarks today, noting that such ''anti-competitive practices are detrimental to the global trading and banking system.''
Mrs. Hills, a former antitrust lawyer, said pointedly today that the last time Japan set financial penalties for price-fixing was in the early 1970's, while in the United States the Justice Department last year alone brought more than 200 such cases.
 
Talks to Start Next Month
 A Japanese delegation is expected here on Nov. 6 for a second round of talks on the structural barriers to trade and business between the United States and Japan. Mrs. Hills said she wanted a blueprint for action by next July at the latest.
In their turn, the Japanese are insisting that the United States also make structural changes, such as cutting the budget deficit and increasing savings that would work to ease the trade deficit.
The semiconductor agreement committed Japan to stop ''dumping'' its chips, or selling them below cost, and to open its own chip markets so that by 1991 the United States would have a 21 percent market share, up from 8.6 percent in 1986.
Mrs. Hills said today, ''I think we sell ourselves short with targets like that,'' noting that outside Japan, the United States averages market shares of at least 50 percent.
While objecting to 21 percent as a ceiling, she said for the first time that it should be the ''floor,'' and added that by any linear progression the United States should already have 15 percent of the Japanese market, instead of the present 11 percent.
Alan W. Wolff, counsel to the Semiconductor Industry Association, said that Mrs. Hills was issuing a ''pretty vigorous statement that the Japanese must improve market access dramatically.''
A spokesman for Senator Exon, who was in Nebraska and not immediately available, said the Senator ''will be reassured'' by the Hills comments and added that her remarks were a ''positive sign that the U.S. will maintain a consistent policy.''
A Bush interagency panel is studying whether to stiffen the already existing $165 million of sanctions that President Ronald Reagan applied against Japan in 1987 for Tokyo's failure to abide by the chip accord.

HEADLINE: Personal Income Up 0.3% in Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Americans' personal income, dealt a blow by Hurricane Hugo, rose a lackluster three-tenths of 1 percent in September as consumer spending posted its weakest advance in a year.
The Commerce Department said today that personal income in September rose $12.8 billion, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate to $4.47 trillion, the smallest increase in four months. Last month's personal income growth followed an identical advance of three-tenths of 1 percent in August and an increase of six-tenths of 1 percent in July. 
Spending increased two-tenths of 1 percent, the most anemic gain in 12 months, to an annual rate of $3.53 trillion. Spending posted robust gains of nine-tenths of 1 percent in August and eight-tenths of 1 percent in July.
''September marks the beginning of the end of the consumer revival,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist of the Boston Company. ''Because of sluggish income growth and caution in spending, consumers will hunker down, especially on big-ticket items.''
 
Manufacturing Jobs Down
 Other signs of weakness in the month include a decline of 103,000 manufacturing jobs and a slight drop in orders for big-ticket durable goods.
Economists, who this spring were expecting a recession to develop, were somewhat relieved by a rebound in spending this summer.
But Mr. Sinai predicted that consumer spending would shrink in the current quarter, a rare event. That will lead to sluggish economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, at an annual rate of less than 1 percent, he said. By the first half of next year, the nation will topple into a mild recession, he forecast.
The Government announced earlier this week that the nation's economy grew a moderate 2.5 percent in the third quarter, the same as in the previous three-month period.
 
Swing in Car Buying Cited
 Other economists, however, noted that the September report was not so bad as it first appeared because consumer spending was held back by a swing in automobile purchases and incomes were depressed by one-time losses from Hugo, which struck North Carolina and South Carolina on Sept. 21.
The report noted that without the effects of Hugo, incomes would have risen twice as much, six-tenths of 1 percent, in September. The impact amounted to $13 billion at an annual rate, most of that coming in a $9 billion drop in rental incomes, which were figured after deducting uninsured losses from storm damage.
The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, increased $14.4 billion, compared with a rise of $5.7 billion in August. The hurricane reduced wages and salaries by about $2 billion at an annual rate.
On the spending side, the $8.7 billion increase in personal consumption spending, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, compared with a $33 billion increase in August.
Purchases of durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, dropped $6.1 billion, while nondurable goods purchases rose $3.6 billion. Spending on services rose $11.3 billion.
A swing in new car purchases more than accounted for the September decline in durable goods and accounted for most of a $19.4 billion increase in August.
The September report showed that Americans' income after taxes rose only two-tenths of 1 percent, down from the gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in August.

HEADLINE: British Shift Puts Spotlight On an Obscure U.S. Journal

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The resignation of Nigel Lawson as Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer has lifted an obscure American economic journal into the limelight.
Mr. Lawson resigned on Thursday because he could not persuade Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to disavow a passage in a magazine article that had been written by Sir Alan Walters, her economic adviser. In advance of the article's publication in the December issue of The American Economist, the offending passage appeared in The Financial Times in London. 
''How the passage got to The Financial Times, I don't know,'' said Michael Zenberg, a Pace University professor who edits the magazine from his home in Brooklyn. ''But I received dozens of calls last week from British newspaper people who wanted to fish for additional bombshells. There weren't any. To me the whole article was innocuous.''
Among the nation's journals, The American Economist, which appears twice a year, is not the one to which prominent economists turn to publish ground-breaking research papers. Its sponsors are Pace and the International Honor Society in Economics, an organization of graduate students in economics with A averages. The readers are mainly these graduate students and academics who first subscribed to the magazine, for $15 a year, when they were named to the honor society.
 
Noted Contributors
 But since 1983, Mr. Zenberg has been running a series entitled ''The Life Philosophy of Eminent Economists''; it is this series that has brought his journal into the spotlight. Among the contributors were Paul Samuelson and Herbert Simon, who are Nobel laureates in economic science, and Walt Rostow, a confidant of President Lyndon Johnson. Sir Alan is the latest contributor.
The Rostow article prompted Mr. Zenberg to invite Sir Alan to contribute. He thought Sir Alan's position with Mrs. Thatcher was similar to the Rostow-Johnson relationship.
''Since I had used Walt Rostow, I was looking for someone outside the United States to balance him in Britain,'' said Mr. Zenberg, who teaches economics at Pace's Graduate School of Business.
With the uproar in London, Mr. Zenberg has released photocopies of Sir Alan's 21-page typewritten manuscript, first submitted more than a year ago. The biographical account includes a passage, on page 19, that reiterates Sir Alan's long-held view that Britain should not join the European Monetary System and that currencies should float freely.
Although Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan have disagreed on these issues for months, the publication of the passage in London this fall instigated the confrontation that ended Thursday in the resignation of Sir Alan as well as Mr. Lawson.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the resignation of Nigel Lawson as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain misidentified the editor of the magazine American Economist. He is Michael Szenberg.

HEADLINE: Unusual Bond Trading Disturbs the Market

BYLINE: By ANISE C. WALLACE

 BODY:
Unusual and very large trading by a single party, thought to be Japanese, has captivated and disrupted the government bond market, contributing to price swings and setting off fears of a corner in one issue of government bonds.
The trader, who may or may not represent a single institution or a consortium, first got the attention of traders by posting huge orders to buy bonds on an electronic system that normally handles much smaller trades. Since then, apparent large trades have set the market on edge.
Yesterday rumors swept Wall Street that the trader sold as much as $2 billion of his bond holdings, but by the end of the day the prevailing speculation was that he or she had sold much less, perhaps $200 million in bond futures contracts. 
Earlier in the week, there had been speculation among dealers that the mysterious trader was trying to ''corner the market'' in a $9.7 billion issue of 30-year Treasury bonds. Rumors said the trader had accumulated $3 billion or even $5 billion of the issue, the 8 1/8 percent bonds due in August 2019.
In a corner, those who sold the bond issue short, that is sold it without owning it, would have to buy it back, possibly at higher prices. Some of Wall Street's largest bond firms did short the bond issue, traders say. Since they did that, it has risen in price, causing losses for them and profits for the mysterious buyer. The price of the issue rose from 98 1/2 percent of par value on Sept. 29 to as high as 103 on Wednesday. Yesterday, the closing bid was just over 102.
''He's cost people a lot of money,'' the head of government bond trading at one of the largest bond firms complained early this week. That trader is convinced the mysterious trader is a Japanese institution but will not say what evidence he has to indicate that.
Some dealers said that they had traced the large-scale buying of this particular bond issue to a Japanese broker, although tales varied as to just which one. They said the suspected the trades were being executed on behalf of a Japanese bond dealer, insurance company or consortium of investors.
On Wednesday, an official at Daiwa Securities in New York said that contrary to rumors, his firm was not involved.
On Thursday, an official at Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International Inc., a Japanese brokerage firm, said his firm had bought ''substantial'' amounts of the long bonds. But Eishi Wakabayashi, an executive vice president of the firm in New York, would not say whether his firm was the mysterious buyer flashing orders on the Cantor Fitzgerald Bond Quotation Service carried on the Telerate system.
He would also not say whether the firm was executing the trades for itself or for a customer or customers. ''I don't really know,'' he said. ''It's all done by Tokyo.''
Given the way the Cantor Fitzgerald system works, many traders can see that the bids go up, but it is difficult to determine whether an entire order was filled, or if a reported trade was for a smaller amount. Usually, that system handles small orders, of the $5 million-or-so variety, with big orders handled discreetly by telephone, using brokers that specialize in bond trading.
Mr. Wakabayashi said he was ''disappointed'' that Wall Street traders and dealers were openly discussing these transactions, saying he feels such things should be kept private and out of the media. ''I'm really disturbed these days,'' he said.
On Wednesday, the unidentified trader used the service to announce that he was willing to buy $1 billion of long bonds. The previous Thursday, Oct. 19, when bond prices fell after the Government released inflation figures, a trader, presumed to be the same one, displayed an order for almost $2 billion of the Treasury bonds.
Yesterday's rumored selling was said to have been done discreetly through dealers, although no one seems to know for sure.
So far, no one on Wall Street has been able to determine the motivations of this trader, which is not surprising since no one is sure of the identity. There is speculation the trader is trying to make a political point about the importance of Japanese investors in financing the United States budget deficit.
But speculations abound. Tadeo Sakashima, vice president of Daiwa in New York, thinks the trader was merely seeking 1980's-style fame. ''The only reason is to be famous and enjoy controlling the market for a short time,'' he said.
If that is the case, his visibility and fame may backfire, some on Wall Street say, hopefully, adding that traders are better prepared to react to him. ''They may have his license number now,'' said Alan Medaugh, a portfolio manager at C. J. Lawrence/ Morgan Grenfell Inc., in New York.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Substantially Lower, Following Stocks and Bonds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar weakened substantially against all major currencies except the British pound yesterday. Currency traders said the dollar was undermined by another poor session in the stock market and expectations of lower interest rates.
Sterling stayed stuck in the slump that it lapsed into when the British Government's top finance official abruptly quit on Thursday. 
The dollar ended near its lowest levels of the day. Currency dealers said selling motivated by internal market factors accentuated the dollar's weakness.
But some impetus to unload dollars came from the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss for the week of 92.42 points, at 2,596.72.
The dollar was also depressed by rumors that a large Japanese investor was dumping long-term Treasury bonds. If United States stocks and bonds fall out of favor, demand for dollars would decline.
The report that the nation's budget deficit totaled $152.1 billion in the fiscal year 1989, which ended Sept. 30, added to the negative sentiment. The deficit has shown little improvement for three straight years.
''The market's perception of a fragile stock market, a possibly faltering economy and announcement of the size of the budget deficit'' pushed the dollar down,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston in New York.
A bearish attitude toward the dollar has been reinforced lately by numerous economic numbers showing sluggish growth. There is speculation that the Federal Reserve Board will soon decide to stimulate growth by nudging interest rates lower. Declining United States rates would reduce returns on dollar-denominated investments, tending to curb dollar demand.
In late New York trading the dollar was at 141.75 yen, down from 142.12 late Thursday. Sterling fetched $1.5795, up slightly from $1.5780 on Thursday, when it plunged after Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned in a policy dispute.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.8295 West German marks, down from 1.8410; 1.6005 Swiss francs, down from 1.6115; 6.2150 French francs, down from 6.2545; 1.17475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17545, and 1,348.00 Italian lire, down from 1,351.00.

HEADLINE: Ortega Now Says End to Rebel Aid Can Save Truce

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Modifying a position he stated on Friday, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua said today that he would adhere to a cease-fire with the contras if the United States halted its assistance to the rebels as a fighting force.
After arriving here on Friday for a conference of Western Hemisphere leaders, Mr. Ortega said that because of renewed contra attacks, the Nicaraguan Army would not extend the 19-month-old cease-fire after Tuesday, and he vowed to renew offensive operations as of Wednesday.
But today, as the conference ended, Mr. Ortega declined to put a specific date on the resumption of military operations, and said his decision to end the cease-fire was ''reversible.''
''We are looking for a solution,'' he said. ''If the Congress of the United States stops financing the counterrevolutionaries, then we will unilaterally declare a truce.'' 
Mr. Ortega repeatedly said the American money should be used to finance the dismantling of the contras.
Before he left the conference today, President Bush said several other leaders had met with Mr. Ortega on Friday night and ''they leaned on him pretty hard.''
Mr. Bush peppered his remarks today with personal attacks on Mr. Ortega, repeatedly describing him as ''a little man'' and once calling him ''an animal at a garden party.''
''The man had a little bit of backing off, a little bit, so let's wait and see,'' Mr. Bush said. But he warned Mr. Ortega, ''Do not break the cease-fire.''
Mr. Ortega's tactics at the meeting, the first summit meeting for the Western Hemisphere in 22 years, appeared to be an effort to increase pressure on the Congress to disband the rebels, who insist that they are the guarantors of Managua's promises to hold free elections on Feb. 25.
Next month, Congress is to decide whether to continue supplying food, clothing, shelter and medical aid to the rebels, most of whom are encamped in bases in Honduras.
The decision to end the cease-fire dominated discussions at the two-day meeting, and was considered a major setback to the two-year Central American peace process.
''It has destroyed everything that has been accomplished so far,'' said President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, whose country has been ravaged by a decade-old insurgency. ''It will complicate the situation a great deal.''
 
No Reaction on Ortega Offer
Neither Mr. Bush nor the other 15 heads of state gathered here reacted to Mr. Ortega's offer to trade the cease-fire for the disbanding of the rebels.
But a spokesman for the contras denounced the proposal. ''Ortega is trying to deal a mortal blow to the resistance,'' Bosco Matamoros, the spokesman, said in a telephone interview from Washington.
Central American leaders have repeatedly and forcefully called for the disbanding of the contras. In an agreement signed earlier this year in Tela, Honduras, five Central American presidents agreed that the rebel army should be decommissioned by Dec. 5.
Nicaraguan officials say the United States has prevented the dispersal of the contras and that they had to take dramatic action to force the issue. Otherwise, the officials said, the rebels would continue to receive American aid and remain in Honduras.
''It was a shock tactic,'' an official close to President Ortega said this morning. ''What we are looking for is a commitment to dismantle the contras by Dec. 5. If we had not done this, it would never have happened.''
 
U.S. Officials Seem Ecstatic
But Bush Administration officials, who at first appeared stunned by President Ortega's declaration on Friday that he would end the cease-fire, seemed almost ecstatic today. ''We're incredulous that he made such a blunder,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. Another senior official said the Ortega decision would make it easier to push continued aid to the rebels through Congress.
Under a bipartisan agreement with the Administration, Congress in April approved $49.75 million in food, shelter and other humanitarian aid to last through Feb. 25. But it won a concession that the President would suspend the help on Nov. 30 if any of the key Congressional committees with jurisdiction in the area objected to its continuation.
In a news conference that began as President Ortega finished outlining his latest offer, President Bush, unaware of Mr. Ortega's modified position, criticized the Nicaraguan leader in unusually biting and personal language, repeatedly calling him ''a little man.'' At least once, a remarkably vituperative Mr. Bush confused Mr. Ortega with the Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. When a television reporter compared Mr. Ortega to a ''skunk at a picnic,'' Mr. Bush concurred, calling the Nicaraguan ''an unwanted animal at a garden party.''
 
'Not the Most Comfortable Fit'
''We didn't come here to have any contretemps with this little man,'' Mr. Bush said. He added that it was ''a little odd'' to have the Nicaraguan President at a meeting to celebrate the centennial of Latin America's oldest democracy, Costa Rica.
''It wasn't exactly the most comfortable fit,'' Mr. Bush said. He noted that Mr. Ortega was the only leader to come to the conference dressed in a military uniform.
But Mr. Ortega, who blamed the United States for Nicaragua's economic depression, said he would replace his orange bandana with a tie once his country's economy is allowed to recover.
The American delegation had insisted that the meeting be largely ceremonial and devoid of substantive group discussions. It also had vetoed plans for a joint communique for fear of appearing to be negotiating with Mr. Ortega.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d went out of his way to portray a brief meeting between the Nicaraguan and American Presidents as nothing more than a greeting. ''I don't think it was what you would refer to as a serious, substantive discussion,'' Mr. Baker said.

HEADLINE: New York Mayoral Race Focuses On Voters' Sense of Party Loyalty

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Whether to resist or respond to party loyalty is emerging as a dominant question in the final 10 days of New York City's mayoral campaign, with David N. Dinkins wrapping himself in the mantle of prominent Democrats and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his Republican-Liberal rival, by necessity appealing for Democratic and independent votes by invoking John F. Kennedy's maxim that sometimes party loyalty demands too much.
Yesterday, Mayor Edward I. Koch taped a television advertisement for Mr. Dinkins in which he reminded New Yorkers that his administration saved the day-care centers and centers for the elderly that would have been shuttered because of economies by Republican administrations in Washington. ''David was there with me,'' Mr. Koch said.
Mr. Koch and Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, are to campaign with Mr. Dinkins today, and appearances with Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio - Democrats who have been recruited to reassure Jewish voters -are planned for this week.
Mr. Giuliani, meanwhile, has been importing prominent Republicans -including Barbara Bush, the First Lady, who is due Friday - primarily for private fund-raising events. On the stump, he has largely been appealing to disaffected Democrats by emphasizing his political independence and his willingness to sever party leaders' ties to city government - most recently, to local school boards. 
 
Still Deadlocked on Debates
While both candidates revised their paid television campaigns for the final full week of the campaign, they remained deadlocked over debates.
Mr. Dinkins has demanded that two other Republicans also be invited to take part - Ronald S. Lauder, the Conservative Party candidate, and Henry Hewes, the Right to Life Party nominee - ostensibly to be inclusionary, but also to divide the Republican vote and to exploit Mr. Giuliani's potential vulnerability on the abortion issue, about which Mr. Giuliani has made a new commercial. Mr. Giuliani, in turn, has insisted that only the two acknowledged front-runners debate.
Mr. Dinkins, who emerged from last month's Democratic primary as the heavy favorite, has generally been viewed by political consultants, editorial commentators and his opponent as ducking debates. But after Mr. Dinkins spent much of this month on the defensive and saw his lead erode in every public opinion poll, some supporters suggested that he now had more to gain by debating - even with as polished a litigator as Mr. Giuliani.
Over the weekend, with no negotiations scheduled, each campaign appeared to be waiting for the other to blink.
Invoking party loyalty is one component in a strategy of reassuring potential Democratic defectors - from those who consider Mr. Dinkins too liberal, to those troubled by his tax problems 16 years ago and to white voters, Jews in particular, concerned not so much about his own record but about his ties to the Rev. Jesse Jackson and, more recently, to a minor campaign worker who later proclaimed himself to be ''anti-white.''
Jews, who comprised the bulk of Mr. Dinkins's white voters in the primary, are considered pivotal in the general election.
To further demonstrate continuity from one Democratic administration to another, Mr. Dinkins named Nathan Leventhal, Mr. Koch's former deputy mayor, to head his transition team and has offered the post of corporation counsel, the administration's top legal post, to Victor L. Kovner, who has served on a number of mayoral panels and was once Mr. Koch's law partner.
 
Belmont Boos Dinkins
As he did in the primary, Mr. Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President, is courting Democrats of all stripes in an effort to demonstrate the breadth of his campaign, if not his appeal, in a city where enrolled Democrats outnumber Republicans by 5 to 1.
To dramatize that he wants to be ''mayor of all the people,'' Mr. Dinkins campaigned yesterday in the Belmont section of the Bronx, a predominantly Italian neighborhood that even Democratic leaders estimate will vote 70 percent for Mr. Giuliani.
As Mr. Dinkins walked down Arthur Avenue past fragrant cheese shops and Italian groceries, he was heckled loudly by Giuliani supporters who screamed ''Pay your taxes, Dave'' and ''Debate, debate.'' Dinkins supporters tried to drown out the hecklers with chants of ''Dave, Dave.''
Mr. Dinkins said his trip to Belmont ''is a bit more than symbolism.''
''I think it's important to go into every community,'' he said. ''Belmont does not belong all to someone else.''
 
The Times Endorses Dinkins
The New York Times endorsed Mr. Dinkins today. The editorial said a vote for Mr. Giuliani, who has never held elective office, represented ''a gamble,'' while Mr. Dinkins, ''warts and all,'' is a known quantity who understands city government.
''He is not the ideal candidate but he is a good man likely to make a decent mayor,'' the editorial said.
Mr. Dinkins said yesterday: ''I'm pleased The New York Times endorses my candidacy, and I'm confident it will help a lot. There's a fairly large pool of undecided voters, and I'm sure that many will be persuaded.''
Mr. Giuliani has been seeking Democratic deserters from the ranks of Koch voters in the primary - Jews, white Catholics and Hispanic New Yorkers. Yesterday, he campaigned in the central and South Bronx in a caravan led by a salsa band whose vocalists repeated the refrain, ''Giuliani para alcalde,'' meaning ''Giuliani for Mayor.''
Escorted by Detective Walter Alicea of the police Hispanic Society and the Rev. Ruben Diaz, a Bronx minister who supported Mr. Koch in the primary, he was warmly received.
He criticized Mr. Dinkins on two counts yesterday. He said Mr. Dinkins's suggestion that free tuition at the City University of New York eventually be restored would add $58 million to what Mr. Giuliani called the ''Dinkins deficit'' - the cost of programs he has proposed. Also, he said that by surrounding himself with prominent Democrats and by suggesting names of people who might serve in his administration, Mr. Dinkins was ''trying to get elected by endorsement and by naming other people.''
 
Giuliani Mentions Carey
Mr. Giuliani, even if so inclined, would be constrained from doing likewise since so many prominent Democrats, whose names Mr. Giuliani could cite to demonstrate the scope of his own potential cabinet, are united behind Mr. Dinkins. Mr. Giuliani said former Gov. Hugh L. Carey is one Democrat he has consulted on fiscal matters, but did not mean to imply that he was a supporter.
Mr. Giuliani also mentioned Richard D. Parsons, president of the Dime Savings Bank of New York and a former adviser to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, as someone who would help ''what I'd like to accomplish, which is have high-ranking blacks'' in his administration.
Mr. Giuliani's most notable Democratic defector, John S. Dyson, chairman of the State Power Authority, loaned the campaign $100,000 last week to reserve television time. Mr. Giuliani nearly kept pace with Mr. Dinkins in contributions during the latest 20-day reporting period, though he continued to lag behind Mr. Dinkins overall.
Today, seeking to nudge Jewish voters from the undecided column to the Republican or Liberal lines, Mr. Giuliani is to meet with the Police Department's Shomrim Society, a Jewish group; visit with Teddy Kollek, the Mayor of Jerusalem, and campaign in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and in in Belle Harbor, Queens, before an evening appearance at Young Israel in Flatbush.
Mr. Dinkins's schedule, too, is heavy with events aimed at Jewish voters.
 
'You Haven't Paid Taxes'
Yesterday, Mr. Dinkins received a signal, perhaps more powerful than any poll results, that Mr. Giuliani's negative advertisements may be having an effect.
After delivering an inspirational speech to Harlem youngsters bused to the ''I Have a Dream'' program at Marble Collegiate Church on lower Fifth Avenue, Mr. Dinkins asked for questions. The first hand raised was that of 13-year-old James D. Pickett, who said, ''I've heard on TV that you haven't paid your taxes.''
Mr. Dinkins explained the details of his failure to pay taxes for four years nearly two decades ago, saying ''the Government always knew that I wasn't hiding income.''
Young Mr. Pickett, an eighth-grader at Intermediate School 275 in Harlem, said he had heard about Mr. Dinkins's tax problems on the news and in Mr. Giuliani's commercials, as well as from his parents. ''They've been telling me they liked him and they voted for him,'' Mr. Pickett said, ''but they just wanted to know why'' he did not pay his taxes. He said Mr. Dinkins's response had satisfied him and he would vote for him if he could.

HEADLINE: THE FREEWAY DEAD: Portraits From Oakland - A special report.;
11 WHOSE LIVES ENDED AS QUAKE CRUSHED I-880

BYLINE: The following article was prepared by Robert Reinhold, Mireya Navarro and Jonathan Rabinovitz; Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Oct. 28

 BODY:
They were brought together by chance, by fate, by an act of God, some might say: 23 men, 15 women and a little boy. Strangers caught together in a terrifying moment as the earth's mantle shrugged, blithely shattering a fragile man-made structure, the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland.
Few in the Bay Area had thought much about the road. It was just part of the network of highways that knitted the region together, routinely feeding commuters onto the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Suddenly on Oct. 17, a powerful earthquake turned the routine into the extraordinary. The cars that are as much a part of Californians' everyday lives as subways are to New Yorkers suddenly became deathtraps.
When the rubble and dust had settled, 39 victims were extracted, lives lost to the whims of nature. The coroner's list was like a census report on the polyglot Bay Area: victims were Asian, black, white, Hispanic. There was a Palestinian, a refugee from Vietnam, Midwesterners, Easterners. Most were not native to the Bay Area: they had come for economic opportunity, for personal or political freedom, for the climate, the beauty. Most gave only passing thought to the dangers of earthquakes, or at least, wrote that off as a price of living in the Bay Area. 
Here is how the lives of 10 people intersected and ended on the Nimitz Freeway:
 
Donna Marsden
Hospital Administrator, 36
 
Born in Torrance, Calif. . . . daughter of a Los Angeles police officer . . . married, divorced and remarried . . . an administrator in the pathology department at the University of California at San Francisco . . . lived in Alameda . . . died at the age of 36.
Like most people born and reared in California, Donna Marsden had adopted a casual attitude about earthquakes. She had taken the precaution of wrapping rubber bands around the knobs of the china cabinet in her three-story Victorian home in Alameda. That saved her china when the jolt hit on Oct. 17, but Mrs. Marsden died with four others in a university van.
She boarded the blue and gray Dodge van every weekday morning, and again at 4:40 P.M. in San Francisco for the return home. That day had been no different, except that her husband had taken her to lunch to celebrate her promotion at the University of California at San Francisco. Later, the van traveled the upper deck of the Nimitz Freeway at almost the same time it did every day. Had the quake struck seconds earlier or later, Mrs. Marsden would scarcely have been affected, apart from picking up some fallen items at home.
With her blue-green eyes and nearly floor-length hair wrapped in a large bun, Mrs. Marsden was striking, and she was known among friends for her sarcastic wit, keen sense of the absurd and, above all, a nurturing spirit. She kept hundreds of plants, two dogs and two cats. A favorite charity was the Starcross Monestery in Santa Rosa, which cares for children with AIDS.
For two years she worked in the anesthesiology department as coordinator for resident doctors until being promoted to the pathology department the day before the quake. Colleagues said she exuded energy and self-confidence, exhibiting a directness bordering on bluntness. Her husband, Bruce, who designs and installs software for the International Business Machines Corporation in Oakland, said one of her greatest joys was fixing the Victorian house the couple bought two years ago, and she spent hours painting and papering the walls and fixing furniture.
They knew earthquakes were a threat, but never thought much of it. ''We grew up out here,'' said Mr. Marsden. ''We tended to adopt a cavalier attitude. It's a fact of life out here. Every time there was a rumble, we'd make a joke when it quit.''
 
Delores Ardoin Stewart
Administrative Assistant, 48
 
Born in Lakes Charles, La. . . . raised by grandparents after being orphaned . . . moved to San Francisco in 1964 to be near her sister . . . married and divorced . . . lived in Alameda . . . an administrative records assistant in chancellor's office at the University of California at San Francisco . . . died at the age of 48.
Delores Ardoin Stewart, a product of Louisiana's Creole culture, loved the Bay Area, the climate, the more tolerant attitudes about race, the San Francisco 49'ers football team and the Oakland A's baseball team -''my men,'' as she called them. But after 25 years here, one thing still terrified her: earthquakes. During the last quake in August, she called her brother-in-law, Jerry Bernard, in nearby Union City, Calif., to vent her feelings.
On Oct. 17, she left the apartment she shared with her companion for the last five years, Michael D. Reardon, at 7:05 A.M. to meet the van that took her to the University of California at San Francisco. She had worked there for 20 years, most of that time keeping records and correspondence at the chancellor's office.
Just as punctually, she met the van for the return to the East Bay. When the quake hit, the van bounced off the upper deck of the freeway; in another few seconds she would have been out of danger.
''She was scared to death of earthquakes,'' said Mr. Reardon, a clerk at the California Department of Health Services in Berkeley. ''Her brother-in-law began to have a feeling something was wrong because after the last one, she talked to him for an hour and a half.''
She once attended a university meeting on earthquake preparedness, but would not go back after the first one. ''She really had difficulties with earthquakes,'' Mr. Reardon said. ''She would really rather get on with the business of living.''
Ms. Stewart, an energetic and statuesque black woman, came to the area in the 60's and lived in the Haight-Ashbury district. It was a heady experience for a Louisiana farm girl, but friends said she was proud to have lived through those times and remained imbued with its idealism. A liberal Democrat, she was strongly committed politically, but she also had a materialistic streak.
She lived in a beautifully decorated apartment and was a considerably skilled cook. She also had a taste for the slot machines in Reno and was an avid dart player.
 
James Thomas Hansen
Businessman, 64
 
Born in Berkeley . . . a B-29 mechanic in the Army in World War II . . . received a bachelor's degree in business administration at the University of California at Berkeley . . . father of four and grandfather of five . . . general manager of the State Shingle Company in Oakland . . . lived in Albany . . . died at the age of 64.
Probably none of the commuters knew the Nimitz Freeway better than James Hansen. He drove his 1985 Toyota Camry back and forth over the elevated road four times a day, twice to and twice from work, the extra round trip to have lunch with his wife of 36 years, Gloria. He was a punctual man, but on Oct. 17 he left work five minutes early to go home and watch the World Series. That cost him his life; his car was one of those caught on the lower level when the upper deck of the two-tiered highway collapsed.
''That day the freeway wasn't crowded,'' said Mrs. Hansen. ''He hits one stop sign and he goes on. About three short blocks or about 20 seconds more and he would have made it through.''
 
Melissa E. Maxwell
Deputy District Attorney, 32
 
Born in San Francisco . . . a fifth-generation Californian . . . 1978 graduate of University of California at San Diego . . . graduated from Hastings Law School in 1983 . . . an Alameda County deputy district attorney . . . lived in Burlingame . . . died at the age of 32.
The World Series saved the lives of hundreds of people on Oct. 17, but it was the death sentence for Melissa E. Maxwell. Many commuters had rushed home early or stayed at bars to watch the third game, and were not on the Nimitz Freeway when it collapsed at 5:04 P.M.
But Ms. Maxwell had arranged to be on the freeway at precisely 5 P.M. so that she could pick up her 7-year-old niece, Erin, at a day care center in Burlingame. Her sister and brother-in-law had tickets to the game, and Ms. Maxwell had agreed to watch the girl.
To remind herself to leave the prosecutor's office earlier than usual - she generally stayed until around 6 P.M. - she had posted a note on her wall to be on the freeway by 5.
All day Ms. Maxwell told her partner, Jim Kinnison, that they had to finish early so that she would not keep her niece waiting. ''She was really looking forward to it,'' Mr. Kinnison said. ''She loved her family. She was always talking about them.''
Ms. Maxwell was one of nine children, raised in an old wooden house that survived the great 1906 earthquake. She had a relaxed Californian attitude toward quakes.
''I don't believe that she worried about quakes,'' her sister, Melanie Fuller of Hawaii, said in an interview while in the Bay Area. ''She was not a fearful person. She was very religious.''
Friends and family members described Ms. Maxwell as an imposing figure, 5 feet 10 inches tall, with fiery red hair. Her presence commanded respect, both in court and in some of the roughest parts of Oakland.
Ms. Maxwell knew all her life that she wanted to be a lawyer, Mrs. Fuller said. ''When she was hired by the Alameda County District Attorney's office four years ago, it was a dream come true.''
Her family recently found a note she had written and stashed in her desk: ''I love to say that I am Melissa E. Maxwell for the People of the State of California.''
Minutes before she got on the freeway, an inspector in her office, Bob Cox, saw her drive by and honk. ''I was returning from a run,'' he said. ''She called out, 'Hey, Mr. Healthy,' and then zoomed off. If she had been parked, I would have talked with her and this wouldn't have happened.''
 
Petra Berumen
Housekeeper, 25
 
Born in Mexico . . . came to the Bay Area about nine years ago . . . mother of Julio, 6, and Cathy, 8 . . . cleaned homes . . . lived in Richmond . . . died at the age of 25.
Petra Berumen would do just about anything for her two children. The slight shy Mexican woman was learning English to help them with their homework. She also learned to drive recently so she could take them to school when it rained and to doctors' appointments.
And so it was on Tuesday afternoon. She was driving the children home from the orthodontist's office in Oakland in the family's red Ford, when the freeway collapsed.
Mrs. Berumen died, along with a passenger, her good friend Yolanda Orozco. The two Berumen children were saved, although Julio's right leg had to be amputated so he could be removed from the wreckage in one of the more dramatic episodes of the rescue efforts. Mrs. Orozco's body also impeded the workers.
Cathy suffered serious head injuries.
If Mrs. Berumen worried much about earthquakes, they were low on her list of priorities as a young immigrant trying to get started in a new land. She had married another Mexican, Pastor Berumen, a construction worker, and two months ago the two bought their first home.
''The Berumens were kind of the American dream,'' said Catherine Syverson, principal of the Downer Elementary School, which both children attend. ''They came to this country, got a good job, lived in a neighborhood with nice people. They had just bought a pretty little house, no small feat in California. They really had it made.'' Mrs. Berumen worked three days a week cleaning houses to supplement the family income, but apart from that her entire daily life revolved around her children. She was active at the school.
A friend, Graciela Almonte, said: ''She was a very good mother. She took them to school and wouldn't leave until they went into the classroom. And she always picked them up.''
And like other mothers, she was determined to have children with nice straight teeth. On Tuesday the the orthdontist's appointment turned out to be a date with death.
 
Raymonde Beauregard-Sund
Personnel Analyst, 42
 
Born in Granby, Quebec . . . reared in West Warwick, R.I. . . . lived in Alameda . . . a personnel analyst in the anesthesiology department at University of California at San Francisco . . . died at the age of 42.
Like others in the university van pool, Raymonde Beauregarde-Sund was a daily freeway commuter. And like most of them, she gave little thought to earthquakes. ''She never expressed any concerns about earthquakes,'' said her husband, Lieut. Cmdr. Jim Sund of the aircraft carrier Carl Vincent. ''We took it as part of living here.'' The two were married 21 years ago and moved to the Bay Area in 1978. She later attended San Francisco State University, where she received a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1980 and began working at the University of California medical center. She was liked there for her zany sense of humor and her generosity toward colleagues.
She had adapted easily to her new home state, taking up marathon running and gourmet cooking, and her concerns about industrial growth in Alameda led her to campaign for ballot measures intended to limit development.
 
Ramzi Farid Asfour
Banker, 50
 
Born in Haifa, Palestine . . . married for 20 years to Lily, a sales clerk at Emporium Capwell's . . . a son, Fareed, 18, and two daughters, Zeina, 16, and Leina, 12 . . . vice president of private investment services for the BankAmerica Corporation . . . lived in Novato . . . died at the age of 50.
Ramzi Farid Asfour had been telling family and friends that he wanted to quit his job as an investment counselor and do consulting work. After an accomplished career as a stockbroker and executive for the BankAmerica Corporation, he wanted to devote more time to his church and to his work on behalf of fellow Palestinians.
On Oct. 17, he was expected in Fremont to discuss investments with a potential client. He was an hour late because of heavy traffic, and he headed back toward San Francisco at 4:30 P.M. Barely half an hour later, his Cadillac Seville was crushed by the crumbling upper deck of the Nimitz Freeway.
His sister-in-law, Lucy Asfour, said he seldom traveled to the East Bay. ''It's incredible he was at that spot at that time,'' she said. ''It was really his destiny.''
Mr. Asfour first moved to the Bay Area in 1972 and had just returned in August 1988 after spending three years working for the bank in London.
''He had connections all over the world,'' said Mrs. Asfour, who is married to Mr. Asfour's brother, Sami. ''Anybody who knew Ramzi loved him.''
Mr. Asfour was also active in the Episcopalian Diocese of California and his local church, St. Francis of Assissi in Novato. This year, the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, Samir Kafity, a longtime friend, appointed Mr. Asfour as his representative in the Bay Area. Episcopal church officials here said Mr. Asfour raised funds for hospitals and schools in the occupied territories and spoke publicly on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
''It was done in the spirit of justice for the Palestinians,'' said the Rev. Mary Blair of St. Francis of Assisi.
''The few days before he died he was feeling especially upbeat, especially inspired,'' she said. '''He thought that he was doing exactly what he should be doing.''
Nobody remembered him as being concerned about earthquakes.
''He probably felt about earthquakes the way he felt about anything in life,'' said his friend and colleague, Jack Cooper, managing director of BankAmerica investment real estate. ''Ramzi would think that it was one of God's creations, the same as rain.''
Mr. Asfour's memorial service at St. Francis of Assisi in Novato was attended by 450 people, and his funeral Mass at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco drew 1,000.
He would have been 51 this past Monday, the day of the Mass. In her parting words at the service, his daughter, Zeina, said, ''Happy Birthday, Dad.''
 
Ray L. Holmes
Structural Engineer, 50
 
Born in Norfolk, Va. . . . married for 22 years to Tamara . . . daughters Tracy, 19; Holly, 18, and Christy, 9 . . . a structural engineer with Vickerman Zachary Miller in Oakland . . . lived in Mill Valley . . . died at the age of 50.
Ray L. Holmes's death amid the rubble of the Nimitz Freeway followed a career that often involved strengthening buildings so that they would withstand earthquakes.
One job a few years ago involved directing the seismic upgrading of two buildings of the International Business Machines Corporation in San Jose, a five-story 250,000-square-foot administration building and a two-story 200,000-square-foot development laboratory. I.B.M. officials said both buildings survived the earthquake unscathed.
''He was an expert in the seismic analysis and design of structures,'' said Ed Curran, vice president of the San Francisco company URS/John A. Blume & Associates, where Mr. Holmes had worked on the two buildings. Mr. Curran said he had lunch with Mr. Holmes a month ago and tried to woo him back.
Normally, Mr. Holmes worked until at least 5 P.M. But on Oct. 17 he left about 10 minutes early to watch his favorite team, the Giants, play in the World Series on television.
He was wearing the charm he thought would bring luck to his team, which had lost the first two games of the Series: boxer shorts emblazoned with the team logo. At the office, he had let colleagues take a peek by pulling the boxers up an inch above his belt.
A longtime friend and colleague, Leo Conoscente, described him as ''Mr. Sunshine.''
''He was an extremely gentle, kind and generous man,'' he said.
Mr. Conoscente said that Mr. Holmes took earthquakes ''very seriously'' in his work.
Personally, ''he was probably more blase about it, that there wasn't anything to worry about.''
But ''if he took that highway, he felt it was O.K. to drive on,'' Mr. Conoscente said.
 
Timothy Moss
Sales Manager, 40
 
Born in Ontario, Ore. . . . received a bachelor's degree from the University of Santa Clara in 1978 and master's in business administration and economics from Golden Gate University in 1985 . . . an administrative sales manager for Pacific Bell . . . died at the age of 40.
A few weeks ago Timothy Moss tried to find special screws to wire his bookshelves to a wall to keep them from falling in an earthquake.
Like many Californians, Mr. Moss understood that earthquakes are a part of life here. But he did not expect to die in one.
On Oct. 17, Mr. Moss's gray Acura Integra was one of the last cars to enter the freeway section that was crushed when the upper level collapsed.
''He never really had an attitude about earthquakes,'' said his brother, Tony, in a telephone interview from Payette, Idaho. ''He liked the city so much he didn't care about them. We would jokingly discuss them, like you do with people from California. But who could believe that he would be in such a wrong place at such a wrong time.''
Mr. Moss's family owns American Fine Foods Inc. in Payette, but he chose to live in San Francisco rather than take over the family's multimillion-dollar business.
A friend, Greg Mathews, said Mr. Moss loved the city's culture, its scenic views and its diversity. The two shared a two-story condominium with vaulted ceilings for two years, and they had prepared for a major earthquake by stocking supplies like bottled water, batteries and flashlights.
''Tim sort of felt that some of this stuff was in the way, but he went along with the program,'' Mr. Mathews said.
Mr. Moss had spent most of that Tuesday at a meeting he was not required to attend. When it adjourned, he hurried from the building, declined an invitation to go to a bar and rushed on to the Nimitz Freeway. He was not hurrying home to watch the World Series; he was trying to beat the traffic.
''Apparently he was the last car to drive into the section that collapsed,'' said Bruce Oliver, Mr. Moss's supervisor. ''If he had stopped to sneeze, he wouldn't have been there.''
 
Juan Daniel Luis Rubi
Installed Sunroofs, 28
 
Born in San Francisco . . . married for six years to Deanna, a machine operator at a baking company . . . 8-year-old twin sons, Juan and Daniel . . . an installer of car sunroofs . . . lived in San Francisco . . . died at the age of 28.
Juan Rubi checked in with his Daly City office at 4:45 P.M. He and a co-worker had just picked up a 1989 Chevrolet Camaro from a client in the East Bay city of San Leandro and were ready to head back to their place of work. Mr. Rubi was to drive the Camaro, which was to have a sunroof installed, and his colleague was to follow in another car.
''I'm on my way,'' Mr. Rubi said on the telephone.
Twenty minutes later, Mr. Rubi became one of the 39 victims buried in the rubble of the Nimitz Freeway. The co-worker, in an unwitting yet life-saving decision, stopped for gas and was spared.
In San Francisco, Mr. Rubi's family members rushed to reach one another in the chaos after the quake. Concern focused on Mr. Rubi's mother, Juana, who was feared trapped in a Bay Area Rapid Transit train somewhere under downtown San Francisco.
Mrs. Rubi showed up safely at her house at 8:15 that night. But her son never returned home.
''Nobody had worried about him,'' recalled his father, Daniel Rubi. ''He was a survivor.''
Mr. Rubi's body was recovered three days later. A collage of pictures his relatives put together for memorial services showed him as a family man with an especially broad smile when holding his twin sons. Mr. Rubi's funeral Mass on Tuesday at St. Peter's Church in San Francisco's Mission district featured a children's choir to which the twins belonged - but they did not sing.
His father said Mr. Rubi would pitch in when the twins, putting their allowances together and coming short, could not buy the latest video game.
''It was like they were little kids together,'' Daniel Rubi said. ''He always found time to play and stay with his kids.''
 
Vinh Phu
Automobile Mechanic, 32
 
 Born in Vietnam . . . married for 14 years to Mary, 32 . . . three children, Ivan, 13, Jimmy, 9, and Jenny, 6 . . . auto mechanic . . . died at the age of 32.
The family of Vin Phu, who was Chinese, fled the poverty of Vietnam in 1980 only to be confronted with tragedy in the Bay Area less than a decade later.
Two months ago, Mr. Phu moved his family from the cramped studio apartment they had shared in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco to a two-bedroom single-family house in Oakland.
With the three children still attending their old schools, Mr. Phu shuttled them back and forth across the bay as he commuted to the Show Place Garage in San Francisco, where he had worked for seven years.
On Oct. 17, his wife, Mary, came along for the ride. A friend in San Francisco had just given birth and Mrs. Phu wanted to spend the day with them, said a friend, Hana Ho.
School let out at 3 P.M. and the children met their mother at her friend's. At 4 P.M., Mr. Phu left work and picked up his family. Barely an hour later, the earthquake caught them on the upper deck of Interstate 880.
All survived but Mr. Phu. The three children, after being briefly hospitalized, are recovering from cuts and bruises at Mrs. Ho's home in Alameda. The daughter, Jenny, fractured her left arm. Mrs. Phu underwent hip and knee surgery Wednesday and is listed in fair condition at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland.
Mrs. Phu has yet to be told about her husband's death, Mrs. Ho said, but the children know.
''They are strong and brave,'' she said. ''They're doing very well.'' But Mrs. Ho and other friends worry about the application by Mr. Phu's parents to immigrate to the United States from Vietnam. Mrs. Ho said the couple, after years of waiting, were about to move here under their son's sponsorship.
''They're just waiting for a ticket,'' she said. ''We're afraid immigration will close the case. I hope they let the grandparents come here to take care of the children.''

HEADLINE: Japan Moves Toward Modest Aid for Poland

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Prodded by the United States and other Western democracies, Japan is moving cautiously toward approving a modest program of aid for Poland. It would be the first time that Tokyo has provided economic assistance to a nation in the Eastern bloc.
But despite its enormous financial resources and its status as the world's second-biggest aid donor, Japan is not expected to come up with anything more than a tiny fraction of the aid pledged for Poland by Western governments, officials here say. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is eager to announce an aid program soon, possibly visiting Poland and Hungary next year, the officials said, although the sums would probably be in the range of tens of millions of dollars. 
Japan's slow, almost tentative pace in aiding Poland is widely seen as a reflection of its continuing uncertainty about how far to go in translating its economic might into political power.
''A Polish aid program is a noble idea,'' an official said. ''But for it to be implemented, it must first be fully understood by the Japanese people. That will require a little bit of time. This is all part of our growing awareness of Japan's role as a global power.''
Officials say a Polish aid package, even if small, would entail a partial redirection of Japan's aid objectives, which until now have been defined as nonpolitical, emphasizing aid to poor countries in Asia. A debate is said to be raging in the Government, pitting the Foreign Ministry against officials in the Finance Ministry, over the wisdom of aiding Poland, and over how much Japan can afford at a time of deficits and charges of waste and mismanagement in foreign aid.
Under Japanese regulations for foreign aid, Poland and Hungary would not qualify as poor countries because of their higher per capita income and related indicators. To aid Poland, Japan would have to redefine the purposes of its program, a step that would open up a bureacratic disagreements.
The concerns are testimony to Japan's fear, a legacy of Japanese aggression in the first half of this century, that it might be seen as throwing its economic weight around in a menacing way. Tokyo officials are especially nervous about being seen as enlisting aggressively in East-West battles. Pressure From the U.S. Only after considerable pressure from the United States, for example, did Japan agree to step up its aid to Turkey and Pakistan, which are regarded by Washington as ''frontline states'' in the battle against Communism. While siding with the West in principle, many Japanese had long been uncomfortable with becoming involved directly in the cold war.
Now that great changes appear to be under way in the Eastern bloc, Japanese officials say they are still concerned about stirring resentment in the Soviet Union, with which Japan has many specific agreements and a dispute over Soviet possession of four northern islands claimed by Japan.
''Aiding Poland is something we should do to show our position a a major player among the Western nations,'' said a Government official in favor of aiding Poland. He added, ''This view is not necessarily shared by everyone in the Government.''
One measure of the sensitivity of the issue came this week when former President Ronald Reagan, at roughly mid-point in his nine-day visit here, called on Japan to use its financial resources to ''help save Poland.''
''Let no one doubt, this is a golden age for Japan,'' the former President declared in a speech Wednesday. But he then posed what he said was a personal question: ''What will be Japan's legacy? What will be said about Japan when the history of man is written?''
Emphasizing that he was not speaking for the United States Government, Mr. Reagan answered that Japan should join with the United States ''in a golden partnership for democracy in Poland and around the world.''
The comments made some officials nervous, however, because of a concern that they might strengthen the hand of opponents of aiding Poland, many of whom say Japan is already doing too much simply to accommodate the wishes of the United States.

HEADLINE: Effort to Repair an Old Project Lifts Tenants' Spirits (and Paintbrushes)

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Parishioners from middle-class churches in the Chicago area have been spending their weekends since July fixing abandoned apartments in a rundown public housing project where even the police are reluctant to venture after dark.
The efforts by the parishioners, most of the white, have already lifted spirits in the Cabrini-Green complex, inspiring tenants to pick up paintbrushes and rollers to cover walls that have not been touched in decades. The repair effort, which started modestly with a dozen volunteers and limited ambitions, has become an officially sanctioned experiment in restoration of both buildings and pride.
The program has also brought inspiration to the Chicago Housing Authority, which is expanding the volunteer effort to a public housing development across town. #41 Apartments Reclaimed ''I have never seen anything like this,'' said Gertte Smith, the tenant housing manager at Cabrini-Green. ''Suddenly everybody wants to know when the volunteers are going to come and fix up their buildings, and can they get some paint to do it themselves? I can't find anyone who can remember the last time anyone asked for a can of paint at Cabrini-Green.'' 
The ''Cabrini Alive'' effort took shape last summer at a church group in the Gold Coast neighborhood a few blocks east of Cabrini-Green on the North Side. Parishioners were looking for a way to improve relations with their neighbors.
Now groups of 70 to 100 volunteers, joined by a handful of tenants, gather each Saturday in two buildings that are watched by guards. So far they have reclaimed 41 apartments that had been made uninhabitable by gangs, vandals, drug dealers and squatters. The total work force is now about 500 people, including suburban volunteers.
 
'People Already Feel Safer'
Dave Koenig, a financial consultant who is a congregant of Trinity Lutheran Church in suburban Evanston, said he had made several trips to the Cabrini complex since July. ''To me this is the very essence of community, of being a good neighbor,'' said Mr. Koenig, whose face and hair were spattered with paint. ''I feel good about what I'm doing and know the people here do too, because a lot of them have come up and thanked me and told me so.''
Gracie Armstrong, who lives in the building and is the president of the tenants' organization, rolled paint onto a concrete ceiling in a fifth-floor stairwell last Saturday. ''Where we have painted, you don't see them covering it again with graffiti like they do in other buildings,'' she said. ''I know people already feel safer inside the building. Now it seems they don't want to spoil what's been fixed up either.''
Cabrini's towers are bleak fortresses near the affluent neighborhoods just north of downtown Chicago. The towers are home to more than 10,000 people, many of them black and almost all on some form of welfare.
They live scattered among 31 high-rise and 55 row-house buildings, which among them have 3,514 apartments; more than 1,400 apartments are unoccupied. To cut vandalism and crime, housing officials at Cabrini-Green have arranged to move tenants into the lower floors and have sealed off the top floors. The complex is plagued by drug dealers and gangs. Gunfire is a familiar sound. In that atmosphere, the church volunteers' progress is easily overlooked.
But at least 35 of the restored and repainted apartments are occupied by new families. Housing officials say they hope to fill all 140 units in the two buildings being worked on by the volunteers by the end of the year, said Melvin Brooks, who is coordinating the effort.
 
Dealers and Squatters Ousted
Before work began on the buildings they were cleared by the police of drug dealers and squatters, and guards were stationed at the doors to make sure only residents and guests got in. The buildings were each nearly a third empty, in spite of high demand for apartments and prospective tenants who wait as long as a year to be placed.
Although many volunteers admitted feeling uneasy before arriving at Cabrini-Green, none there last Saturday expressed fear. Officials say there has not been one troublesome incident since the volunteers started working in the summer.
Although it began with a small group of churches, the housing authority has now incorporated the idea of volunteer labor in public housing projects into a larger strategy to improve the lives of tenants.
 
'People Do Care'
''It is part of our effort to convince the tenants of public housing that people do care, that the whole community cares about them,'' said Vincent Lane, chairman of the authority. ''We are going to do it as best we can, even if it means doing just one family at a time, one building at a time.''
Mr. Lane said the effort would not have been possible before last December, when the buildings were cleared of the squatters, gang members and drug dealers. In office 16 months, he has had 16 such buildings around the city cleared out and secured with guards.
Robert McKay, executive director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, says Chicago is the first city to use volunteer labor on such a scale to help restore decaying public housing. ''What a great morale booster for the tenants,'' Mr. McKay said. ''It gives them a sense that they are not alone.''
Mr. Lane said he hoped to expand the program to other projects by the end of the year. He said he would seek to enlist other churches and civic organizations to supply not only labor but also baby sitting, day care and transportation for tenants.
As a result of the North Side example, more than 100 volunteers from a Baptist church in a southern suburb of Chicago where most of the members are black showed up at a South Side housing project, Altgeld Gardens, last Saturday and Sunday to begin repainting vacated apartments there.
 
Responses Came From All Over
The Cabrini-Green effort was organized by the Near North Side Ministerial Alliance, using a dozen church volunteers to clean and repaint only five units in one building, said the Rev. Ted Miller, an associate pastor at Fourth Presbyterian Church in Chicago. He said the volunteers have just kept growing.
Along with 15 city and suburban churches, labor was supplied by church networks from as far away as Texas and Oregon. This month a pastor at a Lutheran church in rural Flanagan, Ill., 90 miles southwest of Chicago, brought half a dozen young people in to work at Cabrini-Green.
Carl Bostrum, an official of Lutheran General Hospital, said the inspiration for the effort grew out of discussions about ways to improve contacts among the poor blacks and the affluent whites of the Near North Side. ''And then someone came from C.H.A. to talk about the sweeps'' - the police action - ''and we all hit on the idea of helping fix up some of the abandoned apartments,'' he said.
 
The Day Begins at 8:15
The volunteers show up at 8:15 A.M. on weekends, put on hard hats and fan out over the buildings. Some groups clean. Some install floor tiles. Some paint. It's an eight-hour shift.
On the second floor last Saturday, volunteers from Fourth Presbyterian Church painted walls and scoured grease off kitchen cabinets. Sharyl Hess, a manufacturer's representative, says she lives only five blocks from Cabrini-Green in an apartment on the Gold Coast.
''Yuppies get a bad rap, I know,'' said Ms. Hess, holding a dripping paintbrush.
''But I have helped tutor a young girl who lives here and I decided if there was some chance I could make her home better too, well, I ought to come on over here and do it.''

HEADLINE: Conference on Black Theology Unites Scholars and Pastors

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Black theology, a distinctive understanding of Christianity based on the religious experience of African Americans, was forged in the days of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the Vietnam War, but its proponents believe it is no less relevant in the days of President Bush, televangelism, Spike Lee and the crack epidemic.
And at a conference last week in Manhattan, more than 300 church leaders and scholars agreed, urging that the message of black theology be carried beyond the classrooms to the pews.
The conference was also meant to celebrate the 20th anniversary of a landmark book on black theology, but the organizers were embarrassed when the author declined to participate because of a misunderstanding.
 
'A Missing Link'
Organized by four New York City seminaries, the conference was intended to provide ''a missing link'' between the academically based black theologians and black church leaders ''in the trenches,'' said the Rev. Preston Washington, pastor of Memorial Baptist Church in Harlem and the head of the meeting's steering committee. 
The organizers said that while black theology has been well developed intelectually, its message still needs to be made relevant to black congregations.
Black theology emerged in the 1960's as both a criticism of white Christianity and a search for a black Christian identity. While the proponents of black theology accept the traditional Christian belief in Jesus as the Redeemer, they believe that His message to His followers today is one of freedom from oppression. Like Latin American liberation theologians, black theologians believe that Christianity demands engaging in the struggle for political, economic and racial equality. Black theology also teaches that blacks, by pressing their claims for equality, can redeem white Christianity from its sins of racial prejudice and economic exploitation.
 
Scholarship and Preaching
From the opening worship service last Monday evening at Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem, through three days of lectures and workshops at Riverside Memorial Church on the Upper West Side, the gathering comfortably mixed scholarship with Gospel singing and exuberant preaching.
''This is a momentous conference,'' said J. Deotis Roberts, one of the pioneers of black theology who teaches at Eastern Baptist Seminary in Philadelphia. ''Black theologians and black pastors haven't been together meeting for many years.''
The emergence of black theology is often dated to 1969 when ''Black Theology and Black Power,'' a book by James H. Cone, crystalized black dissatisfaction with the European and American theological currents then dominant.
 
Explanations Demanded
Last week's meeting was also supposed to mark the anniversary of Mr. Cone's book. Mr. Cone, the Briggs Distinguished Professor of Theology at Union Theological Seminary, was not there. Instead, he was teaching his classes only a few hundred yards away.
Because of Mr. Cone's absence, several black theologians decided not to participate in the conference. Some of his students handed out leaflets at the opening service, demanding explanations from the organizers as to why he was not a central part of the conference.
Both the organizers and Mr. Cone said that the problem began with the planning committee's failure to consult him early in its work. Conflicts with his teaching schedule were said to have defeated later efforts to assure his participation, but it was clear that injured feelings were a major factor.
 
'We Blew This One'
The meeting was sponsored by Union Theological Seminary, New York Theological Seminary, Auburn Theological Seminary and General Theological Seminary.
''We blew this one,'' Mr. Washington said. ''All of us are feeling a deep sense of pain.'' He said that Mr. Cone ''was my professor, and his book opened my mind to the possibility of being both black and Christian when I was growing up in Harlem.
Mr. Cone's black theology reflected the Black Power movement of the late 1960s in its determination to shake off the dominance of liberal Christian theologies and in its impatience with the integrationist perspective of Dr. King. But black theology also rejected the condemnation of Christianity as ''the white man's religion'' by Malcolm X and black nationalists.
Peter Paris, who teaches social ethics at Princeton Theological Seminary, described how black theologians used the Bible, black sermons, spirituals and blues to develop its themes.
 
'A New Black Ecumenism'
More recently, Mr. Roberts said, black theology has begun to incorporate the perspectives of black women and biblical scholars. It has produced ''a new black ecumenism,'' he said, and made contact with third-world theologians, especially in Africa.
Indeed, female preachers and biblical scholars played prominent roles at the conference as did black Roman Catholics. Sister Jamie Phelps, a black nun who teaches at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, said that black Catholics ''find ourselves in the margins twice - white Catholics don't take us seriously and black Protestants don't either.'' She told the conference:
''I come to you as a black Catholic sister and theologian, your sister in blackness, your sister in struggle, your colleague in trying to think out what is the meaning of God in these times, times that are deadly.''
Although the mood of the conference was decidedly upbeat, neither black theology nor the black churches escaped criticism.
 
A Warning of a Chasm
Bishop Ithiel Clemmons, who heads one of the eastern New York districts of the 3.7 million-member Church of God in Christ, warned of a growing ''chasm between the black church pews and the black church pulpit.'' Black middle-class religious and political leadership often shares a ''vacillation about right and wrong'' that ''does not sit well'' with the working people in the pews, he said.
Reflecting the Pentecostalism of his denomination, Bishop Clemmons criticized black theology for ''playing down the role of the Holy Spirit in the world.''
Interviewed by telephone, Mr. Cone said: ''The black church has produced outstanding preachers ranking with any in the world, but the church hasn't produced theologians of equal quality. Without strong theology, preaching becomes entertainment, and there is a tendency to make church life center around the preacher.''
Mr. Cone, who acknowledged that ''some see me as going too far in my critique,'' has denounced black churches and denominations for being authoritarian and complacent and for excluding women from leadership. ''It's easy for the black church to be critical of the white church, but it also has to be critical of itself,'' he said.
Speakers at the conference did not match the sweeping denunciations of white America found in Mr. Cone's book 20 years ago, but referring to rates of poverty, drug abuse, violence and unemployment among blacks, they sharply questioned the values of the society.
''In some respects,'' Mr. Roberts said, ''we've gone backwards in this decade, and racism itself has become more insidious. If our people are to survive,'' he added, ''it will be largely due to how well the black church carries out its mission.''

HEADLINE: Milwaukeeans Seek to Stem Rising Violence

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Earlier this month the city broke its record of 95 homicides in a year, set in 1987. This year, one of drive-by shootings, drug-running and nightly gunfire, is being called the year of 100 murders.
''We started on New Year's morning with two drug-related homicides and it hasn't stopped since,'' Police Capt. George W. Hegerty said. Last week the police logged the 100th homicide of the year. The number rose to 101 Sunday night when a 24-year-old man was shot to death in his car on a North Side street. 
''There's only been two weeks this year when we didn't have a homicide reported,'' Captain Hegerty said. ''I was hoping the numbers would drop off, but they keep going up.''
 
Citizens Taking a Hand
Milwaukeeans who had treasured their ethnic neighborhoods, clean streets and tradition of progressive government are mobilizing to turn back the violence.
Many neighborhoods are forming watch groups. Some individuals are taking it on themselves to call the police when they see drug dealing or other illegal activity, said Alderwoman Marlene E. Johnson, who represents an inner-city ward.
''There have been a lot of busts lately, and many of those have been due to citzen alerts,'' she said. ''The key is the people in the community saying, 'Hey, this is enough of this.' ''
In fact, except for a drop last year, the number of murders has been climbing since 1985 despite a decline in city population that started at least two decades ago. There were 73 murders in 1985, 85 in 1986, 95 in 1987 and 73 in 1988. The latest population estimate of about 600,000 in January 1988 was down by about 36,000 from the 1980 census total.
Drugs get much of the blame for the increase in killings. At least 12 of this year's homicides have been directly linked to drug activity, Captain Hegerty said.
Sometimes, the killer fires a gun from a car in a drive-by shooting, then speeds away. The police have linked three drive-by shootings last summer to Milwaukee gangs, including one that killed a 30-year-old man standing outside a tavern less than a block from his house.
 
'We Ought to Be Alarmed'
Karen Hendrickson sadly remembers different Halloweens. ''When we were kids, we went out when it was dark and our parents let us have the run of the neighborhood,'' she said. ''We would never let that happen today. We ought to be alarmed by that.'' The problem goes deeper than drugs, to poverty and racial discrimination, which keep minorities unemployed, Ms. Hendrickson and others say. ''Give people a better environment to live in and give them something constructive to do, then you'll see a turnaround,'' said the Rev. LeHavre Buck, director of Harambee, an organization seeking to improve city dwellers' lives.

HEADLINE: Appointments Worry Environmentalists

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
President Bush won applause when he chose William K. Reilly, a career conservationist, as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. But since then the President's choices for top environmental jobs have raised questions among some preservation groups and lawmakers about Mr. Bush's commitment to protecting the environment.
With a few exceptions, the appointments have been dominated by people sympathetic to development interests in the West and with few environmental credentials. In some cases, the appointees have been derided by conservationists as ''Watt clones,'' referring to James G. Watt, the Reagan Administration's Secretary of the Interior who sold off public lands and encouraged development of natural resources in wilderness areas. 
''At best, it's a mixed record,'' David Alberswerth, a National Wildlife Federation official, said of Mr. Bush's appointments. ''At worst, it's somewhat of a disappointment for someone who is presenting himself as an environmental President.''
 
'Nomination Sends a Signal'
The latest example, and the one that has drawn the greatest fire, is that of James E. Cason, an Interior Department official and former real estate developer who is under Senate consideration as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment. Conservationists say he is inclined to business interests at the expense of the environment and the taxpayer.
''The Cason nomination sends a signal that the Administration will not administer the environmental laws as they were intended to be administered,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee, which is handling the Cason nomination.
A White House spokesman, Stephen T. Hart, defended Mr. Bush's appointments, calling the nominees ''people of quality.''
''What's happening here,'' he said, ''is you have a President with a good environmental record and some people out there aren't able to accept that.''
Conservationists have praised two nominations in addition to Mr. Reilly's: those of Michael R. Deland, the former New England regional director of the Environmental Protection Agency, to head the Council on Environmental Quality, and John Turner, a former Wyoming legislator and wildlife ecologist, to direct the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
Some conservationists also say they have more access to Government officials than in the Reagan Administration. But they suspect that the development-oriented Reagan agenda has only been repackaged.
 
An Uncomfortable Mandate
That conclusion is drawn from nominations like Mr. Cason's, as well as major ones in the Interior Department, beginning with the Secretary, Manuel Lujan Jr., and including Cy Jamison, Director of the Bureau of Land Management, and James M. Ridenour, Director of the National Park Service.
The Interior Department has always had to balance conservation with development of natural resources and has frequently been accused of favoring business interests. Senator Tim Wirth, a Colorado Democrat active on environmental issues, said the Cason and Interior Department appointments reflect Mr. Bush's view that public lands exist to be exploited for natural resources rather than managed for a broader constituency.
''Public lands are bringing back to the state of Colorado and the West, through fishing, skiing, hunting, rafting and hunting, greater economic return than the narrow exploitative interests, particularly when they have to be subsidized by the taxpayer,'' Mr. Wirth said in an interview.
 
'No Chance' of Persuasion
Mr. Lujan, a New Mexico Republican, served in the House of Representatives and its Interior Committee 20 years, and has a history of representing ranchers and the timber industry.
But while environmental groups were dissatisfied with his nomination, they did not wage much of a fight because there was ''no chance of persuading a single senator to vote against him,'' said George T. Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society. The Senate usually gives Presidents wide latitude in nominations. Mr. Lujan was confirmed 100 to 0.
Mr. Frampton said that under Mr. Lujan the Reagan Administration's pro-development agenda has proceeded mostly unfettered.
But an Interior Department spokesman, Steve Goldstein, said the Secretary had tried to be conciliatory. ''Do environmentalists like every decision we make?'' he asked. ''No. But neither do the developers.''
Far more than their boss, Mr. Jamison and Mr. Ridenour are viewed by many conservationists as outright hostile to their concerns.
As director of the land bureau, Mr. Jamison is responsible for almost 300 million acres of public land, including some of the nation's most spectacular scenery.
He served briefly as a legislative liaison for Mr. Watt and for eight years was an aide to Representative Ron Marlenee on public-lands issues. Conservationists say Mr. Marlenee, Republican of Montana, is one of Congress's leading anti-environmentalists. His spokesman, Dan DuBray, said the Congressman believes that public lands should be considered for all possible uses, not just ''locked up'' for recreation.
 
No Record on Which to Focus
Since Mr. Jamison had never held a formal policymaking position, conservationists who opposed his nomination were unable to focus on his record in Senate confirmation hearings. Terry Sopher, who follows the bureau for the Wilderness Society, said that on the basis of Mr. Jamison's contributions to Mr. Marlenee's ''strong anti-wilderness policies'' there was no reason to doubt that Mr. Jamison shared his employer's views.
Mr. Jamison responded, ''You represent the people you work for.'' He said he is now representing the the Bush Administration's views, which are more sensitive to environmental concerns.
He also said he wants ''to keep our relationship with traditional users'' but give equal weight to conservationists whose interests had been neglected. For example, he said, he has proposed additional money for fish and wildlife and recreation programs.
The Senate confirmed Mr. Jamison's nomination on June 26 by a voice vote.
Mr. Ridenour, whose nomination as national parks director did not require Senate confirmation, served eight years as director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Some Indiana environmentalists called him ''the James Watt of Indiana,'' saying he cared little about preserving the state's remaining wilderness areas and favored aggressive development of public lands.
But Mr. Ridenour said his environmental record is strong, including setting aside more nature preserves and wilderness area than any previous director of the Indiana agency. He surprised conservation groups on Tuesday by rejecting a proposal by the United States Forest Service that would have allowed the hauling of logs along the narrow roads of Yellowstone National Park.
 
Sharply Divided Committee
But of all the appointments, Mr. Cason's, pending since March, has aroused the most concern. He would be responsible for the Forest Service and the Soil Conservation Service.
On Oct. 19 the Senate Agriculture Committee voted, 12 to 7, to confirm Mr. Cason, three Democrats joining nine Republicans, but Senator Leahy said he would continue the fight on the Senate floor.
Conservationists say Mr. Cason's record as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management in the Interior Department shows numerous examples of favoring business interests over conservation concerns while costing the taxpayers millions of dollars.
Opponents say he strongly supported Interior Department decisions to resume selling Federal shale oil land for below-market costs. Mr. Cason said he was carrying out existing law because Congress had failed to revise it, but Mr. Lujan later imposed a moratorium on the sales.
At a recent Agriculture Committee hearing, Mr. Cason pledged to do ''a good job of conservation'' and to weigh the views of all constituencies.

GRAPHIC: William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose appointment by President Bush was praised by conservationists (AP); James E. Cason is under Senate consideration as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment, and is said by conservationists to be unfit for the job.

HEADLINE: In Nuclear Cleanup, Costs Grow and Promise Fades

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST VALLEY, N.Y.

 BODY:
Engineers arrived here in 1982 to begin cleaning up a factory that once processed nuclear waste. Their task was to employ a pioneering technology: remove hundreds of thousands of gallons of radioactive liquids and sludge from an aging storage tank and make the radioactive materials safe from spills or leaks by mixing them with cement or glass.
The job was expected to cost $400 million and take six to eight years to complete. But almost eight years into the cleanup, the work is at least six years from completion and the cost estimate is up to $890 million. Meanwhile, the amount of work needed to make West Valley safe seems to be growing.
The West Valley project will be repeated at cleanups elsewhere. The United States Department of Energy faces this problem - what to do with wastes that will be radioactive for millenniums but are stored in tanks designed to last only decades - at two plants that manufacture nuclear bombs: the Savannah River site, near Aiken, S.C., and the Hanford reservation, near Richland, Wash., where even larger volumes are stored. 
 
A Nuclear Edsel
Only the passing of years will reduce the radiation, but engineers say they can stabilize the material so it will stay put until time does its work. The job, which will cost billions of dollars, was described by one official here as producing a ''quality waste product.''
But as the liquids here are solidified, attention is turning to another environmental challenge: wastes that have been dumped in shallow trenches and holes, for which no cleanup strategy has been chosen.
West Valley is a nuclear Edsel. The plant processed used fuel from commercial and Government reactors, sorting it into components and recycling unused uranium and plutonium which was used in bombs and reactors. The plant became a business failure, and the simple recycling vision of the early 1960's produced a technological nightmare for the late 1980's.
Now Government officials and contractors are striving, amid disagreements with environmentalists, to avoid doing something in cleaning up West Valley that could be a nightmare for the next century.
 
'Peeling Away the Layers'
Not all the waste was in tanks. A current nightmare involves the trenches where solid waste has been buried. Not even certain of what is there, planners here speak of their surveys with metal detectors, surveillance wells and sniffing tools as an attempt to ''raise the confidence level'' about their knowledge of what is underground and what may be leaking out.
The official in charge here, Willis W. Bixby of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a contractor, described part of what has been accomplished here as ''peeling away the layers of the onion.''
The stark concrete building in which the used fuel was reprocessed has beds of impatiens and geraniums in front. All around it are workers who have reduced the building's contamination so that more of its space can be used in the solidification operation. They are working toward tearing the factory down and restoring the entire 3,000-acre site, a job that could double the current $890 million budget.
The plant was lured to western New York by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to help bolster the area's economy, and built for $32 million. It operated for six years, until it closed for modifications in 1972. It never reopened, partly because the Government insisted on earthquake precautions and the owners decided that they would be too expensive.
Its legacy was 600,000 gallons of wastes that will be radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years, in a tank designed to last for 40.
 
Monitored for Moisture
Last year Westinghouse began pumping out the liquid and filtering out most of the radioactivity, then using the liquid in place of water to make the first of 15,000 cement blocks. Each is mixed with meticulous care in a square steel barrel and labeled with a striped bar code like those found on cereal boxes to record its singular pedigree.
It is gingerly stacked by a robot crane in a storage building that humans observe through video cameras, and which sensing instruments assure is warm so the cold does not interfere with the curing of the cement. It is monitored for moisture to prevent water from dissolving the mixture.
In two years, if there is enough money, the most radioactive sludge will be mixed with melted glass, in steel containers. It is not clear what will happen to the glass logs, which are meant to join the rest of the nation's spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository that the Department of Energy and its predecessors dating back to the Atomic Energy Commission have been trying to establish for decades. The cement barrels may go to a different repository, or may stay.
In either case, Westinghouse officials emphasize that they are producing a ''quality waste product.'' This, in fact, may be an achievement: at other Department of Energy sites, improperly mixed cement blocks collapsed, allowing radioactive material to wash away in the rain.
 
Audits and Investigations
The handling of hazardous chemicals here was the subject of an audit, released last week, by a team of specialists from Washington, who decided that Westinghouse should pay as much attention to chemicals as it does to radiation, but found relatively few faults. A team of F.B.I. agents visited the site in July but it is not clear if any crimes were found.
Meanwhile, wastes produced in the cleanup job itself are piling up. Under an agreement with environmentalists, the wastes are being temporarily stored in barrels and boxes stacked in tent-like buildings of plastic-coated fabric. But as the project drags on, engineers are evaluating whether those buildings will last long enough.
While the price of the solidification project here has risen and budget cuts have stretched out the completion, important progress is being made; tough technical problems seem to be yielding to patience, skill and money. Simply changing the form of the waste is a major step forward, experts agree.
But it is only one step, as Carol Mongerson, a leading critic, pointed out. ''All they are doing is turning radioactive waste into radioactive waste,'' she said.
 
Tanks Filled With Clay
With the solidification of the most radioactive materials now in sight, attention is turning to the burial ground, which has already leaked. Recently, Westinghouse found kerosine, a chemical used in the reprocessing, escaping from one hole, and had to exhume eight tanks. The tanks were filled with crushed clay, resembling kitty litter, meant to hold the kerosine in place, and the tanks were sealed with duct tape; neither method proved effective.
More problems wait underground. Much of the material reprocessed at West Valley and eventually finding its way into the waste tank was highly radioactive fuel from a Government reactor in Hanford, Wash., but one fuel load was ruptured too badly to process.
Rather than send it back, operators buried it in concrete here, in a hole about 50 feet deep, in wet soil. Spent fuel is supposed to be disposed of in a deep geologic repository, and a multibillion-dollar search is under way to find a suitable spot.
A much larger disposal area is loosely filled with boxes and barrels of wastes in trenches that may be 60 percent empty. That allows the soil above to collapse, and water to enter, and water is the agent that carries radioactive material into the environment.
And while the largest portion of the dump is described as suitable for ''low-level'' waste, its 2.4 million cubic feet of wastes include a hodgepodge that would never be allowed in such a repository now.
 
Subject to Erosion
The site itself would probably not pass muster. West Valley is in an area of heavy rainfall that environmentalists say is prone to underground water flow. It is also subject to erosion. The burial trenches end at a ravine, which a brook is gradually expanding toward the wastes.
''You cannot walk away from the site for the long term - eventually you would lose the end of the trenches,'' said Theodore K. De Boer, the program director for radioactive-waste management of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
The long term means several centuries.
The state agency is paying 10 percent of the cost of cleaning up the high-level waste, with the Federal Government paying the rest, but the state has sole custody of a large part of the burial ground. It is not clear what the solution is, since digging up the wastes would involve substantial exposure of workers to radiation, and as of now, there is no place to re-bury the wastes.
The cost would be horrendous. ''It boggles the mind to think what it would take to dig that up,'' Ms. Mongerson said.
In the interim, the state periodically pumps out the water that gradually fills the burial trenches, to prevent it from running out freely. Past practice was to dump that water into a lagoon and let the radioactive contaminants drain into the soil, so now that, too, is a candidate for cleanup.
To guard the burial ground, a chain-link fence surrounds it. For good measure, the fence is protected by a pair of horseshoes.

HEADLINE: Six Candidates Seek Ears, Not Votes

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
The Libertarian Party candidate for mayor of New York City runs his one-man campaign organization out of his midtown Manhattan stockbroker's office, where he writes his own literature - ''I'm anti-big government'' - photocopies it and mails it out.
The New Alliance Party candidate is campaigning, she says, for ''fair elections,'' and also for one of her opponents, David N. Dinkins.
And the best known of the six minor-party candidates for mayor is the least visible: Ronald S. Lauder, of the Conservative Party, is in Europe on business, and, his spokesman said, he will not be back till the end of the month.
''It is clear at this point that one of the two front-runners will be mayor of New York City,'' said the Lauder spokesman, Nelson Warfield. 
 
Other Reasons for Running
With the public's attention focused on Mr. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani in their last frantic weeks of campaigning, the six minor-party mayoral candidates have largely gone unnoticed, not least because none expects to win. Indeed, they are not in the race to win, anyway. Most are in it mainly to put across ideas that they say the major-party candidates are not expressing.
Henry R. Hewes, the Right to Life Party candidate, is perhaps second to Mr. Lauder in public recognition. He has probably been trying the hardest of the six to raise his profile, calling newspapers and speaking at dinners and church meetings. He is campaigning not only against abortion on demand but on the broader theme of a city suffering from moral decay.
Mr. Lauder, however, the cosmetics-company executive who ran an aggressive, high-spending but unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination, has all but dropped from public view since he stayed in the race under the Conservative flag.
Mr. Lauder, 45 years old, spent $13.7 million of his own money on his Republican primary campaign and still owes $400,000. But since Sept. 13, the day after the primary, his Conservative campaign has spent $420,000. He has also closed his offices in all five boroughs, has kept only one political consultant and has reduced his staff to 10 people from 25.
 
Weekly Letter on Conservatism
Mr. Lauder's spokesman, Mr. Warfield, said that until the election Mr. Lauder's campaigning would consist of issuing a weekly ''white letter'' to the press outlining his party's platform. The aim is to bring conservative ideas into the general campaign, Mr. Warfield said.
As stated in one ''white letter,'' Mr. Lauder would ''run New York City like a business,'' slash the bureaucracy, cut administrative costs, lower taxes and turn municipal services over to private hands. He supports women's rights to abortions but is against government financing of abortions.
''The people voting for us on Nov. 7 probably wouldn't bother to vote if the choice was just between the two front-runners,'' Mr. Warfield said.
Mr. Hewes is dedicating most of his time to trying to drum up press coverage. He said he had spent 50 percent of his time calling reporters and $1,000 of his own money on the campaign. The rest of his financing comes from the national Right to Life Party; party workers said they were unable to supply figures on how much.
Mr. Hewes, 40, runs his campaign from his office on Madison Avenue with a staff of six to eight volunteers. He says he is more conservative than Mr. Giuliani, is opposed to abortion and sex education in schools and wants the mayor's office to aggressively advocate the protection of fetuses. He also agrees that winning is not everything.
 
Message to Next Mayor
''If we were concerned who won or who lost,'' Mr. Hewes said, ''we could dissolve the Republican Party in the city.'' Describing abortion as a ''very hot'' issue, Mr Hewes believes his campaign will send a strong message to the next mayor, and he believes the next mayor will be Mr. Dinkins.
Mr. Dinkins, a Democrat, has lately been an unlikely source of exposure for Mr. Hewes. Mr. Dinkins has repeatedly asserted that he will not debate Mr. Giuliani unless Mr. Hewes, along with Mr. Lauder, are invited to join in. That would be an undesirable prospect for Mr. Giuliani, whose Conservative credentials and his recently adopted position favoring a woman's right to choose an abortion would almost certainly be questioned by the two men. Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, is also running on the Liberal Party line.
The four other minor-party candidates are independents and, like Mr. Hewes and Mr. Lauder, are not participating in public financing. Each party had to collect at least 7,500 signatures to be on the mayoral ballot.
 
Libertarian Runs Own Campaign
Warren L. Raum, the Libertarian candidate and stockbroker who handles all his own campaign tasks, describes himself as a conservative Republican on economic issues but a liberal Democrat on personal ones.
''I'm for personal freedom and anti-big government,'' said Mr. Raum, who is 31. The party advocates making government enterprises and schools private, cutting taxes, ending rent control, dismantling the welfare system and phasing out Social Security. Mr. Raum considers abortion a personal religious issue, is against school prayer and advocates the legalization of drugs.
Leonore B. Fulani, 39, a child developmental psychologist, is running on the New Alliance line. Members claim that the New Alliance, which was founded 10 years ago in New York, is the nation's fastest growing party. Dr. Fulani said the party's membership stood at 20,000 in 1987. Critics contend that the party's politics are hazy.
Dr. Fulani ran for mayor in 1985, receiving 7,597 votes, or 0.6 percent of the 1,170,904 votes cast. She also ran for President in 1988, gathering 0.24 percent of the national vote. The Libertarian Party candidate received 0.47 percent of the votes cast.
 
'Issues of the Black Agenda'
Dr. Fulani was angered by Mr. Dinkins's refusal to hold a joint signature-gathering drive during the Democratic primary campaign and accused him of blatantly wooing the Jewish vote. But she said that despite their differences, she was campaigning for Mr. Dinkins.
Dr. Fulani remains in the race because she believes it is important to ''speak the issues of the black agenda.'' In an interview, she argued strongly that housing, education and health care should be basic rights, but she offered no new programs. She said instead that the prime issue was ''fair elections.''
James E. Harris Jr., 41, a former auto worker, describes himself as a full-time candidate from the Socialist Workers Party. He campaigns, he said, in public meetings and through his party's paper, ''The Militant.''
Fred Mazelis is the Worker's League candidate. He could not be reached and did not answer a telegram.

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: Harvard;
Two Fraternities Set Up Operations Near a Campus

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The Dean of Students says Harvard University does not have a fraternity program. Two such groups, however, exist off campus.
This month 38 members were initiated into the Lambda colony of Sigma Alpha Mu. The president, Jon Brisman, a senior from Teaneck, N.J., majoring in history and science, thought about starting a fraternity over the summer and chose Sigma Alpha Mu because ''all my friends were in Sammy and they enjoyed it.'' The fraternity was preceded by a chapter of Zeta Psi, which was chartered in 1987. 
No national social fraternity has been on campus since the 1930's. But even then the university did not have the fraternity system of today. Many societies did not have national affiliations, and those that did were often classified in the club system. The club system has existed since the late 18th century. The organizations invited members in their sophomore years.
 
Nine Clubs Off Campus
Many so-called final clubs actually formed in the 19th century out of national fraternities like Alpha Delta Phi and Delta Epsilon. Nine final clubs remain off campus; the university severed ties with them in 1984.
Fraternities were classified as waiting clubs, a less-elite version, and were severely restricted in 1928, by limits on recruiting and advertising. In a few years, all the fraternities left, when Harvard was developing its house system. After their freshman years, most students live, eat and socialize in their house.
The social chairman of Sigma Alpha Mu, Richard Geyser, a history major from Tempe, Ariz., said, ''My social life is much better now,'' adding that the group had been meeting in restaurants and planned to rent space for larger events.
Most people socialize through their extracurricular activities, Mr. Brisman said, adding:
''The inference is that we're all going to be friends, and I don't see that as possible in a house with 400 other people. I think there is a severe need for social clubs on campus.''
 
Open Rushes Planned
For the final clubs, men have to receive invitations in order to have a chance to become a member. The fraternities have open rushes.
Members said Sigma Alpha Mu would conduct open rushes. ''We are looking for people we enjoy being with, and that cuts across any social, economic, religious or ethnic barriers,'' Mr. Geyser said.
Neither the fraternities nor final clubs allow women to be members. One final club, the Fly Club, is being sued in a sexual-discrimination case.
Mr. Geyser said that ''outside of Harvard, this wouldn't be an issue'' and that by becoming coeducational the chapter lose its charter. Fraternities and sororities have had their rights to remain single-sex upheld by the courts, Mr. Brisman said.
A charter member of Zeta Psi, Daniel Ramos, a junior from Valencia, Calif., majoring in government, recalled how his group started. ''Some people from the grand chapter in New York City came up here and recruited us,'' he said. ''Thirteen or 15 of us said, 'We'll give it a shot.' ''
Fraternity leaders did not indicate interest in replacing the house system. ''Most people don't want to live off campus,'' Mr. Geyser said. Mr. Brisman said he ''wouldn't want to see the house system fall apart.''
''I've never been to a meeting before where suddenly you meet 40 other guys,'' said a member of Sigma Alpha Mu, Gregory Pulier, a senior from Teaneck, N.J., who has majoring in physics. ''It happens to be a bunch of guys having fun.''

Gambling Den Off Campus Shut, Austin Police Say

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
When vice squad officers raided a suspected gambling den near the University of Texas, the ring was said to be handling $100,000 a weekend in sports bets.
The suspects are Adam David Don, 20 years old, a junior in business administration from Highland Park, Ill.; Dan Anthony Sachnowitz, 21, a junior economics major from Longview, and Christopher John Trapp, 23, of Memphis, who graduated in August with a major in finance.
Senior Sgt. Byron Cates of the vice squad said that on Monday, the night of the raid, the den took in $3,000 in bets in 30 minutes from students and others. The police said they found ledgers and betting slips, many with students' names, and detailed wagering transactions in the apartment north of the campus. The officers also seized telephones and four cars. 
The officers said the suspects faced 2- to 20-year prison terms and $10,000 fines, if they are convicted on their second-degree felony charges. Mr. Don was also charged with engaging in organized crime by promotion of gambling. The others were charged with engaging in organized crime by maintaining a gambling place.
''If something like this doesn't stop people from betting, I don't know what will,'' said Gregory Mann, a senior from El Paso majoring in finance and real estate. Mr. Mann is a member of the same fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu, as Mr. Don and Mr. Sachnowitz.
''I never heard anything that would have made me think twice about them,'' he said. ''They are really sharp guys, and the types you expect to excel in the future.
''Anytime people find out someone is in your fraternity they think the whole fraternity is involved. We didn't know anyting about it.''
An assistant dean of students, Gage Paine, said the incident would not affect the students' standing. Because the incident was off campus, she said school officials would not investigate the case, adding, ''We don't look into off-campus incidents, unless it involves hazing.''
Some students said finding ways to place bets would not be difficult. ''If you talk to people, I'm sure you could find someone to take your bet,'' said Daniel Friedman, a junior in government from St. Louis. ''A chance to win money is something some people can't pass up.''

HEADLINE: THEATER;
For a Bit of a Gamble, Meet Them in St. Louis

BYLINE: By PATRICK PACHECO; Patrick Pacheco is a freelance writer who specializes in the arts.

 BODY:
In South Africa in 1959 one would hardly have expected to find the American musical thriving, much less splashing in the rain that Louis Burke and Joan Brickhill concocted for their revival of Gershwin's ''Lady Be Good'' that year. Yet musicals and dramas with such special effects as Borzois, chariots, 45-foot sequined cloaks, shipwrecks and flying Ariels became the trademarks of this married couple who eventually mounted more than 80 productions in their native country. Doing triple and even quadruple duty as directors, choreographers, designers and actors, they were known as ''the King and Queen of South African theater'' before Mr. Burke abdicated to immigrate to America in 1984.
That extravagant Brickhill-Burke style is currently on view at the Gershwin Theater in the new Broadway musical ''Meet Me in St. Louis,'' based on the 1944 Vincente Minnelli-Judy Garland film classic and the Sally Benson New Yorker short stories that inspired it. Accompanied by the popular songs of Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, the domestic adventures of a St. Louis family at the turn of the century is the motor driving this $6 million production. It opens Thursday with a cast of 35, including George Hearn, Charlotte Moore, Betty Garrett and Milo O'Shea. 
True to form, Miss Brickhill and Mr. Burke have garlanded the seasonal vignettes with fountains, sumptuous costumes, fireworks, a five-ton ice-skating rink and, of course, a trolley that goes clang-clang-clang. According to the producers, almost $3 million has been spent on the physical production, designed by Keith Anderson. Mr. Burke is also credited as director and Miss Brickhill as choreographer in this production, which marks their American debut.
''The challenge was to take this enchanting family story and embellish it without overwhelming it,'' says Mr. Burke, sitting with his wife of 30 years in the study of their rented East Side apartment, the temporary headquarters of Brickhill-Burke Productions.
The Burkes say their talents have always been directed toward the realm of light musicals and comedies and classic English theater. Their own families had come out of that cultural tradition in South Africa; Mr. Burke's mother danced with Anna Pavlova's company and his great-aunt was a founding member of a repertory company.
The Burkes say their reasons for immigrating to the United States were less political than artistic and economic. They felt isolated in South Africa as the international boycotts grew. Also, their runs ''were getting shorter and shorter,'' says Miss Brickhill, as their audience shrank because of white flight. After 25 years of producing in South Africa, they decided it was time to move to Broadway. London might have been the more logical choice, but their experience, emphasizes Mr. Burke, is in American musicals.
Nonetheless, when Mr. Burke came to New York to pave the way for the move, he says he found ''doors slammed in my face, right, left and center'' because Broadway producers had not seen his work. It took two years of byzantine negotiations to secure the stage rights for ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' - complicated by the sale of the M-G-M film library to Turner Broadcasting and a legal tangle between Sally Benson's heirs and the Actors' Fund - and another three years to obtain financing. During that time, Mr. Burke taught acting and lived out of a cramped West Side apartment while his wife worked in South Africa.
Mr. Burke's angel for ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' finally came in the form of EPI Products, a family-owned health and beauty aids company that has put up a large share of financing. Members of the family, the Kroks, who immigrated to California from South Africa 10 years ago, had seen the Burkes' productions there. It is the first theatrical venture for EPI, a company with domestic sales of $250 million a year. But the three sisters who run the company thought that the show, with its emphasis on wholesome family values, would serve as a good promotional tie-in. They also felt, says a co-producer, Christopher Seabrooke, a businessman who is responsible for their involvement, that a musical that features ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' would augur well for a commercial run at this time of year.
Mr. Seabrooke says there is only American money invested in the production. ''There is no South African investment for obvious political reasons,'' he says. ''It would've been impossible at any rate. The amount of rands [the South African currency] an individual is allowed to take out of the country is the equivalent of approximately $95,000 per year.''
While many insiders, Mr. Burke says, warned him away from ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' as a risky enterprise because it was ''old hat and slight,'' he was convinced it was the right choice for the Brickhill-Burke calling card. Although the producer-director says he has as many as 10 projects in the works - including ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' with Mickey Rooney - the musical was simply the first one out of the gate. ''The show is about family, which has a universal and enduring appeal,'' he says, adding that he didn't think it was ''all that risky'' to start with a score that includes perennial favorites like ''The Boy Next Door'' and ''The Trolley Song.''
''It is an American classic because the film was so beautiful, done with great style and finesse. I wanted to keep those elements while reinventing the story to capture the excitement onstage,'' he says.
To that end, Hugh Blane and Ralph Martin have added 10 new songs to the score. Ironically, Mr. Burke says that he wanted to ''open up'' the musical even more, using a term usually reserved for stage musicals that become movies, not vice versa. As an example, the director notes that, in the film, the ''Trolley Song'' consisted largely of close-ups of Judy Garland. Here, the number is rendered as a misty dream sequence taking advantage of the Gershwin Theater's enormous stage.
In the reconstruction, the director says that he was immeasurably aided by Hugh Wheeler, the veteran musical book writer (''Sweeney Todd,'' ''A Little Night Music''), who died nine months into the project.
''Although we fought and argued about many things,'' Mr. Burke said, ''Hugh agreed that the star of this production had to be the entire Smith family.''
When the film was released, the critic James Agee said, ''The real love story is between a happy family and a way of living.'' It was this aspect of the current production that enticed George Hearn. The actor, who won a Tony Award for his drag queen, Albin, in ''La Cage aux Folles,'' plays a Victorian martinet in charge of an independent brood, which includes a doting wife (Charlotte Moore), a jig-happy Irish grandpa (Milo O'Shea), a crusty maid (Betty Garrett) and four daughters, including little Tootie (Courtney Peldon), who decapitates dolls and entombs them in a backyard cemetery, and naive Esther (Donna Kane), who primps for the boy next door.
''I suppose you could call this a fantasy,'' says Mr. Hearn in his dressing room. ''But as dreams go, it's not a bad one and one we could use a lot more of these days given the drug problem and the disintegration of the family.'' I absolutely think there is a place on Broadway for this type of show along with 'Les Miz' and 'Phantom.' ''
Brickhill-Burke's five-year struggle to gain a toehold in New York theater was made all the more difficult by what the couple refer to as ''an accident of birth.'' As white South Africans, their claim to be ''not political'' was somewhat incompatible with the international image of South African theater largely shaped through the politically charged works of Athol Fugard ('' 'Master Harold' . . . and the Boys'') and Barney Simon's Market Theater in Johannesburg, which first presented the musical ''Sarafina,'' based on the violent Soweto school boycotts in 1976.
Yet, one wonders, how did they manage to cope as apolitical artists in a country whose apartheid policies inevitably defines one as ''political'' at birth?
''You cope by doing what little you can to change the system,'' says Miss Brickhill. They did this, she adds, by pressing early on for government permission to play to integrated audiences in the Johannesburg theater they managed for more than five years. And in 1974 they created ''KwaZulu,'' which featured a cast of 35 black performers in ethnic dances. The show toured internationally to acclaim. They also taught classes for black actors, some of whom now sit on integrated arts councils in South Africa.
For the most part, however, Brickhill-Burke Productions is in the business of escaping reality, not addressing it. Mr. Burke says that the objective of using the theater as a place of magic transformation crystalized on his first visit to the traditional pantomime at the London Palladium in 1962. ''I sat transfixed,'' he says, ''as Gillian Lynne [the choreographer of ''Phantom of the Opera''] swashbuckled across the stage as Puss n' Boots and went through a series of metamorphoses. I've never doubted since then that you can do practically anything on stage that you put your mind to.''
But it was 10 years earlier, in 1952, says Miss Brickhill, that the couple's embrace of the American musical theater became inevitable.
''An international company of 'Oklahoma' was touring South Africa,'' she recalls. ''I saw it in Johannesburg, Louis saw it in Durban. We hadn't even met yet, but we both had the same reaction. The show had this vitality, fire and energy that we both related to. It was the milieu in which we wanted to operate.''

HEADLINE: THEATER;
One Struggle Over, Attention Turns to Guilt

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN; Samuel G. Freedman, a former Times reporter, is the author of ''Small Victories,'' a book about one year in an inner-city school, to be published this spring by Harper & Row.

 BODY:
One afternoon two years ago, when Richard Wesley was feeling especially frustrated in his effort to write a play about what W. E. B. Du Bois had called ''the talented tenth'' of black America, he drove from his suburban New Jersey home to visit cousins in Harlem. Heading across 145th Street, he noticed a car wash and decided to pull in. And as he did, a skinny young man with a bucket and squeegee in hand and a sheath of rags draped across his shoulder offered to do the job for a few dollars less.
Mr. Wesley accepted, and the man ran off to fill his bucket. In his absence, two or three other hustlers arrived to displace him. From the safety of his front seat, Mr. Wesley watched in shock as the first returned not only with clean water but a broom handle to attack his competitors.
He drove off quaking, remembering all the other times his car had been besieged by thin men with squeegees, measuring his own comfort against the desperation of fellow blacks battling over a 50-cent payday. That moment, that realization, became a monologue in his evolving play. But more importantly, it provided the sorrowful emotional fuel he required to bring the drama as a whole to fruition. The end result, ''The Talented Tenth,'' opens tonight at the Manhattan Theater Club's Stage I at City Center. 
For audiences whose image of black characters has been shaped by the ghetto-dwellers of August Wilson's ''Fences'' or Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing'' or, for that matter, by Mr. Wesley's 1978 breakthrough play ''The Mighty Gents,'' the men and women of ''The Talented Tenth'' may come as quite a revelation. Graduates of Howard University, they include a realtor, an advertising agent, a Fortune 500 middle manager and a Republican. They vacation in Negril, unwind at the health club, speak of ''networking'' and ''discretionary money.'' And, most clearly in the case of Mr. Wesley's fictional surrogate, a radio executive named Bernard, they feel enormously guilty at having betrayed their political origins, at having escaped rather than uplifted much of what they refer to as ''The Race.''
''That day on 145th Street galvanized everything,'' Mr. Wesley said in a recent interview. ''It made me wonder what happened to those guys that 50 cents and a dirty windshield became what stood between today and tomorrow. It made me wonder how I had gotten so lucky. And what were the responsibilities of that. It made me say you've got to address this - the disparity in the black community, the line of demarcation that is so apparent and so unbridgeable.
''Because that hasn't been the case historically. In the old segregated America, you had Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong living on Sugar Hill, a block from folks who worked as cooks and maids. Now there's an economic segregation in black America. If you're a buppie, a black yuppie, you're not concerned about busing, you're not concerned about public accommodations - except as intellectual issues. You've made enough money to insulate yourself. ''Now it's possible to have a situation where you have a black surgeon who lives in Chappaqua and has kids in private school who play squash. For him, the inner city is a remote place where 'those people' live. He's no more concerned about them than an Irish-American who's living on the Philadelphia Main Line cares about some distant relatives stuck in South Boston.''
Still, it was far easier for Mr. Wesley to perceive his subject and themes than to penetrate them. Although he grew up in a stable, working-class family in Newark and graduated from Howard University, the very hatchery of the black elite, his earlier plays dealt almost exclusively with street life and militant politics.
Mr. Wesley, who is 43 years old, first drew acclaim in 1971 when the New York Shakespeare Festival mounted ''Black Terror,'' which unsentimentally dramatized a black revolution in ''the very near future.'' His 1975 drama, ''The Past Is the Past,'' depicted the encounter between a black father and the grown son he had abandoned long ago. (The play is being revived at the Billie Holiday Theater in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, with John Amos and Ralph Carter, beginning Nov. 9.) ''The Mighty Gents'' was an elegiac look at the former members of a street gang, who 10 years after their last rumble had no other source of pride or meaning in their lives.
Mr. Wesley's own career meanwhile had taken off with relatively little struggle. His playwriting mentor, Ed Bullins, had steered ''Black Terror'' to Joseph Papp, and from that point on Mr. Wesley's life as an in-demand author carried him further and further from his characters. ''The Mighty Gents,'' in that respect, signaled the end of an era. In its maiden production at the Manhattan Theater Club, in fact, the work had been entitled ''The Last Street Play.''
''I felt my generation of black writers had exhausted the possibilities of writing about the street,'' said Mr. Wesley. ''We'd written about drugs. We'd written about prostitution. We'd written about alienated youth. There had to be some new territory to be limned. And that meant for me a period of self-examination. ''I had to realize I was the grandson of two ministers, who provided a secure life for my parents. And they passed on to my brother and me their values and aspirations. There were things that were expected of us - a college education, definitely; a career, absolutely; upward mobility.
''In order to function on the street, you had to have a sense there are no possibilities for you. I always saw long-term payoffs. That's why I wasn't a gang member; that's why I wasn't a great athlete. I had alternatives.'' Mr. Wesley, to be sure, was radicalized by the civil rights and black nationalist movements at Howard, and most immediately by the 1967 riot that laid waste to Newark. Yet as his home city slid further into misery - entire blocks never rebuilt, housing projects declared uninhabitable and demolished - he was able to move to Montclair and send a daughter to private school. While he had made his name with critics with his unflinching stage dramas, he had made a good deal of his money on the comedic screenplays for ''Uptown Saturday Night'' and ''Let's Do It Again,'' popular vehicles for Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby. And he was surrounded by blacks who had enjoyed a similar trajectory.
The question was how to turn their collective story into art. As he contemplated ''The Talented Tenth,'' Mr. Wesley's first inclination was to take the character of Essex Braxton from ''The Mighty Gents'' and insert him into a buppie dinner party. As ''The Mighty Gents'' had established, Braxton had achieved upper-middle-class income and accouterments by leaving his street gang for a career in loan sharking and prostitution. Perhaps, Mr. Wesley thought, Braxton would own a few legitimate businesses to launder money, and perhaps his middle-class friends would never know the true source of his bank account.
The playwright ultimately dropped the idea of including Braxton as being too artificial. But for the better part of six years, until his drive across 145th Street, he could not develop anything better.
''I could never get to the center of it,'' he said of the nascent play. ''I just had this vague idea of what I wanted to write about. I didn't have the insight to bring the characters sufficiently to life. I wasn't willing to go deeply enough into myself and my feelings. I was intellectualizing too much. It was difficult to write about black professionals because I'm always around them. I tend to take what we all say and do for granted. It was hard to realize this was profound material.''
With his emotions unlocked by his encounter with the car washers, Mr. Wesley soon had a play so packed with detail it ran nearly three hours. The Manhattan Theater Club, which gave premieres to three of Mr. Wesley's earlier plays, last spring produced ''The Talented Tenth'' as part of its Stage II series, which is generally not open to critics. The current Main Stage version is one of six shows at not-for-profit theaters nationwide to be underwritten by A.T.&T.'s ''New Plays for the 90's'' program. Bernard is portrayed by Richard Lawson, a veteran of four Wesley plays.
Between last spring and now, Mr. Wesley and the director, M. Neema Barnette, have pruned 50 minutes from the play. The stage action mixes Bernard's retrospective monologues with scenes showing his current relations with his wife, his mistress, his boss, and his closest friends and their wives. But one of the strongest presences in ''The Talented Tenth'' is never seen onstage. She is Bernard's college girlfriend, Habiba, a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist so committed that she fought and died in the Angolan revolution. It is she who embodies the political idealism he fears he has lost.
''The Talented Tenth,'' however, hardly rhapsodizes about black militancy. One of Bernard's longest speeches tells of a radical who berates and then beats a Howard student for leaving his pregnant girlfriend, promises to assume the fatherly responsibilities himself, and in turn abdicates them. Two other characters lambaste a black mayor for indifference and corruption. Considering Mr. Wesley's background in Newark, it is difficult not to assume that this politician bears some resemblance to Kenneth Gibson, who was elected the city's first black mayor in a virtual crusade in 1970 and voted out amid a sense of betrayal 16 years later.
''I believed the people I was following,'' Mr. Wesley said, with some rue. ''I canvassed in the housing projects for Ken Gibson when he ran. The problem with the elected officials is that with a few exceptions they became bureaucrats and caretakers. And with the more militant nationalists, you had the dogma, the cult of personality. So many proved to be charlatans and kooks. They disappointed not only us but the generations that followed. I'm not only talking about black leaders, either. I'm talking about Eldridge Cleaver and Jerry Rubin.'' He paused. ''Still, the problem was the messenger, not the message itself.''
For all the racial specificity in ''The Talented Tenth,'' the play's mood of bittersweet reflection on unrealized ideals seems bound to draw comparisons to Wendy Wasserstein's ''Heidi Chronicles'' and Michael Weller's ''Loose Ends.'' And Mr. Wesley does little to discourage the parallels.
''All of us baby boomers have experienced the same kind of changes,'' he said. ''It's a drag sometimes to think that some of the most exciting days, when every sunrise brought a new challenge, were when you were between 18 and 28. And one day you cut your hair, shave your beard, put away your sandals, go from yippie to yuppie, nationalist to buppie. Everyone tells you you've done the right thing. And you wonder if you really have.''

HEADLINE: FILM VIEW;
Seeing 'Intolerance' Is Hard Work

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby

 BODY:
''I don't think I ever want to see 'Potemkin' again.''
Arthur L. Mayer, the pioneer motion picture distributor, exhibitor, producer and, in his later years, a popular teacher of film, made this admission privately over lunch one day in 1981, shortly before he died.
Mayer was entitled, being then 94 and having sat through ''Potemkin'' more times than the rest of us have tuned in Johnny Carson. He wasn't expressing heresy. He was simply acknowledging that seeing some movies is not as easy as watching them. Seeing movies can be hard work. 
Mayer's rueful words came to mind earlier this month during the New York Film Festival's presentation of D. W. Griffith's 1916 epic, ''Intolerance.''
This was not just another retrospective of some seldom-shown classic. This was the first time that most of us could attend an ''Intolerance'' that approximated the ambitious, gaudy production conceived by Griffith 75 years ago Following its New York premiere at the Liberty Theater on Sept. 5, 1916, ''Intolerance'' was repeatedly cut and re-edited, at first by Griffith himself, in an effort to stimulate box-office activity. At one point, two of the four sequences comprised by the nearly four-hour film were excised and released as separate features. During the years that followed, footage was lost, and butchered prints moldered.
Earlier efforts to restore the film were hampered by the fact that there was no written screenplay. Griffith, who died in 1948, had carried his plans around in his head.
This latest restoration was done by Gillian B. Anderson, the music specialist of the Library of Congress, and Peter Williamson of the Museum of Modern Art. They have re-created as much of the original as now seems possible by using, as their scene-by-scene guide, Joseph Carl Briel's original musical score, composed for the live orchestras that accompanied the silent film's initial engagements.
The result is a triumph of scholarship, sleuthing and dedication. By using still photographs (filed with the Library of Congress at the time the film was copyrighted) as freeze frames, Miss Anderson and Mr. Williamson were able to fill in the estimated 11 minutes of lost footage to complete their restoration.
The festival presentation, with Miss Anderson conducting the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra and a chorus of 16 voices, was something of a stunner. It was a roller-coaster ride back through film history to the time when the art was still in the process of finding its identity. It was also hard work. Griffith was a cinema genius and visionary, but his terms of expression were rooted in the 19th century in which he had been born (1880) and bred. To see ''Intolerance'' today one has to look through bombast, sentimentality and thematic chaos. That Griffith was always more of a showman than a thinker is never more apparent than in this masterwork, whose confused pieties make the racist sentiments of ''The Birth of a Nation'' (1914) look like pure reason.
In the four separate but intercut stories of ''Intolerance,'' Griffith attempts to illustrate the ravages wrought by intolerance throughout the ages.
''The Mother and the Law'' is a ''modern'' tale about industrial America and the terrible deeds done in the name of social uplift. ''The Nazarene'' deals with Jesus' betrayal and crucifixion. In ''The Medieval Story,'' a Huguenot lass named Brown Eyes, her betrothed and her family are caught in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre instigated by Catherine de Medicis in 1572. ''The Fall of Babylon,'' the film's true centerpiece, has much less to do with intolerance than with cinema as spectacle.
There's no difficulty in keeping track of these spliced-together stories, designed, says a note at the film's beginning, ''to express thoughts as they might flash through the mind.''
The difficulty is in staying interested, which, it seems, is a difficulty that today's audiences share with those of 1916. Much like an otherwise good storyteller who has had one too many drinks, Griffith keeps getting sidetracked by extraneous details.
In spite of its intended reverence, ''The Nazarene'' plays like a tab version of a Passion Play. It's the shortest of the film's four sections as well as its most ordinary. ''The Medieval Story'' is also perfunctory Griffith. Yet without these two sections, ''Intolerance'' would never acquire its genuine cumulative impact.
No other film has ever matched the dizzy exhilaration of the film's final 20 minutes, in which its four sequences are crosscut at a constantly increasing, ever more alarming tempo. As Christ hauls his cross to Calvary, Brown Eyes watches her family being slaughtered, the Dear One (in ''The Mother and the Law'') races to find the governor to stay her innocent husband's hanging, and Babylon teeters on the edge of doom.
In pursuit of suspense, Griffith raised crosscutting to a crazy art, and never more shamelessly than in ''Intolerance.'' The demands of the other three stories gave him an excuse to keep cutting away from Christ's passion (the end of which most people in the audience knew anyway), something that would have been unthinkably sacrilegious in a conventional Passion Play.
It is in ''The Mother and the Law'' and ''The Fall of Babylon,'' which later had brief lives as separate features, that Griffith's personality and concerns are most clearly manifest. He may have respected Jesus, but he was more dazzled by Babylon, whose excessive feasting, dancing and general all-round debauching gave the Barnum in him something he could sink his teeth into.
Three-quarters of a century later, the gigantic Babylonian sets continue to stupefy, as do the scenes of the Persian siege and the shots of horse-drawn chariots racing atop the battlements. Nothing Cecil B. DeMille ever did, including his parting of the Red Sea in his second ''Ten Commandments,'' ever came close to Griffith's achievements.
He was a master of spectacle and its significant detail, but it is in ''The Mother and the Law'' that Griffith's 19th-century guilelessness shines through. He was firmly against all injustice, if only as he perceived it.
In this story, the man who had romanticized the Ku Klux Klan in ''The Birth of a Nation'' tells a heartfelt tale of unemployed mill workers, venal employers, cruel strikebreakers and a bunch of heedless self-appointed guardians of the morality of the lower orders. That these guardians are all women seems not to be a coincidence. Reads one title card: ''When women cease to attract men, they often turn to reform as a second chance.''
''The Mother and the Law'' is incredibly naive and sexist by our standards, but it is also a moving and unexpectedly blunt report on the lot of labor in this country on the eve of America's entry into World War I. The means of expression may look old-fashioned. The report itself and the feelings expressed are as genuine today as they were when Griffith made the film.
The pristine print and the live orchestra accompaniment made the Lincoln Center presentation of ''Intolerance'' easy to watch. It was not, however, easy to see, certainly not in the context of today's movies. We have become lazy. We are used to a cinema composed largely of close-ups, cutting between faces that are of interest not so much for what the faces express but for what the mouths are saying. They are fast-food images that arrive in such a precooked way that all one has to do to receive them is to keep the ear open.
To see ''Intolerance,'' one must read between the lines of the title cards (''The loom of fate weaves death for The Boy's father''). One must accept a notion of a popular theater in which generalizations are openly acceptable as characters: The Dear One, The Dear One's Father, The Friendless One, The Mountain Girl, Rhapsode and The Girl Who Rocks the Cradle.
Today's films deal in cliches that pretend to be particular, such as the morally bent cop who has no home life and pursues serial killers, drug pushers and other disturbers of the peace simply because they are there. He is never called The Morally Bent Cop. He has a particular name, Joe or Mike or Tony.
Yet our cinema is no more or less sophisticated than Griffith's. It is different. We have sound and color, and we no longer appreciate the sort of epic in which moral positions are labeled. We are rutted in what's taken to be realism. Our cinema reflects a society that pays lip service to idiosyncrasy (as long as it isn't too different).
Recent films imported from China have much more in common with the cinema of Griffith than they have with ours, at least in part because these Chinese directors are less concerned with the individual than with the fate of society as reflected by the individual. They can't afford the luxury of worrying about alienation. And no matter how bold their films may look in China, they tend to look just a bit old-fashioned to us. Too epic.
Griffith was a master whom time overtook. Sergei Eisenstein, born in 1898, constructed his far more cerebral cinema-of-montage on techniques developed by Griffith in his mass-market melodramas. In turn, Abel Gance built upon both Griffith and Eisenstein to create, in ''Napoleon Vue par Abel Gance'' (1926), an epic that continues to speak to us today without the sort of apologies that must accompany the showing of ''Intolerance.''
I couldn't say that I don't want to see ''Intolerance'' ever again, but I don't think I want to see it again immediately.

HEADLINE: The N.F.L.'s Painful Profit Crunch

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
It is a curious enterprise: an intercity alliance of 28 monopolies, blessed by Congress and invariably ruled by fabulously rich capitalists, bound up in its own form of socialism. Yet the National Football League is as much a part of everyday American life as apple pie, Coca-Cola and Disney World.
This afternoon, in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, and 11 other locations including Giants Stadium, and again in Giants Stadium on Monday night, a total of nearly one million people will pay about $25 each to see a professional football games. Twelve of these games were sold out before the teams took the field, and league bosses are hoping for their biggest box-office weekend ever.
The 1989 season is shaping up to be the biggest fan-grabber in the N.F.L.'s 70-year history. Before the season's half-way mark arrived today, nearly six million people had already passed through the turnstiles. Television viewership of pro football games is on the upswing, too. And a bidding war for the broadcast rights to major league sporting events has team owners ready to play hard ball with networks and cable executives when contracts expire next year. 
With prospects like these, why did the task of choosing a commissioner deteriorate into a three-month stalemate among owners that was not solved until last Thursday morning?
In spite of the outward appearance of prosperity, many of the 28 N.F.L. franchises have run aground financially. And the owners have been divided for some time over how to reverse their fortunes. The dispute spilled over into the search for a replacement for Pete Rozelle, the longtime commissioner, who announced his retirement earlier this year.
League records show that half the teams lost money last year, said Art Modell, owner of the Cleveland Browns. And Victor Kiam, who resuscitated the Remington electric shaver business and owns the New England Patriots, claims that nearly all teams lost money.
The trouble is that the teams, which will take in a combined $900 million in revenues this year, have been unable to offset their rising costs. Television revenues, which typically contribute 60 percent of a team's sales, have been flat for the last three seasons, at $17 million per team. Stadium attendance has increased slightly, to 90 percent of available seats, as have ticket prices in most cities. But because ticket sales contribute only 35 percent of a team's total revenues, these gains have not been much help. Meanwhile, player salaries, which account for more than half of most teams' costs, jumped to an estimated $14 million this year, up from $10 million in 1986, according to the National Football League Players Association.
But the league may be entering a new era of profitability. By hiring Paul J. Tagliabue, a Washington lawyer, as commissioner instead of his opponent, Jim Finks, a former pro quarterback and now president of the New Orleans Saints, a majority of the owners signaled that the league may soon be managed more like a $1-billion-a-year entertainment business than a collection of money-losing tax shelters, as many outsiders have viewed it.
''Mr. Finks is a good football man, but he is not the businessman that football needs to go forward,'' said Michael Megna, vice president of the American Appraisal Associates in Milwaukee, and an expert in valuing sports franchises. ''We have a highly litigious society. And with unions, TV contracts, cable contracts, all of these things require more of a legal awareness and a business awareness. This is no longer a sport per se. It's an entertainment business.''
In directing major sports leagues in America, lawyers have had a promising record. David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association since 1983, has won high marks for putting the once stumbling league on solid footing. Fay Vincent, elected commissioner of major league baseball after the death of A. Bartlett Giamatti in September, has had a short tenure but has won respect for his calm handling of the World Series in the face of the disastrous earthquake that hit the Bay Area. Mr. Tagliabue, who accepted a five-year contract at an estimated $1 million a year, completes the trio of lawyers who have become commissioners of America's three major sports leagues.
 
Negotiating a Pact
 But he may not find the going easy. In addition to bringing peace to N.F.L.'s divided house, he must negotiate a new television contract when the current three-year pact, which he helped fashion, expires in early February. He will also have to lead the league in various antitrust battles.
The division among owners stems in large part from differing investment philosophies. Relative newcomers like Mr. Kiam; Norman Braman, who owns the Philadelphia Eagles; Pat Bowlen of the Denver Broncos, and Jerrel W. Jones of the Dallas Cowboys each paid $65 million or more to join the exclusive N.F.L. club. These new owners are eager for the ego rewards that ownership brings, but are more willing to take risks to increase the value of their investment than are the established owners.
The new breed supports aggressive steps to raise revenues. They want four new teams added to the league roster in the United States within two or three years, which would bring in at least $200 million in franchise fees to be split among the owners. They embraced the formation of the World League of American Football, a minor league that will begin in Europe, Mexico and Canada in 1991. And they believe that the N.F.L. can and should explore fielding franchise teams in Canada, Mexico City and even Japan.
The longtime owners like the Giants' Wellington Mara, Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns and the Chicago Bears' Mike McCaskey are more conservative. Their teams, many of them purchased before the 1960's for well below $1 million, are now worth more than $90 million, based on the sale price for the Dallas Cowboys earlier this year.
Concerned that a high-risk course could burst their bubble, the old guard prefers curbing inflation in player expenses to raising revenues. They fear that lurching for more revenues would overexpose the game on television and thin the pool of talented players by spreading them over too many teams. That could cheapen the game, dampen fan interest and, at some point, send both ticket sales and television ratings into a tailspin.
Beside pacifying these warring factions, Mr. Tagliabue faces other challenges. The players union is pursuing several legal actions involving antitrust claims against the league. Victory by the players in one case could bring a new era in which players could bargain with any team as their contracts expire. In other cases, players would reclaim $25 million in disputed pay and benefits related to a 24-day walkout in 1987 and $25 million in withheld pension benefits. Finally, the league's drug-testing program is under attack in the courts.
Some owners say Mr. Tagliabue's toughest job will be to bargain with Gene Upshaw, the union's director, to obtain an agreement with the players to cap rising salaries, bonuses and other incentive payments. ''Player payroll typically represents about 50 percent of total operating expenses for an N.F.L. club,'' said Steven J. Matt, a specialist in the finances and valuations of sports franchises with Arthur Andersen in Dallas. ''You can't allow that expense to continue to grow out of control. Otherwise, it will become very difficult for teams to make money.''
 
Potential Hostilities
 But striking a deal is likely to increase hostilities. Officials at the players union say owners are not hurting as badly as they claim. Doug Allen, assistant executive director of the union, said that if so many teams are losing money, it is because of spendthrift practices in the front office, not excessive player contracts. He also doubted the owners' complaints of losses because the owners have not agreed to open their financial statements to outsiders.
But keeping things civil is essential. ''We must have a labor peace,'' said Lamar Hunt, longtime owner of the Kansas City Chiefs and president of the American Football Conference. ''And we've got to have success in our business operations. Otherwise, we will fail as a league.''
Many owners do not want to discuss publicly the idea of salary caps, fearing it might provoke the union. Asked if he and other owners would press Mr. Tagliabue to negotiate an overall team salary limit, Mr. Modell replied, ''I don't want to get into that. It's not my department.'' Still, he complains, ''Our player costs are going out of sight.''
Mr. Tagliabue must also break new ground in shaping television contracts to exploit expanding opportunities in cable and in pay-per-view technology. The current contract, fixed at $476 million since 1987, includes ABC, NBC, CBS and ESPN. ESPN, the sports cable network, will broadcast eight Sunday night games, starting in a week, for the third year.
The networks ought to be in a friendly mood to negotiate. CBS shocked the sports world last December when it agreed to pay 26 major league baseball teams $1.1 billion over four years, beginning next year, compared with an expiring, six-year deal worth $1.2 billion. Some analysts expect the N.F.L.'s strong ratings this year, plus competition among the broadcasters, to produce a contract that raises average television revenues for each team to $22 million a year, up from $17 million. Though Mr. Modell declined to state a figure, he said: ''I'm confident of a significant increase. The price of poker has gone up.''
 
Other Considerations
 But money isn't the only consideration in negotiating a contract. Many fans were angered by the deal with CBS because the network cut in half the number of games broadcast on Saturdays. Although ESPN could conceivably fill in the gap in coverage - it paid $400 million for the rights to air 175 games a year - more than 40 million homes are not wired for cable.
Pay-per-view has also dissappointed fans in the few cases where it was tried by the N.F.L. When viewers called their cable system to sign up for a game in San Diego, for instance, telephone lines quickly overloaded and most callers could not get through, said Mr. Megna of American Appraisal Associates.
Yet those systems will some day permit viewers to leapfrog the handful of games offered by networks and cable systems and select whatever game they want to watch for the price of a movie ticket. Many analysts believe it is the gold mine just over the horizon that will give the N.F.L. staggering amounts of additional revenues.
But the technology would seriously threaten the league's efforts to keep a economic balance among teams if all of the pay-per-view money could be kept only by teams watched most often. Mr. Megna said the best teams and those from the biggest cities, like New York and Los Angeles, would reap millions in additional income, while teams in smaller areas, such as Green Bay, Cincinnati or Seattle, would starve. Still, Mr. Modell says the league decided long ago to split revenues from the medium evenly among owners, as they now do those from television.
 
Inequities in Baseball
 Such inequities already exist in major-league baseball, where all teams have local television contracts in addition to league contracts with various networks. The New York Yankees recently signed the most lucrative local baseball television contract - a $500 million agreement through the year 2000 with the Madison Square Garden cable network. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees owner, is not obligated or expected to contribute any of the money to other teams.
Under the promotion-minded Mr. Rozelle, the outgoing commissioner, the N.F.L. won a reputation as the most cleverly-optimized sports league, by brilliantly marrying the live spectacle and television. In 1966, he introduced the Super Bowl, which now commands one of the highest advertising rates in television. Of the 10 programs with the largest viewing audiences in television history, the only two that were not Super Bowls were the two-hour finale of ''M.A.S.H.'' in 1983, and the last episode of ''Roots,'' in 1977. Few 30-second spots, priced at $700,000, remain for advertisers on next January's Super Bowl.
But the N.F.L. appeared complacent, resting on its past successes, as rival sports leagues dressed up their marketing and finances in novel ways during the 1980's, while cutting back on embarrassing drug-abuse incidents. The National Basketball Association made an astonishing turnaround. In 1983, with several of its 23 franchises near collapse, and the Cleveland Cavaliers and Indianapolis Pacers in the most dire straits, the N.B.A. guaranteed that its players as a group would receive a minimum of 53 percent of the league's gross revenues, excluding income from licensing deals and arena concessions. In turn, salaries for each team were capped.
The deal, accepted by the players, was an elixir for the N.B.A. Expenses became more predictable, encouraging wealthier owners to acquire teams. A tough drug enforcement policy also was accepted by the players. The league's sullied image improved, and so did attendance. Teams in Milwaukee, Detroit and Sacramento moved into larger, more profitable arenas. Others are planned. In the last two years, four new teams, in Charlotte, N.C., Miami, Orlando and Minneapolis, each paid $32.5 million - split evenly among existing franchise owners - to join the league.
In turn, the average player salary rose to $510,000 last season from $275,000 in the '83-'84 season. Mr. Stern, the commissioner, said the average salary should reach $1 million in 1993. Meanwhile, league revenues have risen more rapidly than players' salaries, reaching $351 million last year, up from $160 million in '83-'84. They should reach $600 million in four years.
N.B.A. franchise values have soared faster than those of any other major-league sport during the 1980's, according to Mr. Megna. The Denver Nuggets recently was sold for $54 million. ''The N.B.A. had a long way to go,'' Mr. Megna said. ''And it came from nowhere over the last five years.''
 
Fast Honeymoon?
 The N.F.L. that Mr. Tagliabue takes over certainly is far healthier and more deeply imbedded in the nation's leisure culture than the N.B.A. was in its dark days.
But the new commissioner has no illusions about what lies ahead. He told a crowded news conference Thursday afternoon hat his urgent goals were settling the new television contract and striking an agreement with the players union as well as expanding the N.F.L. by awarding new franchises.
It was an agenda unanimously endorsed by the owners divided camps, at least for now. Of course, Mr. Tagliabue's honeymoon could end as suddenly as a quick, look-in pass by Joe Montana. With the owners as potentially fractious as ever, turmoil is only a phone call away.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEW IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR;
Offsetting a Loss of Federal Support

BYLINE: By Craig Bloom

 BODY:
The conservative agenda of the Reagan era has forced many nonprofit groups to become much more sophisticated in the way they do business.
As part of its initiative to scale back big government, the Reagan Administration shifted the responsibility for social welfare from the public to the private sector. ''I believe the spirit of volunteerism still lives in America,'' Mr. Reagan said in a 1981 address on his proposed spending cuts. ''We've let Government take away many things we once considered were really ours to do voluntarily out of the goodness of our hearts and a sense of community pride and neighborliness.'' 
Federal assistance to nonprofit groups, excluding financing through Medicare and Medicaid, has dropped by 20 percent since 1980. Over that period, nonprofit groups in areas from the arts to social services have lost $30 billion in direct Federal aid, adjusted for inflation, and more if Government program cuts that increase demand for nonprofit services are considered, estimated Lester M. Salamon, director of the Institute for Policy Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
While the President's Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives in 1982 asked individuals and corporations to double their charitable contributions to compensate for the cuts, those sources have not obliged. Changes in the tax laws have made it less attractive to give to charity, and changes in the business climate - like the wave of leveraged buyouts, which squeeze corporate spending - have also curtailed philanthropy.
As a result, these sources have offset only about a third of the Federal cuts. Individual contributions have risen by just a third since 1982, while corporate donations have jumped by less than a quarter, and have actually fallen slightly since 1985, according to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. In lieu of giving more money, some companies stress employee volunteerism.
With fiercer competition for donations, nonprofit groups have begun to operate more like their for-profit counterparts. ''We find a lot of ferment on the management side, with much more attention to efficiency,'' Mr. Salamon said. And some have adopted marketing practices to improve their services and reach the likeliest pools of donors.
While most nonprofits are simply trying to prevent a backward slide, one sector continues to grow. With their ideology under attack, several liberal advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Planned Parenthood have seen sympathizers rally to their defense.

HEADLINE:  CONFRONTING THE SOVIET UNION'S ECONOMICE MORASS

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
In a speech in New York on Oct. 16, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said that perestroika's success in the Soviet Union is in the long-term interest of the United States. Mr. Baker offered to send American technical and economic experts to the Soviet Union to help with the reforms.
Help may be needed. The Soviet Union is still groping for ways to make its economy grow and increase its production of consumer goods. An announcement made by Gosbank, the state bank, last Wednesday, declared that the ruble would be subjected to a large devaluation on Nov. 1. But the devaluation is to be limited to transactions primarily related to tourism and might not stimulate the economy as a whole.
What should the Soviet Union do? Three longtime observers of that country shared their views with The New York Times. Donald M. Kendall, chairman of the executive committee of Pepsico Inc.; Anthony M. Solomon, chairman of S. G. Warburg Inc. and co-chairman of a study group on the Soviet economy at the Institute for East-West Security Studies in New York, and Marshall I. Goldman, associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University offered sharply different views. 
 
 
 
Question: Given the deteriorating standard of living in the Soviet Union, is there any action the United States should be taking?
 
Mr. Solomon: The one area where economists and other experts can probably make a modest contribution is in helping the Soviets modernize their information gathering and data gathering ability. I would hope that we would not be so naively arrogant that we would send over teams to advise the Soviets about how to make the transition to a market economy.
 
Mr. Goldman: I would fault the Bush Administration for the strange situation we now have. If we're not careful, someone will look back some day and say ''who lost Mr. Gorbachev?'' This is a unique time if we look at the big picture. Mr. Gorbachev's reforms both inside and outside the country are things we have been asking for since World War II.
We have to remember that there is a lot of opposition to what Mr. Gorbachev is doing from the military. They are not happy about the demilitarization program. They are unhappy about the way the Soviet Union got out of Afghanistan, which they viewed as a defeat. I have had discussions in the Central Committee headquarters where people told me they were worried about a military coup in the Soviet Union. They said they were worried about a coup from either the left or the right. There is unhappiness because for many people the system seems to be breaking down.
It seems to me that our Administration is derelict. President Bush has been very conservative. He's worried about making a mistake on the economic and political side. We will have a summit meeting in late spring or early summer 1990 - that's two years since the last one.
 
Mr. Kendall: I don't agree with Marshall on this at all. You know it's great for people who really don't know what's going on in the Administration to sit down and criticize it like Marshall is doing and the press is doing. This Administration, unlike previous administrations, is planning things without going public on them. A very good example is the Open Skies agreement, which allows reconnaissance flights over Soviet and American territory. Nobody knew about that agreement until all of a sudden it was announced. Mr. Baker is that kind of guy.
I recently met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. He said to me that he was very pleased with the progress they are making with us. There are a lot of things that are going on that the Administration is not talking about. You can say they are slow to get started. But I happen to think they were right in re-evaluating the problem and then deciding on the direction. The Soviets are not unhappy with their meetings with Mr. Baker and President Bush.
You hear people saying what Marshall is saying but he hasn't come up with any ideas about what he can do for the Soviet Union either.
 
Mr. Solomon: I agree. The fact that Mr. Baker has given speeches supporting perestroika means that the Administration is planning something. Mr. Goldman: But Mr. Baker didn't give the speeches until October. Mr. Gorbachev needs to have meetings head to head. So far there hasn't been any action. I disagree with Don.
The Soviets were quite happy when a Republican was elected as President because they thought he would pick up and continue from the Reagan Administration. Now the Russians can't understand what is happening and why it is taking so long.
It is hard to come up with concrete ideas. But when the two heads of state get together for a summit meeting, their staffs are forced to think of things and be creative. That's what summit meetings require.
 
Q. Even if the Bush Administration were to work faster, would it be able to do anything to really change the lives of the Soviet people?
 
Mr. Goldman: Well, I think so. I think the United States should be talking about a Marshall Plan - not a big one. We could call it a kind of mini-Mikhail Plan. We should provide some kind of concrete assistance. After all, we're talking about sending food to Poland.
 
Mr. Kendall: What kind of a Marshall Plan?
 
Mr. Goldman: For example, the big American-Soviet joint-venture consortium of businesses has announced that next year they are going to send over toothpaste to the Soviet Union. This is important because toothpaste is not available in the shops in the Soviet Union. So the consortium has signed a $500,000 deal to bring over toothpaste.
 
Mr. Kendall: They're getting soap from England. Is that something the Administration ought to do? Send over toothpaste? It's not even a difficult technological problem.
 
Mr. Goldman: Yes, but for the Soviet consumer, things like toothpaste have disappeared. The Administration should also offer credits for food.
 
Q. How large should those credits be?
 
Mr. Goldman: We should begin with food aid of several hundred million dollars a year. That's something we could do. We have surpluses, not in grain, but in pork bellies. That's what we're giving to the Poles. We could do the same for the Soviets.
 
Mr. Solomon: I don't agree with you, Marshall. On this point I line up with Don. Yes, I think there are supportive actions that we can take. But at this point, to come up with some pretty massive food or financial aid is premature, and it is also probably not appropriate.
 
Mr. Goldman: That's why I said a mini-Marshall plan. I think it does make sense. Mr. Gorbachev's well being may well depend on whether or not people see any improvement in their shops. He made mistakes on cutting back on the consumer goods early on and he's acknowledged this. If he doesn't get goods in the shops, people are not going to be happy. It's a short-run survival tactic.
 
Mr. Solomon: But you are talking about billions and billions of dollars if you are talking about bringing over a significant number of consumer goods. And then what happens if at some point we stop? It will take years before the Soviets will be able to produce the goods themselves.
 
Mr. Goldman: Yes, but Tony, if Mr. Gorbachev doesn't get some short- term support, he won't be there in three years to get industry going.
 
Mr. Solomon: But how do you come up with massive financial support when they don't even have a real economic program yet? We have to be supportive, but we don't start pouring in massive sums of money before they have a program. It just doesn't make sense.
 
Mr. Kendall: I find this idea a little bit ridiculous because the Soviets haven't asked for anything like a Marshall Plan. They've never suggested it and they haven't asked for export credits either.
Realistically, I think the only thing this Administration can do is continue the negotiations on conventional weapons to get the costs down. An agreement there will benefit the Soviets because they won't have to spend so much money on arms. It will help us on our budget deficit, too. Waiving the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which links trade to human rights, is important. I know the Congress is moving on that and the Administration is prepared to move on that. But you have to get a trade agreement to implement it. We have to work with the Soviets on problems in the third world as well. Then we have to have support for joint ventures and even encourage them.
 
Q. The ruble is not freely convertible with other currencies. What should the Soviet Union do about the ruble?
 
Mr. Solomon: When the Soviets have goods to sell in the international market, and they do have some goods to sell, they simply set the price that is necessary to sell those goods. It's competitive in Western terms.
But the reason why overall price reform is so important is that it should result in domestic pricing which is market influenced and that will make for a more rational allocation of resources. This in turn means that people will know what to invest in and what not to invest in.
 
Q. What about linking the ruble to gold, as some Western economists are suggesting?
 
Mr. Solomon: They need some measure of convertibility of the ruble, yes. But to assume that a country with as many economic problems as the Soviet Union has would be able to move not only to full convertibility but also to a fixed exchange rate linked to gold, assumes an incredible amount of progress. I don't think it's realistic.
 
Q. What is your prognosis for the Soviet Union and its economy?
 
Mr. Solomon: I am agnostic about the future of the Soviet Union. I don't know whether it will ultimately succeed or not. But their chances to succeed will depend on whether they can fashion an overall program. I can't imagine there is any way they can succeed with random steps - moving ahead in some areas and then stepping back when there's a political reaction. They have to have an overall program and then they have to handle the politics of that program. And then they've got a good chance of succeeding - hopefully.
 
Mr. Kendall: Well, it is very difficult for anyone to see into the crystal ball. Mr. Gorbachev has shown a great ability to handle problems - the strike problem with the miners, the way he has handled the minority problems, for example. He has been able to get to a lot of problems. But I agree with Tony. Eventually they have to come up with a plan. Which means price reform.
What are the consequences of that? I don't really think we can tell. I happen to be optimistic. I happen to believe that Mr. Gorbachev will make it. I don't agree with people who think if Mr. Gorbachev doesn't make it then the military will take over because the military historically has never taken over in the Soviet Union. You might get a populist taking over, but I don't think the military.
 
Mr. Solomon: Even if the military did take over, they don't have the resources to start an arms race.
 
Mr. Kendall: The military issue is gone. I also don't think they can go back to what they had before.
 
Mr. Goldman: I am more pessimistic. Mr. Gorbachev is an incredible politician. I don't think there is a politician in the world as effective. Historians will look back and say he is the most dynamic, the most imaginative and the most daring leader that the 20th century has seen. He reminds me of when I went to the movies as a kid and watched the serials. The hero would always get into a predicament with no way to escape. But by the next week the hero, somehow, was able to get out of the predicament. Everytime Mr. Gorbachev gets into a problem, like the miners' strike or the ethnic problems, you think he won't get out of it - but he does. Yet, one day the serial comes to an end. I am not expecting a happy ending for Mr. Gorbachev.

HEADLINE: WEEK IN BUSINESS;
Another Quarter Of Economic Growth

BYLINE: By WILLIAM S. NIEDERKORN

 BODY:
The economy grew at a 2.5 percent rate in the quarter that ended in September as a surge in consumer spending offset weakness in exports and the industrial sector, the Commerce Department reported. The overall advance matched that of the April-June period. Economists found reason to cheer in the report's indication of lower third-quarter inflation, even though that was mostly a reflection of falling energy prices. The data also showed no growth in exports and a 15.1 percent increase in imports.
 
*
 In other reports, orders for durable goods slipped 0.1 percent in September despite the second-biggest increase on record in military orders; personal income rose 0.3 percent in September as consumer spending posted its weakest advance in a year; sales of U.S.-built cars plunged 19 percent in mid-October, and sales of light trucks dropped 22.8 percent. 
 
*
 The savings industry lost deposits of $5.1 billion in August, the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision reported. Separately, state and Federal regulators accused senior officials of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of using wiretaps, political pressure and inducements to regulators to avoid action against the institution.
 
*
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell every day last week, for a cumulative loss of 92.42 points, to 2,596.72. On the New York Stock Exchange, declines led advances by more than 2 to 1 on four of five days. Treasury bond prices edged up on the week, but bill prices tumbled. The dollar fell against all major currencies except the British pound and the Canadian dollar. Gold prices surged to $378.30 an ounce on the Comex, up $11 for the week.
 
*
 Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, below, angrily resigned in a dispute over who was in charge of British economic policy - the Chancellor or Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic adviser. The adviser, Sir Alan Walters, also resigned, without an explanation. Mrs. Thatcher replaced Mr. Lawson with the man she had made Foreign Secretary three months ago, John Major.
 
*
 Japanese corporations raised more than $110 billion in the first eight months of this year from the sale of stock, compared with $20 billion by American companies, by far the largest gap ever between the countries, according to figures from the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Securities Data Company in New York.
 
*
 The Soviet Union announced a drastic cut in the ruble exchange rate that applies mainly to foreigners in the country and to Soviet citizens traveling abroad.
 
*
 A.T.&T. can continue to offer customized networks for large business customers, the F.C.C. ruled. But the commission voted to reject an A.T.&T. discount plan for a long-distance service.
 
*
 The Bush Administration announced borrowing measures to insure that next month's Social Security checks would not be delayed by a fight that may result from its effort to cut capital gains taxes. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the Treasury would move up its regular borrowing schedule to raise $17 billion before Oct. 31.
 
*
 The Justice Department has revised the rules for Federal prosecutors' use of the racketeering law known as RICO. The changes could limit criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants.
 
*
 UAL's board said it would try to keep the company independent. A leader of the machinists' union at United Airlines said his union might be willing to participate in a deal to help the company defend itself against a takeover. UAL's earnings fell 72.4 percent in the third quarter, but revenues rose 7.1 percent.
 
*
 Miscellanea. The S.E.C. approved a new financial instrument that would allow investors to trade a ''basket'' of 500 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange . . . Intel said design flaws had been discovered in its top-of-the-line microprocessor chip and that the errors would be corrected . . . McDonald's and eight of the nation's largest plastics producers announced a national program to recycle plastic hamburger containers and other packages . . . The Big Three auto makers each posted third-quarter results that showed sharply lower profits from domestic car and truck sales . . . Sears, Roebuck's profits fell 15.6 percent in the third quarter . . . The New York Post plans to publish its last Sunday issue on Nov. 26 . . . Anheuser-Busch said it would begin cutting prices on its beers.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEW IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR;
Doing More With Less: Companies Donate Volunteers

BYLINE: By Craig Bloom

 BODY:
After a surge early in the decade, the growth of corporate philanthropy has stalled. Corporate contributions, adjusted for inflation, have fallen by 7 percent since 1985, to $4.8 billion in 1988. By comparison, individuals donated $86.7 billion, up 15 percent for the same period. The most recent culprits for the decline in corporate giving: the rise of cash-draining mergers, the stock market crash in 1987, increased foreign competition and a reduced tax incentive. 
Whatever the cause, many corporations, faced with limited resources for charity, have sought to do more with less. They have become choosier about whom they give their money to, often seeking out projects that complement their corporate missions. And rather than concentrate on donations, they have turned to such things as volunteerism.
The number of formal corporate programs to foster volunteerism appears to have tripled since 1978, said Shirley Keller, deputy executive director for corporate programs at Volunteer: The National Center, a network for volunteer groups. The center estimates that at least 1,000 programs exist, up from 300 in 1978.
Volunteer work can benefit corporations, Ms. Keller said. Employee skill levels and morale improve and so does the company's image in the community. ''It makes good business sense,'' Ms. Keller said. ''It's enlightened altruism.''
Companies have found that the most successful programs are those with the most employee involvement. A few years ago, Levi Strauss set up a task force at its home office in San Francisco to find out why employees there had so little enthusiasm for its volunteer program, said Martha Montag-Brown, director of the Levi Strauss Foundation.
Employees reported that the program provided little inspiration. Employees were then allowed to form their own ''action teams'' to address whatever issues interested them. Participation jumped to 45 percent of the 1,800 employees at the headquarters, up from less than 10 percent in 1987. Projects include helping the homeless, AIDS victims and, most recently, earthquake victims.

HEADLINE: Economic Miracle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a resident of Bolivia from 1984 to 1987, I had the privilege to witness a true economic miracle. Undoubtedly Jeffrey Sachs made a valuable contribution to Bolivia's turnaround (''A Doctor for Sick Economies,'' Oct. 1), but to portray him as the savior of Bolivia is inaccurate.
The decision to impose a moratorium on debt repayment was not made by his client Government but by a previous administration dominated by socialists. It was not a philosophical decision but was dictated by the actual bankruptcy of the national treasury as the nation slid into hyperinflation. 
The shock of simultaneously ending wage and price controls, terminating subsidies, closing state-owned industries, firing thousands of tin miners, slashing the pay of teachers and bureaucrats and floating the exchange rate of the national currency had an enormous social cost. This cost was bearable because of the primitive nature of the Bolivian economy. Many Bolivians have relatives in the countryside who provide them with food. Also, a large informal economy cushioned the blow. The cocaine business channeled millions of dollars into this informal economy and provided work for displaced miners in the coca fields.
It is unlikely that similar circumstances exist in more complex industrialized nations like Argentina, Brazil or Poland. In these cases shock treatments could lead to wide-scale social unrest and bring an end to democratically elected governments.
Granted the shock treatment worked in Bolivia; but to credit Mr. Sachs as the architect of Bolivia's recovery ignores the economic factors peculiar to that economy and the more substantial contribution of other players.
Before Mr. Sachs arrived on the scene, Victor Paz Estenssoro, the former President, and Hugo Banzer Suarez, the former military ruler, had undertaken a cold-eyed analysis of the situation. These two statesmen recognized the folly of the Latin American version of the socialist economic model. They made the intellectual and moral decision to pursue a free-market economy and took the political heat associated with its implementation. They deserve the credit, not the academic they hired to cross the t's and dot the i's.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Sometimes, a Negative Isn't Positive

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A QUICK scan of the political landscape last week suggested one lesson future candidates may draw from the campaigns of 1989: hit hard, hit fast, hit nasty.
But a closer look shows that the results of bitter assaults are more complicated. In some cases, the evidence suggests, a negative campaign can be a dismal failure. And in some cases, positive campaigns can work just as well or better. 
In New Jersey, the Democrat, who attacked first, was leading in the race for governor after he broadcast beginning last month a commercial with a caricature of his opponent's face with the nose of Pinocchio. In New York City, the Republican candidate was gaining fast, following a burst of attacks on his rival centering on tax problems and the questionable background of an associate. Now the Democrat has counterattacked.
From Virginia to Alabama to California, candidates were calling one another liars and crooks with remarkable enthusiasm, out-mudsplattering even the notoriously dirty campaigns of 1988.
By the end of the week, many of those involved in political image-making were lamenting that politics had reached this state. But like the creators of nuclear weapons they were telling the public that attacks can't simply be wished away, for both parties know how devastating they can be and everyone knows the need to retaliate against a first strike.
''Negative advertising is here to stay,'' said Roger Stone, a Washington-based Republican consultant who left the gubernatorial campaign of Representative Jim Courter in New Jersey in June, several months before that race turned negative. ''The question isn't where it is going to be used,'' he said. ''It is when and how. You are going to see more and more of it.''
Experience shows that negative campaigns only work, however, when voters already know something positive about the attacking candidate. And it is extremely dangerous for the mud throwing to be initiated by a candidate who is already seen by the public as mean-spirited.
Pressure to use such campaigning is particularly strong in races where there are spending limits. It takes more money and more time to reinforce a positive message than a negative one.
''I hear a lot of consultants this year saying we beat the guy over the head and that's why we won,'' said Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, who has criticized both candidates here for using tactics that he says have obscured the issues. ''That is the current mythology in Washington. But in fact it is much more complicated than that. The negatives I've seen used in this state sometimes are not effective at all.''
In the race to succeed Mr. Kean, the candidates emerged from a relatively civil primary to face what many considered a classic setup for unleashing a barrage. The Republicans said early on that they planned to link the Democrat, Representative James J. Florio, to scandals in his home county of Camden. Mr. Florio's consultants attacked first.
An early Florio commercial referred to several barrels of fuel oil left on land owned by Mr. Courter and his brother as an emblem of what the Democrats portrayed as insensitivity to pollution. Another showed a cartoon of Mr. Courter squeaking as his nose grew, with an announcer accusing him of misleading voters on car insurance, civil rights and abortion.
 
Striking Back
The latest poll by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University shows Mr. Florio with a 17-point lead; other polls show a similar gap.
When Mr. Florio attacked Mr. Courter with the Pinocchio commercial, the Republican struck back with what is now known as Pinocchio II, a commercial that shows Mr. Courter's nose shrinking and Mr. Florio's growing. It accuses Mr. Florio of lying and other misdeeds.
Mr. Courter started the race with little voter recognition, while Mr. Florio, who had run for governor twice before, was far better known. Some consultants now say that Mr. Courter should have run positive commercials first to give voters a reason to vote for him. They say that although Mr. Florio's attacks put Mr. Courter in a tough position, at least early on he needed to wage more of a positive campaign. Some new poll data suggest they are right. Earlier in the campaign, Mr. Courter's strategists said their surveys showed Mr. Courter could run a strong race on the issues of economic growth and no higher taxes. They also believed many voters would favor Mr. Courter if they were convinced he was tough on drugs and crime and once they heard his free-market solution to the high cost of car insurance.
 
Lost Messages
But an Eagleton poll of 717 likely voters in mid-October showed that after a negative campaign by both sides, voters were about split on which candidate would better handle the economy and taxes. They favored Mr. Florio by 40 to 28 percent on the drug issue. Two-thirds did not know where the candidates stood on auto insurance. Mr. Courter had not driven home positive messages about himself.
In New York City, a quick glance would seem to suggest a negative race is the way to go. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican mayoral candidate, has run a campaign against David N. Dinkins that repeatedly raised Mr. Dinkins's failure to pay taxes, disparities in reports on the sale of stock and his relationship with Robert (Sonny) Carson, a black community leader who has made statements against whites.
''Why does he always wait until he gets caught?'' asked one Giuliani television commercial, produced by Roger Ailes, who is also the media adviser to Mr. Courter. As the race tightened last week, Mr. Dinkins went on the attack, running a commercial that charged Mr. Giuliani with switching positions throughout his career. Mr. Giuliani, meanwhile, has taken a softer tack.
But the current campaign tends to obscure what happened in the primary, when Mayor Edward I. Koch, an underdog whose opponents had already painted him as mean spirited on race, ran a positive campaign against Mr. Dinkins. Polls showed he came close to overcoming Mr. Dinkins. Some experts say that if not for the racially motivated killing in Bensonhurst, which reminded voters of racial divisions during the Koch years, he might just have won.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Is East Europe Too Amazing for the West?

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
AS one astounding development succeeds another in what used to be known as the Soviet bloc, it is no longer visionary to think of the possibility of a new Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals by the end of the century. The extent of change in the East became even clearer last week, but so did the implication that the Western countries may soon have to rethink some fundamental assumptions of the old postwar order if they want to help shape the new one.
The first of these is what Europe is. Until a few months ago, the governments of the 12 countries of the European Community thought its original promise would be fulfilled if they created a single market of 320 million people, with no legal, trade or travel barriers by 1992. Now Poland and Hungary are clamoring for associate-membership status, and finding sympathetic listeners in West Germany, France and even Britain. The community is slowly developing a consensus that it should provide the food, loan guarantees and investment capital that it believes could spell the difference between success and failure for the Poles and Hungarians. Now it is hoping to bring the United States to the same conclusion. 
No less far reaching are the implications for security in the 1990's. Hopes are high that the huge conventional and nuclear arms reductions the Soviet Union and the United States are discussing in Vienna and Geneva could lead, soon, to the chance to convert both NATO and the Warsaw Pact alliances from instruments of mutual deterrence into organizations of mutual reassurance, creating a zone of security from San Diego to Vladivostok.
As these implications dawn on leaders from Bonn to Washington, the sense of urgency is increasing. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said in San Francisco last week that the Soviet ''new thinking'' promised possibilities, but that the United States should seize the opportunity. The same day, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, acknowledged that the invasion of Afghanistan was illegal.
Two days later, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev applied the lesson of Afghanistan to Eastern Europe. In effect, he gave his seal of approval to Poland's first non-Communist government since the wars, and encouraged Hungary to go down the same path. Hungary was already ahead of him, its leaders proclaiming to a cheering crowd of 100,000 that their country was no longer a Communist Hungarian People's Republic but simply the Republic of Hungary, planning to become a democracy.
One consequence of Hungary's decision to open its borders with Austria was an exodus of 40,000 East Germans that cost that country's hard-line leader, Erich Honecker, his job earlier this month. Last week Egon Krenz went before the nominal legislature in Berlin for confirmation as his successor, and 52 members voted against him or abstained. He said he would listen to the East Germans who had elected not to flee, and hundreds of thousands of them held him to his word, taking to the streets in East Berlin, Dresden and Leipzig.
Now, the wonder - or worry - is whether the ultimate logic of an East Germany without Communist autocracy would be one German state instead of two.
President Bush said last week that he wasn't going to be ''stampeded into overreacting'' to change in Eastern Europe, but he added that he didn't share some Western European fears about German reunification either, because West Germany was firmly anchored in the West.
In Europe, too, the realization seems to be sinking in that if reunification did occur, it would not be in this century. In a speech in Strasbourg, President Francois Mitterrand of France seemed to agree, dismissing fears of ''intellectuals and journalists'' that change in the East could lead to ''dislocation'' in the NATO alliance and the European Community. ''Couldn't it produce the opposite effect?'' he asked. ''My conclusion is simple: We must strengthen and accelerate the political construction of Europe.''
Within that simple idea lurk great complexities. In Brussels, diplomats and military officers struggling with the conventional arms reductions that now seem within reach say that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact would be needed for years, just to oversee treaty compliance and insure stability. But all the allies except the United States want NATO to relax its restrictions on trade in technology with the East, and last week Washington was alone in arguing against relaxation.
Powerful disagreements remain about what the single market of 1992 should be, powerful enough to cause a break between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and her longtime Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, who resigned. Should the European Community of 1992 be just a free-trade market, as Mrs. Thatcher wants, a social organism, as the European Commission wants, or a federation, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany wants?
Poland needs emergency food aid, more than the $169 million President Bush has pledged so far, just to get through the winter, and both Poland and Hungary need huge infusions of capital and loan guarantees to convert to free-market economies. But the Western response has been only tentative until recently. Last month, the European Community's executive commission, coordinating aid from 24 Western countries, suggested $660 million for next year. More than that now seems likely to be provided to Poland alone by the United States, West Germany and France, all of which have been raising their pledges.
Unless the West acts soon, the West German Government warns, reform - in Poland at least - could fail, encouraging Rumania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany to stick with their neo-Stalinist systems and ending the dream of a new, united Europe. As Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German Foreign Minister, said in a recent speech in Frankfurt, ''History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities which emerge from these reforms for the whole of Europe.''

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Tearing at the Deep Roots of Protectionism

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the Bush Administration sought in Geneva last week to push the world toward a freer agricultural economy, it was facing opposition not only from Europe but from some important farm interests at home.
 
The problem is that the United
States cannot get more open markets abroad without sacrificing protection for some of its own. In many countries, price supports and import curbs keep internal food prices high, creating excess production. As surpluses rise, they are unloaded on world markets, depressing prices and hurting farmers elsewhere. 
Almost all nations maintain distorting farm subsidies and other programs. ''Our European colleagues have said repeatedly that there are no angels in agricultural trade,'' said Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter. ''We agree. The question is how do we get closer to heaven?''
Mr. Yeutter turned his eyes to the sky as the United States disclosed its long-awaited plan in the current Uruguay Round of negotiations to liberalize trade. The round, which began three years ago at the Uruguay resort of Punta del Este, is scheduled to conclude next year.
The American plan seeks to achieve free trade in agriculture and eliminate most farm subsidies by the year 2000.
Predictably, the European Community, whose long-established farm-support programs have contributed to economic integration of the 12 member states, bristled. Ray MacSharry, the Community's commissioner for agriculture, said the proposals ''could not be considered as a basis for negotiation.'' The Japanese, with the most highly protected farmers in the world, were also critical.
And certain American farm groups that have grown used to subsidies and protection against imports - peanut farmers, sugar growers and dairy producers, among others - found themselves cheering the naysayers.
The United States also presented sweeping proposals to reduce restrictions on financial, construction, tourism and other services, and to enforce greater protection for patents, copyrights and other intellectual property. The American negotiators want rules for services similar to those written for commerce in goods four decades ago under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
One reason is basic economic self-interest. The United States is probably the world's most efficient provider of both food and services, and the $1 trillion in food and services represents half of world trade.
Under current conditions, said United States Trade Representative Carla A. Hills, ''corn growers in Iowa, lawyers in New York, citrus farmers in Florida, high-tech manufacturers in California, and a host of our best and most competitive entrepreneurs from coast to coast are denied the chance to do what they do best - compete fairly and squarely in international markets.''
Yet while the proposals won the strong backing of American businesses from American Express to construction companies, the farm plan is stirring anxiety. More than 30,000 peanut growers, shielded from foreign competition by strict import quotas, would be ''devastated,'' said Walter H. Mitchell, executive director of the Georgia Peanut Producers Association.
The nation's 160,000 dairy farmers, while facing limited foreign competition, have been content with the current price supports, enacted to insure ample milk supplies. ''Producers want predictability,'' said James C. Barr, chief executive of the National Milk Producers Federation. ''We're pretty nervous right now.'' Though foreign sugar production is far cheaper, only one million tons of sugar is being allowed into the United States this year - a tiny portion of domestic consumption - compared with five million tons in the early 1980's. Quotas and price supports cost American consumers $3 billion a year.
The growers say they would change their ways if other countries did. But they are skeptical. ''Our country's proposal is theoretically wonderful, but practically it's pie in the sky,'' said Pete de Gravelles, general manager of the American Sugar Cane League in New Orleans.
Predictably, farm groups with the biggest chance for export gains -the great mid-continent grain and soybean producers and the cotton and rice growers of the South - are the biggest backers of freer trade. Largely reflecting such interests, the 3.5 million-member American Farm Bureau said that it ''strongly supports'' more market-oriented agriculture, but that other countries must make concessions.
It is widely expected that a farm bill due to clear Congress next year will continue all existing programs. But there could be fierce battles on Capitol Hill if an agreement is reached in Geneva, for the lawmakers would then be called on to remove American farmers' protections to meet the new international obligations.
On one point there is agreement: liberalization would greatly benefit the world's taxpayers and consumers. The Administration assesses the cost of current farm policies at almost $200 billion a year for the European Community and the United States together.
''If we let this opportunity fade,'' said Mr. Yeutter, who was Trade Representative under President Ronald Reagan, ''the agricultural situation will be worse than the economic havoc any natural disaster may cause.''

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
A New Mayor, Just in Time For the Hard Time After the Boom

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
A FEW months ago Felix G. Rohatyn caused a stir when he told the City Club that he believed New York may be heading for a period even more painful than the fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
The investment banker qualifies as an authority on the city's problems in the 1970's, since he helped resolve them. Mr. Rohatyn is also chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the agency established in those bad old days to offer financial aid to the city and keep an eye on its books, and so is knowledgeable about the current problems. And if some regard him as prone to a gloomy view, his pessimism has since been echoed by others.
Mayor Edward I. Koch, himself not one to shy away from bad fiscal news, added the latest confirmation of hard times last week, outlining a more than half-a-billion-dollar gap in the budget for the fiscal year that ends in June and putting forth a package of spending cuts and other measures to close it. Not since the early 1980's has the city had to grapple with so big a budgetary hole so late in its fiscal year. 
Mr. Koch's plan entails $200 million of cuts that would affect nearly every city agency. And even if Mr. Koch's successor follows the plan, he will be faced with a large deficit in the next fiscal year that is likely to grow larger still after a new labor settlement with municipal workers is negotiated. Nor will he have much time for on-the-job training. The next financial plan by Mayor David N. Dinkins or Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is due two or three weeks after Inauguration Day on Jan. 1.
A part of the problem is a lag in revenues from almost every important tax the city imposes. Comparing this fiscal year's first quarter proceeds with those from the same period last year, the general corporation tax was down 18 percent, the mortgage recording tax was down 25 percent and the real property transfer tax was down 30 percent. Sales tax revenues lagged behind the inflation rate. The declines might seem insignificant in a $27 billion budget, but to Paul Dickstein, the city budget director, they signal ''barely perceptible economic growth and could be the forerunner of a recession.''
New York City boomed through much of the 1980's, driven by the financial services industry. Then came the stock market plunge of October 1987.
 
After the Fall
In a recent briefing on what has happened since, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the growth in employment the city enjoyed in the 1980's had stopped. It was to be expected that Wall Street would retrench and it did, losing 15,000 jobs in the two years since the stock market fall after gaining an average of 12,000 jobs in each of the five previous years. But the manufacturing sector, which was already thought to be down to the bone, lost even more jobs - 21,000. ''I don't know how to account for it, except with a sigh,'' Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Mr. Ehrenhalt saw hope in the average pay of private sector workers in the city. It stood at $31,700 last year, a 9 percent increase from 1987 and $10,000 more than the national average, suggesting, he said, ''New York City's resilience and its prodigious capacity to generate income.''
Then again, as of 1987 nearly one in four New York City residents was living below the poverty level, a percentage that had not been significantly changed by the preceeding years of improving economic health.
Nor does it seem likely that there will be a quick turnaround. Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group that watches the city's fiscal issues, said that for nearly three decades the New York City economy has been characterized by long swings of growth and long swings of decline. ''If you're a cycle man, it suggests that we're at the top and starting down,'' he said, ''and when you start down, it's not an overnight thing.''
All this would be bad enough but, as Mr. Rohatyn, Mr. Horton, Mr. Dickstein and others have noted, the economy is sagging and tax revenues are drooping just as the demand for city services is rising. Crack addiction has put pressure on the criminal justice system and is blamed for a surge in child abuse reports. AIDS is straining the health care network. Homelessness has compelled the city to undertake a costly housing rehabilitation effort.
Still, there are differences from 1975. The city operates under more rigorous accounting rules that discourage such practices as the pumping of capital money into the operating budget or selling bonds backed by dubious sources of revenue. Fiscal watchdogs issue periodic reports analyzing the city's budget and the Financial Control Board is prepared to step in and run it if City Hall demonstrates an inability to live within its means. Too Tight or Too Loose? That budget has grown substantially, and although the administration insists it is already stretched tightly others have suggested there is room for more trimming and greater efficiency.
''We're not going to have a bankruptcy crisis,'' said Mr. Rohatyn, ''and I don't believe we're going to be shorn of market access.'' In fact, even though Mr. Koch will not be around to carry out most of the budget cuts he planned, two major rating services, which affect the ease with which the city can enter the financial markets, responded positively to his program. And while some investors have sold city securities, jittery about the city's finances and the coming transition, , the administration is moving ahead with plans for a refinancing of bonds.
But in meeting the challenges of the 1990's City Hall will need a large measure of self reliance, at least over the near term. Washington pulled back from many of its commitments to the city during the Reagan years and is not likely to change soon. And New York State has serious budget problems of its own.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Northeast Forests, Too, Get Congress's Interest

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
CONGRESSIONAL debate over the future of American forests has almost always concentrated on the vast timber-growing areas of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. But slowly, the future of another heavily forested region, the Northeast, has begun to stir concern on Capitol Hill.
Unlike the Northwest or Alaska, the Northeast is not mainly concerned with how many trees should be logged and at what cost. Instead, places like Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, New Hampshire's North Country, the Maine Woods and the Adirondack Mountains of New York are increasingly troubled by the encroachment of real estate development. 
''The forests of New Hampshire, as are those of our neighboring states, are being subdivided, chopped up,'' said Paul O. Bofinger, president of the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests.
The forests of New England and New York are popular spots for tourism, and many people are willing to pay top dollar for a piece of the good life. But more and more residents of the states have complained that the changes threaten the land's traditional uses - commercial logging and recreation like hiking, hunting and fishing.
In the last year, New York and the three northern New England states turned to Washington for help.
At the outset, they did not ask Congress for much. Among residents of the rugged woodland areas, there is great suspicion of government in general and of federally imposed solutions. About 85 percent of the 26 million acres of the forests in the four states are privately owned by individuals or companies. The residents like it that way, because they don't want Washington to tell them whether they can hunt or drive snowmobiles through the woods.
Lawmakers authorized the United States Forest Service to work with the states, conservationists and the forest products industry to study what was happening in the northern forests and to propose ways to deal with the changes. This month, the Forest Service released a report that told Congress what many people in the Northeast already knew.
Changes in land ownership ''pose a threat to the long-term integrity and traditional uses of the land'' in parts of region, said George M. Leonard, associate chief of the Forest Service, in testimony before a House subcommittee last week.
Land values have risen sharply. Today, in many spots throughout the northern forests, a property owner can make more money selling woodland for development than for timber production. An average acre sold for timber growing might bring $100, Mr. Bofinger said, but the same acre sold for its real estate value could bring 10 times as much.
Big corporations like the Great Northern Paper Company and the International Paper Corporation are under pressure to sell vast tracts to raise cash, lest they become takeover targets. That could mean cashing in undervalued timberlands. The region got a taste of this last year when the Diamond International Corporation put its vast timber holdings on the block, eventually selling some of it to developers. Diamond's move led to protests in all four states.
Once the Forest Service study is in final form early next year, Congress will be faced with many choices. The report offers lawmakers two dozen strategies for preserving the Northeast forests.
 
Incentives for Owners
Among them are proposals for the creation of tax incentives for landholders who continue to maintain their land for timber growing and suggestions that the Government purchase environmentally sensitive tracts. It appears likely that more than one approach ultimately will be employed.
''Traditional solutions will not meet the challenge of long-term protection,'' the report said.
For example, the Forest Service suggested that owners who agree not to develop their land for 10 years be given favorable tax treatment on capital gains income from the sale of timber. Family landowners could have their land assessed for estate tax purposes on the basis of its current use rather than its potential developed value. That might reduce the incentive to liquidate timber holdings to pay taxes. Landowners who sell to public agencies or conservation groups would not pay income tax on the gains.
Increased use of conservation easements was also recommended. Under this approach, government pays owners to give up their rights to develop their land. The report raised the possibility of creating a national forest or park but pointed out local resistance to this idea.
Indeed, an important consideration for Congress will be the Forest Service's conclusion, based on public hearings and interviews, that residents liked the status quo, that most of the land is in private hands and that owners generally permit free or inexpensive access to those lands. Also, they noted the economic importance of the forest industry in the region.
''Although many who commented said that environmental and economic conditions could be improved,'' said Mr. Leonard, ''most expressed a desire to maintain the northern forest as it exists today.''

HEADLINE: For Mayor: David Dinkins

 BODY:
What a disappointing campaign: voters have heard almost as much about Jackie Mason and Jesse Jackson as about David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani. So far, the two candidates haven't even managed to debate each other.
The sorry nature of this contest makes a hard choice harder. Neither man has demonstrated compelling qualifications for the job Ed Koch has filled for half a generation. Their candidacies, both plausible, are also flawed. Democrat Dinkins has shown little in the way of managerial skills; Republican Giuliani has demonstrated few political skills. Taking into account his understanding of New York, we cast our vote for David Dinkins. 
Rudolph Giuliani is, at age 45, energetic, sensible and ambitious. He's a former United States Attorney who offers a clear message to voters upset by instances of corruption in the Koch administration. His experience as a prosecutor means he knows the underside of society; he's hardly naive about politics. But he is a novice, having never before held elective office. That's not just a formal deficiency. Serving an unruly, sometimes unreasonable public requires skills that do not automatically accompany an analytical mind.
After a deplorable start, Mr. Giuliani has got his campaign on track, done his homework and now makes credible arguments about issues. Yet it's often hard to discern where he stands. He's a Kennedy Democrat who turned Reagan Republican who now runs as a Republican-Liberal.
Likewise, there's not much in Mr. Giuliani's career or campaign that shows an instinct for managing savage conflicts. He analyzes problems rationally. But how well does he handle people's irrationalities? Is he apt to be harsh and moralistic? More than once as a prosecutor, Mr. Giuliani pursued defendants with unseemly zealotry.
Mr. Dinkins is a 62-year-old lawyer and former marine who has spent two decades serving the city, most recently as Manhattan Borough President. He has a reputation for indecision and reinforced it during the campaign. When questions were raised about a stock transfer to his son, he dodged and delayed, transforming what might have been just a stumble into a storm - and reviving questions about his failure to file tax returns 16 years ago. On some issues, Mr. Dinkins takes troubling positions. He still supports the damaging concept of commercial rent control; unwisely, he would delay the city's first garbage-burning incinerator. Yet these are flaws of judgment or matters of honest dispute.
What no one disputes is his most evident characteristic. New York knows David Dinkins to be, above all, a conciliator. If he sometimes takes forever to make up his mind, his ultimate decisions are generally prudent. His instinct is to unify. He gave an example two weeks ago, when he met a crowd of booing whites in Bensonhurst. He addressed them calmly, without rancor, and ultimately won some grudging applause.
This decency can help the city confront its biggest foreseeable problems: a sagging economy and tension between the races. The two go together. Because tax revenues are down, the city already faces a deficit of half a billion or more. The next mayor will have to ask for, and sell, sacrifice to all New Yorkers, most notably the poor citizens hurt most by reductions in city services. Mr. Dinkins seems better qualified to persuade all New Yorkers to share the burdens ahead.
That's also true for another reason: race. Mr. Dinkins would be New York's first black mayor - a fact likely to instill a sense of pride and participation in blacks and other minority groups, following the historical ethnic pattern.
A vote for Rudolph Giuliani is a gamble. It might be a gamble worth taking because, as a Republican, he'd bring a whole new team into a city government long run by Democrats, and because he might learn to excel. But voters know little about him, and even less about the people he might appoint. He lacks experience as a political professional, and nowhere is such professionalism more needed than in City Hall.
David Dinkins, warts and all, is a known quantity. He's a practical Democrat who has come up through the ranks and who knows what he stands for. He understands New York's government, neighborhoods and people. He is not the ideal candidate but he is a good man likely to make a decent mayor.

HEADLINE: TOPICS OF THE TIMES;
Loophole for an Earthquake

 BODY:
Where did Congress suddenly find $3.5 billion for earthquake disaster relief? In a loophole. If the quake had hit last month, as Hurricane Hugo did, money to aid its victims would have had to come from cutting other programs. But, as luck would have it, the deadline for trimming this year's budget deficit has passed now, and with it this year's spending ceiling.
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law says that the deficit in fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, can't exceed $110 billion. But the final official tally of each fiscal year's deficit is made on Oct. 15, just two weeks into the year. Rather than measure actual results, the law only requires an early forecast, based on legislation enacted before Oct. 15 and data on the economic outlook. Anything that comes later is ignored.
The earthquake did not work its devastation until Oct. 17, and Congress did not approve the aid bill until last week. With no budget ceiling to worry about, the bill passed easily. An earlier, smaller bill for Hurricane Hugo relief was complicated by the need to find cuts in other programs.
What will it take to make Congress confront the fallacies of its budget process? Apparently more than a hurricane, or an earthquake.

HEADLINE: What's Keeping Us From Building New Cities;
Part of the Problem

 BODY:
To the Editor:
By proposing that we abandon old cities for new ones in rural areas, William Safire (column, Sept. 25) is suggesting that we also abandon an entire population of the poor, the preservation of an American architectural heritage and the continuation of a 200-hundred-year-old culture. It is precisely the creation of ''Levittowns'' that has debased the economic viability of most cities in the United States, encouraged the use of the automobile and increased the rate of urban sprawl. Suburbanization has not enhanced the social well-being of anyone except the white, middle-class population, who saw an opportunity to flee the crowded, dirty and, yes, black and ethnic urban centers of the first half of the 20th century. 
What makes Mr. Safire believe that these new cities will be any different? In ''The Crabgrass Frontier: A History of Suburbanization in the United States,'' Kenneth Jackson develops the argument that suburbanization has mostly occurred because public policy has supported metropolitan sprawl. Moreover, he shows that America has suburbanized because Federal land development policy since World War II has been inequitable and made with a racial bias.
Mr. Safire is viewing cities as an economic creation and is not considering the social consequences of his scheme. Although economics is the primary reason for urbanization, it would be ignorant to argue that cultural institutions that have evolved out of early urban settlements in the United States do not constitute just as equally the meaning and importance of a city.
Despite the lack of need for businesses to be close together or of retailers to have stores, people do have a fundamental need to be near one another. Human interaction is what makes life meaningful. The narrowness of Mr. Safire's urban vision epitomizes the ever-increasing privatization of American culture. His land-development pattern leaves little room for the public realm.
Mr. Safire should seriously consider exactly who will benefit from his scheme.

HEADLINE: What's Keeping Us From Building New Cities;
Princeton and Irvine

 BODY:
To the Editor:
What William Safire identifies as new cities on the peripheries of American metropolises (column, Sept. 25) are better understood by the word ''sprawl'' (defined by Prof. Richard F. Lamb as ''the seemingly unorganized scattering of homes and businesses across a landscape with no focal points or nodes'').
In 1958, the editors of Fortune magazine sponsored a volume called ''The Exploding Metropolis,'' which is the classic statement of the problem. ''You can't stop progress,'' wrote William H. Whyte, one of the contributors, ''yet much more of this kind of progress and we shall have the paradox of prosperity lowering our real standard of living.'' 
We can measure the prognostication in two very different instances.
Princeton, N.J., 60 miles from New York City and Philadelphia, is a university community dating from the 18th century. Since 1945, the vast popularity of living and working there has put the charms associated with the community at risk. Sensing its own lure, Princeton University acquired 850 acres from the Rockefeller Medical Institute in 1951 and transformed them into the Forrestal Campus.
What evolved is a mix of academic, scientific and business enterprises. Soon, the new campus, a few miles to the east, was occupied by companies in research and development, including I.B.M., Mobil, Squibb, RCA, Xerox and Johnson & Johnson.
Most important, this spawned a 26-mile stretch along Route 1 known as the Princeton Corridor. Its concentration of office facilities is unsurpassed between New York City and Washington. One study, by geographers for the Department of Commerce, anticipates 12 million to 15 million square feet of office space by the mid-1990's, surpassing downtown Newark and making it New Jersey's largest downtown.
Then consider Irvine, Calif., in Orange County, about 40 miles south of Los Angeles, a planned community that was incorporated only in 1971. It was envisioned as a model for suburban growth. Some viewed it as an American standard for the next century. A system for local control was to offset the massive growth that enveloped much of the county since Disneyland was constructed at Anaheim in 1955. Forty distinctive residential villages were planned, with the new campus of the University of California as cultural focus.
As Irvine nears the 20th anniversary of its incorporation, it has not escaped the magnetic influence of Los Angeles. It suffers from the same centerless existence that afflicts much of the multicounty metropolitan expanse of Southern California.
If the dimensions and ramifications of sprawl are self-apparent, there is too little consensus about what to do. Regional planning, ideally devised and administered by state-level agencies, seems the logical answer. Yet anyone familiar with the political economy of the American metropolis recognizes the difficulty in attaining the consent of the locally governed for such resolutions. Residents of each locale prize their autonomy over neighboring communities.
All the while, given our longstanding inability to formulate policies that control metropolitan sprawl, we continue to suffer its perilous consequences.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Nassau

BYLINE: By CATHARINE SKIPP; CATHARINE SKIPP, who works in the Miami bureau of The Times, often visits the Bahamas.

 BODY:
The Bahamian capital, Nassau, spared the destruction that Hurricane Hugo wreaked on the neighboring Caribbean, is in the midst of its biggest construction boom ever. Casinos are being renovated and expanded and new development is evident all over the island. A flourishing economy is apparent in a multitude of new city buses, shopping malls and services.
With the buildup of hotels and resorts, the flavor of Nassau and its two big tourist enclaves, Paradise Island and Cable Beach, has lost some of its island spice. But with that loss has come a more businesslike approach to tourism, its biggest industry. The Bahamian Government has set up education and training programs to attune residents to the benefits of tourism. Carnival, the cruise line that owns the Crystal Palace Resort and runs the casino there, has spent $4 million putting its staff through an in-house service academy, with workers required to attend refresher courses every six months.
Yet many of the formalities of the more than 250 years of English rule are still evident in the workings of the Government and in the colonial beauty of the streets and many of the restaurants and hotels. 
The 80-square-mile island of New Providence where Nassau is situated is home to well over half the 320,000 people that live in the chain of more than 700 islands and cays. Over the years Nassau has become synonymous with the whole island in both name and character. Paradise Island, a much smaller island just to the north, is joined to New Providence by a bridge.
Taxis are expensive and attractions spread out, so renting a car makes sense for overnight guests. English traditions prevail, with left-hand driving and many roundabouts.
 
Getting There
Nassau International Airport, the primary gateway, with several flights daily on various carriers from major cities in the United States, is a long drive from the resort areas. Paradise Island has a new strip that drops you right in the middle of everything. Seaplanes fly out of Fort Lauderdale and Miami directly to Paradise Island, as does Paradise Island Airlines out of Miami.
A passport or birth certificate is needed to enter the Bahamas. United States or Bahamian currency is accepted in all places. Despite the proliferation of ''Bahama No Problem'' T-shirts, Nassau does have some street crime. Visitors should take sensible precautions like locking hotel rooms and rental cars and not wandering off in deserted areas at night.
 
The Reefs
Nassau is surrounded by clear blue water because there are no rivers emptying cloudy sediment into the sea. Against the white sandy bottom you can see clearly to depths of 60 feet. Whether you prefer to see fish on the end of a hook, from the safety of a glass-bottom boat or underwater, an abundance of trips is available.
Perhaps the easiest and most convienent view is to be had at Coral World, an underwater observatory and marine park recently opened off the road between downtown Nassau and Cable Beach on Silver Cay. An observation tower allows visitors both a look at the skyline of New Providence and at the ocean floor 15 feet below. The tower is built in the middle of a natural reef teeming with lobsters, grouper, angelfish and hundreds of other fish attracted by daily feedings, as well as coral and plant life. Huge tanks contain sharks, stingrays and turtles and a building housing 24 aquariums displaying aquatic life from all over the world provides an education on undersea life.
Coral World is open all year. Admission is $12, $8 for children (rising to $14 and $10 respectively on Jan. 1).
Hartley's Underwater Exploration (809-393-8234) takes visitors reef walking. Groups of six don large brass diving helmets tethered to an air supply and are led by the hand around a reef. A big friendly grouper is Mr. Hartley's sidekick and nuzzles up to visitors while Mr. Hartley snaps their picture ($5). Visitors are transported to and from the reef on a 57-foot cabin cruiser, the Pied Piper. A caveat: at 20 minutes the reef walk is a bit short in duration. The cost is $35 a person; the Pied Piper leaves the docks at Nassau Yacht Haven marina (on East Bay Street just east of the Paradise Island bridge) daily at 9:30 A.M. and 1:30 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday.
A variety of diving and snorkeling trips can be arranged through Nigel Bower, owner of Caribbean Images. His 31-foot cigarette boat can transport people down to Spirit Cay and Highborne Cay in the Exuma Islands about 40 miles away. The $130-a-person cost includes a full day of diving or snorkeling, all equipment, food and beverages. Short trips to a private beach on nearby Rose Island are about $85 a person a day.
Mr. Bower can also make arrangements for overnight lodging on Rose Island for an additional $300 a night for a group of up to eight people. A four-day, three-night package is available on Spirit Cay, a private island, for $3,600 for eight people, all inclusive. Mr. Bower can be reached at 809-362-1467 or 809-322-3724.
Fishing charters can be arranged through Nassau Yacht Haven (809-393-8173) and Hurricane Hole marina (809-363-3000). Prices depend on what type of fish are being pursued, which determines where and how far the boats go.
Calypso I and II (809-363-3577) are party boats that go out for day trips to Blue Lagoon and on evening dinner cruises. Each trip is $35 a person and leaves from Paradise Island docks. No cruises are run on Sunday and Wednesday. The day trip leaves at 10 A.M. and returns at 4 P.M. and includes a buffet lunch, wine and fruit punch, snorkeling at Blue Lagoon and a live band. The three-hour dinner cruise leaves the dock at 8 P.M. and includes a steak and grouper dinner and a Bahamian band.
 
Casinos
Gambling draws many to the island although Bahamian citizens are prohibited from visiting the casinos. The Government owns both 30,000-square-foot casinos but they are leased and operated by American companies. Akin to Atlantic City or Las Vegas, the Paradise Island Casino and Crystal Palace at Cable Beach are glitzy affairs, with all the usual games of chance, entertainment and the like. Crystal Palace has been open only a year in the same location as the old Cable Beach casino. The show ($38 for show and dinner or $25 for show and two drinks; 809-327-6200) features the usual singers and dancers and a good magician.
At the Paradise Island Resort and Casino, recently taken over by Merv Griffin's group and under renovation, the ambiance is not quite as glitzy or frenetic as Crystal Palace's but it has a large gaming floor. The show ($42 for dinner and show and $27 for the show and two drinks; 809-363-3000) also features a magician, a comic and dancers. Both shows include some topless dancing.
 
Where to Eat
Every few steps in the business dictrict of Nassau you pass a place to eat, with conch fritters and conch salad to be found on almost every corner. Everything from American fast-food chains and Tony Roma's rib restaurant to expensive white-glove dining is available. The big hotels have a multitude of restaurants to choose from. Around town there are several restaurants worth noting.
The restaurant in the 250-year-old Graycliff Hotel and Restaurant (West Hill Street; 809-322-2796) has a longstanding reputation as being one of the finest in the area.
Five dining rooms overlook the beautiful gardens. The menu features island specialties and traditional fare and an exceptional wine list. Entrees are in the $27 to $36 range. Reservations and jackets for men are required.
Some say Sun And . . . (Lakeview Avenue off East Shirley Street; 809-393-1205) is competing with Graycliff. Ronny Deryckere, the former chef at Greycliff, owns Sun And . . ., which specializes in French, American and Bahamian cuisine and wild game imported from Europe. Entrees range from $23 to $32.50 a person. Dinner is served from 6:30 to 10 P.M. daily except Monday. Reservations are required. Men should wear jackets. Buena Vista (Delancy Street just off Nassau Street; 809-322-2811) serves Continental cuisine and Bahamian seafood in elegant surroundings.

Where to Stay
Nassau, Cable Beach and Paradise Island offer everything from deluxe, private mansions or glitzy hotel suites to the very basic, rustic family-run hotel. The big chains all have hotels here and the Bahamian Department of Tourism runs a reservation service (800-327-0787).
The Ocean Club (809-326-2501) on the beach at Paradise Island is an all-year resort with a backdrop of cloister and gardens for the 71-room hotel and villas. It has clay tennis courts, an 18-hole P.G.A. golf course and a swimming pool. Prices start at $190 a night for a double and go as high as $875 a night for the villas.
Graycliff Hotel (West Hill Street; 809-322-2796), situated in the same mansion as the restaurant in downtown Nassau has 14 beautifully decorated rooms. Rates begin at $150 a night for a double and are booked months in advance.
The out-of-the-way Divi Bahamas Resort and Country Club (809-326-4391 or 800-367-3484) is situated on the southwest shore of the island on the site of the former South Ocean Beach Club. The main hotel is on the P.G.A. golf course, considered by many to be one of the best on the island. The resort is in the process of opening more hotel rooms and a time-share complex on the ocean will open this winter. The skin-diving operation is first rate, it has tennis and wind surfing and horseback riding is available nearby. Rates start at $170 for a double. Buses run all day and late into the night to downtown Nassau and the casinos.
Carnival's Crystal Palace Resort and Casino (809-327-6200 or 800-222-7466), which opened last December on Cable Beach, is an 867-room behemoth with a golf course, tennis courts, health club, water sports and the works. Rates start at $180 for a double.
Budget choice: Buena Vista, at the same address as the restaurant, has five comfortable rooms with a homey atmosphere, each with private bath and air-conditioning, for $80 a night for a double ($70 for a single).

HEADLINE: Japan's Emperor Of Film

BYLINE: Ian Buruma; Ian Buruma's most recent book is ''God's Dust: A Modern Asian Journey,'' published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.

 BODY:
WE THAT IS TO SAY, A GROUP OF Japanese journalists and I - were waiting for Akira Kurosawa. It was February, the week of Emperor Hirohito's funeral, and the director was to hold a press conference about his new film, ''Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' shot in various locations around Japan. It is to be released next spring.
There was a slight air of apprehension in the dingy room at Toho film studios in Tokyo, where Kurosawa filmed such masterpieces as ''To Live'' and parts of ''Seven Samurai.'' It was a bit as though we were schoolboys waiting for the stern headmaster, for Kurosawa has a reputation for being difficult.
He arrived on time, tall, smiling, in dark glasses and jeans, not at all the legendary tyrant for whom the Japanese press a long time ago coined the nickname ''Tenno,'' or ''Emperor.'' Seventy-nine years old, he looked more like a retired general who has taken up carpentry or painting. 
He began the press conference with a series of complaints about the state of Japanese cinema: ''It's as if the cinema owners don't want people to watch movies in this country; they close too early, the sound systems are terrible, the projectionists don't know their jobs. And the films they show are hardly worth seeing anyway; it's by and large the same stuff you see on TV, and why pay for what you can see at home for nothing?
''It's much better in other countries, of course. Why, in America you can watch films day and night, in comfort, properly projected. Moreover, foreign critics do their homework, and they love the cinema, unlike the so-called critics here, who are really more like public relations hacks. Well, are there any questions. . . .?''
After an embarrassed silence, a young television reporter raised his hand, scraped his throat, and, as politely as he knew how, asked whether it was true that Kurosawa was often angry on the set. The reporter might have been thinking of a memorable television documentary of the filming of Kurosawa's last epic film, ''Ran,'' in which the director was seen to torment his first assistant by flying into fearsome rages.
Kurosawa smiled sweetly: ''No, not at all, not at all. That's just an impression created by you reporters. I don't get angry often. How could I? I'd be exhausted if I did.''
He felt for his packet of cigarettes, drew one out and put it in his mouth. He looked for an ashtray, couldn't find one, and peered through his dark glasses with a hint of irritation: ''Why isn't there an ashtray here? Get me an ashtray.'' The film's production manager, Teruyo Nogami, who has worked with Kurosawa since ''Rashomon'' (1950), pointed out that we were not supposed to smoke in this room. Indeed, there was a no smoking sign right behind the director's head. ''Nonsense,'' said Kurosawa, the hint of irritation getting noticeably stronger, ''get me an ashtray at once!'' The ashtray was duly supplied and the avuncular smile reappeared. In the end, Kurosawa usually gets what he wants.
KUROSAWA STRIKES ONE AS A lonely figure in Japan, even more so than might be expected in the case of an exceptional artist. Despite his zest for making films, paintings, sculptures, anything that will serve as an outlet for his prodigious energy, he seems a bit out of step with the society around him - a society which, in his mind, appears to have let him down. Younger critics tend to regard him as an anachronism, an arrogant dinosaur trying in ever more grandiose fashion to recreate a forgotten and, today, irrelevant past. His humanistic concerns and worship of classical art seem out of place in post-modern Tokyo, which worships slick design and immediate sensual gratification. His respect for traditional craftsmanship is regarded as positively eccentric in our fast and plastic age.
Kurosawa's greatest films - among others, ''Rashomon,'' ''Seven Samurai,''
 
''Throne of Blood'' and ''The Lower
Depths'' - were made in the 1950's, the Golden Age of Japanese cinema. In those palmy times, the big studios allowed perfectionists like Kurosawa or Kenji Mizoguchi to make films as they saw fit. If Kurosawa wished to keep his crew and actors on location for days waiting for a perfect sky, the studio bosses would complain but put up with it. If he decided that the facade of a medieval castle, specially built for ''Throne of Blood,'' had to be dismantled and replaced by a three-dimensional one, because the roof didn't look right, well, the bosses didn't like that either, but they allowed him to do as he pleased. If, for the sake of realism, Kurosawa insisted on using real antiques rather than cheap approximations, the bosses shook their heads at the expense, but went along.
In those days, Japanese cinema was still a good business; a few quick formula hits more than paid for Kurosawa's art - and his art made money, too. But in the 1960's, television arrived, and the Japanese film studios never recovered from the shock. They reacted to dwindling cinema audiences by producing cheaper and less imaginative pictures, which caused the audience to dwindle further, leading to more bad films, and so on. By mid-decade, the two great masters of Japan's Golden Age, Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi, had died, leaving Kurosawa to carry on the tradition.
While younger directors adapted to the new age by making cheaper films or working for television, Kurosawa refused. In December 1971, he became so demoralized that he attempted suicide. It was a year after ''Dodes'kaden,'' his first color film, had done poorly, and three years after he withdrew from a disastrous venture in Hollywood - he had been hired to direct the war movie ''Tora! Tora! Tora!'' Rumor had it that he had treated his American actors like soldiers in boot camp, to which they did not take kindly, no matter how famous the director.
True or not, the story illustrates how out of his element Kurosawa must have felt in Hollywood. He was far happier in Siberia, where he made the well-received ''Dersu Uzala'' with Soviet money in 1975.
This is not to say that Kurosawa has no following in Japan. In fact, many of his films have had considerable success at home, and he is still held in awe by most Japanese. But since the ill-fated ''Dodes'kaden,'' Kurosawa has not been able to make a single film without foreign financial support. Steven Spielberg backed ''Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' the special effects are done by George Lucas's company, Industrial Light & Magic, and Warner Bros. will distribute it. The movie will be released first in the United States. The involvement of these American directors, as well as that of Martin Scorsese, who has a small part in the film, is more than professional; they feel they are rescuing a man they consider a master.
''But,'' asked an American visitor in Tokyo, ''aren't the Japanese ashamed that with all their wealth they cannot support the most famous Japanese film maker in the world?'' The simple answer is: no, the Japanese are not particularly ashamed, least of all the studio bosses, who make more money on real estate than on films anyway. As Kurosawa himself puts it, ''There is nothing they hate more than taking a risk on new ideas.''
Kurosawa likes to point out that the Japanese often take pride in their artistic culture only after foreigners have given a project the seal of approval. But, in fact, success abroad can cut both ways; envious locals love to accuse Kurosawa of pandering to foreign tastes, of not being ''purely'' Japanese. When Francis Coppola came to Japan to back Kurosawa's film ''Kagemusha'' (1980), a popular Japanese novelist told the press that only foreigners liked Kurosawa; if Coppola wanted to understand the real Japan, the novelist said, he should see the films of a soft-porn director in fashion at the time.
Then too, Kurosawa's samurai pictures are famous for their homage to the American western -much to the disapproval of some Japanese critics -and he would be the last to deny his admiration for John Ford. Kurosawa has told the American critic Donald Richie that ''westerns have been done over and over again, and in the process a kind of grammar has evolved. I have learned from this grammar of the western.'' His mastery of this influence is such that two of his movies, ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Yojimbo,'' were used as models for the well-known westerns ''The Magnificent Seven'' and ''A Fistful of Dollars.''
But once tainted with the(Continued on Page 64) foreign brush, it would seem, a Japanese artist can never become ''purely'' Japanese again - he loses his sacred bond with the land, like a Brahman who leaves India. When ''Rashomon,'' a film Japanese studio bosses resisted strongly because they claimed they could not understand it, made Kurosawa world famous, winning first prize at the 1951 Venice film festival, some Japanese critics decided it proved the film catered to the Western taste for Oriental exoticism. Others declared that ''Rashomon'' was ''analytical'' and thus ''Western.'' Of course, once the prize was won, the same studio bosses who had resisted the project claimed the success as their own.
No wonder, then, that the old master tends to get tetchy with his countrymen. But why the propensity to pull the emperor down? The answer must be sought, I think, in the traditional nature of Japanese emperor worship. Emperors - real ones, that is -exist precisely to hide or divert attention from the exercise of raw power. Emperors were formally invested with supreme power without being able to exercise it, while the men who did wield power hid behind the sacred imperial symbol. A dual purpose was served: secular power was sanctified and because of the imperial aura it seemed not only natural but inherently benign.
In other words, Japanese power tends to work on the principle of dissimulation: power that does not declare its name, that is naturally benevolent, that is not really power at all. That is why powerful Japanese, though often insufferably arrogant in private, tend to be modest and self-effacing in public.
Kurosawa is not like that. He is neither modest nor self-effacing, and to achieve what he wants he is not always considerate of the ''face'' of others. His strong views are stated with a directness that many Japanese find disconcerting. His extraordinary talent, his directness, his egotism, make Kurosawa stick out in Japan. He has, at considerable personal cost, always resisted this maxim of mediocrity, as have the heroes in his films. He refuses to conform to a society that tends to celebrate the ordinary (heibon) as a virtue. Perhaps this is why in his present film, he has turned away from a time and place he so patently dislikes, to the purely imaginary world of his dreams.
''All my films are dreams,'' Kurosawa said at his press conference, and one sees what he means. Kurosawa's taste for period films, however modern in style, is evidence of a romantic temperament. There are dreamlike scenes, or, at any rate, scenes of make-believe, in several Kurosawa films. In ''One Wonderful Sunday'' (1947), for instance, we see a factory worker and his girlfriend trying to enjoy themselves with no money to spend in bombed-out Tokyo. ''If you don't believe in dreams you can't live properly,'' says the woman at one point.
And they end up inventing the things they cannot afford. They stand in an empty bandshell in the park. He pretends to be a conductor and Schubert's ''Unfinished Symphony'' swells on the soundtrack. He falters, the music stops; she asks us, the audience, to clap our hands, the music swells again, and tears come streaming down. It is Kurosawa at his sentimental worst. At his best, which is very often, Kurosawa's romantic idea that we can make things happen if only we try hard enough, merges with his sharp eye for the weakness of man, to produce great and compassionate art.
Compassion and anger often go together. And Kurosawa, as well as being a sometimes sentimental dreamer, is certainly an angry man. In his fascinating memoir, ''Something Like an Autobiography,'' there is a chapter called ''Congenital Defects,'' the first sentence of which runs: ''I am short-tempered and obstinate.'' His rage is vented on hapless assistants, on stupid critics, oafish censors, pompous authorities, or unimaginative and greedy studio bosses, but these people are merely the targets of tantrums. His real rage is an artistic one, directed only at himself, for not getting his dreams to look perfect, on paper, on the screen. Like all great artists, Kurosawa is driven by the need to get things right.
On the sets of his movies, he is constantly busy, checking a light here, a lens there, adjusting the collar of somebody's coat, making sure of every detail. On locations one sees him striding through fields scouting for different angles, followed by men half his age scrambling to keep up with him. But though he is driven to distraction by incompetent or lazy crew members, he tends to be patient with his actors. Problems are ironed out not by screaming at them - that is reserved for the man who doesn't get the water pressure right in a rain scene -but by coaxing the best out of them through long rehearsals.
Kurosawa's imagery is often violent and extreme. He has said that he likes extreme weather conditions, and indeed many of his most memorable scenes take place in lashing rains, icy snowstorms or suffocating heat. His battle scenes are among the greatest ever put on film. One recalls the long battle in the mud and rain at the end of ''Seven Samurai,'' or the death of Toshiro Mifune, impaled by dozens of arrows in ''Throne of Blood,'' or the grand slaughter of the Takeda clan in ''Kagemusha.'' I saw this last scene being shot and shall always remember Kurosawa, general-like, in his director's chair, ordering the huge mounted army to march to their deaths. All through the battle he didn't move a muscle, every fiber in his body fraught with tension. When it was over, he beamed a smile of deep satisfaction.
VIOLENCE, DREAMS and sentimentality: it is a combination often found in great generals. The source of these emotions is usually embedded in childhood. In his memoir, Kurosawa paints an interesting picture (even in prose, he is more painter than writer) of his early life. He was born in Tokyo, in 1910, the son of a soldier who took pride in his northern samurai ancestry. Pictures of his father, who later became a gym teacher, show a stern man with, as was the martial fashion at the time, a clean-shaven skull.
Akira, by his own account, was a crybaby. Pictures of him, in a kimono and an outsize hat, show a young dreamer. He was such an awkward little boy that his early teachers thought he was backward. There he was, in his words, ''A haircut like a sheltered little sissy's, a belted, double-breasted coat over short pants, red socks and low, buckled shoes. What's more, I was still in a wide-eyed daze and had a face as white as a girl's. I immediately became a laughingstock.''
What brought him out of his shell was a facility for drawing, much encouraged by an imaginative teacher called Mr. Tachikawa, to whom Kurosawa felt grateful for the rest of his life. He began to take a keen interest in such manly pursuits as kendo, Japanese sword fighting. Apparently he was rather weak and never became much good at physical exercises, but he made up for his deficiencies by sheer strength of will: he tried and tried and tried.
Toward the end of his book, Kurosawa sums up his own character: ''I am not especially strong; I am not especially gifted. I simply do not like to show my weakness, and I hate to lose, so I am a person who tries hard. That's all there is to me.''
This was to be the theme of almost all of his films: people overcoming their weakness by force of will, by trying hard. There is a Japanese word for this much admired quality, ''konjo,'' perhaps best translated as ''fighting spirit'' or simply ''guts.'' ''Konjo mono,'' literally ''guts stories,'' are a recognized genre in Japanese novels, films and comic books, a genre that frequently combines violence and sentimentality: the little fellow or girl who never gives up, no matter what it takes. If John Ford is one of Kurosawa's favorite American directors, Frank Capra is another.
Kurosawa's first and already very fine film,''Sugata Sanshiro,'' released in 1943 -a period in Japanese history when fighting spirit was especially admired - was a konjo mono. It is about the physical and, more importantly, spiritual education of a young man. Sanshiro is attracted by a judo master and wishes to acquire his skill. He succeeds and becomes quite a fighter, but the master is not satisfied, because Sanshiro is still a callow and unenlightened youth, with no control over his own strength. In an extraordinary test of will we are shown the process of Sanshiro's enlightenment. He learns a lesson about himself and by extension, about life: the raison d'etre of every Kurosawa hero.
One thing Sanshiro learns is how to contain his power, how to subdue the violence in himself and transform it into an art. As the impetuous hero in a much later samurai picture - ''Sanjuro,'' made in 1962 - is told: ''You cut well. But swords, you know, really good ones, should be kept in their scabbards, and not used at all.'' This is the typical wisdom of much samurai entertainment, the kind of thing Japanese boys still imbibe in comic books.
The theme, then, is a conventional one in Japanese art. Kurosawa's genius lies in the way he tells his stories. The style reflects the theme, for it is all about control, economy of means, simplicity. Kurosawa is known as a masterly editor of his films. He never leaves loose ends. Scenes, however marvelous, are ruthlessly discarded if they impede the flow of the story. This is why many Kurosawa films, though quite long (the original ''Seven Samurai'' was 208 minutes), never seem long. Kurosawa's sense of tempo in his best work is like that of a great composer, with an instinctive feel for the rhythm of his art.
But something happened in the late 1960's. Perhaps it had to do with his switch from black-and-white to color, or his difficulties in getting Japanese backing for his films, or his suicide attempt. Whatever the reason, there appears to be a break between ''Red Beard'' and all the subsequent movies.
It is not that the later films are failures. ''Kagemusha,'' about the tragedy of a simple man made to act the role of a great military lord, only to be discarded like a stage prop at the end, is a fine film. ''Ran,'' Kurosawa's version of ''King Lear,'' set in medieval Japan, has scenes of great beauty. ''Dodes'kaden,'' about the broken dreams of people living in an imaginary shantytown, has moments of high comedy and haunting pathos. But despite the flashes of genius that still shine through, the old genius for simplicity and pacing seems to have been lost. One has the feeling that Kurosawa is a bit like Lear, howling his rage into the stormy winds, only to contain it in the end by becoming increasingly mannered.
Donald Richie, the critic who has done more than anybody to introduce Kurosawa's films to the West, told me a story he had heard which, if true, throws an interesting light on Kurosawa's later development. On a visit to Paris in the late 1960's, Kurosawa apparently met the late Henri Langlois, legendary founder of the Cinematheque Francaise. Langlois, a brilliant but sometimes remarkably flippant man, promised to show the Japanese director a film that would change his life, and proceeded to screen Sergei Eisenstein's ''Ivan the Terrible,'' a mannered work if ever there was one. According to Richie, this event, if it actually took place, ''does seem to have changed Kurosawa's life.''
How his latest film will turn out is, of course, impossible to tell. The sets, looking rather surreal and painted in lurid colors, remind one of ''Dodes'kaden.'' The dream sequences, some set in the days of Kurosawa's youth, some in present-day Japan, some in a timeless world that can only exist in the imagination, are unlike anything Kurosawa has ever done before, unless one counts a rather embarrassing dream sequence in ''Kagemusha'' that was later deleted. The film does, however, lend a kind of symmetry to the life of a man who began as a crybaby, dreaming in art class, and went on to be a keen sword fighter and creator of willful heroes, only to return in the end to his dreams.
I saw him on the set of one of his dreams, sitting in his director's chair, frowning through his dark glasses, which were almost hidden in the shadow of his customary cap. In front of him was a kind of three-dimensional cutout of a van Gogh painting, with a white road leading through a southern French landscape to a huge, orange, van Gogh sun. Kurosawa loved van Gogh as a child, when painting saved him from feeling a failure, and he dreamt of pursuing van Gogh through one of his paintings.
Kurosawa's first assistant asked for quiet in the studio. The red lights came on, the clapper boy stood ready, the actor Akira Terao, playing the young Kurosawa, was on his mark. Kurosawa leaned forward in his chair, all concentration: ''Yoi (ready)! Staato (start)!'' The camera rolled. Terao started walking toward us, searching for van Gogh, to be played by Martin Scorsese. Kurosawa looked at Terao, very intently, seeing perhaps not Terao but his own younger self. When the scene was over, he turned to his cameraman, Takao Saito, and softly said: ''O.K.'' He beamed with satisfaction. He was making another dream come true.

HEADLINE: THE PLAYERS' MAIN MAN

BYLINE: By David A. Kaplan; David A. Kaplan writes often about baseball. He is legal affairs editor for Newsweek.

 BODY:
ONE DAY IN THE middle of the baseball season, nine Houston Astros, in New York for a series against the Mets, spent an afternoon in midtown Manhattan. For 90 minutes they sat around a conference table on the 26th floor of a Third Avenue office tower, listening to Don Fehr, a man more important to their careers than any manager, umpire or opposing pitcher. By many accounts, in fact, it is Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, the players' union, who controls the future of the sport, and his message that afternoon was grim: there is a coming labor war in baseball. 
Dressed in his standard uniform of shirtsleeves and Reeboks, surrounded by shelves of law digests and photographs of legends like Willie Mays and Maury Wills, Fehr fielded the Astros' questions: Could the owners stage a lockout during spring training next February? Might there be a strike later in the year instead? How much money does the union have in reserve for the players? Will there even be baseball in 1990? In general, Fehr's verbal style is lawyerly - careful, intelligent, sometimes rambling - but his answers that day were mean and simple: Yes. Maybe. Plenty. Don't bet on it. Months later, Fehr's stance is largely the same. Sometime soon, probably around Thanksgiving, he will square off against Barry Rona, lead negotiator for the 26 club owners, in bargaining to reach a new labor agreement for Major League Baseball. If the two lawyers can't strike a deal - and their current differences appear intransigent - there may not be a baseball season come next year.
''I expect the worst,'' says Fehr.
BASEBALL'S FIVE-YEAR BASIC Agreement, which governs the employment relationship between players and owners - including the issues of free agency, salary arbitration and pension structure - doesn't expire until Dec. 31. But both camps have been blustering all year long.
Rona and the club owners openly discuss the prospect of a lockout; they've already tried to force language into the contracts of some individual players that would deprive them of pay in case of such a shutdown. And through their Player Relations Committee, which Rona serves as executive director and general counsel, the owners have put aside $200 million in ''a mutual assistance fund'' to help teams meet expenses during a season with no games.
Throughout the summer, scores of athletes routinely dropped by Fehr's office for briefings, much in the manner of the nine Astros. It was even earlier, during spring training, that Fehr traveled across Florida and Arizona with special assistant Mark Belanger, the former Baltimore Oriole shortstop, to gauge sentiment and advise players. ''Before the season ever began,'' says Joe Carter, the Cleveland Indians' outfielder and team labor representative, ''players were asking what was going to happen next year.''
Fehr stops just short of accusing management of looking to break the union, and the only reason he doesn't think the players will strike is that the owners seem so intent on drawing first blood. For its own emergency fund, the union plans to withhold at least $70 million in licensing fees that normally would have been distributed to the players.
All this preparation comes, amazingly, at a time when the game is awash in green. Major League Baseball recently signed network and cable television contracts worth $1.5 billion over four years beginning in 1990, a windfall for each owner of about $14 million per annum. Attendance is at record levels, and despite the pronouncement in April by the Pittsburgh Pirates president Carl Barger that baseball was heading into a ''financial death spiral,'' most clubs are doing better than they were five years ago. The workers aren't starving either: Players earned an average of more than half-a-million dollars this summer.
Why, then, in the name of greed and need, are the principals even contemplating a confrontation that would halt the 1990 season?
That depends on whom you ask.
Rona and the owners cite ''fiscal responsibility'' and the necessity of controlling labor costs. Fehr says salaries should be set by a free market, just as in any other billion-dollar American industry. It's time, he says, to address the inequities borne by younger ballplayers, who lack the freedom of their senior brethren to switch teams as free agents or to have their pay determined by an independent party through salary arbitration. In short, the economic terrain is simple: The players want to get more, the owners want to give less.
For Fehr, however, the stakes extend beyond baseball. ''I recognize that the public cares about these negotiations only because they affect baseball next year,'' he says. ''But the talks are important because they'll show again that something's wrong with American sports. For reasons I can't fathom, we tolerate in sports what we wouldn't accept in any other industry. Can you imagine, here at the end of the 20th century, an annual draft of scientists or exclusive territorial markets for Popsicles or two companies trading insurance salesmen without their permission? If you apply the bizarre labor rules of sports anywhere else, you start laughing.
''For the owners, baseball is all a big game. They don't care that it affects players' lives. For that, we hold them in contempt.''
INTERVIEWING DON-ald Martin Fehr (pronounced, appropriately enough, somewhere between fair and fear) is in itself a little like collective bargaining. So many questions become negotiations: Why are you asking that? Tell me what you already know. What are you really trying to get at, and how come I should answer?
''I'm a straight-shooter,'' he says. ''I never lie.'' And in labor, a field not known for fostering harmonious relations, Fehr is highly regarded for those qualities. But he can also be cagey, crafty and contentious - the stock-in-trade qualities of a negotiator. ''Sure,'' he acknowledges, ''I guess I've been called them all at different times.''
Argumentative but not pugnacious, Fehr, a boyish-looking 41, round-faced, a little pudgy, is, by nature, less labor leader than lawyer; he prefers settlement to confrontation. Unlike his mentor, Marvin Miller, the first head of the players' union and the man who taught baseball about collective bargaining, Fehr is not a labor activist at the core, a romantic about the union mission.
''I'm a politician,'' he explains. ''I think it's important for people to obtain equality of opportunity. This is one way to do it.
''I don't expect the public to view this union's members the same way as the people who work the line in Detroit. I do want people, though, to understand that there is an essential issue of fairness. Despite the money, ballplayers don't have the same rights as everybody else.''
An introspective, soft-spoken man who was born in Indiana and grew up in Prairie Village, Kan., he has been at the helm of the players' union since 1983, but is uncomfortable even now with his notoriety. He dislikes being photographed and many of his interviews are only for background. His interests are eclectic: He likes to go to the ball park with his family; he is also a voracious reader of history, philosophy and esoterica. ''When we're on a plane,'' says Lauren Rich, an assistant union counsel, ''I watch the movie. Don reads about string theory in Scientific American.''
The son of a businessman, Fehr came to the union serendipitously. Following graduation from law school in 1973, he clerked for United States District Court Judge Elmo Hunter of Kansas City, Mo., then joined a small respected labor law firm there. When the landmark arbitration decree, creating baseball's first free agents, was issued in 1975, baseball's owners marched into Federal court in Kansas City to try to overturn it. The union sought a local firm to oppose the owners and chose Fehr's. Because of his experiences in Federal court, the partners had Fehr work on it. They won.
Subsequently, in 1977, Marvin Miller asked Fehr to join the union staff as general counsel. At the end of 1982, Miller retired, and Kenneth E. Moffett - who had been the Federal mediator during the strike that interrupted the 1981 baseball season -took over as executive director. Moffett was dismissed after a 10-month tenure, and the players ultimately turned to Fehr, who agreed to take the title of ''acting executive director'' through 1985, a kind of audition. Now in the fourth year of a six-year contract, at a current salary of $450,000 - one of the highest of any sports union leader - Fehr works a grueling schedule. His duties include administration of lucrative licensing deals, supervising a $440 million pension fund and advising individual players on such matters as drug testing and club discipline. In this season of the Pete Rose gambling scandal, he also handled endless press inquiries, though he is quick to point out that he was not officially involved with Rose, who, as former manager of the Cincinnati Reds, was not eligible for most union services. All this while preparing for the coming negotiations.
Fehr says he wishes for a time when he is not constantly butting heads with the baseball owners. Looking out his office window at a city he doesn't particularly love, he muses about returning to the heartland to teach college or practice law or, he jokes, to have a ''normal labor job like representing the Eastern Airlines machinists.''
BAD BLOOD AT BASEBALL'S bargaining table has been around for nearly a quarter-century. Since 1966 - when Marvin Miller arrived from the United Steelworkers Union and led the players' union into the modern era - there have been five work stoppages: strikes in 1972, 1980, 1981 and 1985, and a lockout in the spring of 1976.
It wasn't always so. Before the union's emergence, going back to the old National League and American Association of the 1880's, clubs treated players like chattel - and got away with it. Under baseball's feudal ''reserve system,'' players, unless traded, sold or fired were forever bound to their clubs. A Yankee, say, could never jump to the Dodgers, so owners set salaries at their pleasure. It was a textbook monopoly, remaining in effect only because of baseball's exemption from Federal antitrust laws, granted in 1922.
Shrewd and impassioned, Marvin Miller was able to unite unsophisticated athletes who'd thought life under the owners' cartel wasn't so bad. By the early 1970's, Miller had achieved for players the right to arbitrate grievances, a limited ability by veteran players to block trades, and the right of all but first- and second-year players to have their salaries determined by arbitration. While losing a round in 1972 when the United States Supreme Court narrowly upheld baseball's antitrust immunity, Miller's crowning moment came three years later with the establishment of free agency.
In 1975, two pitchers, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally of the Montreal Expos, played the season without contracts. The union filed a grievance on their behalf, arguing that the reserve system contemplated only one automatic contract renewal for an unsigned player. The owners, despite warnings about the foolishness of (Continued on Page 54) their position, claimed perpetual rights. An arbitrator, Peter Seitz, heard the dispute, and two days before Christmas he issued the ruling that revolutionized the game's economics: Messersmith and McNally were proclaimed free agents, and their services were available to the highest bidder - or anyone else. Thus could any player become free a year following his refusal to sign a contract.
Baseball's rulers were apoplectic: The owners went to court to block the Seitz edict (and lost); they locked the players out of training camps (then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn eventually opened them, though admonishing that free agency could ruin the sport); they appealed to public sympathy (which, typically, wasn't great on either side). Finally, in July 1976, management and labor reached a four-year deal, an agreement that retained the reserve system - except that players with six or more years in the majors were eligible for free agency.
It might have appeared that Miller had yielded a lot of turf. But in fact, the restrictions on the supply of free agents created a bidding war among club owners for the few available stars; this, coupled with the salary arbitration available to many other players, drove up pay. In 1977, average compensation for a major league player rose 50 percent to $76,000. Two years later, it was $113,500; this season it was $513,731.
During several subsequent negotiations, management sought ways to rein in its own profligate tendencies. Owners suggested percentage limits on pay increases (after all, there are limits on pay cuts) and salary caps based on length of service. They got just about nothing from the union, except in the most recent collective bargaining agreement, in 1985, when Fehr, leading the players for the first time, yielded a crumb; players previously eligible for salary arbitration after two years in the major leagues, now had to play three. It's a concession for which he still hears criticism.
MEANWHILE, BIDDING FOR free agents continued to resemble an auction for the crown jewels - until the off-season of 1985.
That winter, the 9-year-old free-agent market vanished. Teams simply ceased going after their rivals' talent, stars were forced to return to their old clubs and a few players found no work at all. The same happened in 1986. Owners called it fiscal sanity; Don Fehr charged collusion, orchestrated by then-commissioner Peter Ueberroth. In two sweeping grievances, the union accused management of violating the Basic Agreement by ''acting in concert'' to destroy free agency and reduce salaries.
After lengthy hearings, two respective arbitrators found a conspiracy and ruled for the union. Preliminary damages of $10.5 million in the 1985 case were awarded in late August; potentially tens of millions more may follow. Awards have not yet been decided in the 1986 case. A separate collusion grievance is pending for the 1987 season and one is possible for 1988.
For Fehr, the collusion cases - his victories notwithstanding - remain the key obstacle to breaking bread with the owners. ''How is it I negotiate another contract with them when I assume they'll just go out and violate it again?'' he asks. ''I don't trust anything they tell me. That's what makes this negotiation different.''
Without some declaration of wrongdoing, Fehr says, any handshake on substantive matters - the terms of free agency and salary arbitration, pension contributions, minimum pay, league expansion and the length of a contract - is meaningless because ''the owners have already demonstrated they won't live by their word.''
The owners continue to confess nothing. ''The clubs don't believe they violated the Basic Agreement,'' says Barry Rona, their labor representative, ''but they accept the arbitrators' decisions and will abide by them.''
Shortly before he died on Sept. 1, Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti said his concern would be ''to preserve the integrity of the 1990 season,'' although he noted that as commissioner, elected by the owners, he had no institutional role at the bargaining table. ''Since the commissioner lacks equal suasion over both sides,'' Giamatti said, ''he doesn't have it over either, and it is silly to expect him to make labor policy with a wave of the wand.'' The current commissioner, Francis T. (Fay) Vincent Jr., is equally persuaded of his lack of influence. ''Bart's view is my view,'' he says.
That inherent passivity and the fact that the owners' agenda in the last decade has largely been set by the union's demands, mean Fehr will be at the vortex. ''More than anyone, Don will determine if there will be a settlement,'' says Bowie Kuhn, who served as baseball's commissioner from 1969 to 1984.
TO MARVIN MILLER, now 72 and living on Manhattan's Upper East Side, labor causes don't leave a lot of middle ground. It may be in the nature of things that as the players' association matures and accomplishes its root goals, its leadership takes on a less harsh perspective. But for Miller, there are no shades of gray; to him, Don Fehr, even with his combativeness, is just too deferential.
''I don't mean Don is wrong, but he and I have different standards in labor-management relationships,'' Miller says. ''This is Don's first union. He's not as aggressive as he should be with people who lie and cheat. That doesn't show he wants to look weak, but it shows he lacks the background of a trade unionist and it shows a lawyer's mentality.''
Miller criticizes Fehr for ''taking backward steps for the first time'' in the 1985 negotiations, which, in addition to the compromise that players complete an extra year to be eligible for salary arbitration, reduced the percentage of television revenues contributed to player pensions. He says these concessions resulted not from the union ''selling the members out, but from the leadership not preparing and educating the players in the months leading up to bargaining.'' ''Don did fine in the last negotiations, but this one will be a truer test,'' says Don Baylor, a former player who was the chief American League representative in the 1985 talks. ''The players, with their high salaries, are more complacent. When I first came up in 1972, players read the Sporting News; now they're reading the Wall Street Journal. Don has to mobilize attitudes.''
Baylor, one of the most active ballplayers in the labor movement during the last decade, admits the union membership in 1985 was divided over salary arbitration. ''Younger players were mad,'' he recalls. ''Ask them who Don Fehr was and a few would tell you he's the guy who sold them out.''
But Baylor says the rift between young and old was inevitable given the remarkable achievements under Miller that made many players rich. ''Don has a tougher motivational job than Marvin ever did,'' says Baylor. ''Marvin came first and is a god. When he arrived, players were making $6,000 a year. It wasn't too hard to rally them. Today, players stand to lose a lot more when they're asked to make sacrifices. What they forget is that somebody 10 and 15 years ago made sacrifices for them.''
Miller and Fehr themselves say they are professionally close. Miller, moreover, stresses that his comments are isolated objections. ''Don's done well and he'll do better this time,'' he says.
Fehr, sometimes defensive about the relationship, says he and Miller coincide completely on the union's overall agenda, and that it's ridiculous to think he feels himself in Miller's shadow. ''I trust Marvin's instincts like no one else's,'' Fehr says. ''But that doesn't mean we always agree on the details.''
WHILE MILLER may tweak his successor now and then, it is obviously the barons of baseball who are Fehr's adversary. And the collusion cases and their aftermath have given him what he lacked in 1985 - a unifying cause to rouse the troops across economic lines.
Yet the negotiator for the owners says he's not itching (Continued on Page 101) for a fight at all. ''We're not looking to antagonize anybody,'' says the 48-year-old Barry Rona, who notes that he began his career doing union work, but has been with the Player Relations Committee, the owners' labor arm, since 1969. ''It was Marvin who personalized things. Don may perceive his job as maximizing rhetoric and whipping up hysteria, but he and I are lawyers and we're trained to deal with issues. We should be able to do it in the spirit of professionalism.''
Fehr responds incredulously to that kind of sentiment, querying if this is the same Barry Rona who recommended lockout language in player contracts for the 1990 season. Rona sees no inconsistency. ''I made that suggestion so owners would not be totally vulnerable to the union dictating when they would have the upper hand by calling a strike later in the summer,'' he says. ''The clubs are simply maintaining their options, as the union always has.''
''Maintaining options'' is a favorite term of those who conduct labor negotiations. Because collective bargaining is a game of chicken: Whoever blinks first loses. So neither side much wants to discuss the proposals it will bring to the table, lest it tip off the opponent about expectations. In informal talks last winter, only minor issues were explored and ''even then, the conversations didn't go anywhere,'' says Paul Molitor, who plays third base for the Milwaukee Brewers and is now the chief American League labor representative.
Rona does acknowledge, rather ominously, that ''it is fair to assume that the salary structure of Major League Baseball will be a central issue in the negotiations. Salary arbitration and free agency are two methods by which you set salaries at the present time, but they aren't necessarily the only ones.''
That statement would seem to hint at a possible management demand for a fundamental restructuring of player pay, perhaps the cap on salaries that the former Seattle Mariners owner George Argyros has suggested, or a collectively bargained salary scale. Rona won't comment on those specifics. He speaks vaguely of aiming for a ''partnership'' with the players, but offers no detail except to note that the concept clearly doesn't contemplate players getting a piece of any clubs.
Fehr isn't satisfied with the status quo either. He says that the lot of the younger ballplayers will rank high on his agenda, especially because of the givebacks in 1985. ''The abuse taken by players in their first three years is greater than anyone could have anticipated four years ago,'' Fehr says. ''They have their salaries set by the clubs without even the semblance of bargaining.'' The effect on pay is dramatic: In 1988, players with two to three years of major league experience - just under the arbitration cutoff - earned an average of $185,673; those with three to four years made $428,805.
And there is the intractable subject of collusion that Fehr will not forget, the matter of principle as much as principal. Fehr angrily insists that any collective bargaining agreement will have to contain provisions that deter owner conspiracies to restrict free agency. Precedent for such language exists in basketball. Wary of what baseball owners apparently did in 1985 and 1986, the National Basketball Players Association, according to its executive director, Charles Grantham, demanded and got draconian penalties put into its current labor contract; owners who collude are liable to fines of $1 million and punitive damages up to three times what a victimized player has lost due to conspiracy. Rona says these terms are unnecessary and that Fehr is grandstanding.
Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner who presided over four work stoppages, tries to be optimistic. ''With both sides prospering,'' he observes, ''you would think there would be someplace for them to compromise.''
But Bart Giamatti, the late baseball commissioner who had tried to downplay prognostications of doom, acknowledged big trouble approaching. ''There are deep, difficult issues between the sides,'' he said in an interview in July.
''My greatest concern is that this dispute unfolds as a morality play,'' says Giamatti's successor, Fay Vincent. ''The danger is interjecting morality into economics. When it becomes the white hats against the black hats, you get the real risk of deadlock.''
Perhaps, indeed, darkness is destined. In the voice of baseball's reluctant labor warrior, there is both resignation and disgust. ''I fear the apocalypse,'' says Don Fehr.

HEADLINE: AMERICAN CONTEMPORARY;
The New Business Lunch: Offbeat Restaurants

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
DICK BYRNE, AN EXECUTIVE vice president of a New York advertising agency, is a veteran of more long, bibulous business lunches than he cares to recall. Only 10 years ago, these affairs were routinely held at such Establishment bastions as La Cote Basque, The Four Seasons and Christ Cella. On a recent occasion, however, when clients came in from out of town, Mr. Byrne took them to a whimsical Chinese restaurant with a barnyard motif called Pig Heaven.
''It was a big hit with them,'' he said. ''Something very different, and fun.''
Bob Cummins, a lawyer in Chicago, used to take clients to such baronial settings as the University Club of Chicago or The Empire Room at the Palmer House and Towers hotel. ''Those places were almost de rigueur for leading lights in the Chicago financial, legal and business communities,'' Mr. Cummins said. Today, he is more likely to take business associates to lunch at Shaw's Crab House, a bustling, informal seafood place, or Bistro 110, an informal French restaurant with a lively dining bar and moderately priced menu. 
Ruth Manton, the owner and president of Aries Design Management, which represents fashion designers and celebrities, said she used to be a devotee of La Cote Basque and La Grenouille for business lunches. ''But now I don't have the time for a big production,'' she explained. ''And I don't want all those calories.'' Her current haunts include Bice, the snazzy Milan-style trattoria (''I can have pasta and a salad and get out in an hour and a half''), and Aglio e Olio (formerly Cafe Between the Bread), a breezy, casual spot specializing in lunch salads.
Such scenarios are increasingly common today, as the hallowed American business lunch becomes more casual, more adventuresome and - dare we say it? - occasionally fun. The reasons for the trend are varied. For one, the new abstemiousness, prompted by health concerns and changing life styles, has all but eliminated the proverbial three-martini lunch (see accompanying piece). White wine and mineral water are the current social lubricants.
''There is no more cocktail chitter-chatter,'' said Malcolm Forbes, who rates restaurants in Forbes magazine with particular attention to their suitability for business meetings. ''Most successful people are busier than they ever had MILLER spread FFFFFF to be, and there is no time for the three-hour lunch. It's more likely to be noon to 2:00.''
Jason Epstein, editorial director of Random House, observes: ''I haven't seen a three-course lunch with cocktails in a long, long time.'' At The Four Seasons, which is synonymous with the term power lunch, many of the clientele do not drink at all, said Alex von Bidder, the general manager. ''Those who drink wine tend to order a good bottle, but not finish it,'' he said. ''We also serve a lot of iced tea, iced coffee and iced espresso.''
THE TRUNCATED BUSINESS LUNCH IS transpiring in settings that just 5 or 10 years ago would have been considered frightfully downscale, if not undignified. Jim Weinstein, an advertising executive with Chiat/ Day/Mojo in Los Angeles, often takes clients to the clamorous and trendy West Beach Cafe in Venice. ''Clients are looking for an experience as much as the food,'' he said. ''They like an unusual place with an unusual crowd of people, different from what they normally see.'' He recently took a group to Ivy at the Shore, a movie-industry hangout with a regional American menu. ''We had meat loaf,'' he said.
B. Wallace Rucker Jr., an investment banker in Seattle, said he often takes business clients to informal places like Shuckers, a publike oyster bar and seafood restaurant in The Four Seasons Olympic Hotel. ''A lot of the formal, heavier-style restaurants that used to be open for lunch are now open just for dinner,'' he said, explaining one result of the new trend.
The hotel's lavish formal restaurant, The Georgian, is not as popular for lunch. Observed William Mackay, the hotel's manager: ''People have the impression, which is not really correct, that they can't get in and out of The Georgian in an hour or hour and a half.''
Mr. Epstein's Random House office is within a short walk of such celebrated Manhattan restaurants as Lutece, Aurora and The Four Seasons, yet recently he has frequented those spots only at dinner. At midday, he favors such neighborhood haunts as Stephanie's, a modest American cafe, where he recently had lunch with the author John Gregory Dunne. ''It's comfortable, not too loud and the food is light,'' he remarked.
Executives like Mr. Forbes note that clients and customers are no longer as impressed by the lavish trappings of the formal - and pricey - business lunch. ''Today you don't wow a customer by where you take him; you woo him by respecting his time,'' he commented.
Economy plays some part in the downscaling of business lunches, but a relatively minor one compared with economy of time, according to executives interviewed in major American cities. Another factor often cited is the heightened curiosity about cuisine among business people, particularly about ethnic foods and regional American cooking.
''Most cities today have their fancy French restaurants, and all their atmospheres are more or less the same,'' said Clint Clifford, an advertising executive with Wells, Rich, Greene in New York. ''So when they come here, they would rather see something that is special to Manhattan, like some funky place downtown.''
No reliable statistics are available to quantify the trend, but a critic's survey of restaurateurs, purveyors and trade journals indicates that lunchtime business at luxury establishments is off by as much as 25 percent. (The decrease is attributable in part to the 1986 tax law that limited deductions for business lunches to 80 percent of the tab.) And much of the slack is clearly being taken up by informal cafes, grills, trattorias and the new gastronomic hybrid known as the American bistro.
Lavish corporate entertaining is not entirely passe, however. When it occurs, though, chances are it is at dinner.
''If you really want to tie on the feedbag and go all the way - say, with dinner at Lutece,'' said Malcolm Forbes, ''you tend to do it at night.''
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
BELLEVUES, 496 Ninth Avenue, at 38th Street (212) 967-7855
Little more than a rejuvenated diner on a tawdry strip of Manhattan's Ninth Avenue, the French bistro Bellevues is a welcome oasis for lawyers and garment district executives. Customers sit on aqua banquettes - or if alone or in a rush, at the counter -and partake of such rustic fare as pork terrine, boudin noir with apples and onions, and calf's liver with bacon and onions. Service is brisk and upbeat. Prices are appropriately dinerlike, with lunch entrees from $4.95 to $13.50.
Cash only.
 
BRIDGE CAFE, 279 Water Street (212) 227-3344
Proximity to Wall Street and a dearth of serious restaurants in the South Street Seaport area have made this weather-beaten tavern-style restaurant an enduring favorite within the financial community. The menu offers basic American-style fare that is wholesome, fresh and generally well seasoned. Service is prompt. Lunch entrees run from $7.95 to $13.95. No reservations at lunch.
All major credit cards.
 
PARK BISTRO, 414 Park Avenue South, at 28th Street (212) 689-1360
Last year a new chef turned this languishing bistro into one of the most popular lunch spots in the area. The setting is plain, but the aromatic French Provencal fare, with lunch entrees in the $13 to $24 range, is anything but that. Considering the crowds at peak hours, pacing is relatively prompt, but reservations are de rigueur, preferably a day or two in advance.
American Express and Diners Club.
 
PERIYALI, 35 West 20th Street (212) 463-7890
Just a few years ago, the notion of upscale Greek food in a stylish Mediterranean setting was revolutionary in this town of gyros and moussaka parlors, but Periyali has shown how appealing this cuisine can be. The abstemious business crowd at lunch goes for the superb wine-marinated grilled octopus and grilled fresh porgies swathed with olive oil. Entrees are under $20. Some fine Greek wines are served at bargain prices, and the viscous espresso will keep the diner going all afternoon. Waiters are friendly and well informed about the food.
American Express, MasterCard and Visa.
 
CHICAGO
 
FRONTERA GRILL, 445 North Clark Street (312) 661-1434
A colorful Mexican cafe festooned with exotic folk art, Frontera Grill is one of the most authentic restaurants of its type north of the border states. The regional Mexican lunch menu begins with small plates of tasty morsels such as ceviche of fish over tostadas and chicken taquitos, followed by a roster of dynamic charcoal-grilled fish and meat in assorted guises (some spicy, some mild, all complex). An extensive list of Mexican beers is available, as well as an eclectic lineup of wines chosen for their stamina in the company of such assertive fare. Lunch is very reasonable, with entrees under $10. The staff is intelligent and enthusiastic. Reservations are taken for lunch for a party of five or more. Closed Monday.
All major credit cards.
 
SCOOZI!, 410 West Huron, one block west of Orleans Street (312) 943-5900
At the dinner hour, this post-modern, neo-Italianate warehouse-like space makes a night game at Wrigley Field look sedate. The lunch scene is far more tranquil, and the crowd less aggressively trendy. Businessmen shed their dark jackets, roll up their sleeves and nibble on wafer-thin pizzas, vibrant salads and a changing selection of pastas and mostly northern Italian entrees. The two mezzanines on either side of the room, with big comfortable booths, are favored by larger groups from downtown offices nearby. The staff is relentlessly cheerful and earnest. Prices are right, too: A recent lunch for two, including drinks, came to $50 before tip.
All major credit cards.
 
SHAW'S CRAB HOUSE, 21 East Hubbard Street (312) 527-2722
This sprawling fish house evokes Chicago's rollicking jazz age without resorting to theme-park silliness. Beyond a big, lively bar is the knotty-pine and tiled dining room with spacious, paper-draped tables and high-backed banquettes. The light, assiduously fresh seafood and fast-paced service make Shaw's one of Chicago's prime business lunch spots. The menu is more adventuresome than that of most fish houses, perhaps because the chef is French, and offers everything from excellent charred raw tuna with watercress to winter oysters from Chile. Entrees at lunch peak at $22. The wine list is exceptionally well chosen and bargain priced.
All major credit cards.
 
LOS ANGELES
 
CITRUS, 6703 Melrose Avenue (213) 857-0034
A breezy, sunny French restaurant with an outdoor patio, Citrus remains one of the hottest restaurants in Los Angeles, at lunch as well as dinner. The California-inspired French nouvelle-cuisine entrees and stunning desserts make it a prime spot for local executives to show off the city's best to out-of-towners. Lunch entrees range between $10 and $14. Service is professional; reservations are necessary.
American Express, MasterCard and Visa.
 
PAZZIA, 755 North La Cienega Boulevard, West Hollywood (213) 657-9271
This Florentine- and Roman-style trattoria, dominated by a giant mural depicting a bicycle race, draws a stylish business lunch crowd with its elaborate salads, carpaccios, light pastas and grilled entrees. Prices range from $14 to $22. The staff is efficient in an insouciant sort of way. Closed Monday. American Express, MasterCard and Visa.
 
WEST BEACH CAFE, 60 North Venice Boulevard, Venice (213) 823-5396
Just a block from the ocean, this perpetually hip, stylishly elegant cafe attracts a lively midday crowd of business lunchers. The contemporary California fare - with lunch entrees averaging about $12 - is light and sprightly, sometimes adventurous, and the wine list is superior. The noise level can make conversation trying at peak hours, though. Service is casually efficient. Closed Monday. All major credit cards.
 
SEATTLE
 
CAFE SPORT, 2020 Western Avenue (206) 443-6000
A spiffy, pastel-colored Art Deco cafe near the city's bustling Pike Place Market, Cafe Sport draws a local business clientele as well as out-of-town tourists. The food is light, focused on regional seafood, and prepared with an Oriental accent. Among the offerings are peppery pan-fried oysters with cucumber and sprout salad, and steamed Pacific mussels in a lemony, pepper-edged broth. Lunch is a bargain, with most entrees under $10. The staff, though casually paced, is well versed on the food.
All major credit cards.
 
McCORMICK'S FISH HOUSE & BAR, Fourth Avenue and Columbia Street (206) 682-3900
At noon on any weekday, the bar of this masculine Irish restaurant in the center of Seattle's commercial and corporate district is packed with office workers who order sandwiches, salads and chowders and seafood specials. The more spacious, wood-paneled main dining room is geared to fast-paced executives, and serves basic American fare with an emphasis on fresh local seafood. Entrees for lunch range from $5 to $10. Waiters are prompt; reservations are recommended.
All major credit cards.
 
SHUCKERS, Four Seasons Olympic Hotel 411 University Street, at Seneca Street (206) 621-1984
This wood-paneled tavern and oyster bar is the casual counterpart to the hotel's luxurious Georgian Room. Five or six varieties of local oysters are available daily, as well as a wide selection of wines and beers from the Pacific Northwest. Seafood stews and simply prepared fresh fish are the most popular dishes at lunch. Prices are extremely moderate (lunch entrees from $7 to $14). Cheerful waiters are well-schooled on seafood.
All major credit cards.
 
PRICES AND MENUS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

GENE DREAMS
Wall Street, Academia, and the Rise of Biotechnology.
By Robert Teitelman.
237 pp. New York: Basic Books. $19.95.
From cold fusion to high-temperature superconductivity, from robotics to neural networks, many of the recent ''revolutions'' in science and technology seem to have the half-life of an average teen-age crush. Each one strides onto center stage to the boom of the media's timpani, promising to revitalize our sluggish economy, trounce our competitors, light up our homes, levitate our trains and otherwise make life easier, cheaper and more entertaining for all Americans. And almost inevitably, the ''miracle breakthroughs'' prove disappointing: the science behind them is either wrong or too difficult to meet the demand for instant results. 
Perhaps the biggest letdown in recent history has been the business of biotechnology, which involves the manufacture of vast quantities of genetic material by isolating the DNA from the cells of one species (usually human) and splicing it into the cells of another (usually bacteria).
Not only did biotechnology seem to guarantee America's resurgence on the world market - after all, we invented genetic engineering - it also held forth the hope of curing our most intractable scourges. Through recombinant DNA and related techniques, enterprising scientists would spin out amazing new therapeutics to thwart cancer, heart disease, diabetes and infectious diseases. Even the names of the vaunted disease-busting agents had a muscular rhythm to them: interferon, interleukin, monoclonal antibodies. They had to work. And if they worked, some lucky visionaries would get very, very rich.
As Robert Teitelman recounts with delightful verve, occasional bite and persuasive detail in ''Gene Dreams,'' the promise of biotechnology whipped Wall Street into an unprecedented state of near-religious febrility. In the early- to mid-1980's, investors who knew as little about DNA and RNA as they did about muons and quarks poured tens of millions of dollars into a passel of aggressive biotechnology ventures, among them Genentech, Cetus and Biogen. More astonishing still, the investments were made despite one niggling detail: all the biotech companies went public long before they had generated a single marketable or effective product. Their goods were either in the most embryonic stages of development and testing, or remained to be discovered. A few astute observers realized that the Wall Street frenzy - dubbed ''biomania'' - was faintly ridiculous. ''Interferon,'' one scientist told a Forbes magazine reporter in 1980, ''is a substance you rub on stockbrokers.''
Mr. Teitelman, a writer for both Financial World and Oncology Times, begins his tale with the story of Genentech, the largest and most ambitious of the fledgling biofirms. Genentech was the creation of Herbert Boyer, one of the fathers of gene splicing, and Robert Swanson, a venture capitalist turned entrepreneur. Based in South San Francisco, Calif., Genentech was to be an entirely new species of company, one that ''could combine both the pure science of the academic world and the product development of the drug industry.'' It hired employees from the legions of post-doctoral fellows being churned out by the universities and it cultivated a freewheeling atmosphere with Friday afternoon beer bashes, during which Mr. Swanson, Genentech's chief executive officer, often dressed up in a grass skirt or a bumblebee outfit.
The quirky, folksy formula looked like the future of corporate America. And though Genentech had nothing immediately salable, Wall Street wanted it. On Oct. 14, 1980, Genentech and its underwriters offered one million shares of stock at $35 each. That was quite high for an untested company - but not high enough. Within 30 minutes after market opening, the stock had been bid up to $89 a share by eager buyers - a record for an initial public offering - before dropping down to $70 on the final bell.
The Genentech offering was a revelation to many other biologists and entrepreneurs, including those who started up Genetic Systems, a Seattle-based operation and the primary object of Mr. Teitelman's attention. In the Genentech mold, Genetic Systems was the dual creation of a scientific luminary: Robert Nowinski, then with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and David and Isaac Blech, brothers and financial wizards. Yet it was the ''strong, aggressive'' Bob Nowinski, with his ''quick wit, boundless confidence, and a real talent for articulating the romance of science,'' who was to wheel and deal so relentlessly that his little company became someone else's.
Genetic Systems was built around Mr. Nowinski's specialty, monoclonal antibodies - designer molecules or ''magic bullets'' that can home in on specific targets, such as viral proteins and cancer cells. Mr. Nowinski had a two-fold plan: to develop monoclonals for the diagnosis of venereal and other infectious diseases; and to use the profits from the diagnostic kits to fashion more sophisticated therapeutic monoclonals that would destroy tumor cells. Even the first step required money, however, so the company's founders cobbled together a complex financial plan and took Genetic Systems public in June of 1981. Trading once again was manic, millions of dollars cascaded into the company coffers and research began. So, too, did an attitude of extravagance - business affairs were catered by the priciest gourmet shop in Seattle, while Bob Nowinski drove a company Ferrari and always went first class.
Financial troubles were not far behind, and by the end of 1981 the company was ''burning'' cash at a frightening rate. To ease the pressure, Mr. Teitelman tells us, Mr. Nowinski and other principals went chasing money again, offering warrants, limited partnerships and similar paper promises. Mr. Nowinski also struck a deal with George Todaro, a renowned biologist at the National Cancer Institute, to start an offshoot of Genetic Systems, dubbed Oncogen, which would explore the potential profitability of research in cancer genes.
Indeed, striking deals seemed to become a habit with Mr. Nowinski. Whenever Genetic Systems ran into difficulty developing a particular product, he negotiated with other, better-equipped companies - an approach that, while broadening the technical base of the enterprise, effectively spread real or potential profits too thin. And despite the best efforts of scores of young scientists, some biological problems were just too complicated, too messy, for the corporate balance sheet. Far from being the ''magic bullets'' of Mr. Nowinski's dream, monoclonal antibodies have not proved to be the long-sought cure for cancer.
By 1984, Genetic Systems' outlook was bleak. Profits from its diagnostic kits were barely dribbling in, executives were at each other's throats, the accounting records were in chaos and nobody knew how much cash was on hand. A year later, Bristol-Myers, an old-fashioned, bureaucracy-riddled, distinctly nonentrepreneurial pharmaceuticals giant, bought Genetic Systems. ''The [biotechnology] revolution clearly was dead,'' the author writes, ''or it had not yet begun.''
Whether explaining difficult biological concepts or tortuous financial stratagems, Mr. Teitelman writes with lucid grace and an insider's grasp. He points out that there have been some genuine successes in biotechnology, most notably Genentech's development of tissue-plasminogen activator, which dissolves clots in clogged arteries. Yet Mr. Teitelman believes that nature is profoundly complicated, and that the battle against cancer might well be ''not a sweeping victory'' of ''powerfully elegant simplicity,'' but a ''long, difficult war one tumor type, one disease, at a time.'' No stock prospectus can make it otherwise.
 
THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING
Biotechnology sold itself on the belief that it could remedy the most profound economic and medical ills of the age, and please Wall Street as well. . . . Talk of medical breakthroughs became pretexts to raise more money; capital accumulation was confused with speculation; rhetoric was mistaken for reality. . . . Genetic Systems, for all its flaws, was a solid scientific enterprise; Alfacell, on the other hand, has proven thus far to possess the substantiality of smoke. But both appeared . . . dressed in similar gaudy costumes. They were joined by scores of others. Most featured the same apparatus: advisory boards, mice, consultants, forecasts, and laboratory miracles. . . . Like the art market, biotech posed complexities and uncertainties that created a role for experts as powerful and indispensable guides. . . .
Selling Genetic Systems or Alfacell was not that much different from selling, say, a painting by Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, or Jasper Johns. . . . Substance or technique begin to matter less than ideas and style. . . . Fortunately . . . art and medicine are finally very different things. Art must wait for history to judge its merit; until then, the game belongs to dealers and critics. In biotechnology and medicine, theories must sooner or later prove themselves among the sick and dying - an unforgiving jury - and in the marketplace. . . . Does the tumor shrink? Are there side effects? Can the technology be sold profitably? . . . Does it provide much help to the physician? In that way, it finally gains exit from the world of fashion and hype.

THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF HUTTON
By Donna Sammons Carpenter and John Feloni.

SUDDEN DEATH
The Rise and Fall of E. F. Hutton.
By Mark Stevens.
298 pp. New York:
NAL Books/New American Library. $19.95. 
An unusual number of America's once great companies fell upon hard times in the 1980's. Deregulation, foreign competition, roller-coaster interest rates were some of the causes. But for the most part, the big problems were bad management and infighting within the companies themselves.
And so it was with E.F. Hutton & Company, which barely avoided liquidation before being bought and rescued by Shearson Lehman Brothers last year. ''The Fall of the House of Hutton'' and ''Sudden Death'' tell essentially the same tale. This venerable securities firm had an 85-year franchise as the most illustrious stockbroker to America's rich and famous. When E.F. Hutton talked to the gang in Palm Beach, Palm Springs, Southampton and Zermatt everybody was listening. The stock market crash of October 1987 dealt the company a death blow, but the hemorrhaging had begun years earlier when it pleaded guilty to 2,000 counts of mail and wire fraud in connection with illegal use of bank overdrafts. In fact, the scandal never seemed to end, caroming from Congressional investigations to lawsuits to endlessly bad publicity, and resulting in the steady defection of key employees and customers.
If you are looking for a story of villains and good guys, or of outsized greed, this isn't it. Rather the downfall of Hutton, as described in these two books, is a sad account of Wall Streeters unable to adjust to changing times. It is a portrait of people at the top of one of the country's most famous securities firms who were totally unequipped to overcome a major crisis, or even to recognize its full dimensions. At the center was Robert M. Foman, described in both books as an eccentric, heavy-drinking executive who ran the company as if it were his personal plaything. In the organization that he created, professional control and supervision was nonexistent. There was no real chief financial officer, no functioning audit committee, no operational oversight of the ways different businesses interacted. The board of directors was, until the final months, composed mostly of employees who merely rubber-stamped Mr. Foman's decisions. Backstabbing, bad decisions and indecision were rampant. Deep clashes occurred between the brokers in the field, who generated most of Hutton's revenues by selling stocks to rich people, and the white-shoe investment bankers, who wanted Hutton to focus on earning fees from advising clients on mergers and other big deals.
In ''The Fall of the House of Hutton,'' Donna Sammons Carpenter, the author of ''The Price Waterhouse Book of Personal Financial Planning,'' and John Feloni, a former Hutton broker, recount events mostly from 1982 on. Writing in diary form, they achieve the impact of a fast-moving, investigative documentary describing a company facing one emergency after another. Of the two books, this one gives the better feeling for life in the eye of the crisis, describing the dramas surrounding Hutton's top executives, its employees, its customers, its lawyers, Congress and the press.
''Sudden Death,'' on the other hand, takes a more historical view. Mark Stevens, a syndicated financial columnist, gives us a better appreciation of what Hutton really was like as an American institution: its deep roots on both coasts, its presence in New York's Plaza Hotel and other fancy resorts, its vast national network of highly paid salesmen. Mr. Stevens also does a better job of describing the pressures of Wall Street, including the relentless search among companies for deep capital bases and the tensions among the trading, investment-banking and brokerage cultures within the big companies.
Because so much of the material in both books comes from insiders speaking on and off the record, the picture that emerges is no doubt heavily influenced by interviewees intent on protecting their own reputations or impugning someone else's. For this reason, much of the petty dirt dished out about some of the principal characters must be taken as the gossip it is. A more objective view of Hutton's demise would probably require that a little more time elapse between the event and the interpretation of what really happened and why. It would also include a more thoughtful analysis of the kind of people and control systems required to manage large financial institutions at a time when dollars move around the world electronically and the very definition of money and financial risk is increasingly fuzzy.
A deeper treatment would also answer these questions: What difference does it make if the E.F. Huttons or the Merrill Lynches collapse, anyway? Aside from the employees who are laid off, would customers, creditors or the nation's financial system be badly hurt? Neither of these books even touches on the bigger stakes. But until we know how close the Hutton demise was to becoming a widespread financial debacle, it's hard to know whether we are reading about just another corporate rise and fall, or whether all the drama was about something much more significant.
 

 
JUGGLING FOR DOLLARS
 What was most striking to Steve Milne [a bank auditor] about the Hutton account was the amount of money involved. The number of dollars deposited was clearly way out of line with the amount of business generated by the brokers at Hutton's four-man . . . office. Since opening its account just nine days earlier . . . Hutton had deposited . . . $26,427,507. All eleven deposits consisted of large checks written by Hutton to Hutton on its accounts at two banks in Pennsylvania. . . . Hutton was moving money back and forth between the two Pennsylvania institutions and Genesee [Mr. Milne's bank]. Also . . . Hutton had drawn checks on its Genesee account totaling $26,432,000 - or $4,493 more than the firm had deposited. Why? . . .
As he looked closer . . . something else caught Milne's eye: Many of the checks deposited in the account and many of the checks drawn on it carried the same date. . . . Finally . . . the checks deposited in Hutton's account carried the signatures of employees at the local brokerage office, while the checks drawn on the account did not. Milne wasn't sure, but what he had found so far led him to suspect a classic check kite.

THE NEW CROWD
The Changing of the Jewish Guard on Wall Street.
By Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld.
Illustrated. 444 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $19.95.
The most provocative - and down-to-earth - comment on the giddy world of ''The New Crowd,'' a mostly celebratory account of ''The Changing of the Jewish Guard on Wall Street,'' comes from the curmudgeonly Lewis Glucksman. He's the combative trading-desk Samson who helped bring the old-guard ''Our Crowd'' investment house of Lehman Brothers down around his head. Observing the rush of his Lehman partners to sell to Shearson/American Express, he tells the authors that people on Wall Street, including himself, are all greatly ''overpaid . . . relative to the value of the service provided.'' 
Curiously, the authors of this otherwise well-reported and mostly well-written chronicle of 1980's Wall Street and the nouvelle society it spawned dutifully record Mr. Glucksman's skeptical perspective, but fail to give much consideration to the fundamental question it raises: What exactly was the value of the services the New Crowd brought to society - beyond the entertainment value their parties brought to the society pages? Yes, the John Gutfreunds, the Henry Kravises, the Carl Icahns, the Felix Rohatyns, the Saul Steinbergs and the Ronald Perelmans made a lot of big deals; they were big deals, although not quite the civil rights pioneers the authors suggest when they tell us ''the New Crowd broke the stranglehold of the Establishment Wasp bankers and their Our Crowd [German-Jewish] competitors.'' Despite the pecularily strained, somewhat militaristic mixed metaphor of the subtitle, the authors are, if anything, philo-Semitic; in their view the New Crowd is a group of outstanding visionary leaders.
But the question of the value of their services is more problematic. The authors sum up what they characterize as the New Crowd's achievements as ''block trading, risk arbitrage . . . junk bond financing that helped companies expand and made almost every company vulnerable to a takeover, and leveraged buyouts that restructured corporate entities and raised critical debt levels. They provided vast amounts of liquidity.''
This is a fairly mixed record, considering the recent high-profile defaults in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts's leveraged-buyout financings and the recent near-panic liquidity crisis in the junk-bond market. Not to mention the guilty pleas of Ivan Boesky, Martin Siegel and the junk-bond colossus Drexel Burnham Lambert. A jury will decide whether the invisible emperor of the New Crowd economy, Michael Milken, is a martyred genius, as his supporters claim, or a venal racketeer, as the Government charges. But questions of value are not necessarily resolved in court, and the authors fail to address adequately the question of whether Mr. Boesky, Mr. Siegel and the others are aberrations of New Crowd culture or symptoms of something deeply wrong with its go-for-it values.
While Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld, both freelance journalists, make careful note of all the charges, indictments, scandals and follies, the overall cheerleading tone of their prose seems to take for granted that the New Crowd is a roaring success story. They seem mightily impressed by the big deals their subjects have made, by their rapid rise, their astronomical salaries, the ''elegantly expensive taste'' and delicate personal touch with which the big shots' sexy second wives have furnished their larger and larger apartments. (There is a lot of gaga prose about imported English paneling and the like here - evidently the result of personal house tours the authors got from New Crowd wives.) Above all, there is the assumption that success itself is proof of value, even vision.
Are the New Crowd visionaries? It is instructive to compare the New Crowd with another group of entrepreneurial Jewish visionaries, the glove makers and furriers who left the Lower East Side to found the great Hollywood studios and forever changed America's vision of itself. Does merging Shearson and American Express or taking Nabisco private really rate up there on the scale of Jewish visionary achievements with those of the Hollywood moguls (not to mention with Freud, Einstein and Kafka)?
Consider the case of Sanford I. Weill, whose rise from small brokerage partnership to the presidency of American Express is one of the book's main narrative threads. Mr. Weill is described as ''a blunt-spoken, cigar-smoking stockbroker, who had grown up in Flatbush, Brooklyn, the son of immigrant Polish Jews.'' But like the other New Crowd stars, he didn't go from rags to riches; it was more like going from polyester to Polo. Mr. Weill doesn't come across here as smart as Bruce Wasserstein, as nimble as Felix Rohatyn, as bold as Carl Icahn. He was less a vaulter than a plodder, the authors write, and ''opportunity followed [him] like a faithful dog.'' But throughout all his acquisitions another thing followed him around: mass firings.
After his partnership acquired H. Hentz & Company in 1973, Mr. Weill ''laid off hundreds of employees,'' the authors write. When he acquired Shearson Hammill in 1974, ''only half of Shearson's 2,400 employees survived.'' When Shearson acquired Loeb Rhodes Hornblower in 1979, ''about 2,500 of the 10,800 employees were fired.'' Finally, Mr. Weill landed the presidency of American Express, found himself over his head in an alien corporate culture, bailed out, bounced around a bit and then landed on his feet as head of the financial services giant Primerica. The authors give him a Sinatra-like send-off: ''He was back on center stage. . . . He was back in the big time.'' But then, in what is evidently a last-minute footnote, they add: ''Less than two weeks before Christmas (1988)'' - three months after Mr. Weill took over - Smith Barney, Primerica's brokerage house, ''fired more than 150 employees.''
Still, the authors seem determined to interpret Mr. Weill's rise as an example of pluck and fortitude, a major Horatio Alger success story. They admiringly chronicle his parallel ascension in the socialite-charity world, capped when he and his wife headed up the Carnegie Hall restoration project, to which they contributed $2.5 million. In our last glimpse of the Weills, we see them proudly admiring their names over the door of the Weill Recital Hall. While it's undoubtedly true that Mr. Weill made the largest financial contribution to the recital hall, it might have been more appropriate to inscribe over the door the names of the thousands he fired. Mr. Weill made the biggest donation; they made the real sacrifice.

LIAR'S POKER
Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street.
By Michael Lewis.
249 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $18.95.
In 1984, through an improbable set of circumstances, Michael Lewis, a 24-year-old Princeton University graduate studying at the London School of Economics, turned up in a rented tuxedo at a dinner given by the Queen Mother. He found himself seated next to the wife of a managing partner of Salomon Brothers. Mr. Lewis soon landed a job with the company - one of the most sought-after opportunities for the money-minded college generation of the 1980's. 
''Liar's Poker'' is the very funny account of his three-year, dog-eat-dog climb there. Starting as an overpaid $48,000-a-year trainee, Mr. Lewis, by 1987, was on his way to triumph as an institutional bond salesman in Salomon's London office, earning $225,000.
This is a story with much irony. Here is one of America's top investment banking and securities trading firms, an adviser to the largest corporations and money managers, unable to run itself. Its management style is one of warring individuals and factions. While its chairman, John Gutfreund, moaned about underlings demanding too much money, he turned out to be the highest-paid chief executive on Wall Street. The message from the top down was contagious: Every man for himself.
In London, a naive Mr. Lewis was talked into selling some bonds from Salomon's inventory by a trader who had to get rid of them or face a loss. It didn't matter that the bonds quickly collapsed, that the company lost a new client or that the money manager who bought the bonds lost his job. Mr. Lewis performed nobly for Salomon Brothers.
But Mr. Lewis soon learned a valuable lesson. The only way to keep his clients - and perhaps assuage his growing feelings of guilt - was to protect them. So with an anxious junk bond trader standing over him and pressuring him to sell a new issue of bonds that everyone knew would go bad, Mr. Lewis cryptically told a grateful client not to touch them with a 10-foot pole.
The book's title, ''Liar's Poker,'' refers to an after-hours game played by Salomon's bond traders and arbitrageurs. The stakes can run as high as several hundred dollars a bet. The game, combining bluff and calculation, is based on guessing the serial numbers of dollar bills. In fact, Mr. Lewis notes, a good player combines all the skills of a good trader. One day, according to Mr. Lewis (Salomon Brothers has denied this story), Mr. Gutfreund walked into the New York trading room and challenged Salomon's top trader to bet $1 million on a single game. But the trader was better than Mr. Gutfreund at this: ''No, John,'' he said. ''I'd rather play for real money. Ten million dollars. No tears.'' Mr. Gutfreund declined, outbluffed before the game began.
Ultimately, Mr. Gutfreund and Salomon Brothers may have outbluffed themselves. With no real long-term game plan, no grasp of overhead and a tendency to live for the next deal, the company had vastly overspent and overexpanded before the 1987 market collapse. Afterward, it was forced to make major personnel cuts and to eliminate whole departments. Its huge expenditures for growth in Europe were unhinged by a number of major miscalculations. Not the least of these, according to Mr. Lewis, was that while many American institutional clients believed they had no choice but to deal with the company, European customers regarded Salomon Brothers as not only crass, but just one of hundreds of brokers. They were not as willing as the Americans to forgive or forget.
Yet the author believes Salomon will survive and prosper. As for Mr. Lewis, having survived the company's staff cuts because of his moneymaking ability, he says that he left Salomon Brothers not out of disillusionment but ''more because I didn't need to stay any longer.'' Whatever the case, he's obviously as good a writer as he was a bond salesman. Perhaps that's because both jobs involve being able to tell a good story.

HEADLINE: ECONOMICS: READING YOUR WAY OUT OF CHAOS

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL; Peter Passell writes about economics for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Economics has long accommodated dozens of schools of thought. But in the last decade or so, it has become more like physics or chemistry, disciplines so broad and so complicated that, within the field, one group of specialists barely speaks the same language as the Ph.D.'s across the hall. And so much of what is published seems more to proselytize for an ideology than to make sense of the chaotic world inhabited by economists. It's no wonder that a single economic development can be interpreted as a godsend or a disaster, depending on the interpreter's frame of reference.
In such a morass it would be foolish to expect any single volume to sweep away the confusion for the noneconomist. But I've found that certain books help me think more clearly about the economy than others do; certain books call me back to them again and again in times of muddle.
Some of the best recent writing about modern economics is actually relatively painless as it guides the reader through the bewildering world of stock market crises, deficits, trade balances, monetary policy and interest rates. 
Here is my own short list of must-reads. If there is a bias in the selection, it is toward books that are politically astute and treat the English language with respect.
Readers who don't want to waste their time on flash-in-the-pan theories but seek an introduction to the kind of thinking about economics that will be useful even 20 years from now should take a look at Alan S. Blinder's ''Hard Heads, Soft Hearts: Tough-Minded Economics for a Just Society'' (Addison-Wesley, Cloth, $17.95; Paper, $10.95). This little book, written in 1987 by a Princeton economics professor and columnist for Business Week, surveys a lot of ground lightly. But there is enough between the covers to make the mainstream economists' way of looking at public policy comprehensible to anyone who is interested.
A decade ago it became fashionable for economic gurus to worry about ''the British disease,'' the apparent tendency of mature industrial economies to lose vigor. Today, the symptoms are described somewhat differently - the buzzword is competition, and there is a stronger moral cast to analyses of America's failure to pull up its socks.
But one of the first books on this big-think topic - ''The Rise and Decline of Nations: Economic Growth, Stagflation, and Social Rigidities'' (Yale University, Cloth, $30; Paper, $10.95) by Mancur Olson, published in 1982 - still strikes this reader as the most penetrating. Mr. Olson, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, links slower growth to the gradual proliferation of interest groups seeking advantage at the expense of economic efficiency. Many of the examples in this fine essay on what has come to be known as the economics of public choice involve labor unions. But the analysis could apply equally well to small dairy farmers who now seek a ban on the use of hormones to promote milk output, or loggers who defend the subsidies they receive to harvest from Government-owned forests.
Conservatives no longer dismiss the poor as lazy or immoral. And liberals no longer quiver with rage at the idea that poverty is a consequence of cultural failure, as well as insufficient income. Somehow, though, this intellectual convergence has yet to translate into a commitment to a realistic antipoverty program.
If Washington ever does get serious about ending poverty, politicians could do worse than to use David T. Ellwood's ''Poor Support: Poverty in the American Family'' (Basic Books, Cloth, $19.95; Paper, $9.95) as the blueprint. In this 1988 book, Mr. Ellwood, a professor of public policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, argues that the problems facing two-parent, single-parent and underclass families are quite different and demand separate solutions. Some of his ideas are quite familiar: universal medical insurance, an increase in the minimum wage. Some will be new to all but policy aficionados: expanded Federal tax credits for low-wage earners, a uniform child-support system to cope with the problem of absent fathers. Just about every one of his proposals is smart, humane and practical.
At the heart of modern microeconomics is a 19th-century utilitarian notion of rationality, of people who act in consistent ways to advance their material interests, subject to practical constraints. The idea has the virtue of keeping models of economic behavior simple enough to seem scientific. And it meshes neatly with Darwinian natural selection - the impulse to economic gain is easily linked to the biological imperative to pass on one's genes. But unlike Mr. Spock on ''Star Trek,'' members of the human species hardly seem to fit the superrational profile. That is why Robert H. Frank's 1988 book, ''Passions Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions'' (Norton, $19.95), is such a find. Mr. Frank, a professor of economics at Cornell University, sets out to patch the utilitarian model, explaining how seemingly irrational altruism makes good economic sense. And he writes with real style - a rarity among economic theorists, who are generally more at home with the Greek alphabet.
Economists of almost every ideological stripe believe that free trade is a good thing. And many think it is about the only thing that keeps rich countries striving and gives poor ones a shot at the brass ring. The catch is that free trade is not good for everyone. And the losers - assorted unions and businesses that face stiff foreign competition - work overtime to make sure the economists' message does not get through to Washington.
Jagdish Bhagwati's 1988 book, ''Protectionism'' (MIT Press, $16.95), may not win the hearts or minds of the House majority leader, Richard Gephardt, and other politicians who have decided that real Americans should buy American. But it is the most eloquent statement to date of the logic of open trade. And it even offers reasons for optimism: while the protectionists are winning some battles, the Columbia University specialist in economic development argues, free traders are winning the war.
Can an 800-page book on monetary policy really be a page turner? William Greider, best remembered as the man to whom David Stockman confessed all, has managed the nearly impossible. His 1988 book, ''Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country'' (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, Paper, $12.95), lucidly explains how the money is made and how it makes the world go round. He sometimes even makes the lesson exciting. The context is the recession of 1980, which Paul Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, deliberately induced to contain rising prices. Mr. Volcker ended up with a reputation as the selfless leader who stopped the inflation vandals at the gates. But Mr. Greider, a journalist, is far less kind. The Federal Reserve, he argues, was doing what it has always done, defending the interests of the wealthy at the expense of homeowners, farmers and the folks who buy dining room sets on credit. That interpretation does not sit well with post-liberal economists, who worry more about the size of the economic pie than the size of the slices. But while Mr. Greider is, arguably, dead wrong, no one who reads his book will think he is foolish. Indeed, Congress is now considering a variety of proposals to put salt on the Fed's tail. It is hard to remember a work on the subject that is at once so technically sophisticated and so accessible.
Wondering why everyone else is driving a BMW while you can barely afford the monthly payments on a Chevy? Frank Levy explains it in ''Dollars and Dreams: The Changing American Income Distribution'' (Russell Sage, Cloth, $27.50; Norton, Paper, $7.95), a 1987 accounting of the economic plight of the baby boomers.
By every collective measure, Americans are more prosperous than they have ever been. But as Mr. Levy, an economist at the University of Maryland, points out, small increases in average earnings mask enormous variations in the fate of generations. Male workers under the age of 40, in particular those without college degrees, have borne the brunt of the collapse in employment in heavy industry. And they had the bad luck to enter the labor force just as women were asserting their rights to the really good jobs. The baby boomers' problems, moreover, have been compounded by the run-up in house prices in the 1970's that left young renters out in the cold and by the sharp increase in regressive payroll taxes used to fund the elderly's Social Security pensions. Mr. Levy does not explain how the boomers might dig themselves out of the trap. But his pathbreaking study does set the stage for the coming war of distribution between young and old.
The standard view of economic development these days is that free markets and fast growth go together like beer and nachos. But Alice H. Amsden, an economist at the Harvard Business School, suggests that tastes in development strategies may not be universal. Her 1989 book, ''Asia's Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialization'' (Oxford University, $29.95), argues that countries just now jumping on the growth track must use government intervention to compensate for technological backwardness in export markets. That may sound like a rationalization for the sort of meddling that has wrecked economic development prospects from Argentina to Algeria to Poland. In fact, it is a defense of the more disciplined government-business partnerships that have served South Korea and Japan very well. How applicable it is outside Asia is grist for economic policy mills.
Nobody says it better than John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard liberal icon who has been in the thick of the economic policy game for half a century. Unfortunately, a lot of what he has had to say has been dismissed by his many critics as unoriginal or just plain wrong. The one Galbraith book that pleases almost everybody is ''The Great Crash 1929'' (Houghton Mifflin, Cloth, $17.95; Paper, $8.95). This anecdote-stuffed account of greed, stupidity and innocence, first published in 1955, shows Mr. Galbraith at his sardonic best. The latest edition, published last year, includes a preface comparing the 1929 stock market collapse with the one in 1987. One might quibble with his world view. But what's the point? You would only assume I was jealous of the remarkable felicity of his prose - and you would be right.
For years economists said the sky would fall if Ronald Reagan and his profligate friends in Congress didn't mend their overspending, undertaxing ways. But most Americans have learned to stop worrying and love their tax cuts. And while Washington still pays lip service to the need to cut the budget and trade deficits, sacrifice just doesn't sell.
Benjamin Friedman's ''Day of Reckoning: The Consequences of American Economic Policy Under Reagan and After'' (Random House, Cloth, $19.95; Vintage, Paper, $8.95), written in 1988, after it was clear that President Reagan would never have to foot the political bill for his six-year-long party, does not predict that Western civilization will collapse anytime soon. But Mr. Friedman, who worked as an investment banker before he became a professor of economics at Harvard University, does offer a devastating analysis of the likely consequences of Reaganomics: permanently diminished living standards and declining world influence.
The Soviet Union is changing so rapidly that any analysis of its economy is bound to be a little dated before it is published. Ed A. Hewett, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and a seasoned perestroika watcher, could not foresee the crippling strikes and regional discontent that would lead Mikhail Gorbachev to warn last month of imminent economic collapse. But those who had read his ''Reforming the Soviet Economy: Equality Versus Efficiency'' (Brookings Institution, Cloth, $36.95; Paper, $16.95) in 1988 were not likely to be surprised by the subsequent unraveling. He explains how the economy that Stalin built muddled along, rudderless, for decades. Mr. Hewett outlines the botched half-efforts at reform under Nikita Khrushchev, Aleksei Kosygin and Yuri Andropov. And while the author is too much the scholar to go into the prediction business, he makes clear that the obstacles facing Mr. Gorbachev are indeed formidable.
At least one book on economic history belongs on the list, and the choice could hardly be easier. The first volume of Fernand Braudel's ''Civilization and Capitalism: 15th-18th Century'' - ''The Structures of Everyday Life'' (Harper & Row, Cloth, $35; Paper, $19.95) - is an idiosyncratic survey of how ordinary people lived from the Middle Ages through the Industrial Revolution. It is great history, great economics and great fun.
Mr. Braudel, a French polymath who began writing history in a German prison camp during World War II, flits from detail to grand thesis with the grace of a Nureyev. Where else, for example, is one likely to learn that the furniture of 20th-century Japan is based on designs from seventh-century China? And where else could one discover that carbohydrate is destiny, that accidents of climate and soil separating the regional domains of wheat, corn and rice critically influenced the rise of Europe and the fall of Asia and Latin America?
''If you know so much about the economy, how come you're not rich?'' The economists' answer, which has never satisfied anyone inclined to ask the question, is that most of what they learned in school is not useful in beating the averages in stocks and bonds.
Burton G. Malkiel, a former dean of the Yale School of Organization and Management, is the rare economist who is as at home on Wall Street as on campus. Rarest among the rare, he is also skilled at translating disciplined academic research on securities markets into practical advice for small investors. Read his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'' (Norton, Paper, $11.95) - the fourth edition of which was published in 1985 - to discover why 90 percent of what stock brokers tell you is nonsense. Or, if you insist, read it, in Mr. Malkiel's words, ''to get rich slowly but surely.''
The recent ''More Like Us: Making America Great Again'' (Houghton Mifflin, $18.95) is not exactly about economics, and its author, James Fallows, is not a card-carrying member of the economists' fraternity. But the book, a clear-eyed look at the strengths and weaknesses of America's economic culture, is a fine antidote to the Japanese-do-it-better-and-besides-they-cheat school of public policy.
Mr. Fallows, a distinguished journalist who used to write speeches for President Jimmy Carter, lived in Asia for several years. But unlike many Japan watchers, he rejects the idea that the Japanese way of running an economy can be successfully emulated by us. Japan's success, he says, is closely linked to its revulsion at disorder and open conflict. America's great strength, by contrast, is its tolerance for rough edges and its capacity to harness individual initiative. The way to rouse the American economy from its lethargy, he argues, is to fight the tendency to allow those who have it made to shut the door behind them. His proposals, a mix of the very conservative (voucher systems for education) and the very liberal (open immigration), suggest just how irrelevant economic ideology has become.
Interested in owning a single reference work that promises the latest word on all of modern economics? One exists - ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics,'' edited by John Eatwell, Murray Milgate and Peter Newman. The list of its contributors, including such extraordinary economists as Thomas Schelling, Albert Hirschman and James Buchanan, could hardly be more impressive.
Unfortunately, there is a catch - make that two catches. At $750, the four-volume, 2,000-entry, 4,100-page work is more expensive than a week in the Bahamas. And much of it is much less enjoyable: perhaps half the entries are written in econspeak, understandable only to those who know the jargon and the math. Happily, there is a much cheaper and more accessible version of ''Palgrave.'' The flashiest, least technical entries in the 1987 reference have been repackaged by W. W. Norton into individual volumes, each focusing on a broad topic. Three of them - ''Economic Development'' (Cloth, $39.95; Paper, $12.95), ''Social Economics'' (Cloth, $39.95; Paper, $14.95) and ''The Invisible Hand'' (Cloth, $39.95; Paper, $14.95) - are particularly user-friendly. They won't turn you into an economist overnight. But like the other books mentioned here, they'll help guide you through the morass.

CORPORATE MAKEOVER
The Reshaping of the American Economy.
By Harvey H. Segal.
269 pp. New York: Viking. $19.95.
Harvey H. Segal has seen a lot of corporate America, and it hasn't been pretty. Managerial megalomania. Empire-building. Slothful complacency. Fancy offices, unmerited perks and preposterous salaries. His indictments span the Fortune 500 as his baleful gaze falls on Ford, General Electric, Exxon, Citicorp, ITT and dozens of other corporations. Four decades' worth of outrage built up during Mr. Segal's career as a banker, an academic, a corporate director and a Wall Street journalist power ''Corporate Makeover,'' an extended cheer for the firestorm of restructuring that has swept through American industry in the 1980's. 
The corporate form just doesn't work, Mr. Segal believes. He has plenty of company in this lament - not just liberal and leftist critics but even the godfather of capitalism, Adam Smith, who had such dim hopes for the accountability of hired managers that he doubted shareholder-owned companies could survive in any but the most sheltered of markets. John Stuart Mill, though, found this judgment to be ''one of those overstatements of a true principle often met with in Adam Smith.'' Much the same can be said of Harvey Segal.
He sets out to tell tales and draw morals. The first task he carries off superbly. Few people are better equipped to serve up vignettes of managerial waste, fraud and abuse. His portfolio of jobs has endowed him with just the right blend of outsider's perspective and insider's familiarity. And he writes in a style that, at its best - and it's at its best most of the time - is vivid, heartfelt and wry all at once. Those who lack any sympathy for the corporate raider's mission will find this book especially enlightening. It is also entertaining, with the slightly illicit thrill any real-life disaster story delivers.
Unlike many other writers who shake their fists at the American corporation, Mr. Segal is admirably precise about his complaint: managers shortchange shareholders. The only proper definition of corporate success, he argues, is the return equity owners reap. Stagnant productivity, slipping American living standards and ebbing national competitiveness, in this view, are at most side effects of the central failure to maximize the present value of net earnings.
Mr. Segal insists that hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and forced restructurings - which he bundles together under the convenient if inelegant label ''corporate makeovers'' - are ''symptoms, not the disease.'' True enough. But neither are they a magic cure, and Mr. Segal goes astray when he moves from description to prescription. ''It may be wishfully premature,'' he writes, ''to speak of a market for corporate control. Yet the mind-set that increasingly regards companies as assets, casually to be bought and sold, is becoming more pervasive.'' This, he urges us to believe, is good news. What Mr. Segal, and the theorists who inspire him, mean by ''a market for corporate control'' is the set of legal, regulatory and financial arrangements that allow anyone with a sporty frame of mind and Drexel Burnham Lambert's telephone number to seize the helm of a corporation by offering an immediate bonus to shareholders.
The book zeroes in on the key question, asking whether ''corporate makeovers really enhance economic efficiency, or are they simply moves in a financial shell game?'' But Mr. Segal answers almost casually, reprising over and over again the theoretical case for why, in a certain sort of world, takeovers should boost efficiency, and piling up anecdotes about lousy managements that need to be booted out. There has been an enormous amount of careful work done in recent years on the effect of changes in corporate control (a research tradition that, according to the economist F. M. Scherer, has now ''advanced to the point of richly elaborated confusion''). One of the few solid conclusions to date (among many intriguing leads) is that nobody can say anything that is simple, sweeping and true about the net gains from such changes. Mr. Segal cites this hard-won body of evidence only where it happens to support his case.
Unreconstructed leftists are prone to a rookie error in logic that goes like this: Since some businesspeople are guilty of sloth and venality, anything that makes the business world squirm is good for the rest of us. Mr. Segal is no leftist, but he trots out the same non sequitur. His paean to the freewheeling market for corporate control just doesn't follow from his indictment of American industry.
For one thing, his magic bullet isn't well aimed. Many of the industrial dinosaurs he so devastatingly describes, like LTV, are still slouching along unchallenged, while some pretty good companies, such as Richardson-Vicks and Phillips Petroleum, have been swallowed up or forced into traumatic restructurings. Recent research on the topic shows it is not the worst corporations in each industry that typically draw raiders' attentions, but those near the middle of the pack. Any subsequent gains in efficiency are correspondingly modest. Signs are mounting, moreover, that pervasive corporate upheaval and uncertainty carry long-term economic costs.
On the other side of the ledger is the social fallout of takeovers and restructurings. Mr. Segal is understandably contemptuous of managers who entrench and enrich themselves at shareholders' expense while professing concern for workers, local communities and foundations that depend on the corporation. He handles the issue forthrightly, asserting that only shareholders matter - they're the owners, dammit - and on this point he has plenty of supporters and a coherent, logical case. But not everyone agrees. And just because some cynical managers hide behind the skirts of constituencies other than shareholders doesn't rob these groups of legitimate claims.
Finally, most corporate makeovers involve an enormous increase in debt. The deals Mr. Segal discusses, in fact, are just the most visible instances of the growing indebtedness of American industry. Here again, there is fierce and honest disagreement on the implications. The Federal tax code tempts companies to substitute debt for equity. Until recently, most firms limited their indulgence in tax-favored debt financing. The traditional view is that a heavy load of debt is bad, because it leaves managers no slack.
But the Harvard economist Michael Jensen (whom Mr. Segal cites often and approvingly) argues that a heavy load of debt is good, precisely because it leaves managers no slack. Any spare cash, he warns, would just be frittered away on perks, pay and wasteful monuments to managerial vanity. A financial structure that keeps managers right on the edge of default, where one false move means disaster, is the only way to concentrate their minds on efficient production. This extra efficiency will more than counterbalance the extra vulnerability, as managers learn to perform on the high wire better than they ever did on the ground.
A complex tangle of institutional and tax-code changes is turning much of the American economy into a messy and expensive test of this notion. Mr. Segal thinks it will work out fine. It might. But Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard colleague of Mr. Jensen's, notes that annual interest payments already claim over half of the average corporation's yearly earnings in the booming 1980's, and worries about what would happen in a slump. The Princeton economists Ben Bernanke and John Campbell calculate that at the debt levels prevailing in 1986 - and they are higher now - a recession like that of 1973-74 would bankrupt one out of 10 major companies.
Mr. Segal is confident that we will continue to avoid a major downturn; or, if a bad recession hits, that ''made-over'' corporations will be able to manage their way through it; or, if they fail, that innovations in finance and bankruptcy law will make corporate collapse painless for everybody except incompetent executives. He disparages the ''Cassandras of the old managerial establishment'' who fear the consequences of swollen debt loads. But Mr. Segal, and others who use the ''Cassandra'' tag to taunt those they see as timid, forget the point of the Greek myth. Cassandra's curse was that her prophecies would always be ignored, even though she turned out to be dead right every time.
The debate over mergers, leveraged buyouts and restructurings won't be settled for many years. Harvey Segal has written a richly informative contribution to that debate. If, as I fear, he is wrong in his conclusions, he is honorably and usefully wrong. It would be reckless for anybody to make up his mind on the takeover issue based solely on the case Mr. Segal presents. But it would be just as reckless to ignore it.
 
HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?
 Grumblings about exorbitant executive pay . . . would be more productive if they were shorter on moral indignation and longer on guiding principles. What's alarming is not that the average chief executive officer was paid $595,000 in 1987 or that Jim P. Manzi of Lotus Development Corporation, the computer software house, led the pecuniary parade with a cool $26.3 million in salary, bonus, and stock options. . . . It's not the levels of compensation that will make or break the American corporation but rather the lack of any reliable link between what CEOs are paid and how well they perform.

THE SUN ALSO SETS
The Limits to Japan's Economic Power.
By Bill Emmott.
292 pp. New York:
Times Books. $19.95.
The rapid transformation of Japan from a defeated empire to one of the world's most powerful nations has always outraced the capacity of foreign analysts to keep up. In the 135 years since Commodore Matthew C. Perry introduced Japan to Western technology and gunboat diplomacy, the country has undergone various, sometimes extreme transformations in the Western imagination. The sequence of adjectives associated with Japan in this century has echoed its changing role on the world stage: exotic, evil, pathetic, laughable, admirable. 
Most recently, there has been a strong trend toward a perception of Japan as ''not quite like us.'' A number of analysts - led by the former United States trade negotiator Clyde Prestowitz, the American journalist James Fallows and the Dutch writer Karel van Wolferen - have begun to argue that Japan is somehow, well, different. They state variously that Japan does not understand the concept of free trade (Mr. Prestowitz), that its goal is industrial expansion rather than the general welfare of its citizens (Mr. Fallows), that bureaucrats and corporate interests really run the country (Mr. van Wolferen). In other words, the view of Japan as Evil Empire seems to be returning.
In ''The Sun Also Sets,'' Bill Emmott's unemotional, finely reasoned arguments could be regarded as an antidote to that consensus, which has a lot of political appeal among those who favor tough negotiating with Japan. The book's title comes from the author's assertion that Japan's huge financial surpluses could shrink as rapidly as they appeared and that its power and wealth could prove as ephemeral as that of OPEC.
But there is no need to run out and dump your Japanese holdings. The author concedes that Japan's clout could last another 50 years, although he offers evidence to suggest the reign could be much shorter. The valuable reminder here is that even Japan, which appears to be such an invincible economic juggernaut today, must inevitably succumb to the basic laws of economics: countries that build huge surpluses of money eventually see them shrink.
Mr. Emmott, a former Tokyo bureau chief of The Economist, argues that Japan's huge piles of money resulted from a fortuitous combination of circumstances in the early 1980's - a high savings rate, low Government spending and an excess of exports over imports - that is changing even as Japan's trading partners complain. He reminds us that Japan's wealth is a recent phenomenon and that for most of the period since World War II, the country has been a debtor nation - borrowing more than it could produce. For those who worry about drowning in a sea of yen, ''The Sun Also Sets'' is a fragile lifeline, offering hope that Japan will begin to behave like other nations and expose its problems, shortcomings and mistakes.
While the title suggests a promising thesis, the discussion of Japan's eventual decline is taken up only in the last part of the book. Most of it performs what has become a ritual in such works: debunking the numerous myths about Japan. (At some point, we need to ask ourselves why so many in the West continue to prefer the imaginary, threatening, near-perfect Japan to the real, flawed, often clumsy Japan.) In this case, the author does an effective job of cutting through the assumptions of terrifying efficiency to reassure us that the Japanese aren't that different after all. For example, Mr. Emmott tackles the myth of workaholicism. Yes, most factory workers work hard, he says, but not so the majority of white-collar workers. They do stay late in the office, but mainly to collect overtime pay and to make up for goofing off during normal hours.
Mr. Emmott whacks away at one of the most persistent fantasies: that Japan is unchanging and hidebound. Its civilization may be old, but the country is amazingly flexible and dynamic. Its ability to adjust to new circumstances and to embrace new technology has been the secret of its success. Japan's leaders have also been shrewd in gauging Western frustration and giving ground only when they have to. And they have used imaginary differences to resist those changes that were politically difficult to make. One irony is that the foreign critics accept the argument that Japan is different and use it to justify tough measures.
The book's central thesis is that change in Japan has taken on a momentum of its own. Reveling in their newfound affluence, the Japanese are beginning to act like the rest of us. They buy BMW's, vacation in Hawaii, play the wild Japanese real estate and stock markets and prowl the department stores of New York and Los Angeles with credit cards. The new affluence, the author argues, will lead Japan to behave like other wealthy countries: to become more open to imports, to foreign influence, even to the sins of excessive consumerism that have badly damaged the American economy. In making his case, Mr. Emmott offers a powerful challenge to the Japan-is-different school, although his opponents are likely to respond that this recently changed behavior may also be short-lived.
The author brings a valuable British perspective to issues that have often generated more heat than substance in debates between Americans and Japanese. He notes coolly that few United States politicians have had the courage to suggest that we deal with trade friction by tackling those things we can control: our high budget deficit and low savings rate. And in the interest of fairness, he enumerates the barriers erected by European nations against the Japanese.
Mr. Emmott rejects suggestions that Japan will overtake the United States economically. Since Japan's destiny is becoming more intertwined with that of America and Europe, he argues, its interests will more closely match those of its trading partners. In his scenario, the United States will remain No. 1, but No. 2 Japan will take its place alongside the major European countries as a respected, often-consulted ally. The author admits he is an optimist. He insists on seeing the Japanese not just as economic machines but as individuals with the same needs and drives as the citizens of other affluent nations. As the world adjusts to Japan's new clout, frustrated politicians should be reminded often of the real people behind the Japanese trade numbers.

The insolvency of huge segments of the United States savings and loan industry marks a sorry chapter in this nation's financial history. The magnitude of the corruption, greed, incompetence and cynicism of those who mismanaged or plundered hundreds of thrift institutions - or covered up what was going on - breaks all records. Many lawyers, accountants and regulatory specialists who should have blown the whistle were either duped or inept. A disturbing number of high Government officials displayed appalling judgment. In the end, the costs to the taxpayer, the real victim, will be colossal.
Now the whole disgraceful episode, though far from over, has spawned a flock of carefully researched, well-crafted books chronicling the fiasco. Three particularly good ones are ''Other People's Money,'' by Paul Zane Pilzer with Robert Deitz; ''Inside Job,'' by Stephen Pizzo, Mary Fricker and Paul Muolo; and ''The S&L Insurance Mess,'' by Edward J. Kane.
Each has a somewhat different focus and different audiences in mind, but all provide genuine value to their readers, whether they are already reasonably well informed or only casually acquainted with what has happened. If none are fully successful in coming to grips with the broadest policy dimensions and implications of the thrift industry debacle, that is surely forgivable, for the situation is still fluid.
Because Mr. Pilzer is in real estate development, he has some firsthand experience of what went on. He has teamed up with Mr. Deitz, an editor of The Dallas Times Herald, and together they have written a highly readable introduction to the thrift disaster. They recount the history, the legislative background, the gambits used to exploit new powers granted to the savings and loan institutions in the early 1980's by a deregulation-minded Congress, and the duplicity of Washington heavyweights who used their influence to stop remedial regulatory action. Of the three books, this one is probably the best all-round treatment, despite sometimes irritating overgeneralizations and hyperbole.
Mr. Pilzer reveals a key point: the dangers inherent in a system of large-scale Government insurance of deposits. These were clearly foreseen right at the outset - and by none other than Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, as he was about to become President. He (and others) understood the potential for abuses, and tried to head off legislation supported by populists like Huey Long and Texans like John Nance Garner (the incoming Vice President!). But the political pressures for deposit insurance were overwhelming. In 1933 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (F.D.I.C.) was established for banks; in 1934 the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (F.S.L.I.C.) was added for thrifts.
Though the system, as Mr. Pilzer explains, held together until the 1970's, it was always fundamentally fragile. Savings and loan institutions provided long-term fixed-rate mortgages that were financed by short-term savings deposits. As long as interest rates remained relatively stable, this was a profitable activity. But when inflation dramatically escalated in the 1970's, the business was doomed. Many thrifts, subject to an inadvisable interest-rate ceiling imposed by Congress decades ago, faced calamity as deposits were withdrawn, lured by the far higher yields available on money market funds.
But interest rate deregulation, which began in 1980 under Jimmy Carter, was no panacea, either. Once free to compete, thrifts could hold onto deposits, but at the stiff price of offering higher interest to depositors - and that meant losses on the savings institutions' existing low-interest mortgage portfolios.
What ultimately proved more disastrous, as Mr. Pilzer and the other authors show, was a string of poorly thought-out decisions by Congress. The first was to increase the maximum deposit insured by the Government from $40,000 to $100,000. This encouraged deposit insurance brokers, who could place large sums divided into lots of $100,000 each, to shop for the thrift willing to pay the highest interest rate - no matter how shaky its assets or bad its management. These so-called ''brokered deposits'' poisoned the system.
Egged on by thrift industry lobbyists, the Reagan Administration went beyond mere interest-rate deregulation. Aided by willing Democrats, they hustled through Congress an incredibly shortsighted piece of legislation, the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982, which removed regulatory barriers to thrift industry business activities. No longer was the industry largely confined to financing housing. Overnight, the sky was the limit.
The results were devastating, as all of the authors show. Before the ink was dry on the new act, the staid thrift industry was invaded by all manner of promoter, swindler, land speculator, junk bond player and money launderer. Some of the more outrageous cases, spun out in rich detail by the authors of ''Inside Job,'' are so lurid that a novelist would blush to invent them.
Mr. Pizzo, Ms. Fricker and Mr. Muolo are investigative journalists and they have put together a chilling account, cast almost in cinematic terms, of greed and criminality. While tales of political interference by Washington officials on behalf of crooked savings and loan magnates are not ignored, the real juice of ''Inside Job'' is in the fascinating descriptions of the private-sector perpetrators - such as Charles H. Keating Jr., principal owner of Lincoln Savings and Loan in Irvine, Calif. - and how they went about fleecing thrifts. The authors' thesis of organized crime involvement is provocative.
Aside from racketeering and fraud, they make clear that the incentives to take excessive risks, even for law-abiding thrift managements, were overwhelming. The Government insurance funds, not the borrower or the depositor, were underwriting the financial outcomes. The philosophy was: ''It's heads I win, tails the F.S.L.I.C. loses.'' Mr. Kane's book is a scholarly monograph that basically arrives at the same conclusions as the other two. While he approaches the subject analytically, rather than by poring over the egregious cases, he, too, believes that the savings and loan crisis was an inevitable consequence of the ways Congress restructured deposit insurance and the thrift industry at the start of the 1980's. ''The S&L Insurance Mess'' demands a good deal from the reader, but for serious students of the issue the effort is worthwhile.
All of the authors are plainly of the view that the Government deserves a tremendous amount of blame for the thrift crisis, and I agree with them. The books name names. In Congress, Fernand J. St Germain, Jim Wright and Tony Coelho have been forced out (though for varying reasons, not all of them connected to the thrift scandal), yet incumbents like Jake Garn, Alan Cranston, Dennis DeConcini, Donald W. Riegle Jr. and many others have a lot of explaining to do.
Within the Reagan Administration, the authors of the three books have amassed convincing evidence of the questionable actions and interventions of several Presidential appointees. One of them, M. Danny Wall, once an aide to Senator Garn, remains chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision (formerly the Federal Home Loan Bank Board).
But the person who stands out as exhibiting the most appalling lack of judgment is Donald Regan. As the Secretary of the Treasury, he was the nation's top financial official, with the ultimate fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayer, and he continued to play a pivotal role on this issue after he left his Treasury post to become White House chief of staff. As these books conclude, he pitted his entire political weight against those, especially the thrift regulator Edwin Gray, who were trying to avoid a catastrophe. Mr. Regan prevailed; the taxpayer lost.
The regulatory officials deserve a share of the blame, however, as the books underscore. They were amateurish in dealing with emerging cases, and left the impression in the industry that they were not in control. They failed to educate the public about the abuses of the deposit insurance system, did not alert the press to the scandals in the making and showed poor leadership in dealing with Congress on reforming the system.
Others share the guilt: Outside auditors did a lax job in questioning rosy profit results that should have been seen as too good to be true. Independent directors of many failed institutions did not exercise their fiduciary responsibilities. Depositing institutions knowingly placed large amounts in the weakest thrifts without caring what the consequences of their activity might be. The national news media failed utterly to see the public policy implications. And probably most cynically, the lobbyists for the solvent thrift institutions effectively delayed legislation to restructure the F.S.L.I.C. As a result of their efforts, the problem became so large that the Government has been forced to carry the bulk of the rescue operation's financial burden (which could approach $300 billion), thereby letting the industry off the hook.
Common to all three books is the sense of outrage and exasperation they leave in the reader. The outrage stems from the fact that most of the guilty are getting away without any meaningful punishment, either by the courts in the case of the thrift industry crooks, or by the voters in the case of the large number of Congressmen - Democrats and Republicans alike - and executive-branch officials who did not protect the public interest. Still, what may be worse is the feeling of exasperation: after everything that has happened, nothing was included in the recently enacted bailout legislation to eliminate the essential abuses of the deposit insurance system.
These three books were completed before the final compromises on the Bush program were known, but it is fair to infer that all of the authors would be mightily disappointed in what was done. There is a surprisingly strong consensus among them about what the major elements of true reform would be: substantial cutbacks in the size of deposit that the Government would fully insure, along with the imposition of deductibles; meaningful curbs on brokered deposits; better supervision of thrifts through upgraded personnel and tougher rules; better coordination and cooperation between bank and thrift supervisors on the one side and the Justice Department and the F.B.I. on the other; careful screening of thrift officers, directors and owners; realistic accounting; and, finally, significant increases in capital requirements, probably the only major reform of the Bush program and the legislative compromise that resulted.
A final thought. These books force us to face up to an embarrassing and painful reality: we as a nation are badly governed in situations where our lawmakers and executive-branch officials are preoccupied either by ideology or by the narrow interests of a relative handful of big campaign contributors. In this case, and no doubt in others to come, the public interest has simply been ignored.

MARKET MADNESS

 BODY:

MANIAS, PANICS, AND CRASHES
A History of Financial Crises.
Revised Edition.
By Charles P. Kindleberger.
302 pp. New York:
Basic Books. Cloth, $21.95.
Paper, $12.95.
What should be done about crashes in financial markets? Two years after stock markets crashed around the world, the question had receded from public view until the markets again cracked this month. The 1987 crash produced more publicty than pain and lulled many into a belief that crashes don't matter. A poll of actuaries, professionals who help map investment strategies for pension funds, found earlier this year that a majority thought another stock market crash was likely in this century, but they expected it would not be followed by any real problems. They foresaw no depression, not even a deep recession, and were confident that Main Street would not be seriously affected by Wall Street's problems. 
In his new edition of ''Manias, Panics, and Crashes,'' a history of such phenomena from 1720 through 1987, Charles P. Kindleberger, the Ford International Professor of Economics Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argues persuasively that crashes do matter and that it is usually right for central banks to step in as lenders of last resort, although uncertainty about whether they will do so can help hold down the speculation that normally precedes a crash. In 1929, he argues, there was too little lending, and in the international crisis of 1931 no one came forward to be the principal lender. Different actions, he believes, would have led to a better outcome for the world.
Mr. Kindleberger is under the impression that not much can be done to curb the speculative excesses that occasionally end in disasters. Better monetary policies could help, he says, but markets will nonetheless sometimes act irrationally and need Government intervention. He is scornful of a younger generation of economists who take it for granted that investors always act rationally, quoting Isaac Newton's observation that ''I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.''
Newton knew himself well. Having been an early investor in the South Sea Company, one of the most famous financial bubbles, he sold his shares for a 100 percent profit of 7,000. ''Unhappily,'' Mr. Kindleberger writes, ''a further impulse later seized him, an infection from the mania gripping the world that spring and summer. He reentered the market at the top for a larger amount and ended up losing 20,000.''
Once a crash comes, it is not easy for a lender of last resort to know when, and how, to act. ''Whether too soon and too much is worse than too little and too late is difficult to specify,'' the author writes. ''In 1857, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue of the market far too early and helped it inflate still further. In 1873, response was too slow.'' A serious depression followed that crash.
Mr. Kindleberger praises Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, for having run a ''splendid operation'' in providing credit during and after the 1987 stock market crash. But he does not comment on whether the effect may have been only to encourage a rebirth of speculation.
Mr. Kindleberger is an economist of the old school. He writes fluidly, introduces economic concepts clearly and avoids equations. More willing to take on the current situation than he was when the first edition of this book was published in 1978, he is alarmed by the third-world debt problem, by speculation in stock prices and by the United States budget and trade deficits.
In addition, he is worried that, just as the Depression of the 1930's occurred after Britain had stopped being the world financial leader and before the United States replaced it, ''there is a possibility that an aging U.S. economy will increasingly be incapable or unwilling to furnish the leadership and resources that it provided. . . . If so, what will take its place?'' He discusses the possibility of the void being filled by international organizations, or by Japan or West Germany, but sees obstacles to all those possibilities.

Help for the Atlantic Salmon

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant

 BODY:
One of the world's most highly regarded game and food fishes, the beleaguered Atlantic salmon is also a symbol of pure, free-flowing rivers.
In North America, the largest and most prestigious organization working to improve the salmon's lot is the Canadian-American Atlantic Salmon Federation. This country's branch of the federation is holding its seventh annual fund-raising dinner at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan on the evening of Nov. 16.
The federation, a nonprofit conservation organization, came into being in 1982, a marriage of the Canadian Atlantic Salmon Association, formed in 1949, and the International Atlantic Salmon Foundation, which was chartered in New York in 1968. 
At the time of its inception, the federation had a staff of two and its budget was approximately $100,000 a year. The budget this year is $2.5 million, about $2 million of which came from donations from private individuals and foundations. Through its regional councils in this country and Canada, the federation links the salmon conservation and restoration efforts of more than 120 affiliate organizations and their 500,000 members.
Spawning in rivers, with the resulting progeny's dropping down to the sea and returning in one, two or three years, the Atlantic salmon was blocked from ascending many of its spawning rivers in New England by the turn of the century, until only Maine had any significant runs of the fish. Blessed with an abundance of salmon rivers, Canada has not been so affected, although even now the federation is working to block a hydroelectric project that would spoil salmon spawning habitat in the Moisie River in Quebec, one of Canada's best producers of large salmon.
More than a decade ago, Canada's salmon runs had dwindled alarmingly, largely the result of overharvesting by commercial netters. Poaching, too-liberal angling regulations and so-called subsistence fisheries by native Canadians were also factors in the species' decline. The subsistence fisheries have often been tainted by black market sales of the fish. In the mid-1960's, Danish high seas drift-net fishermen working in the Davis Strait off Greenland discovered that salmon from many nations gathered there and an uncontrolled fishery for them was soon under way. That fishery now operates under a quota established by the North Atlantic Salmon Treaty Organization, which is made up of the salmon-producing nations of the world and those countries that harvest salmon but have no salmon rivers of their own.
As the high seas fishery was being brought under control, Canada's national and provincial governments restricted or banned commercial fishing for the species. This involved reimbursing salmon netters for their lost income. At the heart of this crackdown on commercial netting in Canada was a growing awareness by public officials that a salmon caught by a sport fisherman is worth many times more to the general economy than one taken in a commercial fisherman's net.
Sport fishermen have also been restricted. In Quebec during the season just ended, the angler limit was one fish a day and in New Brunswick only two grilse - small salmon returning after one year at sea - could be kept. In all the provinces the seasonal limit was 10 fish.
The result of all this has been a dramatic improvement in the runs of salmon in most Canadian rivers. Although the federation has played a significant role in these salubrious changes, other organizations were also at work, including Richard Buck's Committee on the Atlantic Salmon Emergency, which did battle with the Danes early on.
In more recent years, Buck's Restoration of Atlantic Salmon in America Inc. has focused on salmon conservation at the international level. In Canada, the influential and venerable Miramichi Salmon Association has also worked to aid the salmon. Making the wild salmon (production of farmed Atlantic salmon, pioneered in Norway, is under way in Canada) a game fish safe from commercial exploitation would bring more income to Canada, but longstanding traditions cannot be set aside overnight.
The province of Newfoundland, where there is no restriction on commercial salmon fishing, is a case in point. The federation and a Newfoundland group, the Salmon Preservation Association for the Water of Newfoundland have called upon that province to close its shore net fishery for five years. That fishery intercepts inordinate numbers of salmon bound for other Canadian provinces and New England, and has also, says the preservation association, resulted in ''nothing less than a total rape'' of Newfoundland's own salmon rivers.
Some innovative ideas to improve salmon runs in Canada have evolved. Quebec, for example, has turned over once-private streams to local groups for management. This move has resulted in improved salmon runs and a virtual end to poaching. It's one thing to play Robin Hood and steal a salmon from a stretch of stream controlled by a wealthy group of Canadians or Americans, and quite another to steal from your fellow townsmen.
The federation is also deeply involved in the New England salmon restoration effort. A short while ago, for example, it gave $10,000 to a coalition that is trying to block a hydroelectric dam on Maine's most productive salmon river, the Penobscot.
The upcoming federation dinner begins with cocktails at 6:30. Raffle and auction items include fishing gear, limited edition sporting prints and salmon and trout fishing trips on rivers in Canada and the United States. Tickets are $100 each. For reservations, call (508) 356-0717.

HEADLINE: Financing Repairs in Co-ops and Condos

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
THE boiler groans and expires. The windows were leaky last winter and now another cold season is on the way. The elevator won't pass inspection and the broken and buckled sidewalk outside, which everyone thought belonged to the city, turns out to be the building owners' responsibility.
These are the kinds of developments, whether surprises or a long time in coming, that confront New York's co-op and condominium owners with the need to spend a lot of money, and therefore with deciding where to get it. The choices are always borrowing the money or assessing the apartment owners for their share, and boards of directors are becoming increasingly sophisticated about which approach is best for them.
''It's one of the most common problems that comes up before a board,'' said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council for New York Cooperatives, a co-op and condominium owners' group. ''What do you do when you have to spend some money?'' 
Several co-op accountants and board members remarked that these days bring on a particularly large amount of financial juggling to co-op and condominium boards, both because so many buildings converted to owner-occupancy in the last decade are showing their age and because the drop in interest rates over the last year makes this a good time for many to review their debt ledgers.
The choice of the source of money often depends on the kind of people living in the building, the kinds of repairs or improvements needed, their cost and even the type of governance involved, such as the limited-equity rules for publicly sponsored co-ops.
''Each co-op finds out that it has its own situation,'' Ms. Rothman said. ''The secret is to find out what that situation is.''
It has been nearly 20 years since 670 West End Avenue was converted into a co-op, and the 19-story apartment house at 93d Street was showing its age when its board decided that necessary repairs could no longer be postponed.
''There was a lot of deferred maintenance,'' said Eugene Worden, president of the board. ''The windows were going, there were serious leaks; the sidewalks needed replacement, our two boilers were 40 years old and both were held together with bubblegum and baling wire and the elevators needed work.''
For co-ops, the choice comes down to borrowing from a bank or assessing each apartment owner for a share of the cost. For a condominium there can be no bank loan, since the owners' association owns no property for collateral. It must use assessments to raise money unless it has a large reserve fund.
In most cases, accountants say, the individual owners of condos end up borrowing for their assessments anyway, pledging their units for the loans. The terms, however, are usually less favorable that those available to a co-op corporation.
AT 670 West End Avenue, the engineer's report put the repair cost at between $1.5 million and $1.7 million, amounting to more than $18,000 for each of the 95 apartments - too much of an assessment even for a building where three-bedroom apartments sell for $700,000. The co-op may have profited from having an expert at the helm, for Mr. Worden is a real estate consultant and has been advising co-op conversion sponsors for years on the finances of large apartment buildings.
He noted that his building had a small mortgage, $800,000, at a big interest rate, 13 percent. So the co-op rolled over the old mortgage into a new $2.3 million one at 9.87 percent, leaving it with a substantial amount of cash for the repairs.
To refinance, however, the co-op had to pay a prepayment penalty on the old mortgage. Co-ops, as corporations, are not covered by the state law that prohibits prepayment penalties on individual homeowner mortgages. The building also had to pay points on the new loan, but both of these one-shot expenses were more than offset by the lower interest rate, Mr. Worden said.
Mark Shernicoff, an accountant with the Manhattan firm of Zuckerman and Shernicoff, said that refinancing with a larger loan may not make sense for every co-op. ''When it comes to paying off a prepayment penalty you have to look at the value of the new loan against the old one,'' he said, ''and if you recover your costs within a couple of years, you're O.K.''
But with interest rates stabilizing at relatively low levels, some lenders are demanding more than prepayment penalties, which generally are based on fixed percentages of the loan that decline as the loan approaches maturity. It is not uncommon for banks these days to require being ''made whole,'' or earning the full amount on a loan, regardless of when it is paid off. That amounts to paying the difference between what the loan's value is to the lender over its life and the lower return the money would gain in the market at the time of payoff.
The penalty for early payoff is hard to predict with ''made whole'' loans, because it would depend on interest rates at the time of the payoff. However, Mr. Shernicoff added, such loans are often offered at a lower rate.
When the co-op boom was beginning in New York City and real estate values were a fraction of today's, many co-op loans were self-amortizing, like most single-family home loans. As a result, many older co-ops have negligible debt burdens.
The trend these days, however, is toward the five- or 10-year interest-only loan - with the principal as a balloon on the due date, Mr. Shernicoff said. That means lower interest rates and more flexibility in rearranging building finances as the opportunity arises.
''Corporations exist in perpetuity,'' he explained. ''Since the building has many owners, it will outlive any one owner, and the bank will continue to lend as long as the building is there. So it doesn't make sense to be tied down to a long-term mortgage.''
SHAREHOLDERS benefit from tax deductions when their co-op borrows, since a portion of the interest payments is assigned to each lease. Any capital gains tax due on an apartment when it is sold can also be reduced by deducting the costs of capital improvements paid for by assessments, Mr. Shernicoff said. But, he added, capital gains are rarely charged against primary residences, since the law allows a seller to reinvest the profits in a new home without penalties, if the seller does so within two years.
Mr. Shernicoff played out a hypothetical scenario to describe the differing tax advantages for an owner in a 100-unit co-op in which each unit is assigned 10 shares.
If the building borrows $300,000 for capital expenses with a 11 percent interest rate in which 10 perdentage points are interest and 1 point is amortization, each owner would have a $300 interest deduction available in the first year of the loan.
For an owner in the 28 percent Federal bracket paying a total of 35 percent in income taxes (because of city and state levies), the interest rate would produce a $105 tax deduction, plus a $30 increase in the apartment cost basis, figured for capital gains purposes, in the 1 percent amortization payment.
But, ever the accountant, Mr. Shernicoff warned that the market price of the apartment might suffer as a result of the borrowing because the interest costs of the loan would raise maintenance charges.
Some buildings, the accountant went on, do not have to borrow at all.
''If you are dealing with a relatively wealthy population of shareholders on Fifth Avenue,'' he said, ''they might prefer to invest the money themselves in the building rather than having the corporation do it, so they simply assess themselves for the amount they need and write a check. In a more middle-class or modest-income building, where people are living from paycheck to paycheck, the shareholders might not be in a position to write a check for thousands of dollars, so they borrow, or use the reserve fund.''
BUT in small amounts, assessments can work very well, said David Smith, president of the Penn South co-op complex, the 2,820-apartment limited-equity co-op between 24th and 25th Streets on Eighth Avenue. Limited equity means that tenant/owners may recover only their purchase price, adjusted for inflation, when they sell their units. The figures for a long-term resident currently are $8,000 for a one-bedroom apartment, $10,000 for a two-bedroom and $13,000 for a three-bedroom unit.
The giant public development, sponsored by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, is nearing the end of a renovation project costing $20 million, almost half its total 1962 construction cost. The improvements include a $7.5 million co-generation plant, allowing it to generate its own electricity. It has borrowed most of the money but needed $1.2 million quickly this fall.
To borrow further, approval of the New York City Board of Estimate is needed and action on the matter is not likely before late next month. Penn South was built with low-cost state bonds after the project was approved by the Board of Estimate. The board of directors has asked apartment owners to assess themselves $100 a room, to be added to their equity payback when they move out.
''Doesn't it make sense for us to go to ourselves instead of to a bank?'' Mr. Smith said. ''It's the cheapest rate anywhere and we pay ourselves back when we move. But if you need two, three thousand, you can't get that kind of money out of people, so you go to the bank.''
In some cases, a condominium or co-op could resort to the reserve fund, the rainy-day account that well-managed buildings gradually accumulate from a portion of each tenant's monthly charges. The size of the reserve depends on the age and condition of the building, experts say, and they also agree that it is best used for emergencies, and must always be replenished.
''Put the contingency charges in your budget and if you don't use them, don't spend it to reduce your maintenance, but bank it and watch it grow, '' Mr. Chernicoff said.
A far more typical example of co-op financing than either the huge Penn South or the relatively wealthy 670 West End Avenue is the Carlton, a 144-unit, five-year-old co-op at 3441 85th Street, in Jackson Heights, Queens. The 43-year old building was converted in 1984 with a $250,000 reserve fund from the sponsor and a $900,000, 11.75 percent, five-year mortgage due at the end of this year.
The reserve fund was quickly spent on badly needed new windows and the building needed more money for longer-term repairs, said Martha Goldstein, the board treasurer, who bought her parents' two-bedroom apartment in the building for its terrace and broad views of the Manhattan skyline.
In 1987, the co-op took out a $1 million second mortgage and spent $800,000 of that on a complete masonry waterproofing and the rest on additional amenities such as a master television antenna.
''At that point we realized that our balloon mortgage was coming due,'' Ms. Goldstein said, ''so our lawyer negotiated with Citibank to assume the entire mortgage debt and give us some extra money for more improvements, at a rate lower than on the first and second mortgages.''
The first mortgage interest rate of 11.75 percent dropped to 9.75 percent on the new, 10-year loan, and the building ended up with with an extra $500,000 to rebuild elevators, redecorate the lobby and halls, encapsulate asbestos in the basement, renovate gardens and repair the building's 85-space parking garage.
''All of this was done without raising the maintenance at all, because the interest rates are so much lower,'' Ms. Goldstein said.
The earlier second mortgage in 1987, charged at 1.5 points over the then 10.2 percent prime rate, necessitated a 30 percent maintenance increase the following year, however, and an additional 2.34 points may be necessary at the end of this year to pay for increased staff salaries. Monthly maintenance charges have accordingly grown from $200 to $400 a month when the building was converted to $300 to nearly $500 a month today.
''That doesn't sound bad, but this is Queens, this isn't Manhattan,'' Ms. Goldstein remarked. ''We now have the best building in our neighborhood, but our maintenance is also the one of the highest, to the point where people who would normally want to buy in our building can't afford it.''
HOW do co-op boards find out that their maintenance is getting out of line with the surrounding community? From real estate agents, Ms. Goldstein said. Would-be sellers quickly bring the message back from their visits with local brokers, a message, she said, mimicking a broker, that goes: ''If you could just get your board to do something about your maintenance . . .''
For Ms. Goldstein, a freelance book editor, learning the ins and out of co-op financing - and refinancing - has brought home one lesson in particular: Hire good help.
''Shareholders don't know an awful lot about it and they don't care,'' she remarked. ''They used to be renters, like I was, and they just want to go to work and pay their maintenance and live their lives, and they don't want to get involved with running a major real estate operation.''
So hiring a lawyer, Morris Ordover, became a first step in handling the myriad negotiations with banks and contractors, she declared.
''Lawyers don't just interpret real estate law, they do your negotiating so that your unpaid board members don't have to get involved in this,'' she said. ''I mean, we're talking about a $2.2 million mortage and another million-dollar capital improvement fund and here I am, being Donald Trump for nothing.''

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: The Capone Connection;
Transforming a Onetime Chicago Mob Headquarters

BYLINE: By JODY BROTT

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
A $2.6 million Federal urban development action grant awarded to this city last month has provided the last link in the financing of a $28.6 million project to transform the historic Lexington Hotel, where Al Capone had his headquarters, and a neighboring building into a 258-suite hotel with 32,000 square feet of retail space.
Its developer, Dr. Ganesan Visvabharathy of Vilas Investment Properties of Chicago, plans to annex a three-story building and combine it with the hotel - known in its later years as the New Michigan Hotel - providing 50 suites and 16,000 square feet of retail space. One Capone suite will be restored as a tourist attraction.
Construction on the hotel, on the northeast corner of Michigan Avenue and Cermak Road, three miles south of the Loop and four blocks west of the McCormick Place exposition complex, is to begin in November and take two years. Its original name will be restored. 
The Lexington project joins a booming Chicago hotel market. Six hotels have been built downtown since 1987, bringing the number there to 55, with about 25,000 rooms, according to the Chicago Convention and Visitors' Bureau.
Half a dozen more are scheduled to open over the next two years. Unlike the Lexington, however, all the new hotels are either in or north of the Loop.
Dr. Visvabharathy, who has a Ph.D. in business administration from the University of Illinois, has retained for historical restoration John Vinci, an architect known for restorations of Carson Pirie Scott & Company, the Trading Room of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Frank Lloyd Wright Studio in Oak Park, Ill. He is now restoring the lobby of the Chicago Tribune Tower. The local architectural firm of Loebl, Schlossman & Hackl is designing new construction.
A Chicago landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Lexington is vacant, boarded and windowless, its once elegant plaster and marblework vandalized. It stands in what once was a thriving commercial and industrial neighborhood that has now been designated a tax-increment financing district, a 20-block blighted area bounded by 21st Street on the north, 23d Street on the south, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive on the east and State Street on the west.
Dr. Visvabharathy has an option to buy the hotel, which he has said he will exercise in November. The building was acquired in 1983 by the Sunbow Foundation, a professional women's group that intended to renovate it while training women in construction trades. But it ran out of money.
The developer said he will pay $750,000 for the hotel and $1.5 million for the adjacent building, which currently houses small businesses.
In addition to the urban development action grant, which lets the city make a low-interest loan of $2.6 million to Vilas Investment Properties, $17.5 million will come from private lenders, $3 million from private investors and $5.5 million from the city's tax-increment financing bonds. These are retired by tax increments gained from improved properties. The city expects the completed project to generate $685,000 in annual taxes.
''The city very much supports this project,'' said Joseph J. James, the Commissioner of Economic Development. ''It will provide a tourist attraction where there currently is an eyesore and we hope it will activate a ripple effect throughout the area in terms of revitalization.''
MR. JAMES also said that he hoped the hotel would handle the spillover from McCormick Place, which added 534,000 square feet of exhibit space - about a third more than it had - two and a half years ago and complement the 30-acre Chinatown expansion scheduled to begin next month six blocks west of the hotel.
He said the Lexington work would provide 175 jobs during construction and, once complete, 432 permanent jobs.
However, Eugene E. Krell, senior associate of the local Real Estate Research Corporation, a national consulting firm, called the project ''questionable,'' adding that ''it will be difficult to achieve the room rate required to cover the cost of renovation in that location.''
Dr. Visvabharathy said he will charge $99 a room, 20 percent less than downtown competitors. He said he will target ''the built-in market'' of the nearby McCormick Place, one of the country's busiest exhibition centers, which Charles L. Durham, financial consultant to the Lexington Hotel project, said lacks nearby hotel space.
From his hotel window, Capone watched Eliot Ness and his Prohibition agents drive a caravan of seized beer trucks. When Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. interviewed him in his hotel suite for Liberty magazine in 1931, the mob leader called for a ''safe and unspoiled America'' and said he had fed ''350,000 people a day'' the previous winter.
But ''even if Capone never set foot in it,'' said Timothy J. Samuelson, an expert in Chicago architecture and history, the hotel would hold its own as ''a very important early building.''
In its heyday, the hotel was known as an extension of the fashionable Prairie Avenue District, where some of Chicago's wealthiest citizens, including George Pullman and Marshall Field, lived. It also is one of the few architectural survivors of its kind, as famous as a prototype of the Chicago School of architecture as it is infamous as the site of Capone's headquarters.
The buff-colored brick building has a terra-cotta cornice and a central skylighted court that extends from the second to the tenth floor. It was designed as a first-class hotel by Clinton J. Warren, one of the important architects of the turn of the century. Warren, who specialized in hotels, adapted the openness of Louis Sullivan's skyscraper metal frame office buildings to a hotel format.
The hotel opened in 1892. One of its first guests that year was President Grover Cleveland, in Chicago to dedicate the World's Columbian Exposition. Considered an exclusive address, the hotel provided permanent housing for the well-to-do and rooms for transients. However, by the early 1900's, the wealthy began to move to North Lake Shore Drive, making the area less desirable.
In 1928, during Prohibition, Capone and his gang moved onto the fourth and fifth floors of what had by then become a second-rate hotel in a declining neighborhood. One of his suites - with a bay window and one-of-a-kind luxurious pea-green-and-lavender-tiled bathroom - was on the southwest corner of the fifth floor.
IN 1931, when Capone was convicted of income-tax evasion and sent to prison, his entourage moved out. Seven years later, to try to create a more positive image, the name was changed to the New Michigan Hotel. The effort failed, the hotel became a brothel and the area continued to decline.
Despite the success of Mama Batt's, a well-known kosher restaurant on the ground floor, the hotel closed in 1980. Three years later it was put on the National Register of Historic Places and in 1985 was designated a Chicago landmark.
In 1985, too, the television talk-show host Geraldo Rivera did a program featuring the exploration of a vaulted space under the sidewalk that was to uncover what was believed to be Capone's secret vault. The only things found were a broken sidewalk and a few empty bottles believed to have belonged to contractors who worked on the building.

HEADLINE: Drug Evictions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on Oct. 1 entitled ''Running Drug Dealers Out of Public Housing'' contains a serious error with regard to eviction procedures in New York State. Let me correct the record.
The article correctly states that in federally subsidized public housing, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is permitting a waiver of the grievance procedure (administrative hearing) before going to court to seek an eviction. The intent of this waiver is to expedite the eviction of drug dealers in public housing. Incorrectly, however, you state that ''the only state without a waiver that is not seeking one is New York.'' 
Not only has New York sought such a waiver, but it was successful in doing so, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced in May of this year. Due to the Governor's initiative, New York State was the first state to receive on a statewide basis a waiver of the grievance procedure so that drug-related evictions could proceed expeditiously.
In January of this year, I established an antidrug program within the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Under this program, a number of significant steps were taken to assist housing managers throughout the state in reducing drugs and crime.
First, regulations governing evictions in state-assisted housing (18,000 units of Mitchell-Lama housing and 22,000 units of public housing) were changed earlier this year to allow faster access to the courts in drug-related cases. As a result, these housing managers can now initiate a drug-related eviction directly in court, without a prior administrative hearing. This change is similar to H.U.D.'s waiver of an administrative hearing, which affects 193,000 units of federally subsidized public housing in New York State.
Second, the state's housing agency revised the language in leases used in Mitchell-Lama housing to unequivocally state that possession of illegal drugs or weapons is grounds for eviction. Similar changes for state-assisted public housing leases will be recommended shortly.
Third, we are continuing to assist our housing managers in the field with a wide range of technical assistance on ways to improve security in their developments and seek funding for programs to prevent and reduce drugs and crime. Special training and materials for antidrug programs have been developed for this purpose.
The state housing agency has a long-term commitment to combating drugs in housing. We will remain actively involved in finding effective and sound ways to eliminate drugs and crime, to insure that safe, affordable housing is available for the people of the state, who deserve it.

 BODY:
More than two years after New York City began the nation's largest low- and moderate-income housing program, construction is moving at full throttle. In one recent initiative, work is nearing completion on El Rosario, a complex of 51 two-family homes in a blighted industrial section of the East Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn. 
The noncontiguous project, bounded by Bushwick Avenue, White, McKibbin, Seigel and Moore Streets, is being financed by the city, the state and the New York City Partnership, a nonprofit economic development organization. The homes are being built by the Beechwood Organization of New Hyde Park, L.I. They are to be sold for $141,000, far below the price of a comparable Brooklyn property.
Each of the homes will have a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath owner's unit and a three-bedroom income-producing apartment.
To qualify, buyers must be able to make a 10 percent down payment and have annual incomes of $35,000 to $53,000.

Halloween: Big Business and Big Trouble

BYLINE: By Matt Sawyers; Matt Sawyers lives in Unionville.

 BODY:
AS certainly as suburban doorbells chime when the sun goes down each Oct. 31, cash registers everywhere will relentlessly ring in the weeks preceding Halloween. Candy corn is steady at 99 cents a pound. A decent Batman costume will go as high as $20. Child-sized candy bars are piled up at the entrances and exits and checkout counters of grocery stores. School is back in session. Halloween is coming; it's in the air. 
What galls me, though, is that whenever I go off about what a publicly sanctioned scam Halloween really is, people gape at me and say, ''It's for the kids! Where's your heart?'' In addition to being a numbing platitude, this is patently false. Halloween is big business and therefore big trouble, friends. I think greater scrutiny should be paid to see exactly who gets what from it.
The economic boons of Halloween begin well before it and peak around the night of Oct. 30 (known to some as Cabbage Night), when toilet paper and egg sales go to the moon. High school students especially love to pelt friends, houses, planes, trains and automobiles with eggs and are known to gift wrap small pickup trucks in toilet paper.
In my old neighborhood in Avon no thinking adult would step outside on the night of the 30th, except Mr. Stockwell, who turned on searchlights and walked the perimeter of his yard with a softball bat. Who could blame him? More to the point, who could simply explain to him that we were receiving our first exposure to the tenets of vigilantism and guerrilla warfare?
The economic dominoes fall. Expect to see an immediate run on cleaning products in the days after Cabbage Night and Halloween, when homesteaders emerge from the house to assess egg and soap damage to their cars, which somehow always seem to absorb the brunt.
In the next six months, orthodontists and dentists will probably notice a surplus of taffy deposits in young mouths. A dentist friend of mine in West Hartford confided in me once; ''From the mouths of babes comes a very good living. Sometimes even a whole Porsche.''
Lunacy is one with the moon, they say. So what can be done? I answered the door last year in my Ed Meese mask, and they still came in droves. The year before I played Barry Manilow at peak volume and the doorbell rang all night. One year I reached my limit and sprinkled dry pet food into the outstretched pillowcases after I ran out of candy. The following morning my neighbor called and asked if I was missing a mailbox bearing my name and street number and could I please remove it from his compost pile.
One department store will be announcing its ''Million Dollar Halloween Clearance Sale'' soon, as it always does two weeks or so before the 31st.
Now, though, it occurs to me that dwelling on the economics of Halloween ignores the truly nightmarish aspect of it: The mobilization of our children against their adult oppressors. Let us keep this in mind this Oct. 31 as we lurch out of our easy chairs, put down an old copy of ''Lord of the Flies'' and trudge to the door to feed the armies of the night.

HEADLINE: The Social Cost Of Low Wages

 BODY:
The article dealing with the homeless problem in New Jersey was very timely (''State Grapples With Homelessness,'' Sept. 17). The reference made to the low wages and high cost of rent facing the poor in our state has been confirmed by many private agencies involved in aiding the homeless. 
In our state, we have seen the decline of the manufacturing sector from 40 percent of all jobs to a new low of 20 percent. The closing of manufacturing plants, paying much higher wages than the service sector, has forced our middle class into the poverty level. Rampant unemployment and little hope for the future have spawned rising crime, divorce, suicides and a drug culture among the poor in inner cities.
The cure lies in providing more higher-paying jobs to skilled and semi skilled workers. We have to recognize the fact that a misguided trade policy by the Federal Government has exported millions of manufacturing jobs to countries with wage levels but a fraction of ours.
If our policy was founded on common sense and related to our people's needs, a revival in American industry would result. The policies of Japan and the European community are realistic, and their citizens the beneficiaries. Our Government has the responsibility to do likewise. Only then can we reverse the decline in the living standard of our middle class.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
Fabricating 326 Rental Apartments in an Old Mill Town

BYLINE: By MICKY BACA

DATELINE: NASHUA N.H.

 BODY:
Since the completion last January of the conversion of a 160-year-old mill here that is on the National Register of Historic Places, all but a handful of its 143 apartments have been rented and this city considers the success of the project, called Clocktower Place, a major step in revitalizing its downtown.
Both the first and second phase of the project have substantial Federal funding and thus must provide units at below-market rents to low- and moderate-income families. The second phase, which will begin soon, will create an additional 183 apartments, bringing the total to 326, as well as a 492-space underground garage on the six-acre site. The site now has a 63-space parking lot. 
The one- to three-bedroom project is moving forward at a time when mill conversions, plentiful throughout New England since the mid-70's, have been curtailed in response to a slower economy and a scarcity of Federal housing funds, according to Margo Webber of Newton, Mass., a historic preservation consultant who worked on the project.
She said that the complex once housed the world's largest blanket mill, operated by the Nashua Manufacturing Company. It was purchased by Textron in 1945 and shut down three years later when many of the nation's textile manufacturers moved to the South, where both land and labor were cheaper.
On Wednesday, in Lowell, Mass., 15 miles south of this city, the first phase of a $60 million conversion of the former Massachusetts Mills complex will open. Joseph Mullins of Boston is the developer. Of 442 rental apartments planned, 130 will be ready for tenants, according to Reginald A. Ouellette, Lowell's director of Economic and Industrial Development. In addition, he said, a $50 million conversion of the former Boott Mill into 600,000-square feet of office space by Congress Group Properties of Boston is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
The Clocktower Housing Association Limited Partnership, whose general partner is Edward Brice of Brookline, Mass., secured housing development action grants to finance almost half of both phases of Clocktower Place. It is the first conversion of a mill complex to housing in this city of 80,000 residents.
Jane Adelman, the project manager, said the two-building first phase cost $12 million, with $5 million of that sum covered by the Federal grant.
The second phase, which will involve the conversion of three more of the old mill's seven connecting buildings, is expected to cost $21 million, including $10 million in Federal grants.
Under the grant requirements, Clocktower Place must offer below-market rents to low- and moderate-income tenants for 25 years on 20 percent of the units in the first phase and on 30 percent of the units in the second phase, according to David Boesch, the city's Community Development director.
Below-market rents for the first phase will range from $355 to $525; for the second phase, rents may be no more than 30 percent of a tenant's income.
Market rents range from $615 to $975 for the first phase and are expected to be $700 to $1,000 for the second, according to Ms. Adelman.
The five-story mill building complex hugs the bank of the Nashua River, whose waters were used to power the generators for the mammoth textile mill operations that once thrived here. Ms. Webber said a slower real estate market, the lack of Federal housing subsidies available for mill conversions and a 1986 tax reform measure that limited the tax credit for historic preservation have slowed the pace of mill conversion in the past two years. She said she is hopeful that an effort under way to restore the tax credit will revive mill conversions.
Bruce Polishook is president of CWC Builders, a Newton, Mass., which did the historic renovations for the first phase of Clocktower Place. Now he is transforming the Kennedy Biscuit Factory in Cambridge, Mass., into 142 apartments with the help of Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency funding. He said fewer mill renovations are now being planned in the region.
''We are looking at a couple of them but it is much tougher for developers to make them work,'' he said. ''There is less state and Federal money available.''
Many experts say mill conversions to condominiums are now on hold because the market is overbuilt and extremely soft. But Michael Prozeralik of the Architectural Team in Newton, Mass., the architectural project director for the Clocktower Place, said Nashua still is in need of good rental housing.''
Mr. Boesch termed Clocktower Place ''a substantial project in the downtown that signals that it is in a transition period.'' To implement the downtown revitalization, he said, the private sector has joined the city in promoting the Downtown 2000 Plan to encourage a mix of residential, retail and commercial development that would make the area the city's focal point.
He noted that a proposal for a 130,000-square-foot office-retail structure called Gateway Center is now in the final approval stages. The project will preserve the facade of the Chase-Sears block on Main Street, with new 10-story structure rising behind it.
A key element of the Downtown 2000 Plan will be the rejuvenation of the Millyard - 30 buildings, some of which are now occupied by light industrial enterprises, that once turned out miles of flannel, cotton and denim. Mr. Boesch said that the city hopes to see the revitalization of the district realized by the turn of the century.
He said that the rental success of Clocktower Place has been ''quite remarkable.''
''It's nice to see middle income, younger families locating in the downtown,'' Mr. Boesch said. ''We hope that this developer or others will be willing to pick up additional mill buildings and do similar good things.''
Ms. Adelman said she would not rule out a proposal by her company to do a third phase for Clocktower Place. ''It's moved fairly quickly and we're very pleased because it was an unknown,'' she said.
The Clocktower Place mills were built between 1823 and 1920 as the textile manufacturing business grew in Nashua, according to Ms. Webber. In recent decades, the buildings had been used for a variety of small manufacturing and warehouse ventures. Mill buildings adjoining the Clocktower Place project now house businesses ranging from tote-bag manufacturers to trucking operations.
The windows for Clocktower Place are replicas of the original mill windows, providing ample light and river views to the rental units, which feature 12- to 14-foot ceilings and sun porches. The mill complex contains two clocktowers that are in the process of being restored, according to the acting property manager Erol Duymazlar.
The project, which features a fitness center with a sauna and whirlpool, is within a block of the city's Mine Falls Park, a 350-acre recreational area along the river.

HEADLINE: Scrutinizing the World of Taxation

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: HARTSDALE

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to international taxation, businessman and bankers here and abroad look to Walter H. and Dorothy B. Diamond. From their office here, the husband-and-wife team provide a constant stream of data on the changing world of finance and trade.
Their 46 books - on such topics as tax havens, capital formation, investment incentives and free-trade zones - were produced for a series published by Mathew Bender in Albany. Its volumes are sold to 10,000 subscribers worldwide. 
To produce these books, the Diamonds have 600 correspondents worldwide who provide them with timely financial information and they also make trips overseas each year. Some of the traveling also stems from Mr. Diamond's work as the United Nation's international trade adviser and as an adviser to the United States Agency for International Development. He is also the author of the monthly International Trade Newsletter, published by 17 banks and trade organizations, and writes a monthly column for The London Financial Times.
 
Closing Foreign Banks
Mr. Diamond, who is in his mid-70's, traces his career to the onset of World War II, when the Federal Government put him in charge of closing down the German, Japanese and Italian banks in this country. He later became the manager for international taxation at two major accounting firms and has been a national bank examiner and a Federal Reserve Bank foreign analyst.
Mrs. Diamond, an editor and columnist whose specialty was once consumer affairs, said she began collaborating with her husband shortly after their marriage 42 years ago.
''I started out by editing his copy and learned a good deal about taxation,'' she recalled. ''So in 1973, when we were in Taiwan and Matthew Bender, our publisher, asked Walter to do a book on tax havens of the world, I was able to encourage him to take the assignment and I said I'd help him do it.''
 
'A Quick Study'
Her husband added: ''Dorothy, who is a clever woman and a quick study, soon became an expert in capital formation, marketing and international relations, free-trade zones and tax treaties. We became a team,'' he added, ''and Dorothy has had the distinction of becoming the first woman to address the International Tax Planning Association.''
Earlier this month, the Diamonds were completing a 450-page looseleaf supplement their subscribers will receive in January. Four such supplements are issued each year to keep pace with the changing factors that influence investment decisions, Mr. Diamond said.
The couple spoke freely about how they believe recent events affect the position of the United States in the international marketplace.
''There would have been a lot more selling this last Friday the 13th if President Bush had had his way and the capital-gains tax had been reduced,'' Mr. Diamond said, discussing the sharp drop in the stock market that occurred Oct. 13. He noted that his opinion was different thatn that of the President and that he felt that a reduction in the capital-gains tax does not automatically result in increased investment in plants and equipment.
''That's the President's philosophy, but actually, investment in plants and equipment has been going up steadily - 4 to 12 percent every year - for the last 10 years,'' he said. ''As for our capital gains tax, which is presently 28 or 33 percent, it is already lower than the capital gains tax paid in the rest of the world, where the rate is anywhere from 35 percent to 60 percent.''
 
Encouraging the Tax Havens
A reduction in capital gains tax, Mr. Diamond suggested, would have encouraged people to leave the stock market and to invest their money at a higher rate of interest in offshore tax havens. ''That would have resulted in even a larger flight of capital out of the country,'' he said.
In recent years, Mr. Diamond said, billions of American dollars have gone to 50 tax havens in the world. ''Tax havens have become a tremendous business in a lot of countries,'' he said. ''Guernsey, in the Channel Islands, for instance, is so overloaded with management-investment firms and branches of foreign banks vying for business from American investors that overcrowding has become a problem.''
The Cayman Islands, with $240 billion in United States currency, ranks first on the tax-haven list, he said. ''Then comes Luxembourg, with $200 billion, followed by the Bahamas with $180 billion. That's a lot of money going out of the country to our disadvantage.''
''I heard John Maynard Keynes say once, 'So goes capital expenditure, so goes the economy,' and that certainly is the case in the United States today,'' he added.
 
The Value of Incentives
Other countries in the free world, Mrs. Diamond said, encourage spending for plants and equipment by giving corporations incentives. ''Governments abroad pass laws that give companies subsidies so they can invest in their manufacturing plants, while we, on the other hand, are becoming a service economy,'' she said.
Tax-free trade zones is another area in which the Diamonds have specialized. Mr. Diamond helped design free-trade zones at Colon in Panama, Shannon in Ireland and Kaoshiung in Taiwan. Taiwan is the largest free-trade zone in the world.
Mr. Diamond said that in 1970 there were only seven such zones in the United States. ''Now there are 160, including No. 37 in New Windsor, N.Y., where Stewart Airport is based, and No. 37A in North Tarrytown, where the General Motors plant is located.''
 
'Not the Original Intent'
''A zone is a fenced-in area,'' he explained. ''A subzone, such as the one in North Tarrytown, is an individual plant. Free trade zones first appeared in the United States in 1934, during the Depression; they were seen as an attempt to help exports. But now they're being used to help companies that have problems and companies that want to raise their profit margins, which was not the original intent at all.''
Mrs. Diamond, who has spoken to the Rotary Club of Manhattan on this subject, said companies that want free-trade-zone status must apply to the United States Foreign Trade Zone Board at the Department of Commerce.
''A zone designation gives a company the ability to import raw materials from abroad without duty, which in turn gives them the opportunity to cut costs,'' she said. ''Our objection to the zone status for companies is that only a few of them - seven or eight I believe - are exporting their goods, which was the rationale for the trade zones in the first place. Companies with trade-zone status, we believe, should be exporting goods. Especially now, which would help our outstanding trade deficit.''
In another project, the Diamonds have put together 37 volumes of ''International Tax Treaties of All Nations'' for Oceana Publications in Dobbs Ferry. One reviewer called the latest volume, which has just been published, the world's most comprehensive contribution to the literature of international taxation.
''The first International Tax Treaty volume was compiled in 1975,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''We bring out supplements when they're needed to keep current. And we've been averaging two to five a year. We have about 26,000 subscribers on our list.''

HEADLINE: More Boats Being Kept On Racks

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
MORE Connecticut boats are being kept year round in warehouses instead of on the water, as rack storage buildings, or boat valet operations, are constructed along the coast.
A boat is stored on racks, under cover, until its owner wants to use it; then it is loaded on a forklift truck and brought to the water. Most services offer one launching and re-racking a day during the boating season.
A new rack storage building opened recently in Branford, and developers are hurrying to finish others in East Lyme, Norwalk and Waterford to accommodate boat owners looking for winter storage. 
Boat valet services are also being planned in Greenwich and Stamford, and the Harbor Development Commission in New Haven is considering one there.
''There certainly are a lot more of them now than there were even a few years ago,'' said Dan Rothenberg, the principal environmental analyst with the Coastal Resources Management unit of the State Department of Environmental Protection. ''And that extends from Greenwich to Stonington.''
Although the state keeps no list of rack storage buildings in Connecticut, Ray Bovich, president of the Connecticut Marine Trades Association, said his group knew of two sites in Clinton, and one each in Milford and Old Saybrook. He said another large boat valet service recently opened in West Haven.
The boat valets under development, or on the drawing board, would at least double the available spaces, Mr. Bovich acknowledged. ''This kind of facility makes a heck of a lot of sense.'' Rack storage is typically cheaper than renting a slip, and the boat's parts will last longer if they are out of the corrosive salt water. In addition, as coastal land has become scarce, regulations for building on it have stiffened.
''It's a lot easier to build a rack storage building than it is to get approval to build anything in the water,'' said William T. Gardella Jr., a spokesman for Rex Marine in Norwalk, which is completing a 207-space warehouse.
Stanley M. White, president of Ocean and Coastal Consultants, which is planning the 225-space boat valet service in Greenwich, said: ''The benefits to the boat owner is the boat is secure, and it's out of the elements. You're going to see a lot more of these in Fairfield County.''
Boat valet services have been popular for years in warmer climates, and in resort communities. But until about five years ago, there was a surplus of dock space, and no incentive to develop rack storage here.
But the number of boats has increased dramatically in Connecticut over the last few years. From 77,078 boats registered at the end of 1985, the number increased to 81,485 the following year, 86,444 in 1987, and 94,819 last year.
A few years ago, Mr. Rothenberg said, rack storage buildings typically housed boats 18 to 22 feet in length. ''Now they're trying to cram the largest boats they possibly can onto the racks,'' Mr. Rothenberg said. He said 30-foot boats were routinely racked at some services.
''Rack storage is an attractive option, environmentally and economically,'' he said. Rack storage reduces the danger of a fuel spill and the need to coat the boat's hull with anti-fouling paints, which dissolve into the water.
The owner benefits because the boat is more secure and storage on racks is as much as $600 lower than at a slip for a 30-foot boat, valet owners said. For example, Rex Marine is selling space in its nearly completed rack storage building for $80 per foot for the 1990 boating season, or $40 a foot for the winter, Mr. Gardella said. A slip can be as high as $100 a foot per season in the Norwalk area.
Rack storage permits the marina owner to use dock space for larger boats, which pay more. ''A smaller boat just doesn't give the marina the same dollar value for the area it takes up in the water,'' Mr. White said. ''This concept really helps the little guy, who might not even be able to find a slip otherwise.'' But many people are worried about a glut of boat valets. ''It used to be so bad you couldn't get an in-water slip no matter what price you were willing to pay,'' Mr. Gardella said. ''But right now, it's not like that.''
So far, he said, Rex Marine has filled about 30 of its 207 slips, and it could take as long as two to three years to reach capacity.
''If you want to build one of these it better be with a service or sales operation, because there's going to be competition and you need something to convince people to use yours,'' Mr. Gardella said. ''People who build one of these and expect people to flock in are going to be disappointed.''
Planners are also questioning whether developers are rushing into plans for boat valet services without consideration to protecting views of the waterfront.
Norman F. Cole, principal planner in Stamford, said a plan for a 250-space boat valet, along with 200 units of condominiums and 100 marina slips on the site of the Hoffman Fuel depot, has received mixed reviews.
''We liked the idea of boat rack storage in that it creates an opportunity for people with smaller boats,'' he said, and the city encourages diversity on the waterfront.
''But we also raised questions about whether it can really fit on this site,'' Mr. Cole said. He said with the condominiums the site was nearly covered, and the boat valet buildings would block views of the water.
Mr. Cole said he was also concerned about the proposal to have forklifts running boats back and forth through a residential area.
''I don't know of anyplace in Connecticut where one of these has been integrated with a condominium project,'' Mr. Cole said. ''Obviously, we've got a lot of questions that need to be answered during our review.''
Mr. Rothenberg said another problem is as the land near the waterfront gets used up, proposals for boat valets are coming in for property further and further removed from the water.
''We've got some proposals now where these boats would have to be hauled some pretty good distances on a fork lift just to get to the water,'' Mr. Rothenberg said.

THE FOUR LITTLE DRAGONS
By Brian Kelly and
Mark London.
432 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $21.95.
The Four Little Dragons - or Little Tigers as they are more frequently called - are South Korea, Taiwan and the two city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong. Their postwar economic growth, founded on hard work, ingenuity, a kind of Confucian family solidarity and well-targeted export drives to the developed countries (the United States in particular), has created one of the great success stories of modern times. They started in the shadow of the Japanese ''miracle'' - and were undoubtedly influenced both by Japan's business strategies and bureaucratic planning. But their extraordinary economic growth figures have exceeded even the consistently rising growth rates of Japan itself. 
Business entrepreneurs in all four economies are sometimes called ''Confucian Capitalists'' (though the term is used advisedly). Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong are basically Chinese polities. Their people are products of a Confucian heritage that stresses loyalty to the group, an almost fanatical devotion to education and family and the general acceptance of strong, patriarchal Government authority. South Korea, too, has a heavy Confucian heritage; and even more than the others, it is the very model of what some American economists have called the ''capitalist developmental state,'' whose aggressive economic expansionism has given the phrase ''free enterprise'' a new and often curious meaning.
The talent and industry of the Four Little Dragons, although often demonstrated in quite a different way from American preconceptions, have much to teach us. All in all, this is a subject that cries out for a good book.
Unfortunately, ''The Four Little Dragons'' is far from that. In fact, Brian Kelly and Mark London's hop-skip-and-jump travelogue through the four states (plus Thailand, thrown in at the end for no extra cost) may be the most carelessly written book about Asia - or almost anyplace else - that this reviewer has ever read. Full of cliches, unsupported generalizations, half-truths and factual errors, the serious publication of this work suggests the gulf between the realities of the dynamic Asia-Pacific world and the insular perceptions of Manhattan publishers.
Apparently fresh from the steaming jungles of the Amazon (the scene of their last book), Mr. Kelly, a business magazine editor, and Mr. London, a Washington lawyer, decided to charge into the urban jungles of Southeast Asia: ''Here was another frontier that invited exploration,'' Mr. Kelly writes in the introduction. ''For all either of us knew about them, the people of these countries might have been Indians from the remotest rain forest. Yet more than the Amazon, the Four Little Dragons were beginning to have a profound effect on the United States. From the trade deficit figures to the unemployed steelworkers to the almond-eyed math geniuses at MIT, it was apparent that the world no longer belonged to the Caucasian race. What we wanted to know was 'who are those guys?' ''
With this premise, and an oversupply of breathless prose, our two travelers set out for Dragonland. Their passage through each destination seems to have followed a pattern. First they obtained the services of local government public relations officials, whom they would use as foils for various quips and pleasantries about the country involved. Then, obviously too shrewd to be taken in by mere propaganda, they found some knowing friends or acquaintances who would tell them what was really going on. These volunteer Sherpas ranged from successful local businessmen with American college educations to fellow drinkers the authors ran into in the evidently innumerable local bars, nightclubs and hostess spas on their tour. This on-the-spot reporting is then buttressed with copious quotations from various authorities like James Clavell, Anthony Burgess, Robert Elegant, John le Carre, Theodore H. White and ''The World of Suzie Wong.''
Mr. Kelly and Mr. London's sweeping generalizations are made the more distasteful by an air of condescension bordering on racism. About South Korea, for example, they declare: ''As was only hinted in our first plunge into Seoul nightlife, alcohol is the great stimulant of the Korean economy. It numbs the pain of the workingman so he can make it through another 10-hour shift of tedium. But it also binds the office workers, from stock boy to director - each drinking on his own stratum, of course, in a modern tribal ritual that is not so far removed from the tribe.''
Or here they are visiting a Government office in Taipei: ''We were escorted into a waiting room where we watched a procession of young men dressed in blue suits darting in and out of several doors, waving telexes and newspapers and shouting to one another. . . . After 15 minutes of watching this the phrase Chinese fire drill came to mind.''
The authors laugh uproariously between themselves over the Chinese mispronunciation of ''cherder,'' which as every Washingtonian knows is pronounced ''chowder,'' and just could not understand how Koreans could mispronounce the name of their LeMans (''Re-mans'') car. They even resort to the old sahib act: ''As flight time drew closer . . . we panicked and shamefully involved [sic] White Man's Privilege, with Kelly jabbering at an airline clerk that we were important businessmen about to miss a connection.''
The continual Rover Boys tone is all the more unfortunate because the authors - obviously bright people - have included much good and interesting material in their account. They correctly point out the continuing political and social unrest that lies behind the extraordinary South Korean economic success story, as well as the inevitable climb of the low wages on which so much of the country's economic progress has been based. They were certainly not deceived by Lee Kuan Yew's velvet-gloved dictatorship in Singapore. They rightly make a point of Taiwan's extraordinary congeries of huge cash surpluses and small business, with direct tie-ins to merchants and wholesale buyers in the United States. They give us a sense of the frenetic beat of Hong Kong, the city that keeps grinding out its products and making its financial deals in the shadow of ultimate takeover by Deng Xiaoping's China. They also perform a service to American readers by going through the details of the huge Carrian Investments scandal that rocked Hong Kong some years back.
Still, this useful information is mixed indiscriminately with errors of fact. For example, Yoido Island, the site of the National Assembly and a forest of new high-rise office buildings in Seoul, is referred to as ''Cheju Island,'' which happens to be about 300 miles south of the city. In discussing the Korean War, the authors reappoint the Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, to the office of Secretary of War, and suggest a truce two years and almost 100,000 lost lives before the actual armistice was declared. And this is the first time I learned that Taiwan's land reform occurred because ''Chiang [Kai Shek] wanted to end landlord abuse.'' (It was forced on his Government mainly through American pressure.) Of course readers can enjoy vicariously the authors' on-the-spot investigation along the nightclub circuit. It remains a pity that they couldn't have taken some of their bar time and socked away a week or two in the library instead - or better still, spent a little more time in the countries they write about.

WHEN GIANTS LEARN TO DANCE: Mastering the Challenges of Strategy, Management, and Careers in the 1990s. By Rosabeth Moss Kanter. (Simon & Schuster, $21.95.) This could have been a deadly academic treatment, full of charts and graphs, footnotes and tables. Instead, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, has written a relaxed, readable account of the hows and whys of change in American corporations. In tomorrow's corporate Olympics, the prizes will go to the businesses and managers who have met the challenge of ''the ultimate corporate balancing act'': organizational and structural changes that will require, simultaneously, cutting back and growing, doing more with less. It is a complex world, Ms. Kanter says, and Americans are up against tough competition. Business is in transition because the world economy is changing, and the author peppers her pages with examples. While older corporations, like Eastman Kodak, learn to update their approaches, newer ones, like Apple Computer, are evolving from entrepreneurial start-ups to more mature, settled organizations. Change is the key: becoming lean without becoming mean, restructuring for maximum ''entrepreneurial thrust,'' developing and using synergies. (Once an upstart buzzword, ''synergy'' is now an accepted academic term meaning a ''whole that multiplies the value of the parts.'') Synergies involve getting more for less; hence the streamlining, bureaucracy-cutting, decentralizing that are necessary in today's postentrepreneurial corporate world. For all the change, however, and the uncharted waters ahead, Ms. Kanter makes it clear that people are the dominant factor and the most important resource in a successful business. The demands on them are multiple and conflicting; restructuring can disempower them, but they are the key to success or failure.

HEADLINE: In Oakland After the Series, Joy With an Edge of Sadness

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 29

 BODY:
Oaklanders had waited years for this moment, to beat San Francisco in the World Series, to show the world they had something better than their snooty neighbor across the bay.
But while their Athletics drubbed the Giants in an impressive four-game sweep, the celebrations were decidedly muted today in this city where 40 died and 2,500 lost their homes in an earthquake 12 days ago.
Green and yellow balloons festooned the Athletics' locker room last night, but there was no spraying of champagne, and organizers said today that they had scaled back plans for the official victory rally scheduled for 11 o'clock Monday morning in Jack London Square on the waterfront.
 
Minute of Silence
The team will still arrive and depart by ferry to the tunes of the Oakland Municipal Jazz Band, but fireworks and a parade have been scratched, in part because such enthusiasm was regared as unseemly and partly because so many streets are still blocked by quake damage. The parade would have been very crooked. 
''We've scaled back dramatically,'' said a spokeswoman for the Celebrate Oakland Committee, Cassie Arnold, who added that the city would forgo its plan to give each player a gift. A moment of silence for the dead is planned for the one-hour ceremony, and fans will be encouraged to donate to the Northern California Earthquake Relief Fund.
The delayed Series victory came as a needed lift after so many stressful days. About 900 people spontaneously gathered for a noisy celebration at the square last night; fans danced and sang in the streets downtown, and carloads of Oaklanders with pennants, banners and signs cruised up and down Broadway, the main street, much of the night.
At Ricky's Sports Lounge and Restaurant, where a boisterous crowd of about 250 people erupted into dance and song at the last out, Rich Kapferer, a patron, said: ''Oakland needed this. It's such a lift. It's going to put everything back on its feet again.''
Even Margaret Currey, who spent this morning trying to salvage a few possessions from what had been her home in the historic Madison Park Apartments at Ninth and Oak Streets, was ecstatic. ''A sweep!'' she exclaimed. ''We knew the A's were going to win.'' And nearby, at a Red Cross shelter at Laney College, some of the displaced gathered around a television set Saturday night to cheer the team.
 
Hard Realities to Face
But once the cheering stopped, there remained some hard realities for this East Bay city of 356,000. Oakland had expected to reap $100 million in economic benefit from the American League playoffs and World Series. While some of that certainly came in, it paled before the devastation left by the 15-second temblor. Damage has been estimated at $1.2 billion, and that does not include the Nimitz Freeway, whose collapse killed 39 people.
The quake, which killed and displaced far more people here than it did in San Francisco, aggravated Oakland's chronic problems of poverty, homelessness and drug abuse. It damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, shut City Hall and 11 other municipal buildings and forced dozens of stores to close.
Though the cleanup and reconstruction will bring an influx of Federal and state relief funds, officials here say those efforts will not begin to make up for the damage. Some business leaders add, however, that the quake will not delay the city's $250 million downtown revival plan; businesses displaced in other counties may even want to relocate in Oakland, where there are many vacant offices built to modern standards for quake resistance.
While diehard fans were glued to their televisions, the Series clearly did not attract the normal interest. Baseball could scarcely match the earthquake and its aftermath for tension and high drama.
With a brisk breeze and crystal blue skies, Jack London Square was gay and festive today, but not because of baseball. The usual Sunday farmers' market, with pumpkins and shiitake mushrooms piled high, was supplemented by a fall harvest festival that included a pie-eating contest. Nearby, a rowing regatta brought scores of crews from around the state.
There were plenty of A's fans in the crowd, including Ben and Enid Witharm. ''Things had to start going again,'' said Mr. Witharm, a retired sheet metal contractor, who was wearing a green A's cap. ''You cannot sit around and mope.'' His wife added, ''We live with tragedy.''
The team's most loyal fan may be Louise Jones, the harbor master for the pleasure boats that dock here. Dressed in Athletics green, she said she had been to every A's home game in 12 years but one, the day her son was married. For her, at least, the games provided validation that Oakland was better than San Francisco. ''We're the class side of the bay,'' she said. ''We always were. It's just that the rest of the country didn't know.''
 
'It's a Healing Game'
But at De Lauer's newsstand on Broadway, Charles Fortson picked up a Sunday paper and said he thought too much festivity was inappropriate. ''I think we should keep a low profile,'' said Mr. Fortson, an accountant for the Navy here. He is a former Brooklynite who still roots for the Mets.
The fans who gathered last night at Ricky's, with its six giant television sets and 40 smaller ones, had not forgotten the earthquake. ''There's still an underlying sense of empathy for people hurt in the earthquake, but tonight was baseball,'' said Morgan Colebrook. ''It's a healing game.''

HEADLINE: LEARNING TO SAY NO: SCHOOLS AND THE DRUG WAR - A SPECIAL REPORT:
Judgment Replaces Fear in Drug Lessons

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Kan.

 BODY:
Once confined to a class session or two reciting horror stories and statistics, drug education in America is undergoing radical changes as the crack epidemic touches the lives of younger children across the country.
Rather than frightening students, as teachers often found themselves trying to do following the drug curriculum of the past, schools are now seeking to help students develop personal traits that make them resist drugs: strengthening their ability to make sound judgments, to handle the stressful times of life, to resist pressure from friends and to resolve confusing signals at home and in the community.
Visits to classrooms from the heart of Brooklyn to the heart of America here indicated that drug classes are now being introduced a great deal earlier than ever before and they are laced through a child's school career.
 
Need for Studies Is Cited
Preliminary indications are that the newer courses may have a beneficial effect on the students who take them. But critics of drug education programs, old and new, contend that far too little scientific evaluation has been done to know for certain. And they say the Bush Administration's new anti-drug policy does not provide enough money for such research. 
In the schools in this area, where stores stock dolls of Dorothy of Kansas innocently skipping through Oz, teachers now give 15 lessons a year coaching sixth, seventh and eighth graders on how to refuse drugs. A skit illustrates how.
In the improvisation by eighth graders, Monica Navarro warned Danita Conway that she would tell their friends that Danita is a wimp for declining marijauna. Danita, using the ploy of ''reverse pressure'' she has just learned, snapped back that she will tell their friends ''your momma still tucks you in at night.''
 
Lessons Conveyed Simply
Or, in the crack-ravaged Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, Sharon Fleishman may never mention the drug to her kindergarten pupils, but she helps the 5-year-olds understand the importance of caring for their health. In a 20-minute class about prescription drugs that she enlivens with cartoons of an intoxicated raccoon, she tries to convey a simple lifelong lesson: ''Only sick people should be taking drugs.''
The scare tactics implicit in earlier programs, particularly those of the 60's and early 70's, were based on the notion that stark facts and figures about the intoxicating effects and health perils of drugs would speak for themselves and send the message. But the thinking now is that the presentation of simple facts without helping a child deal with them has sometimes had the opposite effect. Particularly among children of poor neighborhoods, the facts often seemed to make drugs more enticing.
''Children don't learn by scare tactics,'' said Anne Garfinkel, a drug education teacher in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. Even experts who say such tactics can be effective for some children acknowledge that other approaches are needed in inner cities.
Paul J. Brounstein, senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said these tactics work best with people who have something to lose. But, he added, ''if you're dealing with older, inner-city kids, kids with an experience of failure, with few perceived opportunities, you've got to overcome a major hurdle, which says drugs are an alternative to economic success.''
The fact is that most students already know a good deal about the legal and health perils of crack and other drugs. What they often do not know, particularly if they come from chaotic or broken homes, is how to make important personal decisions and how to defend their values, says Ginay Marks, the drug coordinator of School District 15 in southern Brooklyn, which has one of New York's most ambitious programs.
Teachers who lead anti-drug classes are also trying to get across the idea that when children feel hopeless, as almost everyone does from time to time, there are solutions other than drugs. Gauging the Success Positive Indications, But With Cautions One persuasive study of the effects of drug education, published this year, focused on the Kansas City metropolitan area's experimental Refusal Skills program, the one taken by Danita and Monica. Researchers found that a year after taking the class, 3 percent of the students reported they smoked cigarettes, 4 percent drank alcohol, and 3 percent used marijuana. Figures for the schools where the program was not taught were higher: 13 percent smoked tobacco, 9 percent drank and 7 percent used marijuana.
But Dr. Joel Moskowitz, a research psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley, is quick to caution that schools chosen for the Kansas City experiment were not, strictly speaking, randomly picked. They were selected because their schedules were most flexible. Nevertheless, it turned out that the students given the drug instruction and those who were not were roughly identical in economic and racial backgrounds.
Dr. Moskowitz, who reviews applications for Federal grants for drug programs, notes that other studies that seem to show favorable results are not fully conclusive. They are usually doneat well-functioning schools for middle-class children, he said. Even when they are conducted at schools with diverse populations, the reseachers often lose track of the most troubled students, and these are the ones most likely to use drugs eventually.
''Nationally and locally there are no well-evaluated effective models for 'what works' in prevention and education,'' said a June report by Interface, a private Manhattan research group.
Still, teachers say they must try something, even if it is based only on their hunches about what will work. ''We're the only agency that can make a difference on children,'' said Cathy L. Sillman, supervisor of drug education for the Kansas City, Kan., schools. Selecting a Program A Call for 25 Hours Of Class in a Year About 70 percent of the nation's schoolchildren get at least one class in drug education during their school years, said Zili Amsel, acting director of prevention research for the National Institute of Drug Abuse. But Robert M. Stutman, special agent in charge of the New York office of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, said more than 25 hours of classes a year that are led by teachers are needed to bring about ''attitudinal changes.'' Most programs, he said, offer six to eight hours a year, do not start until junior high school and may use outsiders unfamiliar with classic teaching techniques.
School systems battling complaints that students cannot read and write well enough are finding it difficult to pack 25 hours of drug education into a school year. Nevertheless, many have bolstered their programs. After complaints last year from Mayor Edward I. Koch that too few elementary school children were receiving drug instruction, Richard R. Green, then the New York City School Chancellor, mandated that every student receive at least eight hours. The city now spends $34.5 billion a year on drug education.
Increasingly, instruction is starting in kindergarten. Experts have persuaded many parents that because children begin using illegal drugs in elementary school, they need to be alerted early. The average user's initiation age, said Ginay Marks, is 12.6 years old.
Most school systems cannot afford the time to invent their own drug programs, so they have adopted programs tried other places. These programs, complete with tapes, models and manuals, bear catchy titles like ''Here's Looking at You, 2000,'' ''Growing Healthy'' and ''Project Star.'' Building self-worth and rehearsing strategies to resist pressure from others are part of all the programs, along with a focus on health habits and drug information. Reaching the Youngest Drugs' Effects As a Health Matter ''Growing Healthy,'' sponsored in part by the New York Academy of Medicine, has been adopted by schools in 41 states. It tries to subtly steer children in kindergarten through seventh grade away from drugs, alcohol and tobacco.
Children learn about nutritious foods, brushing their teeth and caring for their eyes. Only occasionally are drugs mentioned. In the fifth grade, students will dissect a calf's lung and inflate the air sacs with straws. This vivid illustration, teachers hope, will buttress lessons about the harms of smoking tobacco and marijuana.
Ms. Fleishman's kindergartners in Brooklyn get a ''Growing Healthy'' lesson three times a week. Showing cartoons from a book, Ms. Fleishman told them that only parents should be giving them drugs.
 
Walking a Fine Line
''If you see your brother and sister taking some medicine, what are you going to do?'' she asked. ''Call my mother,'' one boys shouted. ''Throw it in the toilet,'' another said.
''My cat was playing with it,'' said 6-year-old Jason Mungen, ''and I went to my mommy and she told my brother to put it back in the cabinet.''
Such lessons, teachers believe, are essential in a neighborhood like Bushwick where children with drug-addicted mothers are often being reared by grandmothers. Ms. Fleishman recalls that several years ago, when she first mentioned cocaine, a 5-year-old said: ''My mother takes that white stuff and puts it up her nose.''
''I have to walk a fine line between teaching children not to take drugs and not condemning their parents,'' said Ms. Fleishman. ''I try to explain that sometimes adults do things that aren't good for them.''
For Kansas City second graders, who receive 30 lessons a year from the ''Here's Looking at You'' program, the message is more overt. Seven children in Katie Mathews's class at the M. E. Pearson School arranged themselves like the organs of a human body by standing on chairs of varying heights.
 
In Exhaustion, a Lesson
Walter Dobbins played the brain, his fingers pecking away in the air like someone at a computer. Mark Reyes was the heart, pumping his arms like someone inflating a bicycle tire. Nicole Rodriguez and Camila Martinez played the lungs, taking deep breaths. Crystal Stafford and Linda Davis were the kidneys, making broomlike motions to sweep away poisons.
First, Mrs. Mathews had these organs go about their jobs at a easy rhythm, just as a healthy body would. Then she asked how they might respond if a drug were injected into this imaginary body. The actors speeded up and giggled. ''Don't stop, keep going,'' Mrs. Mathews urged. When they seemed really fatigued, she let them stop.
''Imagine what would happen to a human body if it never stopped and you just keep putting drugs in and the organs would keep going faster and faster and faster,'' she gently said. Middle School Approaches How 'Just Say No'
 
Can Be Practice
Children in more than 50 middle schools in Kansas City, Kan., and across the Missouri River in Kansas City, Mo., are learning from ''Project Star,'' a 15-lesson program that teaches ''resistance skills.'' It was begun by the local Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation after disclosures of cocaine use by four Kansas City Royals baseball players.
''A lot of kids want to say no, but they don't know how,'' said Glenn Schoenfish, principal of the Argentine Middle School, on the Kansas side.
In Sally Welter's physical education class, children talked about ways their friends might entice, threaten or tease them to use drugs. Then, with prodding from Ms. Welter, they figured out ploys to combat the pressure. They decided on these methods: the Cold Shoulder, the Broken Record (constantly repeating refusals), the Good Excuse and Strength in Numbers (allying with friends who will not try drugs).
 
'O.K. to Be One of a Kind'
At Public School 32 in the drug-ridden Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn, Anne Garfinkel, known to her students as ''the drug lady,'' commands the classroom like a conductor, squeezing just the right shadings of meaning from students.
''I'm going to give you a $25 word,'' she told a sixth-grade class and wrote ''unique'' on the blackboard. ''What does it mean?''
After students ventured some definitions, she had them compose a three-column chart of how the class members were like all other people, like some other people and like no other people.
All people are alike, the students agreed, in needing food, clothing and shelter. Some are alike in tastes, opinions and talents. Nobody is alike in the way they look, their voices, even their fingerprints.
''What have you learned?'' Ms. Garfinkel asked.
''It's O.K. to be one of a kind,'' a boy in the front volunteered. Ms. Garfinkel smiled. Outcome Can Be Deadly In older grades, the drug question is addressed more explicitly. But individuality and clear thinking are discussed as well.
Mark Sherman told his class of ninth graders in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, the news story of a 16-year-old Long Island girl whose boyfriend, after drinking several beers, was killed trying to beat a train across the tracks.
''Those people who ran across the railroad track - did they think they were going to die?'' the teacher asked.
He wrote the word ''omnipotent'' on the board and suggested that the boyfriend might have been thinking: 'I'm quick and strong and I've got good reflexes.''
Leaving the class, Israel Guzman, a student, said: ''It makes you think. If I do this, then this is going to happen. If I don't do this, then this is going to happen.'' High School Challenges An Emphasis On Social Skills By high school, students are given much more detailed information, but the emphasis remains on social skills.
Gregory Faulkner, an instructor at Phoenix House, a Manhattan drug treatment organization, visits a health class at Washington Irving High School in the Gramercy Park area for a series of three lessons and informs them that the euphoria of crack lasts 20 to 40 minutes and is followed by a long depression. But his main focus is on getting students to talk about what they most value and how drugs may affect those values.
''Can a drug user really say he's valuing his health?'' he asked a class.
In an exercise, Reheim Moye, 17, acted the part of a senior class president who is being urged by the vice president, played by Jacqueline Moran, 17, to allow a keg of beer and marijuana on the annual class trip. The class evaluated Reheim's predicament.
''People will lose respect for him if he turns around and does the same thing she wants him to do,'' said one girl in the front row. But another added: ''If you don't do it, you could lose friends.''
For the most part, the students gave answers that adults would hope for. Reheim said he found the class valuable. ''It puts you in a situation where you have to deal with your emotions.''

HEADLINE: Accuracy in Short Supply In Flood of U.S. Statistics

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Government's system of gathering economic statistics, much like the nation's highway network, is badly in disrepair.
Statisticians and economists, both in and out of government, say that a combination of budget cuts and deregulation - much of it a legacy of the Reagan era - is eroding important yardsticks and undermining policy makers striving to guide the economy.
 Furthermore, despite an effort by the Bush Administration to reverse the trend, statistical agencies face more spending restraint this year. This could compound the damage, hurting some well-known reports, including the index of leading economic indicators, and reducing the frequency of data collection or eliminating some data altogether. Efforts to improve other gauges that professionals consider imprecise -notably those for retail sales and foreign trade - will also have to be set aside, officials said.
 
Everyone Is Affected
And lest anyone think this is a dusty debate for economists and bureaucrats, the truth is that these numbers affect the lives of all Americans. Social Security payments and some wages are tied to the official inflation rate, and the Government uses statistics to help evaluate welfare and other social programs. On a broader scale, bad numbers can mean bad policy and a recession instead of a recovery.
What is more, the financial markets increasingly jump up or down, making or losing millions for investors, with each new economic report - and with the revisions that follow.
For example, measured growth for the second quarter went from 1.7 percent in July, to 2.7 percent a month later, to a second revision of 2.5 percent in September, undermining confidence in the numbers and leading to wide confusion about the economy's direction. The 2.5 percent growth, after adjustment for inflation, reported last week for the third quarter could be subject to the same kind of revisions.
No one doubts that data gatherers face a difficult task: tracking precisely the nation's growing, shifting economy. But critics say they could do better.
 
A Lag in Technique
Critics see two problems: Current statistics, they say, are deteriorating because staffs and data collection have been cut and sampling techniques have not kept up with the economy.
They also maintain that budget cuts have forced statistics agencies to skimp on research needed to make data reflect broader changes in the way the economy functions. Economists are debating whether important statistics like productivity, savings and the G.N.P. really measure what is going on in the economy.
It will not be long, some say, before the Government will be trying to set economic policy with a statistical compass so inaccurate that it cannot find north.
In a poll taken at a recent meeting of the National Association of Business Economists, Walter J. Williams, president of American Business Econometrics Inc., said he found that 72 percent of his colleagues were unhappy with data quality, up from 61 percent in 1988. A rising number, 38 percent, said data quality was deteriorating. The figures on merchandise trade, retail sales and G.N.P. were rated the worst.
Jerry L. Jordan, a member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, said he shrugs when he sees many of the closely watched statistics spewed out monthly.
''I take the numbers with a big grain of salt,'' he said. ''There are enormous problems.''
Lyle Gramley, a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board, withholds judgment on monthly numbers ''subtly and unconsciously'' because of his concern about their quality.
''The worry,'' he added, ''would be that at a critical juncture the statistics would suggest a course of policy that we would come later to regret.''
Much of the erosion is a result of Reagan-era policies, including deregulation and a general de-emphasis of the data's importance. Budgets have also been held constant, at best, after adjustment for inflation.
Staffs have been cut in the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Affairs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other agencies. At the Bureau of Economic Affairs, for example, the staff has been reduced from 453 in 1979 to 371 this year.
 
Key Revisions Delayed
The number of mathematicians at these agencies has been held constant, and there are fewer statisticians. The size of critical surveys, like the Current Population Survey, which is a base for employment reports, has been reduced. Key revisions in the calculation of other data, like the Consumer Price Index, have been delayed for several years.
In addition, research money needed to improve the data has been diverted just to insure adequate staffing and surveys for the core reports, like the G.N.P. and the Producer Price Index.
Changes begun before the Reagan era but continued under President Bush have also hurt. Deregulation of some industries, like airlines, and a cut in required paperwork for business reduced the amount and variety of data collected. Because of a changing attitude about government and the restraint on pay, there has also been a general decline in the quality of the people attracted to the statistical agencies.
In the budget process this year, the Bush Administration has lost its effort to make improvements. The $20 million extra the Administration asked for to increase quality has been rejected in Congress.
This loss will mean the setting aside of plans for the revision of the Current Population Survey used for employment data, and improvements in figures for manufacturers' orders, retail sales and trade.
''We're looking for core program cuts at the Bureau of Economic Affairs and for options for cutting the frequency with which we gather data or even eliminating some data,'' said Michael R. Darby, the Under Secretary of Commerce for economic affairs, who oversees two agencies.
 
Additional Budget Cuts
Paying for the $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime bill now in Congress will require an additional 0.43 percent cut in military and domestic programs, including statistics.
And the across-the-board cuts under the budget-balancing law will force even more damaging restraint if they are not revoked. This will depend on Congress and the White House agreeing on their own deficit reduction package.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, will release a review of the economic statistics system soon. He said improvements could be achieved without major new financing but acknowledged that the budget restraint hurts.
Mr. Boskin would not say directly that the quality of Government statistics had declined, but he agreed that ''improvements need to be made to give the same degree of accuracy in the more complex economy of today that we had in a much less complex economy years ago.''
The problem has been dramatized recently by sharp revisions in the reports for retail sales, non-farm employment and G.N.P.
Revisions, in themselves, are not bad; they are part of the system. Initial reports based on preliminary information are revised in later months as more data are gathered.
 
Dependability Questioned
Many professionals may well put too much weight on the monthly figures, although they are clearly warned that they will be revised. But recent wide swings call into question the dependability of the reports.
In retail sales, initial reports this summer gave some the picture of an economy slowing sharply, even heading for a recession. But later revisions showed a much stronger economy. The main reason for the G.N.P. change was the record revision in the retail figures for May, which went from an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent to a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent, and then to an increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Mr. Darby of the Commerce Department said retail sales figures were based on a sample that was steadily shrinking in comparison with the number of retail establishments, helping cause sharp revisions.
As the initial figures were released, the Federal Reserve began to ease interest rates. But after the revisions changed the view of the economy, the decline was halted. ''Would policy makers have decided policy differently?'' Mr. Darby asked. ''I don't know, but they could have.'' (The Fed has eased rates since the stock market drop of 190 points on Oct. 13.) Is Problem Worsening?
Beyond revisions, the deep-seated problem is that the quality of the data could well be getting worse. The G.N.P., for example, is slowly losing its relevance. It is better designed to measure the output of goods and services in the 1950's, when manufacturing was king. The service sector -areas like banking, retailing, insurance and legal services - now makes up 75 percent of output. But much of the service economy is small, and new businesses are often missed. And many businesses that used to provide data voluntarily have stopped as a way to reduce costs.
One problem with the G.N.P., as noted in a recent report by the Office of Technology Assessment, is in measuring price changes and quality improvements, especially of computers and other high-technology products. The measures affect the calculation of input and therefore change the total measured output.
Mr. Darby said that for the current G.N.P. report just using computer prices for 1988, instead of the 1982 prices now used, would lower this year's first-half growth by half a percentage point.
''It is easy to conclude that the quality has slipped as the service sector has grown,'' said Ben E. Laden, a Washington consultant who worked on a report on statistics by the National Association of Business Economists. ''But whether the G.N.P. growth is higher or lower one really doesn't know. But I would think that we underestimate the economic activity over time.''
 
Other Measures Criticized
Problems plague other data, too. Productivity, which is crucial to future standard of living, and savings, which is important for investment, are both poorly measured, economists say.
Despite the advent of computers, automatic teller machines and other changes in the last decade, there has been no measured increase in productivity in financial services. There are no measures for the value of a college education or the training paid for by an employer, both of which should affect productivity and, therefore, the measure of workers' output.
Data considered less troubled, like unemployment, could also be affected just by the change in living situations. The growth of two-income families and other extended unrelated groupings could make gathering accurate data more difficult.
Janet L. Norwood, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the Consumer Price Index needs, but does not have, an adequate measure of medical costs, which now make up 12 percent of the G.N.P.
''We have to have the resources to keep up with the changes,'' she said. ''Because these are tight times we don't. And that's what is scary.''

HEADLINE: Houston Candidates Court Business

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Although business leaders can no longer anoint mayors as they did decades ago, the campaign now under way shows that good business is still good politics in Houston.
Both major candidates entered politics as reformers, fighting the kingmakers with the help of minority voters. That was in the boom years of the 1970's. Now with the city painfully recovering from its bust, they eagerly portray themselves as champions of economic development and defenders of Houston's fabled ''good business climate.'' 
Mayor Kathryn J. Whitmire, who is seeking re-election to a fifth two-year term, speaks out in favor of contracting out city services, and she coolly dismisses opposition from organized labor. ''It is no secret that the unions are mad at me,'' she said proudly. ''They have reason to be mad at me.'' Fred Hofheinz, who is trying to regain the office he held from 1974 to 1977, accuses the incumbent of letting Dallas take the lead in luring corporations, the equivalent of a New York City mayor letting New Jersey take the Statue of Liberty.
 
Understanding How to Sell
Challenging Mrs. Whitmire in a recent debate, he said, ''I think Houston needs someone who really understands the importance of entrepreneurial activity, who really knows how to sell something.''
Just as heat and humidity mark the weather here, low taxes and minimal city planning are the traditional elements of Houston's business climate. Both candidates have vowed not to raise taxes or to disturb Houston's place as the largest American city with no zoning ordinances. Houston is the nation's fourth largest city, with about 1.7 million residents.
And the emphasis on business extends to other issues. Parks, education, transportation and even law enforcement are routinely discussed by the candidates as ''amenities'' necessary to attract new companies to the city.
Legend has it that the city's business elite used to meet in SSuite 8F of the Lamar Hotel to make major political decisions, including who should be mayor. The men who dominated the city from 1930's through the 1960's have left their names on monuments, but they have passed from the scene and their favorite hotel was torn down a few years ago.
But business has remained politically powerful because there is no limit on the size of personal campaign contributions to local campaigns and because municipal politics is nonpartisan.
''Houston remains the extreme case among Sun Belt cities where business elites hold sway,'' said Joe R. Feagin, a University of Texas sociologist. ''Politics is very different in older cities like Chicago or New York where political parties, organized labor, immigrant groups, and, more recently, minority groups make it more of a negotiation among equals.''
 
New Cry: Diversification
But now the city's business leadership is far too large and heterogeneous to fit in a single hotel suite, and diversification has replaced oil as the corporate byword. Instead of demanding that government leave them alone, proponents of economic development now speak of ''public-private partnership.''
After six years of traumatic recession, which began with the plunge of oil prices in 1982, Houston has begun a slow economic recovery that homeowners and workers as well as business leaders considere as fragile and sacrosanct as a newborn child. Under these circumstances, business interests are certain to get careful treatment even in a campaign between two people who were once proponents of change.
While both Mr. Hofheinz and Mrs. Whitmire have always been fiscal conservatives, they both once fought to reduce cronyism in City Hall and the influence of socially conservative business leaders. Each has also fought for homosexual and minority rights. Both remain in favor of abortion rights.
 
Liberal and Conservative
In the current campaign Mr. Hofheinz has occasionally articulated his liberal views on social issues, and he has accused Mrs. Whitmire of ''running the city like a corporation rather than a community.'' But he has emphasized a need for a police crackdown on drug pushers.
''Mayor Whitmire began as an outsider but she has become very much an insider over time,'' said Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston.
A conservative tilt may have been assured by the fact that this is a campaign between two candidates who have previously shown strength among black and moderate white voters. In an interview Mrs. Whitmire said she considered the city's West Side to be the crucial battleground in this election. In that area of affluent, overwhelmingly white subdivisions, deed restrictions, private police forces, privately contracted garbage pickup and private schools make up for weak public services.
When the campaign began in early summer, public opinion surveys showed Mrs. Whitmire in trouble. It was a remarkable show of vulnerability for an incumbent with a solid record of success at the polls.
Mr. Hofheinz then suffered the loss of a crucial supporter when Representative Mickey Leland, Democrat of Texas, died in an airplane crash in August. Mr. Leland, the city's most prominent black politician and one of many community leaders the Mayor has alienated during her tenure, had made the defeat of Mrs. Whitmire a personal crusade.
Mrs. Whitmire has since skillfully set the agenda for the campaign. She has portrayed herself as the leader who guided Houston through the dark days of the bust and on to recovery. The hard times serve her as ready explanations for tax increases, an understaffed police department and streets that flood in a modest rain.
In all her campaigns Mrs. Whitmire, an accountant, has insisted that choosing a mayor is a matter of picking the most competent manager, and recent polls indicate this approach seems to be working. While Mr. Hofheinz has been prone to vague pronouncements on ''the need for a change'' and ''leadership that unites,'' Mrs. Whitmire clearly relishes the details of governance.
When she was asked in a debate about solid-waste disposal and garbage collection fees, the Mayor responded happily, ''Thanks for raising two of my favorite subjects.''

HEADLINE: On Moscow: The President Is Missing

 BODY:
There is an iron law of bureaucratic politics in Washington: Until a President takes a firm public position on an issue, even his closest aides will push and pull in different directions. And there's an obvious corollary: Without a united administration, coherent action is impossible.
That's why it was comforting when Secretary of State James Baker seemed, in two important speeches, to put a stop to the Administration's extended hand-wringing over policy toward the Soviet Union. He declared unequivocally that the United States wants Mikhail Gorbachev's reform efforts to succeed. 
Now, distressingly, the Administration seems to have stumbled into disarray again. On Oct. 17, only a day after Mr. Baker pledged the Administration's help in changing the Soviet economy, Vice President Quayle had another idea. In a little-noticed speech, Mr. Quayle said, ''Let them reform themselves.''
Last week, an even more questionable challenge to policy unity was under way in the White House basement. Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser, drafted a speech saying Mr. Gorbachev's prospects for success are very slim indeed, and implying that Washington should invest little in the Soviet leader's future. Fortunately, Mr. Baker squelched the Gates speech, though not the story, which was uncovered by The Times's Thomas Friedman.
President Bush's role in all this is unclear, as it is in many other matters. Perhaps he savors the idea of placating contending constituencies with the Quayle and Gates speeches for the hard-liners and the Baker speeches for liberals and moderates. That might make everybody happy and leave the President riding 70 percent approval ratings.
But surely Mr. Bush must see the dangers in all this confusion. For starters, disarray feeds the growing impression that he has no convictions and that he's straddling most important issues. He might also reflect on the fact that his political support, while broad, isn't very deep. He'll need a record of accomplishment to consolidate his strength.
Soviet-American relations are the best place to make his mark. Americans want glasnost and perestroika to succeed because these policies are bringing the changes the U.S. has wanted for 40 years. Mr. Baker is as pessimistic as the next official about Mr. Gorbachev's prospects. But he understands that's all the more reason to lock in agreements now, like treaties to cut arms that Mr. Gorbachev's successors would find difficult to reverse.
Unless the President puts his public stamp on the Baker line and grasps the historic opportunities before him, he will pay dearly. His advisers will fight each other over every comma of an arms treaty and stymie any effort to give economic help to Moscow. The moment for accomplishment will pass and Americans will know whom to blame.

HEADLINE: James Florio for New Jersey

 BODY:
For the most part, Tom Kean's eight years as Governor have been good ones for New Jersey. The economy has been robust, job growth strong and the state has shucked its image as a backwater to New York City and Philadelphia.
The last few years, however, have been full of troubling portents. The economy has slowed, tax revenues have fallen short of expectations and the problem of high auto insurance rates has festered. 
When New Jersey voters pick Mr. Kean's successor on Nov. 7, they will choose between candidates of sharply different philosophies: Representative James Florio, a Democratic advocate of activist government, and Representative Jim Courter, a Republican who favors market solutions to most problems. Mr. Florio seems the better choice.
Mr. Florio lost by a hair in 1981 to the man he now hopes to succeed. He has represented the Camden area in Congress for 15 years. Among his most notable accomplishments have been the environmental Superfund and legislation to speed the removal of asbestos from schools. He calls for more sensible state regulation of the auto insurance business, a flat ban on sales of assault rifles and more drug treatment and education as a means of fighting the AIDS epidemic. He refuses to be specific about how he would cope with the next governor's biggest problem: a revenue shortfall that could reach $600 million next year. That's not a satisfying stance, but it's probably a shrewd one. He wants to do a complete audit of the $12 billion budget - the first in 20 years - to identify where cuts can be made. He cautiously says he foresees no need for new taxes, but avoids a no-tax pledge.
Mr. Courter pledges no new taxes for at least four years. That's unwise and unrealistic. Next year's budget gap is just the start. For example, the State Supreme Court may require the redress of funding inequities between rich and poor school districts and that would require more revenue.
More fundamentally, New Jersey's sacrosanct tradition of municipal home rule has become an obstacle to solving big problems like solid waste disposal and efficient transportation. And while Mr. Courter is gregarious, his minimalist approach would do little to remove that stumbling block.
Neither campaign has been distinguished. Like last year's New Jersey Senate race, this one has seen too much mudslinging. Nevertheless, both men have communicated their messages about how to govern - and Mr. Florio's sounds more sensible.

HEADLINE: Campaign Matters;
Trying to Fool All of the People All of the Time

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
''Candidates see success as the ability to be all things to all people,'' said Frank J. Macchiarola, who has the unusual perspective of an academic, a former New York City Schools Chancellor and a losing candidate for city comptroller. ''They promise $2 worth of services for the $1 we have.''
Lee Miringoff, the poll taker for the Marist Institute, said simplistic television commercials and candidates who tailor their views to polls also tend to ''trivialize'' campaigns to the point where debates, when there are any, are more concerned with the candidates' ties, makeup and one-liners than issues.
John H. Mollenkopf, a professor of political science at the Wagner Institute in the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, argued that ''ideologies and strong positions on issues make trouble in elections.'' 
Finally, there is the view that even a knee on the chest of a candidate is not likely to produce strong and realistic opinions on how to solve the crime, drug, education, housing and fiscal issues that cast a pall over New York City.
Maybe some problems are beyond anything but Band-Aid solutions. More likely, special interests may not like one solution or another.
That certainly was the case in a series of interviews with mayoral candidates at The New York Times in the primary and general election campaigns.
The idea was to give the candidates the opportunity to discuss their plans at length in the calm of a conference room and to allow follow-up questions. No audience, no cameras, hopefully no wind-bagging or posturing.
 
What did we get at
The Times? Pat speeches. Tap dancing. Pirouettes. Mush. So much so that it was hard to tell the difference between David N. Dinkins, the liberal Democrat, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the moderate Republican.
They didn't even have Mayor Edward I. Koch to kick around - as most candidates did in the primary - because Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani hope to inherit the substantial number of Koch primary supporters. At one point Mr. Giuliani even compared himself to the Mayor at the start of his first term, trying to rejuvenate a city coming out of a fiscal crisis.
Clearly Mr. Koch has contributed to this blandness by his cries of fiscal gloom and doom. No talk of major initiatives. Can't afford it. Somewhat like the last Presidential election.
So what's the difference which candidate gets elected?
Obviously there is a personnel difference. A Giuliani election would bring in a whole new cast of characters, including neophytes whose lack of political experience nearly sank the Giuliani campaign: lawyers, businessmen, yuppies, Republicans and maybe a few Liberals that are left.
Even a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat like Richard C. Wade, the urban historian, acknowledged that Mr. Giuliani ''would come into office with fewer obligations than any mayor for years.''
A Dinkins administration? There would be some old and new black officials. There would be liberal Democrats, organization Democrats, union officials, Koch administration holdovers and hangers-on. Some would bring governmental expertise, which is important. Others would bring less desirable baggage. There are already signs of lawyer-lobbyists who manage to change administrations like shirts. They like winners.
''Giuliani hasn't enough friends; Dinkins has too many friends,'' Mr. Macchiarola said.
There would also be a difference in priorities. Instinctively Mr. Dinkins would lean toward conciliation and social welfare issues, Mr. Giuliani toward crime issues and budget management. It could be a classic ideological confrontation, except that the candidates have blurred any distinction because they don't want to turn off any voters.
Mr. Giuliani, too, would have to reach out to a black community that has had its expectations of a black mayor raised more than ever before. Conversely, if Mr. Dinkins is elected, the race issue is likely to be muted in future elections, as it has in other cities like Chicago and Cleveland, which elected black mayors and followed them with white mayors. The point was made.
There would probably be fewer demands on Mr. Giuliani because his coalition is more diffuse and economically better off. Mr. Dinkins's initial base - minorities, the poor and municipal unions - would guarantee strong demands on him.
''High expectations, low cash,'' Mr. Mollenkopf said. He added that Mr. Giuliani would be ''not unlike Koch, emphasizing fiscal restraint.''
So, there are some differences. Even if the candidates try to hide them behind a lot of smoke and semantics.

HEADLINE: Would Unions' Backing Cost Dinkins as Mayor?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
If David N. Dinkins is elected mayor of New York City next week, his pledge to share the goals of the many municipal unions that were instrumental in his nomination and his longstanding commitment to help uplift the poor will be tested almost immediately.
Mr. Dinkins has won nearly unanimous support from leaders of organized labor, which contributed money and volunteers to his campaign and votes in the primary election.
Having raised expectations, what, his Republican opponent and other critics wonder, would a Mayor Dinkins deliver in return?
The financial community, comfortable with Mayor Edward I. Koch after almost 12 years, appears to be jittery about the prospect of any new mayor.
 
Panel of Economic Advisers
But with the city facing projected deficits and what analysts say is a cooling economy, some members of the business community have expressed concern that Mr. Dinkins, by temperament and ideology, may deviate from the fiscal conservatism that generally marked the Koch administration's successful efforts to restore the city's credit in the securities markets. 
That he briefly considered tinkering with the state law barring strikes by public employees and joined demonstrations by private hospital workers pressing their contract demands deepened those concerns.
Mr. Dinkins, the Democratic nominee, says the concerns are unjustified. To reassure skeptics, he has said he would ask the state Financial Control Board to estimate how much money is available in the city budget for collective bargaining.
He has already appointed a panel of eminent economic advisers. He has named a former Koch deputy as chairman of his transition team. And as an example of his independence, he cites his public support for proposed limits on tenure for principals at their schools, despite the proposal's initial lukewarm reception from the principals union, which has endorsed him.
 
Early Labor Friends
A number of state fiscal monitors say any concerns about Mr. Dinkins should be tempered by existing legal safeguards and by additional reviews under a proposed city charter. Some say that Mr. Dinkins, as an ally of labor, may be better able to gain its cooperation in negotiations next year - as another friend of labor, former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, did in the 1970's when the unions made concessions in the city's interest and their own.
Addressing potential Wall Street contributors last week, Mr. Dinkins said as much, noting that looming budget gaps make it unlikely the next mayor will have much to give away.
''So it may well be that I'll have to tell some of my friends they cannot have the things they want,'' he said. ''But they'll take it from me.'' Among those friends is Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the teamsters' union, whose early endorsement of Mr. Dinkins appeared to be pivotal at the time. All he wanted in return, Mr. Feinstein said, was access. Combative and vocal, Mr. Feinstein, who presides over a relatively small union, has filled a void among labor leaders since the retirement of Victor Gotbaum as head of the largest municipal employees union. Mr. Feinstein would be one of the first to confront Mr. Dinkins at the bargaining table.
 
Credit Rating Warning
''The reality is everything has to fit into a financial plan,'' Mr. Feinstein said. ''The next mayor, like the present one, will be much more conservative than we believe he ought to be. We did better with Koch than we can hope to do with Dinkins. We took every nickel there was to take. With Dinkins, you don't have the same adversarial relationship. You're not going to have someone on the bridge yelling, 'Break the strike.'
''That doesn't mean,'' Mr. Feinstein added, ''that the unions are going to say, 'Whatever you want, David, we'll do for you.' ''
Last week, Moody's Investors Service delivered a warning that the city's credit rating would be a function of ''the new administration's ability to maintain fiscal responsibility and realistically balanced budgets, without sacrificing its infrastructure-rebuilding program.''
The warning was not aimed solely at Mr. Dinkins. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate and a former Federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is also viewed warily by some members of the financial community because of his inexperience in municipal government and his refusal, like Mr. Dinkins's, to rule out a tax increase. Both describe it as a last resort.
A decline in city bond prices this month was blamed by Mr. Giuliani on concerns raised in an article in Dow Jones Capital Markets Report that Mr. Dinkins ''would spend too freely.'' In endorsing Mr. Giuliani last week, Crain's New York Business cited its ''deep philosophical differences'' with Mr. Dinkins.
 
It's Not Just 'Trust Me'
Any new mayor would be constrained by a budget gap estimated at more than $1 billion during the rest of this fiscal year and next, and by outside overseers, like the Financial Control Board and the Municipal Assistance Corporation - vestiges of the city's brush with insolvency in the 1970's.
As the fiscal crisis receded, some contraints were loosened. The State Legislature deleted the city's ability to pay for labor settlements as a criterion in arbitration. The state monitors' influence is now largely limited to moral suasion, though the Financial Control Board can reclaim its veto power if the budget appears to be severely unbalanced.
''You just can't say 'trust me,' '' the board's executive director, Philip R. Michael, said. ''Compared to 15 years ago, it's night and day.''
Alair A. Townsend, the publisher of Crain's and Mayor Edward I. Koch's former deputy mayor for economic development, asked rhetorically, ''Can any mayor be free-spending, full-stop?
''No, because the F.C.B. and state law say the budget has to be balanced, whatever it takes,'' she said. ''Can any mayor be a relatively 'free-spending friend of labor?' That's a different question. The institutional forces don't constrain labor choices. They just say you have to pay for whatever you give.''
 
Delivering City Services
The city's financial plan assumes only a 1.5 percent wage increase. Since Mr. Koch took office in 1978, wages have risen slightly more than the inflation rate for uniformed city workers and slightly less for civilian employees, said Robert W. Linn, Mr. Koch's director of labor relations. The projected inflation rate for the coming year is about 5 percent.
''It's hard to give less than the Consumer Price Index,'' Stanley Brezenoff, the First Deputy Mayor, said.
Just keeping pace with inflation would cost $385 million, including pension contributions, beyond what the city has budgeted for wage increases next year.
''It's fair to say that rather minor swings in percentage have a major impact on your ability to deliver city services at the margins,'' Mr. Linn said.
Mr. Dinkins's repeated calls for a ''fair'' settlement for workers in private hospitals, who won wage increases of 7 1/2, 7 1/2 and 5 percent over three years, could haunt him.
''The teachers were quoted as saying this is the time for them to get more,'' Mr. Linn said. ''It will be hard for city hospital workers to get less than 7 1/2 percent. If the teachers prevail, if the hospital workers prevail, who's going to say to the cops or the teamsters, 'you should have a lower standard.' ''
 
Fiscally Moderate Advisers
Willingness to come to grips with looming deficits early, as Mr. Koch has, can avert a crisis later. When Mr. Koch unveiled his austerity plan last week, Mr. Giuliani embraced it and chided Mr. Dinkins for being noncommittal.
Mr. Dinkins's defenders recall, though, that, as a Congressman, Mr. Koch, too, was regarded as profligate, but was transformed by the epiphany of fiscal reality early in his first term. Moreover, while Mr. Dinkins, as Manhattan Borough President, often lobbied successfully for social welfare programs in budget negotiations, his additions did not represent ''astronomical sums,'' Mr. Brezenoff said.
Besides naming Nathan Leventhal, a former deputy mayor in the Koch administration, to smooth the transition between administrations, Mr. Dinkins has sought to wrap himself in the protective garb of fiscally moderate economic advisers, like Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, to help him get elected and then to govern.
''The key to the acceptability of the labor settlement for the city economy and the credit markets,'' Mr. Rohatyn said, ''is that the amount of the increase be austere, that it be arrived at without confrontation, and that it be financed by real productivity, which means, in many cases, personnel reductions, and not by taxes.''
Yet, Mr. Rohatyn, a Dinkins supporter, said, ''I would argue the city's labor leaders are more likely to accommodate David Dinkins in trying to make him a success.''
Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, agreed. ''If teachers felt they were more valued,'' she said, ''you'd get a lot more - you should pardon the expression -productivity.''
Mr. Gotbaum, former head of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, recalled that former Mayor Beame ''supposedly was a captive of the unions and we gave him givebacks.'' With Mr. Koch, ''who was supposed to be tough on the unions,'' he said, ''I got my contracts ratified by 85 to 90 percent.''
Earlier this month, Mr. Dinkins told Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, ''Quite simply, you can't bargain away what you don't have.'' Describing himself as ''a firm and fair negotiator,'' he said that he would press for productivity and that he would ''strike a reasonable, fair, prudent agreement'' with municipal unions.
Jack Bigel, a municipal union consultant, said, ''I don't believe labor supported Dinkins because he's an easy mark.''
And Mr. Gotbaum said, ''They're not going to make David look bad.''

HEADLINE: Robert Van Fossan, 63, Chairman Of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
Robert V. Van Fossan, board chairman and chief executive officer of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company and a longtime New Jersey civic leader, died of cancer yesterday at Morristown (N.J.) Memorial Hospital. He was 63 years old and lived in Mendham, N.J.
Mr. Van Fossan had been chief executive officer of Mutual Benefit, of Newark, since 1972. He was president of the company from 1972 until 1978, when he became chairman. 
He was or had been an officer of more than a dozen civic organizations. He was a spokesman for New Jersey businesses and a strong advocate of cooperation for social progress and reforms among business, government and volunteer groups.
Mr. Van Fossan was the chairman of Renaissance Newark Inc., a public-private group; the chairman of the Newark Performing Arts Corporation, and a trustee of the Newark Museum and of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, which aids nonprofit groups. He was the primary founder and former chairman of the Partnership for New Jersey, a group of business and community leaders that works to solve social and economic problems.
He was a former chairman of the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on efficiency in the courts, of the executive committee of northeastern governors, of the state's panel of the Regional Plan Association and a member of the executive committee of the state's National Conference of Christians and Jews.
Mr. Van Fossan was born in Breckenridge, Minn., raised in Devils Lake, N.D., and served as a corporal in the Marines in the South Pacific in World War II. After earning a high school diploma, he won successively higher posts in the Northwestern National Life Insurance Company over 24 years.
Surviving are his wife, Mary Jane; a daughter, Deborah Greer of Eagan, Minn.; two sons, Robert, of Wayzata, Minn., and Steven, of Chatham, N.J.; his mother, Marie, of Missoula, Mont., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Government Spreading Net To Break Market Free Falls

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Prodded by the likelihood of periodic plunges in stock market prices, the Federal Government, like it or not, is becoming committed to emergency measures to limit the damage from these frightening episodes.
That emerging safety net for the market showed itself in the Government's actions immediately after the 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday, Oct. 13. In the two weeks since then, various new damage-control measures have been proposed and debated.
But a containment procedure patched together by the Government could encourage speculation by creating ''the false sense that there isn't going to be too much downside risk in stock prices without the Government stepping in,'' said David R. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street firm.
 
Commitment From Fed
The Federal Reserve Board has made the most obvious bailout commitment, hurrying the word out after the Oct. 13 plunge that it would provide adequate credit to buy stocks when the market reopened on Oct. 16. Such offers of easy credit, however, can sometimes bring down intesest rates and be inflationary. 
Less publicly, the Securities and Exchange Commission also stepped in that weekend, with staff members making dozens of telephone calls to major traders. The calls tended to discourage further selling, the traders said.
''The simple fact is that the Government held the market's hand and the investor's hand in a way that we have never seen before,'' Mr. Jones said.
Since then new proposals have surfaced, all reflecting the gowing concern over the prospect of repeated stock market plunges. None of them have been accepted or rejected, but all of them represent a growing discussion of ways to prevent future crashes or limit their damage.
H. Robert Heller, who resigned recently as a Federal Reserve Board governor, proposed in a speech that the Fed intervene during stock market sell-offs and buy stocks in quantity to halt slides - just as the Fed now buys and sells dollars to control the dollar's value.
And Richard C. Breeden, the S.E.C.'s new chairman, asked Congress to give his agency more power to monitor stock trading, particularly big trades that often cause stock market volatility. In addition, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the Bush Administration was studying ways to time the releases of economic statistics so that they do not roil stock prices.
Even without such new measures, the actions of the S.E.C. and the Federal Reserve over the Oct. 14-15 weekend undoubtedly helped stocks rebound the following Monday. That day, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.12 points. To some analysts, the Government's developing role in limiting stock market plunges invites comparisons to its commitment to maintain a smoothly functioning banking system.
 
Continental Bank Bailout
Over the last 15 years - to avert collapse of major institutions and the disruption of the nation's financial system - the Government has responded to bank crises by guaranteeing deposits even beyond the requirements of Federal deposit insurance. The Government's de facto commitment to banking was clearly established with the 1984 bailout of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago.
''The Government moved in to prevent banks from collapsing, and in doing so acknowledged a powerful and longstanding responsibility for the well-being of the economy,'' said Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a business organization. ''Now they are eager to be supportive of the stock market because the shock waves from a crash can be damaging later on.''
But so far the Government's relationship with the stock market is in an early, evolutionary stage. The Federal Reserve's reassurances, for example, amounted to offering credit without the requirement of putting up stocks as collateral. The Fed did this by indicating that banks would be able to draw enough reserves from it to lend to brokerage houses and other big investors on easy terms.
A similar move was made two years ago, but not until the morning after the crash of Oct. 19, 1987 - and then only after banks had pulled back on loans to brokerage houses and other traders, aggravating the situation.
''The Fed's anticipatory action this time was a very positive signal and one that was sensitive to our concerns; it encouraged people not to panic sell on Monday,'' said Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive of the PaineWebber Group Inc.
 
Raising Expectations
But the Fed's readiness to help the markets with loans also raised expectations. Albert Wojnilower, senior economist at the First Boston Corporation, said, ''Once the Fed has come forward, it is really committed to keep on doing so.''
Similarly, the S.E.C. in its weekend telephone calls asked many of the nation's biggest traders what they thought would happen after the stock markets opened on Monday, Oct. 16 -the sort of question that has gone out in previous periods of unusual trading, but not on so wide a scale or with such energy. ''They stayed in touch with the system better than they ever had before,'' said Stanley Shopkorn, vice chairman of Salomon Brothers, in charge of trading operations.
What is more, the discussions carried the S.E.C. onto ground it does not usually tread. In discussing the market's prospects, the S.E.C. learned of trading plans. Some Wall Street executives said the discussion itself was quiet pressure to buy on Oct. 16, not sell.
The S.E.C. also called the big mutual funds, like Fidelity Investment Inc., which was asked to report on Saturday, Oct. 14, and again on Sunday, how many customers had placed weekend orders to sell their shares in stock funds.
 
Fueling the 1987 Crash
Relatively few had, in sharp contrast to October 1987, when a flood of redemptions forced Fidelity to sell huge quantities of stock to raise cash to pay the customers. Those sales helped fuel the crash of Oct. 19, when the Dow Jones average fell 508 points, or 22.6 percent.
''We get requests about redemptions and our cash positions whenever the market is volatile,'' said Robert Pozen, Fidelity's general counsel and a managing director. ''This time the requests came much quicker and they wanted immediate responses, not two weeks later.''
The Federal Reserve's open lending policy meant that brokerage firms would have funds to lend to clients for stock purchases on Monday. In addition, the firms would not be under pressure to sell off stock purchased on margin or credit, with the stock itself as collateral.
The Dow Jones average did rebound, so the Fed in the end did not have to follow through on its promise. And the S.E.C.'s calls, intended to restrain selling, were not put to the test, this time.
 
Two Unsettling Messages
The Government's emerging routine for market bailouts - one that Government officials speak of only off the record - carries with it two unsettling messages, economists and Wall Street executives say.
One is that the Government is being forced to get more deeply involved because big plunges in stock prices are no longer once-in-a-generation events. The Dow has dropped by more than 3.5 percent in a single day only three times since World War II, but all three of those days have occurred in the last two years. The first two came in October 1987, and the third was 18 days ago, when the 190-point plunge, in just 90 minutes, erased 6.9 percent of the Dow's value.
''This sort of volatility will continue to be a hallmark of the American financial markets,'' said Henry Kaufman, an economist and consultant. ''There will be other Oct. 13's and there will sometimes be other Oct. 19's.''
Some market experts contend that volatile price swings result inevitably from such developments of the 1980's as computer-aided trading; the rising influence of foreign financial markets, particularly Japan's, and the power of portfolio managers.
The other message concerns the economy. While the Government, true to its free market principles, is not concerning itself with whether the Dow is at 2,700 or, say, 2,500, it is serving notice that it will take steps to limit a one-day plunge that threatens economic stability.
 
Handful of Safety Measures
In addition to this month's actions of the Fed and the S.E.C., the emerging intervention process includes a handful of safety measures adopted since the 1987 crash. Among them are ''circuit breakers,'' which halt trading temporarily, and restrictions on the various computer-aided trading procedures that can feed a selling panic.
But the growing commitment to stock market containment could perhaps be inflationary. The Fed's easy credit commitment might put downward pressure on interest rates. That was not an issue this month, when the economy was weakening and interest rates were declining anyway.
But Mr. Kaufman said that if stock prices plunged during a period of economic strength, the Fed might have to offer easy credit just when monetary policy was on an opposite tack -one of holding back on loan money and pushing up interest rates to fight inflation.
''If the Fed tries in these circumstances to bail out the market,'' he said, ''that could destabilize prices.''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Thatcher Skeptical on Europe Money Ties

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed skepticism today about whether other European Community countries would fulfill Britain's conditions for tying the pound more closely to their currencies, an essential prerequisite for full European economic union.
France and Italy would have to get rid of foreign exchange controls and permit free movement of capital, as Britain had done, she insisted in a television interview. ''Then we'll see whether the exchange rate can hold under those circumstances; I hope it does,'' she said in a tone that implied that it might not.
With her remarks, Mrs. Thatcher thus rebuffed calls from several leading members of her own Conservative Party for a clear British commitment to the European Community's seven-currency exchange rate mechanism. Her former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned from the Cabinet on Thursday after months of friction between him and Mrs. Thatcher over the issue. 
 
Direct Answers Avoided
Mrs. Thatcher avoided direct answers to questions by Brian Walden of London Weekend Television about what led Mr. Lawson to leave. He said in his resignation letter that he could not continue as long as Sir Alan Walters, who has described the exchange rate system as half-baked, served as Mrs. Thatcher's economic adviser.
New reports of the growing friction weakened the pound on the international exchange markets in recent weeks, and Mr. Lawson raised basic lending rates in Britain to 15 percent earlier this month to prop it up. Sir Alan also resigned on Thursday, after Mr. Lawson's departure.
''Strong leadership will continue,'' the Prime Minister said today, giving little evidence of contrition and dismissing talk about disagreement within the Government as ''tittle-tattle.''
 
'Reason and Emotion'
''I'm staying my own sweet, reasonable self, founded on very strong convictions which were a combination of reason and emotion,'' she said.
The European exchange rate mechanism, the first step of a process that many European leaders say they want to lead to a common currency, sets limits within which seven currencies, including the West German mark and the French franc but not the pound, may fluctuate against one another. It does not tie their value either to the United States dollar or the Japanese yen.
Mrs. Thatcher, at the last European summit meeting in Madrid at the end of June, went along with the other leaders on letting preparations proceed for an intergovernmental conference next year to prepare the way for a common currency and full economic union of the 12 member countries. But she also made clear she disapproved of the idea.
 
Parliament Reaction Cited
''I think there's no need for a single currency in Europe,'' she said then. ''It'll be the biggest transfer of national sovereignty we've ever had, and I don't think it will be at all acceptable to the British Parliament.'' She was reportedly angry with Mr. Lawson and her Foreign Secretary at the time, Sir Geoffrey Howe, for urging her to compromise, and eased Sir Geoffrey out of the Cabinet in July.
Today, she said the pound would not join the exchange rate mechanism unless all the other leading European economies played by the same rules as did Britain's.
''We shall join the exchange rate system when there are no foreign exchange controls, when there's freedom of movement of capital, when their insurance and pension funds are run as openly and freely as ours are and when the subsidies are gone,'' she added. ''You can't have a currency like sterling playing under that higgledy-piggledy set of rules.''
 
Differences Emphasized
Mrs. Thatcher said that France planned to eliminate foreign exchange controls by July, but that Italy might require longer, and that some countries barred their government pension funds from investing funds in other countries and some subsidized state-run industries.
''We believe in an open economy, but they have artificial and cultural barriers which are going to be very difficult to get down,'' she said. ''I really can't have Britain worsted by other people having a different set of rules from us. Of course I fight for Britain and of course I'm combative; I shall go on doing it. But they simply must be fair.''
''I like a strong pound,'' she said, but she would not say whether her new Chancellor, John Major, would raise British interest rates further if the pound fell again next week. It declined to 2.885 German marks on Friday, after Mr. Lawson's resignation, and at one point dipped below Thursday's close in New York of $1.575 before stabilizing after support by the Bank of England.
 
Continuance of Policies Seen
''I'm very sad that he's gone,'' she said. ''The same policies will continue. It was quite clear that he had made up his mind and that there was nothing I could do to dissuade him.'' She repeatedly described Mr. Lawson's standing within her Cabinet as ''unassailable.'' When Mr. Walden asked if Mr. Lawson would have stayed in the Cabinet if she had dismissed Sir Alan, she answered: ''I don't know. I don't know.''
Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, accused Mrs. Thatcher of ''confusion, division and malice'' today. Labor ran an unchanged 10 percentage points ahead of Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives in a Sunday Times telephone poll of 711 people taken after Mr. Lawson's resignation.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Rise To '89 High

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Bolstered by higher capital spending in a number of industries, machine tool orders climbed 33.4 percent in September from the previous month, reaching the highest monthly total this year.
According to a report to be released today by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, machine tool orders rose to $302.9 million, from $227.1 million in August. Analysts said the rise was a reflection of plant modernization in a variety of areas. 
''Orders in September came from general machinery companies,'' said James J. Paper, an analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian Inc. in Omaha. ''It's not coming from any one particular area. It's coming from a wide range of industries, with a number of different companies increasing their capital spending.''
 
Orders for This Year Down 19%
Machine tools, which are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts, are used in the manufacture of everything from appliances to vehicles. Economists consider their sales and orders important indicators of capital spending patterns by makers of large products like automobiles and aircraft.
Although the level of orders was significantly higher in September than in August, orders for the first nine months of the year were down 19 percent from the comparable period of 1988. The level of new orders was also down 7.7 percent from September of last year.
Shipments of machine tools were up 24.5 percent from August, to $281.2 million. And shipments for the first nine months were 37.5 percent higher, at $2.25 billion. Shipments last month were 23.6 percent higher than in September of last year.
 
'Optimism and Caution'
Albert W. Moore, president of the association, based in McLean, Va., said the level of new orders for the year has been consistent with the 20 percent decline for 1989 that had been widely predicted by industry analysts. He added that 1988 had been a particularly strong year.
''The 1980's have been a period of transition for the United States machine tool industry,'' Mr. Moore said. ''As the decade draws to a close we look to the 1990's with both optimism and caution. Optimism, because we know that the United States machine tool industry can regain lost ground and grow. Caution, because we know there is much to be done to spur that growth.''
 
Foreign Orders Off 26.8%
The level of foreign orders for American-made machine tools dropped 26.8 percent in September from August, largely because the dollar had strengthened, analysts said. In the first nine months of the year, foreign orders were down 27.7 percent. Meanwhile, domestic orders for makers of machine tools were up 44.7 percent in September from August, but were 17.6 percent lower for the first nine months of the year.
Orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, were up 23.4 percent, to $192.8 million, from the August level. That category typically accounts for three-fourths of the industry. Orders for metal-forming tools were up 55.4 percent in September, the association said.
The backlog of machine tool orders stood at $2.15 billion in September, up from $2.13 billion in August.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid Sought for Electronics

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 29

 BODY:
In a report that will be delivered to the President this week, a national advisory committee on semiconductors will recommend that the Government establish a multibillion-dollar venture capital operation intended to resurrect the American consumer electronics industry.
The report could give new impetus to flagging efforts aimed at forming a Government-industry initiative in high-definition television. The advanced video product has become the focus of efforts to bring American companies back into the consumer electronics business, which they have all but abandoned to Japanese and European companies.
The Bush Administration is divided on that issue, and it has recently backed away from the idea of offering support for any particular industry. But members of Congress and electronics industry representatives say the new report could help swing momentum their way. 
 
'Serious Consideration'
''I think it's a report that will get serious consideration,'' said Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California and a leading proponent of a national policy on high-definition television. ''Hopefully, something like this will move the debate, both within the Administration and beyond it.''
Mr. Levine said he expected to introduce a bill soon that would create a Technology Corporation of America, which would be similar to the semiconductor committee's proposed investment company. The major difference, he said, is that his proposed corporation would get direct Federal financing while the semiconductor committee's proposed company apparently would not.
The semiconductor committee consists of semiconductor and computer industry leaders and high-level Government officials. Its proposal calls for an investment company that would be known as the Consumer Electronics Capital Corporation, which would be privately managed and run for a profit and would serve as a source of ''low-cost, very patient capital'' for companies wishing to enter the consumer electronics business.
The Government would provide loan guarantees that would enable the corporation to borrow money at low interest rates and invest in new consumer electronics technologies and companies.
The group issuing the report, known as the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors, was created by last year's trade act to come up with policies to maintain a competitive American computer chip industry.
The panel recommends that the investment company would get initial equity funding from industry sources, private and institutional investors, and state and local governments. The corporation would raise billions of dollars in commercial debt, using Federal, state and local government loan guarantees to insure a low interest rate.
Such an investment corporation would counteract a key advantage the Japanese have in their access to low-cost capital. Many American companies have said they cannot afford the heavy long-term investments needed to get into the manufacture of televisions, videocassette recorders and other consumer products while still showing a profit for their shareholders.
 
Financing for Sematech
The report, which has not yet been released, also recommends that financing for Sematech, the Government-backed semiconductor research consortium, be immediately increased to $300 million a year from its current level of $200 million, and by $800 million over the next three years.
In his cover letter to the President, the committee's chairman, Ian M. Ross, the president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Bell Laboratories, acknowledges that the recommendations may be controversial.
''We have not shied away from controversy,'' Dr. Ross says. ''In this report we present necessary first steps toward a national semiconductor strategy. We believe that the country needs bold and innovative action.''
The report never mentions high-definition television, preferring to focus on all of consumer electronics and avoid the criticisms from those who say the importance of high-definition television has been overblown.
The report documents a decline in the competitiveness of the American semiconductor industry, which makes the silicon chips that are the heart of everything from computers and telephones to robots and weapons. The report finds an equally serious decline in the American industry that produces the sophisticated machinery and raw materials used to make chips.
The 29-page report also calls for the Government to play a stronger role in insuring that American companies can participate in consumer electronics. For instance, it asks the Government to consider requiring products sold in the United States to use a certain number of United States components. It also calls for the Government to help American companies license the technology they need from foreign companies that now control many of the key patents in consumer electronics.
 
Tax Breaks
The report also recommends numerous steps to lower capital costs by making the research and development tax credit permanent, reinstating the investment tax credit, reducing taxes on capital gains and facilitating the formation of industry consortiums. It also recommends steps to improve education, protect American patents and copyrights, and promote access to foreign markets.
Members of the advisory committee from industry were John A. Armstrong, vice president for science and technology at I.B.M.; Norman Augustine, chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta; Robert W. Galvin, chairman of Motorola; Jerry R. Junkins, chairman, president and chief executive of Texas Instruments; James C. Morgan, chairman and chief executive of Applied Materials; Charles E. Sporck, president and chief executive of National Semiconductor, and James G. Treybig, president and chief executive of Tandem Computers.
Government members were: John A. Betti, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition; Erich Bloch, director of the National Science Foundation; D. Allan Bromley, the President's science adviser; Robert O. Hunter Jr., director of the Office of Energy Research at the Department of Energy; and Thomas J. Murrin, Deputy Secretary of Commerce. Executive director of the committee was William R. Bandy, a program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Four New Trophies For a Top Headhunter

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Gerard R. Roche, who is regarded as a top executive headhunter, has four new trophies to display.
Mr. Roche, who is in the business of snaring top executives for big corporations, has within the last month been involved in the placement of four visible leaders in disparate fields: Paul J. Tagliabue as the new commissioner of the National Football League, James R. Jones as chairman of the American Stock Exchange, Hugh Southern as general manager of the Metropolitan Opera and Jerry J. Jasinowski as president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
''The common denominator here,'' Mr. Roche said last week, ''is that for a guy who has spent most of his time working for the Bill Paleys of the world, in all these cases we were working for committees.'' 
Mr. Roche is chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, an old-line executive search firm in New York.
Finding the candidates, or the ''tall timber,'' as Mr. Roche calls them, is not the hardest part. Mr. Tagliabue, as legal counsel to the N.F.L. for 20 years, was in a strong position to move up, as was Mr. Jasinowski, who was the chief economist of the manufacturers association.
Executive searchers are hired, Mr. Roche said, not only to produce candidates but to ''manage the process, conduct the meetings, do the reference checking and coordinate the various constituencies, and finally, to get the tall timber to accept the position.'' He is quick to point out that he did not do all four assignments alone, but had help from his partners at Heidrick & Struggles.
Mr. Roche, who is 58 years old, grew up in Scranton, Pa., working in his father's grocery store. He is a graduate of the University of Scranton and received an M.B.A. degree from New York University.
He was working as marketing vice president for the Cordite Company when he was recruited for a post at Philip Morris. He did not take the job, but the encounter piqued his interest in the recruiting business and he went to work for Heidrick & Struggles. That was 26 years ago. Some of the executive placements he is most proud of are John Sculley at Apple Computer, Richard Voell at the Rockefeller Group and Stephen M. Wolf at UAL.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Focus Is on Raising the Debt Limit

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
For much of the 1980's, official Washington has chosen a dubious milestone - a necessary increase in the nation's debt ceiling - as the appropriate moment to call a political scrimmage.
The tactic has grown tiresome to credit market participants, who warn that the latest upshot could be disarray, and possibly higher interest rates, over the next few weeks.
As a way of trying to make political points, Democrats in Congress have in the past delayed passage of a rise in the debt ceiling as a way of reminding voters that the huge increase in the national debt this decade has taken place with Republicans in the White House.
 
New Twist in Battle
The partisan battle took on a new twist last week, when Republicans made it plain that they intend to attach a rider to cut the capital-gains tax to legislation that raises the debt ceiling, now at $2.87 trillion. 
The gambit has been abetted by the Treasury Department, which on Friday said it would increase the size of its weekly bill auctions and supplement them with a $2 billion cash management bill sale so it can pay Social Security benefits after midnight tomorrow, when the current debt ceiling is scheduled to drop to $2.8 trillion. The additional cash will give the Government enough money to operate until Nov. 9, market participants said.
But continued gamesmanship over the debt-ceiling increase is almost certain to delay the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions, which had been expected to take place in the first full week of November.
''The debt limit process has often been politicized by Congress, but never by the Treasury,'' said Richard M. Kelly, president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, primary dealers in Government securities.
Mr. Kelly, who was a Treasury official during the Carter Administration, added: ''This is a sad, unprecedented development, one that in my judgment has hurt Treasury's credibility. And in the end, the financial markets will quite likely suffer as a result.''
One bond trader, who asked not to be identified, said: ''The market is really getting sick of all this political posturing. It makes a mockery of the whole system.''
The Treasury's decision was not greeted with universal derision, however.
''I am not sure there would have been a timely vote on the debt ceiling even without the capital gains provision,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, who was chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget during the first Reagan Administration.
''Treasury's step was somewhat unusual, but it seems prudent,'' Mr. Kudlow said.
 
Short-Term Rates Up
Short-term interest rates rose sharply on Friday once details of the Treasury's plan were fully disseminated in the market.
The increase in short-term financings poses no problem, but market participants fear that a further delay by Congress in raising the debt ceiling will jeopardize the efficient sale of $30 billion or more of securities at the coming refunding auctions.
''If the debt ceiling is not raised until Nov. 8, for example, there will be quite limited when-issued trading in these issues,'' Mr. Kelly said. A delay of that nature ''will compact the sale of an awful lot of debt into a very short period of time.''
Aside from watching Congress wrangle over the debt ceiling, this week market participants will receive important data on how the economy performed in October.
The reports include the monthly survey from the nation's purchasing managers, due Wednesday. More important, though, are the employment data due from the Labor Department on Friday.
Analysts are not expecting the October figures to be as weak as September's, but most anticipate that the numbers will provide further evidence of a slowdown in the economy.
Alan Levenson and Richard Berner, economists at Salomon Brothers, are forecasting that non-farm payroll employment rose by 180,000 in October, up from a strike-adjusted increase of 133,000 in September.
While the overall number is important, economists and Federal Reserve Board governors are likely to focus intently on how employment conditions in the manufacturing sector fared last month. In September, manufacturing employment fell by a surprisingly large 103,000 jobs.
An indication of investor sentiment about New York City, which faces a cloudy economic future, could come today in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
As part of a plan to refinance part of its roughly $13 billion in outstanding debt, the city is expected to offer to investors more than $786 million worth of general obligation bonds. The refinancing will save New York $162 million in interest payments in the current fiscal year, and an additional $100 million in 1991.
After reviewing modifications to the city's financial plan, Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the two top rating agencies, reaffirmed their A ratings on the city's bonds. But questions remain.
 
'It Is Very Hard to Predict'
''We are really looking to see what the next mayor does,'' said Colleen Woodell, a vice president at Moody's. ''He somehow has to maintain a balanced budget, and unless he comes up with additional cuts, he has to do something to enhance revenues. It is very hard to predict how that will be accomplished without some increase in taxes.''
The refinancing package is part of a series of steps the outgoing Koch Administration is taking to help close a projected $528 million budget gap for fiscal 1990.
Late last week participants in the municipal bond market said that preliminary price talk about the New York City issue put coupons as high as 7.85 percent on long-term bonds.

HEADLINE: Trade View Of U.S. Dim

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
In a pessimistic assessment of trade prospects, the Bush Administration said Friday that it was unclear that the trade deficit could be shrunk further and warned that it might grow next year.
The current-account deficit, the broadest gauge of American trade, which measures investment flows as well as payments for goods and services, narrowed sharply in 1988, to $126.6 billion, down from a record $143.7 billion in 1987. But progress has stalled this year, with the gap running at only a slightly better $122.8 billion annual rate from January through June.
The Administration, in a report prepared by the Treasury Department, warned that the current-account deficit might start widening again unless the United States and its economic allies do a better job of coordinating economic policies, including currency exchange rates.
The report, the Treasury's semiannual report to Congress, was prepared under a provision of the Trade Act of 1988 that requires the Administration to look for cases of currency manipulation by American competitors in world trade and to negotiate to halt such practices.
Under the law, the Administration has singled out South Korea and Taiwan. The report expressed approval of the effort by Taiwan to raise the value of its currency and lower its trade surplus, but it sharply criticized South Korea.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Air India Tries a New Look For International Travelers

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Falling behind its regional competitors in Asia's burgeoning air travel market, Air India is shedding its ethnic image for a sleeker, made-in-America look.
When the airline, India's international flag carrier, introduced its first redecorated Boeing 747 in Bombay earlier this month, gone were the red Rajasthani arches that once framed the windows. The plane had also lost its fussy red stripes. 
The new look, an all-white plane with a single red band and gold sun painted on its tail, was designed by Landor Associates of San Francisco, which also remodeled the images of Singapore Airlines and the Indonesian flag carrier, Garuda.
Interior changes are also being made by Air India, which wants to make its first- and business-class sections more attractive to international travelers.
 
Relying on the Ethnic Market
The airline has been relying heavily on what business analysts here call the economy-class ethnic market: Indians traveling or living abroad. But other Asian airlines, among them Thai International, Singapore and the Malaysian Airlines System, have been capturing growing shares of long-haul passengers because of their high standards of service and comfort.
The new look for Air India is part of a general shake-up at the airline under its 39-year-old director, Rajan Jetley. He said his aim is to create a ''high-yield contemporary airline.''
India, like many Asian nations, is now a nonstop flight from most European cities, and one stop away from the United States, where Kennedy International Airport is Air India's only stop. International carriers, once limited mostly to Bombay and New Delhi, are beginning to schedule more flights from Calcutta and Madras in return for greater access for Air India in Europe.
Ten years ago, Air India, which says it now flies to 40 cities on five continents, was rated among the world's 10 worst airlines by a European passenger association. Indian passengers also complained of slovenly conditions on planes and in airport terminals and of indifferent and surly service.
 
Complaints Are Down
Over the last two years, however, better airport operations and more convenient schedules have helped reduce complaints and raise profits for the Government-owned airline. India also has two nationalized domestic carriers, Indian Airlines and Vayudoot, both plagued by problems with service and equipment.
Air India reported a profit of $26 million in its 1988-89 fiscal year, though some industry analysts said they thought the profit was helped by the Government's cutting the price of fuel to the airline. But there is no debate that the airline's loss was almost that much in the 1987-88 fiscal year, so whatever the real profit, it was a turnaround.
The cost of Air India's revamped corporate image, down to menu cards, baggage tags and stationery, will be about $35 million. The new image is not winning much applause at home, however. The plane's design has been criticized as too bland to make an impact and too international to be identified with India.
Air India promises at least not to ditch its little Maharajah. The mascot will remain, though not on the planes.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Raid Across the Mexican Border

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico, Oct. 24

 BODY:
In his office at the headquarters of Vitro S.A. here, Ernesto Martens keeps a supply of customized baseball caps emblazoned with labels like ''creative'' or ''optimistic'' or ''emotional.'' At the moment, his choice would probably be a cap marked ''bold.''
As president and chief executive of Mexico's biggest maker of glass products, Mr. Martens - along with the company's chairman, Adrian Sada - has just presided over the first successful hostile takeover of an American concern by a Mexican company.
In a deal that was begun Aug. 9 and is expected to be formalized soon, Vitro is acquiring the Anchor Glass Container Corporation, the second-largest glass container manufacturer in the United States. The cost of Vitro's American foray is estimated at more than $900 million, including $460 million in Anchor debt, the purchase of the Latchford Glass Company of Huntington Park, Calif., for $48 million and the installation of Latchford's management at Anchor. 
 
'We Had to Expand'
''We had to expand our base,'' Mr. Martens said when asked why Vitro had decided to make acquisitions in the United States. Mr. Martens, a 56-year-old chemical engineer, was chief executive at Union Carbide de Mexico before he joined Vitro in 1977.
''If we want to continue to be a glass company, as we have been for 80 years, we can no longer be satisfied having a strong domestic base and some export activity,'' he continued. ''With a more open Mexican economy, our strategy has had to change.''
The watershed transaction comes at a time when the United States and Mexico are making big efforts to scale down barriers that have slowed the growth of trade between them. During a state visit to Washington by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari earlier this month, officials of the two countries signed an agreement that promises to reduce tariffs and open investment opportunities in important industrial sectors like automobiles, steel, telecommunications, petrochemicals, computers, textiles and processed foods.
Analysts here and in Mexico City said they would not be surprised to see other Mexican companies, faced with the prospect of increased competition here, move into the American market through the takeover route.
 
Shopping for Banks
Cementos Mexicanos recently bought several concrete plants in the Southwest, for example, and some of Mexico's state-owned banks are known to be shopping for savings and loan associations and small banks in Texas and California.
But the biggest impact of Vitro's acquisition of Anchor is likely to be felt among Monterrey's other industrial giants, like the Alfa, Visa and Cydsa conglomerates, whose activities include steel, paper cartons, plastics, beer and chemicals. Until the death of Eugenio Garza Sada in 1973, all four companies were run as divisions of the Monterrey Group, and even today they remain closely linked by blood ties and a common outlook.
''These guys are all first cousins, so you can be sure they are talking to each other,'' another American analyst here said. ''All of them also happen to be cash-flush, with money coming out of their ears, so now that the first step has been taken by Vitro, the odds are that we will see it happen again.''
That Vitro, which last year recorded income of $152 million on revenues of $1.1 billion at recent exchange rates, turned out to be the first Mexican company to move north across the border by the takeover route has surprised few here.
 
Entrepreneurial Spirit
The business community in this industrial center of three million people less than 100 miles south of the Rio Grande is renowned throughout Mexico for its entrepreneurial spirit, and Vitro, which was founded in 1909 to make glass bottles for beer, is regarded as one of the best-run businesses in Monterrey.
''In Vitro we have observed a management that has been very aggressive, in the sense of diversification and expansion, and capable of achieving growth in spite of the economic crisis from which the country has been suffering since 1982,'' said Jorge Placido Evangelista, an analyst at Operadora de Bolsa, a large brokerage house in Mexico City. ''It's also in the vanguard of technology, much of which it has developed itself and has been exporting.''
Nevertheless, Vitro's acquisition of Anchor comes after a decade of great change and retrenchment for the publicly held conglomerate, dominated since its earliest days by members of the Sada and Garza families. Like many Mexican companies, Vitro borrowed heavily during the oil boom of the late 1970's, to find itself reeling from twin blows in 1982, when oil prices collapsed and the Mexican Government nationalized a bank owned by the company.
 
Astute Negotiators
By 1983, Vitro's debt to foreign banks had risen to $758 million. But the company was never forced to declare a loss, and it showed unusual skill and astuteness in talks with its bank creditors, with the result that indebtedness had been reduced to $15 million in August.
''Vitro showed a capacity to negotiate with the banks,'' Mr. Placido said. ''They took firm positions and held to them.''
In the mid-1980's, additional pressure came from the Government's decision to open up Mexico's closed domestic market to foreign imports and competition, which was followed by Mexico's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986.
''If we had done nothing, we would have ended up with a strong domestic market position, but with everybody outside shooting at us,'' Mr. Martens said.
Faced with recession at home, Vitro also embarked on an effort to raise its profile in overseas markets. Exports, which totaled $108 million in 1984, had grown to more than $250 million by 1988, including items ranging from delicate crystalware sold at Neiman-Marcus and soft-drink bottles made for Coca-Cola and Pepsico to sophisticated glass-making machinery for American clients and windshields and windows for Ford automobiles.
 
Appeal to the Middle Class
In Mexico, Vitro has also diversified into product lines that appeal to middle-class Mexican consumers who hope the worst of the economic crisis has passed. In one of its 12 joint ventures, the company makes Samsonite luggage, mostly for the domestic market, while a joint venture with Whirlpool, to make refrigerators and stoves, was begun in 1985.
Mr. Martens said Vitro planned to use its advanced glass-making technology to help restore the competitive position of Anchor, which has recorded net losses of nearly $26 million over the last four quarters. That strong technological position, market analysts said, should help Vitro recover a large chunk of the $400 million the company has said it plans to invest in Anchor over the next five years.
''This is the most brilliant move that any company in Monterrey has made,'' an American economist here said. ''Vitro has opened a huge window into the United States, and I would suspect we are going to see them benefit from a lot of cross-fertilization and cross-trafficking.''
 
In American Hands
Mr. Martens said Vitro planned to shut three of Anchor's existing United States plants and would name Federico Sada, the 40-year-old head of Vitro's container division, as Anchor's vice-chairman. But Vitro executives said day-to-day management would remain in American hands.
''Anchor is to be an independent subsidiary, not a part of the Vitro container division,'' said Mr. Sada, who studied at Washington University in St. Louis and at Harvard. ''My role will be indirect, at the board level.''
While some Wall Street analysts viewed the $21.25-a-share price paid by Vitro for Anchor as overly generous, Vitro's senior management said the purchase was worth the price, especially in view of the company's desire to gain a foothold in the United States and become a worldwide force in the glass industry. ''We're buying 26 percent of the biggest market in the world,'' Mr. Martens said.

HEADLINE: Shun 'Backwater of Oppression,' Nixon Tells China

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Former President Richard M. Nixon urged China today not to sink into a ''backwater of oppression and stagnation'' and called on both the United States and China to strive for cooperation to overcome the present bitterness in their relationship.
Parts of his remarks, delivered at a banquet tonight given by Prime Minister Li Peng, are likely to embarrass the Chinese. Mr. Nixon referred twice to the events surrounding the violent crackdown on demonstrators on June 2-4 as a ''tragedy'' that has soured Chinese-American relations.
''The cultural, political, and ideological differences between us, Mr. Premier - you a Chinese Communist who believes in Leninist rule, I, an American conservative who believes in capitalism and democracy - are too great to permit a common understanding of this tragedy,'' Mr. Nixon said.
''But let us not become mired in endless and fruitless recriminations over the seeming impasse that has now developed between our two countries,'' he said. 
 
Continued World Role Urged
Mr. Nixon, who arrived on Saturday and is expected to stay until at least Thursday, also called on China to help maintain stability in the Pacific region and to continue to take part in the global economy and balance of power.
The visit was billed as a fact-finding trip rather than a mission to accomplish major breakthroughs in tense relations between the United States and China. Diplomatic relations have been strained since the military crackdown on the democracy movement in June and since the American Embassy decided to grant refuge to a dissident couple, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian.
Mr. Nixon made a landmark trip to China in 1972, helping prepare for establishment of diplomatic relations seven years later.
He is the most prominent American to visit China since the June crackdown. The United States has suspended all high-level trips to China, and he is visiting as a private citizen, although he is to brief President Bush upon his return home.
Earlier today, Mr. Nixon met with Li Ruihuan, who was named to the six-member Politburo standing committee in June, but the substance of the talks was not made public by either side.
Separately, the Government announced tonight that it would withdraw martial-law troops from Tiananmen Square in Beijing and from major intersections throughout the city. The troops will be replaced by armed policemen, in what appears to be another step toward easing of martial law in the capital.
The Government added that a small number of troops would remain in the city to carry out martial law, which was imposed in major areas of Beijing on May 20. ----U.S. Charges Harassment BEIJING, Oct. 30 (AP) - The United States Embassy has filed three protests in three days with the Chinese Government, asserting that diplomats and their families are being harassed by the Chinese authorities, an embassy official said today.
The reported harassment, including incidents of slashed tires and policemen pointing rifles at diplomats' children, comes as the Chinese have increased surveillance of the American Embassy's compounds.
The increased surveillance is in addition to the police officers with automatic rifles and helmets who have surrounded the embassy and the Ambassador's residence since the crackdown in June, when the dissidents Mr. Fang and Miss Li took refuge in one of the compounds.
The official said he saw no connection between the harassment and Mr. Nixon's visit.
In the last week, the official said, one embassy staff member found a tire on his car flat on two mornings, each time after he had entertained Chinese guests. Two other staff members found their car lights had been turned on during the night, draining the batteries, and one car's fan belt was stolen.
Twice in the last week, policemen outside the embassy pointed unloaded automatic rifles at children of American diplomats and pulled the triggers, the official said.

HEADLINE: As Oratory Fades, Obstacles to Chemical Arms Pact Multiply

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
One month after President Bush proposed from a United Nations podium that the United States and Soviet Union begin to slash their stockpiles of poison gas, his initiative has run into political and technological obstacles.
In the Soviet Union, the only plant equipped to destroy poison gas has been shut down by a newly powerful environmental movement, Soviet officials say. Experts believe it will be years before new Soviet sites for destroying chemical weapons are built and operating.
''We do have difficulties in destruction,'' said Sergei B. Batsanov, a top Soviet chemical arms negotiator who began a weeklong meeting today with American negotiators in New York. 
Bush Administration officials are still struggling to turn the President's remarks into a workable plan. For example, they are still debating whether the President's initiative should include highly intrusive verification measures to guard against the possibility of covert stocks of poison gas.
An insistence on stringent monitoring could frustrate Mr. Bush's hope for an early accord that would lend impetus to the worldwide effort to ban poison gas, officials said. But they acknowledged that without far-reaching monitoring measures, it would be impossible to verify fully Mr. Bush's proposal that the two sides reduce their chemical arsenals to equal levels.
 
'Not Got It All Together'
Nor have Bush Administration officials decided whether a Soviet-American agreement to reduce chemical arms would require Congressional approval.
''We have not got it all together yet,'' an official said. ''But once these remaining issues are resolved, we hope to have a workable plan ready to discuss with the Soviets.''
The idea of destroying chemical weapons gained high visibility in January when the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, announced in Paris that Moscow would begin to eliminate its poison gas stocks in advance of a global treaty banning chemical weapons. Washington responded that the United States already was destroying chemical arms.
At that time, the Moscow authorities appeared to assume that their new chemical weapons destruction plant at Chapayevsk on the Volga River would soon be ready to operate. After Mr. Shevardnadze's address, however, local residents raised objections to the Chapayevsk facility on environmental grounds. In early September, the Government dropped its plan to destroy chemical weapons at Chapayevsk, Soviet officials have said.
President Bush sought to seize the initiative in his Sept. 25 address by proposing that the two sides cut their chemical weapons stocks to an equal level that would be about 80 percent below current American stocks.
But political problems in the Soviet Union, among other factors, may delay Mr. Bush's efforts, according to Administration specialists and experts outside Government.
 
Moscow Lacks the Means
One major obstacle is that the recent decision by Moscow has left it without the ability to destroy significant quantities of chemical weapons.
Mr. Batsanov, the Soviet chemical arms negotiator, confirmed that the Chapayevsk plant would be used only for training purposes, with water substituted for chemicals.
He said the Government would decide later this year what additional chemical destruction plants to build.
He did not say how long it would take to build the new plants. But American officials estimate that it will take about three years to build new American installations for destroying chemical weapons.
In contrast to the Soviet Union, the United States has already built a new chemical weapons destruction plant on Johnston Island, south of Hawaii, that they hope will be fully operational in July 1991.
The Government also plans to break ground Tuesday on a destruction plant in Utah, one of eight to be built in the continental United States.
The Johnston Island site is months behind schedule. But Pentagon officials say that they will be able to meet a Congressional requirement to destroy old chemical weapons by 1997 if no unforeseen challenges arise.
Aside from these problems, Moscow and Washington still disagree over whether a pact reducing American and Soviet chemical weapons should be accompanied by a ban on new production.
The Soviet Union has proposed such a ban. But the Bush Administration has strongly opposed it, arguing that it needs to manufacture advanced new ''binary'' weapons, in which two types of otherwise harmless chemicals are mixed to produce a lethal gas.
On verification, the Soviet Union appears to have an accommodating stance. Mr. Batsanov said Moscow would be willing to accept far-reaching monitoring as part of a American-Soviet accord, including impromptu ''challenge'' inspections in search of covert stocks.
Bush Administration officials argue that the President's initiative should be pursued despite political and practical problems.
An Administration specialist said that the two sides could share destruction technology. A pact could also take account of ''the problems and dilemmas facing the Soviets'' in constructing plants to destroy chemical stocks.
Such assurances might be helpful, the interview with Mr. Batsanov suggested.
The negotiator said that some officials in Moscow were concerned that Washington would take advantage of the Soviets' problems to score public relations points. He argued that the United States was in a much better position to destroy chemical weapons.
He said that some Soviet officials questioned the timing of Mr. Bush's address, which could be linked to the problems at the Chapayevsk facility.
''The magnitude of effort'' to destroy chemical weapons, ''political, economic and so forth, is not equal,'' Mr. Batsanov asserted.

HEADLINE: U.S. Birth Level Nears 4 Million Mark

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The number of babies born in the United States every year is edging toward four million, a level not reached since the baby boom in the 1950's. Until recently, demographers thought that level would be out of reach until well into the 21st century.
A decade ago some demographers, confronted with record low birth figures, estimated that as many as 25 percent of American women born in the 1950's would remain childless, thus reducing the total number of births for decades to come. Others argued that these women were merely deferring births. 
Figures being compiled now show that the second view is generally correct and that the rate of childlessness for women born in the baby boom will be only about 15 percent.
Other questions remain about how the next group of women, those born in the late 60's and early 70's, will balance motherhood and careers.
 
Impact in Baby Boom
And some experts, like Ben J. Wattenberg, author of ''The Birth Dearth,'' say the current surge in the fertility rate is like the baby boom itself, an aberration in a steady, 200-year decline in fertility in the United States.
At the peak of the baby boom, when births exceeded four million from 1954 to 1964, women were having slightly more than three children each. Their daughters, now 25 to 42, are all in their childbearing years, and although they are having, on average, slightly fewer than two children each, their sheer numbers are fueling the current surge.
''During 1989, it looks like we'll just touch 4 million,'' said Martin O'Connell, a Census Bureau demographer, ''That number I see peaking at between 4.0 and 4.1 million and trailing off toward the end of the decade to 3.8 and 3.6 million.''
''People would have said 10 years ago that we weren't going to get back'' to 4 million births, said Suzanne Bianchi of the Census Bureau.
 
Crowded Classrooms Foreseen
The number of births in the United States fell in 1986, but rose sharply in 1987 and 1988. In 1988, the National Center for Health Statistics recorded 3.91 million births and the figures have been going up steadily.
For two years, Ms. Bianchi said, the number of births has been significantly higher than the Census Bureau projected in 1984 and 1985, a discrepancy that could cause unexpectedly crowded classrooms in elementary schools in the early 1990's.
Ms. Bianchi and other experts agree that delayedin childbirth is the main factor in the current surge. Predictions of high rates of childlessness have not proved out.
 
Rising Average Age
A decade ago demographers predicted that 1 in 5 or even 1 in 4 women born in the baby boom would have no children, but, Mr. O'Connell said, the rate of childlessness is expected to be only 14 percent for women born in the late 1940's. For women born in the 1950's, he said, the rate is 16 percent.
While the average age of first-time mothers rose from 21.8 years in the early 1960's to 23.7 years in 1988, more than 70 percent of all babies are still born to women in their 20's.
Some experts argue that in the near future American women will return to a pattern of slightly earlier childbearing. A complete return to the patterns of the early 1950's is not expected.
Richard Easterlin, an economist at the University of Southern California who says a family's financial wellbeing is crucial in the decision to have a child, expects that women in their late teens or early 20's will achieve financial security faster than baby-boomers because they will face a less competitive labor market.
The result, he said, should be earlier childbearing among these women. ''My expectation would be to see the upswing in the 25- to 29-year-old age group,'' he said, adding that he expected this to become evident ''five years down the road.''
 
Income and Fertility Rate
William Butz, the Census Bureau's associate director for demographic programs, questions whether the fertility rate for younger women could increase as long as their educational and career opportunities increase.
''In an economy that is holding women in jobs, women's time becomes more expensive,'' said Mr. Butz.
When men were the sole or predominant family wage earners, he said, couples tended to have more children in good times and fewer in bad times.
As the labor market opened to women, he continued, a new variable entered the equation: Did a couple want to forgo the woman's income for a period of time so they could have a child?
This change, he said, led to a reversal of normal patterns. Economic downturns became occasions for increased fertility, at least among younger couples.
Mr. Butz said these assumptions tested well for the recessions of 1970 and 1973-74, but he has not examined them in light of later recessions.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Gag That Man!

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Some of those people in Washington really have their nerve.
Take what happened last week. The deputy director of the National Security Council had the gall to propose saying a few public words about how Mikhail Gorbachev was having some very serious economic and nationality problems and how it was not a foregone conclusion that perestroika would work.
Bush Administration people have said something like that before. But that was in the old days - a few weeks ago. 
Since then, the Bush Administration and the Baker State Department have become hugely enthusiastic about the American commitment to perestroika - reforming and preserving Soviet Communism through Soviet Communism and Western help.
Now they see political gain in get-ting on the Gorbachev bandwagon and none in raising pesky questions.
So you can understand how irritated Secretary of State James Baker was when he heard that Robert M. Gates had had the impertinence to propose making a little speech that might dampen the euphoria about the perestroika the Administration is promoting.
Then, as Tom Friedman of The New York Times reported en route to his 12th Pulitzer Prize, Mr. Baker made the right call; no more speech.
It does not take long for a top bureaucrat to try to put a mental fence marked ''no trespassing'' around his department.
Also, Gorbachev zealots in the United States keep telling President Bush and Mr. Baker they better hurry up and build an American ''consensus'' about foreign policy in support of the Soviet leader, his present and his future. Otherwise, they say, watch out - we will call you a wimp again.
Like most top bureaucrats - political, governmental, business and even, Heaven help us, journalistic - Mr. Baker seems to think ''consensus'' is another way to say yes, sir!
Russian bureaucrats even have a proverb for it: Every little vegetable has its season. In translation: Shut your mouth.
So silencing Mr. Gates may be within Mr. Baker's bureaucratic clout-prerogative. But the rest of us are not bureaucrats. What is best for Mr. Baker's blood pressure may not be best for what we laughingly call the intellectual climate of the country.
But what is disappointing is not so much Mr. Baker's automatic reaction - silence, small vegetable - but the acquiescence and even praise with which it has been received in the intellectual community.
One of my favorite editorial writing friends, versed in government ways, is even suggesting that to win more political strength at home President Bush should jump right in to help shut off the ''confusion'' of dissenting voices.
The argument is also used that if Bush-Baker do not whip everybody into line, some Administration officials may even argue about the terms of arms treaties or economic assistance to the Soviet Union.
Isn't that part of what they are getting paid to do? Remember whistle blowers? When Mr. Gates wants to sound a little peep, the reaction of Administration bureaucrats, and ex-bureaucrats, is: Gag that man.
But let's not the rest of us think as bureaucrats or former bureaucrats. Few things are more important to debate now than American policy toward the future of the Soviet Union.
Is Mr. Gorbachev the issue? Or is it how we can help the Soviet Union achieve a future free of the restraints and powers of the Soviet system, which he still holds in his hand?
It is even possible Mr. Gorbachev may be part of that future; it is difficult to predict the limits of his flexibility.
But even to suggest real discussion brings floods of denunciation: You want to destroy Gorbachev and bring on Russian Fascism.
If Mr. Gorbachev can be destroyed by some honest discussion in the United States, the man is a gone goose.
Another argument that must give him a good chuckle: If anybody in the Administration raises public questions about bandwagoning, Mr. Gorbachev will not sign the arms control agreements he wants to sign. That is not only an insult to the Administration's political sophistication but to Mr. Gorbachev's, which he has already demonstrated is much higher.
The issue of the moment is not perestroika. It is the right of a responsible public official like Mr. Gates to discuss it candidly. It is a pity that a man as intelligent as Mr. Baker chose to exercise his ability to shut Mr. Gates up.
Anyway, with a nod of appreciation for Mr. Gates's attempt, let's be happy that you and I do not grow in any Government garden, and never have.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Bush's Acid Test

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
President Bush's much-ballyhooed clean air proposals took a beating in a House committee but he still can push his innovative acid-rain program through Congress - if he throws the full weight of his Administration and his own prestige behind it.
If not, his growing reputation for ''waffling'' will be furthered and his early credits as an environmentalist will be lost. Already, Mr. Bush has failed to call the White House environmental conference for this year that he promised in his campaign, and he seems reluctant to join the industrialized world in moving against global warming - perhaps because John Sununu, his chief of staff, is reported to believe the problem does not yet require action.
Mr. Sununu also was ingloriously involved in one of the Administration's most embarrassing setbacks -when that House committee threw out Mr. Bush's plan requiring the automobile industry to build and sell, in the nation's nine most polluted cities, one million alternative-fuel cars by 1997. It was not just that the committee surrendered to the industry, merely requiring it to certify its capacity to build the cars; Mr. Sununu was reported to have undercut the Bush proposal, while William Reilly, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency, was supporting it. 
That produced charges that the Administration was ''all over the lot'' while George Bush was nowhere. Then the committee gave him the back of its hand again, stiffening far beyond his desires the proposals he had sent up for reducing pol-lutants emitted from automobile tailpipes.
Mr. Bush's acid-rain plan is still on the table, however, though it faces stiff opposition in both houses. Environmental sources believe it still can be approved, if the President and the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, join forces in supporting it. Mr. Mitchell has every reason to do so, since his home state, Maine, is a major sufferer from acid rain and he is trying to overcome the Democrats' reputation as big spenders.
The Bush plan sets a tough and permanent cap on pollutants that cause acid rain, emitted from 107 plants in 18 states. The plan requires a reduction of 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide (about half the total now spewed into the air) and two million tons of oxides of nitrogen over the next 10 years -far greater emission cuts than the affected industries wanted.
They could achieve specified reductions in pollutants by any of several methods - installing smokestack scrubbers, switching to low-sulfur coal, encouraging consumer conservation of electricity, adopting new technologies, or any combination of the above. The Administration and the Environmental Defense Fund -which helped devise the plan - contend that this would be less costly than requiring the plants to install scrubbers, with Government subsidizing the expense.
Costs could be further reduced by a daring ''market approach.'' If one plant cut its pollutants more than required, it could sell its overage to another plant that had not sufficiently reduced its emissions. The buying plant then could subtract that amount of pollutants from the reductions it otherwise would have to achieve. The costs to both would be lowered - to the selling plant by the proceeds of the sale, to the buyer in the reduced costs of reaching a smaller quota.
That is not ''selling pollution rights,'' as some critics have called it, since the total required reduction of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen still would have to be achieved. Nor is the whole program ''anti-growth,'' as critics also allege. To reduce the emission of pollutants is not necessarily to restrain the capacity for economic growth or plant expansion. When the benefits of an end to acid rain - which kills lakes, rivers, animal and plant life, and even damages structures - are included, the cost-benefit ratio heavily supports Mr. Bush's program.
But will Congress support it? That may depend on the Senate, where action on acid rain is expected first and might well influence the House. The former majority leader, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, a high-sulfur-coal state, leads the formidable opposition of other such states and of the Midwestern utilities most affected.
That only gives George Bush the opportunity to prove two things now in doubt: his commitment to environmentalism and his resolution as a political leader.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Soviet Citizen Forum: Fewer Rifts Now

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Soviet and American citizens celebrated the improvement in relations between their two nations today as they met here for their fifth annual exercise in people-to-people diplomacy. But the occasion was marred by American concern about a Soviet editor who was not allowed to attend.
Officials from the two countries, speaking at the conference sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh and the Chautauqua Institution, said they hoped that they could reach significant agreements to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons before the summit meeting tentatively planned for late spring or early summer of 1990.
Vladimir F. Petrovsky, a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, said such agreements, including one to reduce strategic offensive arms by 50 percent, were possible if ''both sides make vigorous efforts.'' Such a timetable is highly optimistic and would require spectacularly rapid progress by arms negotiators. 
The Chautauqua conferences, which began a few months after Mikhail S. Gorbachev took power in 1985, have become a barometer of Soviet-American relations, marked in the past by fierce debates and ideological fireworks. But there are fewer points of contention this year, and the conference has become a forum for charting cooperation on economic matters.
 
Pittsburgh's Perestroika
Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Wesley W. Posvar, president of the University of Pittsburgh, said the Soviets could learn many lessons about perestroika from Pittsburgh, which has restructured its economy in the last decade, with the demise of big steel plants and the rise of high-technology industries.
Vladislav A. Starkov, chief editor of the weekly tabloid Argumenty i Fakty, had been scheduled to attend the conference, but he is not here. A senior member of the staff of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, Leonid N. Dobrokhotov, said Mr. Starkov had been ''advised'' to remain in Moscow.
''It was not punishment,'' the party official said. ''He is a Communist. We have the right to advise members of the party to do something or not to do something. He agreed with it.''
Mr. Starkov published a reader survey that cast doubt on President Gorbachev's popularity and glorified his more radical critics.
Vladimir V. Pozner, the Soviet television commentator who is serving as a moderator for some of the sessions here, expressed ''sympathy and support'' for his journalistic colleague. He deplored the effort to remove Mr. Starkov, who he said was ''fighting back.''
American delegates said the exclusion of Mr. Starkov was inconsistent with the spirit of Chautauqua, an intellectual, ecumenical retreat in western New York that promotes cultural exchanges and uncensored debate on political issues.
 
Wide Range of Topics
Among the topics to be discussed by Soviet and American experts in open sessions at the six-day conference this week are trade and economics, arms control, human rights, the role of ''women in contemporary society,'' regional conflicts, drug abuse, the exploration of outer space and environmental issues like acid rain and global warming.
At the insistence of Soviet officials, the program also includes discussions of ''religious pluralism'' and ethnic diversity in the Soviet Union and the United States.
Seventy-nine families in the Pittsburgh area have opened their homes to members of the Soviet delegation, who are sampling American supermarkets, pizza parlors, and sports events.
The United States Government strongly supports this type of citizen diplomacy, and the United States Information Agency helps with the arrangements.
Surveying Soviet-American relations, Curtis W. Kamman, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, said the two nations were no longer just adversaries, but ''cooperative partners in certain respects.''
''A key difference is the fact that the ideological component of U.S.-Soviet relations has diminished,'' he said. ''This has allowed both countries to move away from an ideological prism and thus find a more realistic and pragmatic way of tackling problems.''
 
Nicaragua Issue Raised
Mr. Kamman called on the Soviet Union to make sure that the Government of Nicaragua did not resume combat operations against guerrilla forces backed by the United States. President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua has threatened to break the 19-month truce because of renewed attacks by the contras. Mr. Kamman complained that the continued shipment of arms to Nicaragua from Soviet bloc countries ''makes it much more difficult'' to have free elections of the type promised for February 1990.
Mr. Petrovsky said the Soviet Union had agreed to ''desist from shipping arms to Nicaragua'' as part of an effort to promote a political settlement there.
More generally, Mr. Petrovsky said that Moscow wanted to ''become an equal and predictable member of the civilized community of nations.''

HEADLINE: Kean's Popularity Is Little Help to Courter

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The popularity of New Jersey's best-known Republican, Gov. Thomas H. Kean, has been of little help this fall to his own party and its candidate for governor, Representative Jim Courter.
One reason, both Republican and Democratic leaders say, is Mr. Kean's aloof style of leadership, which has often separated the Governor from controversies over his two terms and now has kept him at arm's length from the struggling Courter campaign.
In addition, Mr. Kean's liberal positions set him apart from the national party and from Mr. Courter, and he has made little effort to conceal his differences.
Mr. Kean has publicly differed with Mr. Courter on the death penalty, automobile insurance, abortion, whether gay teachers should be allowed to teach children, whether AIDS-infected students should be admitted to classrooms with other children, and Mr. Courter's pledge not to raise taxes. 
The Governor also criticized Mr. Courter, along with his Democratic opponent, Representative James J. Florio, for their negative television commercials and the assaultive tone of the second television debate between the candidates, on Oct. 11.
 
Kean Rejects Television Script
Recently Mr. Kean rejected the script for a Courter commercial that would have had the Governor make a tough attack on the Democrat.
In recent weeks leaders of the Courter campaign and top members of the party have said that they believe Mr. Kean could have campaigned harder for Mr. Courter in the summer and early fall. ''The feeling is that sometime this summer Tom or his advisers decided not to give this thing their all,'' said one prominent Republican member of the Legislature.
''After looking at what Kean has been saying over the years and some of the statements by Courter this summer, it's a position that makes some sense,'' the lawmaker concluded.
Recent polls show that just four years after Mr. Kean won re-election with 70 percent of the vote, Mr. Courter is failing to attract the independents and Democrats who voted for Mr. Kean, Ronald Reagan and George Bush throughout the 1980's.
But aides to the Governor say Mr. Kean has done whatever the Courter campaign has asked. After criticism by members of the Courter campaign and other Republicans appeared last week in The Washington Times, Mr. Kean immediately began making daily campaign appearances with the Republican nominee.
In contrast to his usual policy of freely responding to the press, Mr. Kean repeatedly declined to be interviewed on the subject of his relations with the Courter campaign.
Carl Golden, the Governor's press secretary, said that even before that criticism became public, Mr. Kean had made 14 appearances with Mr. Courter. The problems that Mr. Courter experienced, he said, were beyond the Governor's control.
''Tom Kean has done everything he can to help Jim Courter,'' Mr. Golden said. '' The people who are attempting to lay the blame on Tom Kean are doing so for self-serving reasons.''
In any case, Mr. Florio has played off of the differences between the two Republicans, arguing that he is more likely than Mr. Courter to continue Governor Kean's initiatives. He points to votes in Congress on the environment and transportation where Mr. Florio voted for the positions endorsed by Mr. Kean and Mr. Courter did not.
This weekend, for example, the Florio campaign quoted an editorial endorsement by The Atlantic City Press, which said Mr. Florio was more likely than Mr. Courter to continue the policies of Mr. Kean.
''On a lot of issues where it comes down to what are your values, it is a fact that Governor Kean and Congressman Florio have been closer to each other than either have been to Congressman Courter,'' said Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's press secretary.
 
A Patrician's Diction
Over the past eight years Governor Kean practiced an eclectic politics that many politicians say has resonated almost perfectly with the sentiments of the era. Though he championed free-market economics, he also spoke out forcefully on environmental issues and on behalf of minorities, and maintained a quiet liberal line on social issues like abortion and homosexual rights.
Brandishing a buoyant smile and a patrician's diction, Mr. Kean often appeared to be not just a partisan advocate, but a personification of New Jersey in resurgence. Under what he called the ''politics of inclusion,'' he helped attract large numbers of white Democrats in 1985, along with a majority of black voters.
While voters in 1980 and 1981 favored the Democratic Party by 31 percent to 22 percent, voter preferences are nearly equal today, according to studies by the Eagleton Institute of politics at Rutgers University.
But critics of Mr. Kean charge that he exercised a kind of removed leadership, and often refused to spend his political capital on controversial issues. Democrats have charged that Mr. Kean's successor will immediately have to face the problems Mr. Kean failed to solve, including a disastrously-managed automobile insurance system, rising property taxes and widespread overdevelopment.
 
Swinging at Easy Balls
''You don't get into the record books by only swinging at the easy balls,'' said Assemblyman Alan J. Karcher, a Democrat who was one of Mr. Kean's major foes in his first term.
In recent weeks, criticism of Mr. Kean's distant style has come from Republicans who have watched mishaps plague Mr. Courter's campaign. Last year, the Governor promised to endorse a candidate to succeed him this year, a choice which many party leaders hoped would avoid a bitter battle for the nomination.
Mr. Kean, however, never did endorse a candidate for the nomination and Republicans fought an expensive and tiring race. Meanwhile, Mr. Florio, who faced only minor opposition in the Democratic primary, concentrated on organizing his fall campaign.
In the summer the Governor, aides say, was upset by Mr. Courter's remarks on abortion and his advocacy of a ban on homosexual teachers. During those weeks, Mr. Courter made few indications he would continue Mr. Kean's policies and appeared far to the right of the incumbent.
 
Pushes for Courter Staff Change
In mid-September, said people familiar with the meeting, Mr. Kean and his top aides told Mr. Courter that he was under the influence of conservative Republicans from Washington who did not understand the state. They pressed to replace his campaign manager, Kenneth Connolly, with Roger Bodman, a Republican consultant who had managed Mr. Kean's campaigns. Mr. Courter agreed, but Mr. Bodman changed his mind the next morning and refused to take the job.
Mr. Connolly has remained in charge, together with Roger Ailes, President Bush's media adviser.
''The perception that Kean is not actively helping him has hurt Courter,'' said Stephen Salmore, a professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers, who is advising the Republican Party.
''Whether that perception is reality is not clear,'' Mr. Salmore added. ''The Courter campaign has not tried to focus on continuity with the Kean administration. And that has made it difficult for Kean to do much. Kean truly does not believe in arm-twisting. That is not his style.''

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Candidates' Basic Speeches: Laments Followed by Proposals;
Dinkins: I Intend to be Toughest Mayor on Crime This City Has Ever Seen

 BODY:
The New York City mayoral candidates give dozens of speeches. Sometimes they address a particular issue or audience in a particular way. More often they use a ''basic speech'' that varies little from one occasion to the next. These are the basic speeches of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, and David N. Dinkins, the Democratic candidate:
Let me take a couple of minutes to tell you my view, my vision of what it means to be a Democrat in New York in 1989. We Democrats believe that government should be an agent for change, that government can't afford to stand on the sidelines and that it belongs on the side of communities fighting back against crime and drugs.
It belongs on the side of activists and builders working to create affordable housing, on the side of people with AIDS, on the side of parents, teachers, principals and students who are struggling to make our schools drug-free zones, where our kids learn more about reading and math and less about cocaine and crack. 
Let me say it as plainly as I can: I hate drugs and what they're doing to our children and our neighborhoods. This greatest of urban centers, this city that we care about, is a city under siege. Whole neighborhoods are fast becoming free-fire zones. Some of our housing projects have become base camps for drug dealers, and, too often, we hear of roving gangs' terrorizing our subways, our streets and our parks.
My first term as mayor I will double the number of community-patrol police officers on the beat term. And I will guarantee that there will be a cop on every subway train every night in the year. And I intend to fund community anti-crime groups in every borough, and I'll re-dedicate our criminal-justice system to a very basic proposition.
 
'Learn to Respect'
Every crime must be punished. I don't care if it's your first offense. I don't care if you just stole a car for the night or if you just took a few dollars from a kid on the street. If you commit a crime and are caught, you'll learn to respect the law and the system.
You will because you will punished, no excuses, no apologies. This is one marine who believes in the value of discipline and respect. And I'm going to make sure that some young guys get a whole lot of it early on, when they still have a chance to turn their lives around.
In the next four years, we're going to fight back against crime and drugs. I intend to be the toughest mayor on crime this city has ever seen. You know, I have a wife, I have children, a little boy and a little girl, ages 35 and 32 - they used to be little. But I have a grandson, and he really is little. He's only 3 years old, and my daughter is going to bring me another grandchild. I hope a daughter. And I care about them, and I want to make sure they're safe. And I want your children and your grandchildren to be safe.
So, with your help, I intend to be a mayor who draws on the strength of each of us to lead New York into the future. Together, we will protect our neighborhoods and preserve our environment. We will build up our economy and tear down barriers and secure social justice, from job care to health care to affordable housing. Most of all, I will reach out to all the family of New York. I will fight for you and speak for you.
 
Plea to Unions
I will not pretend that leading this city into the 90's will be easy. Our economy is slowing. Challenges are mounting. And with this year's budget gap now estimated at $500 million, it's clear that the next mayor will have to make some tough choices.
But I'm prepared to do that. And I'm already hard at work, quietly and diligently, to assist in solving the city's current fiscal situation.
I know that the trade-union movement understands the challenges of governing New York during lean times. For it was the labor movement that pitched into help during the fiscal crisis, to restore this city to solvency and fiscal balance. People tend to forget that, you know. I'm going to remind them.
While we don't face that kind of crisis today, the next mayor will have to start from a basic proposition. Quite simply, you can't bargain away what you don't have, and the city will be hard pressed to meet all of the many challenges we face in the coming years. . . .
My friends in labor, like my friends in business and my friends in government, know that I'm a firm and fair negotiator. They know I will bargain hard to increase the productivity and efficiency of the city work force. And I'm confident that we'll be able to sit down and strike a reasonable, fair, prudent agreement on the next round of municipal contracts.
 
Three Costly Challenges
This city faces many costly challenges - drugs, housing and AIDS -just to name three. And my highest priority will be to see that we invest in our $26.6 billion budget wisely, so as to meet the challenges of the 90's.
But working together, all together, we will be able to make this city livable and workable and create a future of opportunity and prosperity for all New Yorkers. And together we will re-establish and reaffirm the progressive values that are New York's best heritage and hope. ...
So let us come together now as New Yorkers in a great coalition stands for progessive principles, that appeals to what is best in our people and that seeks to expand the frontiers of justice and opportunity. Let us give new life to the values given to each of us in our time by John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. For too long from the center of power in this nation, we have heard only a summons to selfishness. Meanwhile, our national government is evading the emergency of urban America. We have seen the wealthiest prosper at the expense of the poor and the middle class. We watched bombs increase while hope declines. . . .
It's time in this city to determine the next mayor to open a new path to progress. I hope you will walk that path with me. And victory in November is only the beginning of the journey. We won't finish it overnight. But we will renew our hopes and our aspirations. We will be activists and strong and determined. We will make this city work. We will make it safe, and we will bring New York together.
In closing, let me recall and adapt the words of President John Kennedy in the last speech he ever made in our city, because his thoughts apply in this moment in our history. ''It is essential,'' John Kennedy said, ''that the word go forth to all who are concerned about the future of the family of New York that we are not weary in well doing. And I am confident, if we maintain the pace, that we shall in due season reap the kind of city we deserve and deserve the kind of city we will have.''

HEADLINE: Sales Dip Deflates Hyundai Bubble

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Just three years after engineering one of the most successful imported-car introductions in the United States, the Hyundai Group has hit a rough patch.
Sales of the South Korean company's subcompact Excel model have dropped sharply this year as its price has risen, as domestic and foreign competitors have grown more aggressive in a weak auto-sales market, and as buyers have tired of the Excel's three-year-old styling.
Hyundai's relations with its 310 dealers in the United States have become strained, and in the last few months the company has lost three of its top American managers.
But analysts and Hyundai executives and dealers say that the company's problems are not irreversible and that it is not unusual for importers to suffer growing pains as they move beyond the introduction of their first car. But they say Hyundai's woes clearly reflect its biggest strategic misstep - a slowness to bring on new models - as well as the perils of competition in a weak market for auto sales. 
With an initial base price of $4,995 and styling drawn heavily from pricier Japanese competitors, the Excel quickly became a hit with first-time buyers and others seeking affordable ''cars that make sense,'' as the company's advertising slogan put it. Within a year, Hyundai trailed only Toyota, Nissan and Honda among all foreign car makers in import sales in the United States.
 
'Ran Out of Customers'
''They sold 700,000-plus of the Excel model over several years without changing it, and they just ran out of customers to buy it,'' said J. David Power of J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Westlake Village, Calif. ''They didn't get the next generation of styling on stream fast enough, and the market changed very rapidly on them.''
Through the first nine months of this year, Hyundai sold 146,042 cars in the United States, down 30 percent from the corresponding period of last year. For all of 1989, Hyundai Motor America, the company's sales and marketing arm in the United States has already slashed its sales projection to 200,000 cars, from 300,000, and some analysts think Hyundai will fall short of the lower figure. In 1988, Hyundai sold 264,282 cars in the United States, up slightly from 1987.
''We started with such a bang that the manufacturer didn't think there was much urgency to bring on new models,'' said Bob Brest, a Hyundai dealer in Lynn, Mass. ''They probably got a little complacent, and when things turned down, they turned down very quickly.''
 
Another Executive Quits
Earlier this month, Hyundai Motor America said it was eliminating 50 of the 600 jobs at its headquarters in Garden Grove, Calif., south of Los Angeles. At the same time, it announced the resignation of W. Greg Warner, the only remaining executive of three Americans who had led Hyundai's introduction into the United States.
The company attributed Mr. Warner's departure to ''differences regarding business direction'' with executives of the South Korean parent company, and analysts said there had long been strains between the Korean and American managers. Mr. Warner did not return telephone calls.
The company is now searching for a new chief operating officer to serve as second in command to H. W. Baik, the Korean president of Hyundai Motor America.
Hyundai Group, one of South Korea's largest companies, is engaged in shipbuilding and shipping, steelmaking, electronics, construction and other businesses in addition to automobiles. Its sales last year are estimated at $18 billion.
While the domestic South Korean auto market remains very important to Hyundai, the company's investment in North America is growing. In January, the company opened a $325 million assembly plant in Quebec to serve the United States and Canada, and is now building a $100 million metal-stamping plant on an adjacent site to make components.
Hyundai executives say their product line remains strong, with few quality complaints, and they will be able to re-establish themselves as a maker of cars that rival the Japanese in looks, options and reliability, but at a significantly lower price.
''We see this as a temporary setback,'' said Debbie Douglas, a spokeswoman for Hyundai Motor America. ''We have a lot of new and exciting products for 1990.''
 
Bigger Car, but Poor Sales
Hyundai faces a formidable task. After three years of selling only the original Excel model, Hyundai last winter introduced the Sonata, a four-door sedan with a base price of $9,999 that is intended to compete with larger cars like the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord, both of which generally sell for several thousand dollars more.
Sales of the Sonata have been disappointing. Cynthia Certo, director of forecasting for Integrated Automotive Resources, a consulting firm, said Hyundai had projected in January that it would sell 80,000 Sonatas this year. Through September, only 26,115 had been sold.
While the car has received generally good performance reviews, it was introduced in a weak market that has forced all manufacturers - even those like Honda that had previously avoided widespread rebates and other promotions - to become intensely competitive, especially in the market for midsized cars. Even with a price advantage, the Sonata suffers from Hyundai's relatively low volume of advertising and lack of a clear image in this country, analysts said.
''Somehow, they've got to get that car on the buyer's consideration list, and so far they haven't done that,'' said Dennis Keene of the Keene Consulting Group, an automotive consulting firm.
Hyundai is now bringing out a more powerful Sonata with a V-6 engine, and it plans to introduce a sporty coupe within months. But the company is by no means abandoning the subcompact market. It is introducing a version of the Excel with more power, a roomier interior and new styling. It has a base price of $5,899.
 
More Competition for Excel
But the low end of the market has also become increasingly competitive since the original Excel made its initial splash. Appreciation of South Korea's currency, the won, and wage increases in Korea have diminished Hyundai's price advantage over both imported and domestic competitors, like General Motors' Geo Prizm, the Toyota Tercel and the Nissan Sentra. The Excel's rivals in this country now include two Korean-made cars, the Pontiac LeMans, built by the Daewoo Motor Company, and the Ford Festiva, built by Kia.
Moreover, competitors have been aggressive in offering rebates and financing deals on slightly bigger compact cars, prompting many buyers to pay a little more for a larger car.
''The larger the incentives you have on those attractive larger cars, the worse it gets for 'econoboxes' like the Excel,'' Ms. Certo said. ''The small-car market is going to shrink dramatically over the next several years, and it's doubtful that the Excel will ever reach the sales levels it did in prior years.''
Hyundai was also hurt by the poor creditworthiness of many buyers, a problem for other makers of entry-level cars. As defaults mounted among low-income and first-time purchasers, Hyundai dealers found it more difficult to help other buyers obtain financing. Hyundai is trying to solve that problem by setting up its own financing company.
 
Big Dealer Investments
Dealers have been increasingly worried about whether the large investments in showrooms required by Hyundai will pay off now that sales have slipped. Hyundai had required stand-alone dealerships, and even asked franchisees to buy showroom furniture from the company. Since sales have dropped, however, some dealers have started selling Hyundais alongside other makes with the manufacturer's grudging permission.
The company is also planning a big advertising push for the 1990 cars in the next few weeks and plans to increase advertising spending for the coming year, apparently responding to dealer criticism that its marketing has not been aggressive enough.
For all their gripes about the company's performance in the last year, dealers say they remain convinced that the Korean company will do whatever it takes to turn around the situation. ''They told us, 'We are in the States for good,' '' said Richard Kim, a dealer in Los Angeles who recently traveled to South Korea to meet with Hyundai executives.

HEADLINE: Dollar Takes Its Cue From Stocks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Something different is happening in the foreign exchange market. In a reversal of the recent pattern, the dollar is being led around by the stock market.
The change came with the 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13. In the uncertain days since, the stock market has taken over from the foreign exchange market as the barometer for the financial markets. 
Currency traders' eyes remain on the Dow as stock trading begins in New York at 9:30 A.M. and throughout the day. It seems that even a little move in the stock market, especially down, causes the dollar to twitch.
 
Lower Rates, Lower Dollar
True, the dollar has not tracked the stock market exactly in the last two weeks. And traders acknowledge that part of the impact on the dollar is not the stock market directly but that the sudden stock market plunges have forced the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates already and may force further moves in the future. Lower rates will push the dollar lower.
But it is clear, traders said, that the stock market is sending out its own tremors. And because foreign exchange traders, like moths, are attracted to a simple signal to guide their dealing, these tremors are no longer being ignored.
''For the first time in a while we are following the stock market,'' said Liliana Nealon, vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
''The foreign exchange market sometimes gets myopic; it focuses on one thing,'' said Frank Watson, vice president of the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. ''And in the last couple of weeks that has been the stock market. The one clear signal to sell dollars is when the Dow goes down.''
Before October, the dollar had been setting the pace. For a year or more, the dollar, rising or falling, had generally led the stock, bond and other markets. This is because the foreign exchange market has been the arena where opinions, especially from abroad, have been expressed most quickly about the health and attractiveness of the American economy.
The foreign exchange market has also been where the United States and its economic allies have best been able to express their policy intentions through dollar selling, economic communiques and the movement of interest rates.
And it is likely that the foreign exchange market will return to this leading role when the outlook for the stock market and the economy improves.
For now, economists and foreign exchange traders said the switch means that the dollar is headed downward, although many argue that the dollar is not headed for a sharp plunge unless something much worse happens to stocks.
It is a change that should please the United States and its economic allies, which have fought all summer to end a persistent dollar rally that pushed it well above the ceilings believed to have been set for it - 1.90 marks and 140 yen. Since Oct. 13, when the dollar stood at 1.9075 marks and 144.15 yen, it has fallen sharply, closing yesterday at 1.8340 marks and 141.85 yen.
 
Roles Are Reversed
With the roles now reversed, a strong dollar rally on Friday was crushed as the stock market, as measured by the Dow average fell 32 points. Even when the market rallied late in the day, the dollar had lost its steam and ended down for the day against most currencies.
On Thursday, another rally was squelched as the stock market slumped, wiping out most, but not all, of the gains for the day. And last Tuesday, when the market fell more than 80 points in the morning before recovering, the dollar dutifully followed, declining and then rallying a little on the rebound.
Yesterday, the dollar rose a little as the Dow Jones industrial average posted its first gain in five trading days.
There are two reasons for the role reversal, which has quickly dulled the bullish attitude that had helped push the dollar above 2 marks and 150 yen this spring and allowed it to remain strong despite coordinated central bank intervention and interest-rate increases in Europe and Japan.
The plunge in the market, some analysts argued, woke up traders to the negative statistics on the economy and the dollar that they had been ignoring. This news included the employment report for September, the rise of interest rates by one percentage point in most of Europe and the increase of the discount rate in Japan. At the time of the announcements the dollar pretty much shrugged off the impact.
''I think there have been a lot of negatives for the dollar recently,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel Inc. in New York. ''But it took the stock market to make traders pay attention.''
 
Ease in Rates Unexpected
The second reason is that the plunge in the stock market has forced the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates slightly, a move that was not expected this soon.
When the United States and its allies in the Group of Seven announced in September that the dollar was too high, they aggressively sold the currency and interest rates rose in Europe and Japan. But analysts said it would take a lowering of interest rates in the United States to close the policy loop and really bring the dollar down. Now this is happening.
If there are any more sharp plunges in the stock market, traders are likely to assume that the Fed may have to ease rates further in an effort to make sure the market has the liquidity it needs to function normally.
This would put more downward pressure on the dollar. When interest rates fall here and rise abroad, the differential narrows, making investing in dollar-denominated securities less attractive to foreign investors.
''Every bout of weakness,'' one top bank trader said, ''means the Fed has to be on its toes.''

HEADLINE: Mitsubishi Estate a Force In Japanese Real Estate

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 31

 BODY:
When the brokers and investment bankers representing the Rockefeller Group went looking for a buyer with the cachet to match that of their prestigious client, they did not have to look far.
''Just about our first call went to Mitsubishi Estate,'' said a professional involved in the deal.
In fact, when Mitsubishi Estate was approached in the late summer, it agreed almost immediately to make a pre-emptive bid, ending any further discussions with other Japanese companies approached. Those included Mitsui Real Estate Development and Sumitomo Realty. 
Mitsubishi Estate is regarded as Japan's most prestigious real estate owner and developer. It developed and owns most of the buildings in one of Tokyo's premier commercial centers, the Marunouchi district, which borders the Imperial Gardens in the center of the city. Mitsubishi Estate is also pursuing a number of other large-scale development projects that are likely to keep it at the top of the Japanese real estate industry.
Still, even if the investment bankers were pleased with the quality of Mitsubishi Estate's image, there were political concerns driving the deal, some of those involved said. Mitsubishi Estate will acquire 51 percent of Rockefeller Group at first. Over the next two to three years, it will increase that holding to 80 percent, according to those involved.
The whole point of this complicated process was to avoid criticism in the United States. Many politicians and others in the United States have reacted negatively to huge Japanese acquisitions in the United States and in this instance the dealmakers wanted to soften the blow of yet another purchase of a highly visible American asset.
Mitsubishi Estate is a member of the Mitsubishi group of industrial and financial companies, a successor to one of the most powerful pre-war zaibatsu's, which had previously dominated the Japanese economy. Mitsubishi Trust and Mitsubishi Bank together own 11.4 percent of the real estate company, and other members of the group own more shares.
As of the end of the fiscal year that ended March 31, Mitsubishi Estate had assets of $7.6 billion, at current exchange rates. It had net profits of $250 million and sales of $1.93 billion. Slightly more than half of its sales came from leasing.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Inch Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers awaited reports on economic activity in October.
Market participants said the survey due tomorrow from the nation's purchasing managers and a report on employment conditions scheduled for release on Friday will be focal points for trading.
Treasury market participants centered their attention yesterday on auctions of $2 billion worth of 51-day cash management bills and $15.6 billion of three- and six-month bills.
The short-term offerings were announced by the Treasury last week in order to raise cash to pay Social Security beneficiaries before the nation's debt ceiling of $2.87 trillion expires at midnight. 
Proceeds from the auctions will raise enough revenue for the Government so that it will remain solvent until Nov. 9. By then, Congress must enact legislation to raise the debt ceiling.
 
Short-Term Offerings
At the auctions, the three-month bills were offered at an average discount rate of 7.78 percent, up sharply from the 7.52 percent average rate at last week's auction.
Meanwhile, the six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 7.62 percent, up from an average rate of 7.50 percent a week earlier.
The 51-day cash management bills were sold at a discounted rate of 7.87 percent.
The short-term issues are merely a prelude to next month's quarterly refunding auctions, when around $30 billion worth of notes and bonds are expected to be sold.
''With all the supply coming, it is somewhat surprising the market did as well as it did,'' said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Group Inc.
In late trading, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 102 10/32, up 1/8 of a point, to yield 7.92 percent.
 
Secondary Note Trading
Among secondary Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 5/8, up 5/32, to yield 7.90 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 5/8, up 1/ 32, to yield 7.83 percent.
In other developments, the municipal bond market was encouraged as a $786.9 million offering of New York City general obligation bonds was snapped up by investors.
The issue, the second from New York in the past few weeks, comes at a time when doubts about the city's economic and political prospects have been rising.
''The deal apparently went very well,'' one municipal bond trader said. ''And the successful pricing helped the rest of the secondary market do better.''
Late yesterday, investment bankers at Goldman, Sachs & Company, the firm acting as lead manager for the underwriting, said the issue had sold out.
 
Broad Appeal
The officials said that a broad spectrum of individual investors, money managers and institutions - some of whom had not previously bought New York City bonds - bought the issue.
''Right now yields on all municipal securities, not just those issued by New York City, are at very attractive levels compared to Treasuries,'' one investment banker involved in the financing said. ''As a result, we saw a good bit of cross-over buying by accounts that were getting out of other securities and into municipals.''
For the second time this year, the New York City issue included an offering of taxable bonds.
Yields on the $55.9 million worth of taxable bonds range from 9 1/8 percent on issues that mature in 1994 to 9.90 percent on bonds maturing in 2010.
Yields on the $757.44 million of tax-exempt serial bonds sold yesterday range from 6.50 percent on bonds that mature Aug. 1, 1990, to 7.78 percent on bonds that mature in 2008.
The issue, which carries an A rating from Moody's Investors Service and an expected rating of A-minus from the Standard & Poor's Corporation, is to refinance bonds that mature over the next several years. The prospectus states that many of the issues to be refinanced mature in 1990 and 1991.
 
Budget Savings Claimed
City officials claim the refinancing will result in savings of $162 million in interest payments during the 1990 fiscal year and an additional $100 million in 1991.
After examining the contents of the refinancing package, however, some critics claimed yesterday that the savings would be far smaller than that.
''There is a modicum of real 'refunding' going on that may save the City $1 million or $2 million,'' said Robert C. Apfel, president of Robert C. Apfel & Company Inc., a capital markets consulting firm. ''All they are really doing is rolling debt that would mature over the next 12 months to 18 months over into the next 20 to 30 years.''
Steven J. Matthews, New York's assistant comptroller, said the issue ''is a restructuring of debt that produces both present value savings and budgetary savings and will allow the City to more accurately reflect the life of the asset that is being financed. This is not fiscal gimmickry.'' The successful New York City offering helped to push prices of outstanding City issues up by half a point, dealers said. Many City issues have been under pressure in recent sessions.
Participants in the secondary market for municipal bonds said prices of most other issues rose by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point yesterday.
Acitivity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was very sluggish, dealers said, with little or no change in prices.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
British Pound Makes Gains; Some Traders Are Cautious

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against leading foreign currencies yesterday while the pound advanced for the first time since London was shaken last week by the departure of Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Gold prices slipped in domestic trading after rising overseas.
Analysts said investors spent the day squaring their positions after the pound declined sharply late last week. Mr. Lawson resigned on Thursday, spurring questions on whether British policy might change. 
Robert Ryan, an analyst with the Bank of New York, said the rise of the pound reflected short-covering, the buying of dollars to fulfill previous agreements to sell them.
The pound rose to $1.5825 in New York, up from $1.5795 late Friday, after closing earlier in London at $1.5785, up from $1.5750 on Friday.
Some dealers warned, however, that sentiment remained pessimistic toward the pound.
''You're bucking the trend if you try to take the pound higher right now,'' said a corporate dealer at an American bank in London. ''I'm not convinced the pound's fall has stopped.''
Overseas dealers said trading was lackluster as dealers waited for fresh economic news later in the week.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Friday, included: 1.8340 West German marks, up from 1.8295; 1.6050 Swiss francs, up from 1.6005; 6.2265 French francs, up from 6.2150; 1,346.00 Italian lire, down from 1,348.00, and 1.1735 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1747.
The dollar rose to 141.85 yen in New York, from 141.75 late Friday.
Gold edged lower in New York after gains in foreign trading. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $376.65 an ounce, down from $377.25 late Friday. Earlier, gold fell 50 cents to close at $377.80 on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Silver prices also were mixed. An ounce of silver fell 3.8 cents, to $5.243, on the Comex.
