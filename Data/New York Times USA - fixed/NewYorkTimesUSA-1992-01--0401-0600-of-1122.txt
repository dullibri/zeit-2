HEADLINE: NOW Reasserts Its Role as Outsider

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The National Organization for Women celebrated its 25th anniversary here this weekend by embracing its status as a militant outsider in politics at home while reaching out to other countries in an attempt to create a movement of "global feminism."
Harking back to her days as an airline stewardess, NOW's new president, Patricia Ireland, told the group's plenary session on Friday that her job usually consisted of "walking up and down aisles, taking people's garbage, and saying 'thank you, thank you.' " For too long, she added, "women in Washington and other capitals of the world have been taking other people's garbage and saying 'thank you.' " 
 In a later interview, Ms. Ireland, who replaced Molly Yard as president last month, said: "I am less than interested in playing with the boys in the Democratic Party any more. We played in '84 and '80. We made great efforts to get the Senate back in Democratic hands. The reality is that as each more and more conservative justice has gone on the Supreme Court, they have been confirmed by a Democratically controlled Senate."
 
Membership at 250,000
 Instead, she said, the group would use this election year "to create a lot more feminist candidates, and those who come out and vote for them will also vote against George Bush."
Indeed, many of the 700 women present who told their stories and plotted their strategies in small groups that focused on topics like "violence against women," "economic empowerment" or "women and families," took pride in the devil-take-the-hindmost sense of separatism that pervades the organization. Since the group's charter was drafted by Betty Friedan, author of "The Feminine Mystique," and 27 other co-founders in a Washington hotel 25 years ago, its membership has grown to about 250,000.
Bolstered recently by women's outrage over the Clarence Thomas-Anita F. Hill hearings, the group's support is now as extensive as at any time since the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1982. In the wake of that failure, the group's membership, 220,000 in 1982, plunged below 130,000 over the next several years.
But compared with the heyday of the fight for the Equal Rights Amendement, this convention and birthday party seemed energized more by defiant anger than by any of the plethora of proposed actions.
Throughout the weekend, it was clear what the group did not like: the possibility that the Supreme Court could, within six months, reverse its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion; pay inequity against women, who earn about 68 cents for each dollar a male worker earns, and all forms of discrimination against homosexuals.
It was less clear exactly what they intended to do about it. Or perhaps more accurately, it seemed clear they would support all actions suggested, but it was unclear which actions they would actually take.
That sense of diffuse inclusiveness was the signature of the four-day gathering. Like the the informal sidewalk market set up to sell T-shirts, jewelry, music, pottery, studies on date rape and manuals on lesbian love, the four-day event had the trappings of a politically correct bazaar, its intellectual and practical wares showing its desire to be all things to all feminists.
 
Boos and Catcalls
 That was not always an easy task, especially as the organization started to make its moves into global politics, as Friday's plenary session showed. The featured speaker, and the closest thing to a political celebrity (aside from Ms. Friedan) was Hanan Ash rawi, a Palestinian spokeswoman.
But her exegesis on Palestinian feminism consisted of a frontal attack on the Israeli Government, as she urged American feminists: "Stop sending military aid to Israel. Stop paying for the deportation of our people."
This prompted boos and catcalls from the new Jewish feminist caucus, which was enraged that the Israeli speaker chosen by NOW, Tamara Gozansky, is a Communist and a member of the country's Peace Party and someone unlikely to express views in opposition to Ms. Ashrawi's.
The disruption prompted Ms. Ireland to accept the Jewish feminists' insistence that Dr. Alice Shalvi, head of the Israeli Women's Network, be given the podium to rebut the views of Ms. Ashrawi. This was followed by hugs and a hands-joined-in-victory photograph opportunity.
Earlier, the audience had been riveted by the tale of Aminata Diop, a woman from Mali, who fled her family and her country rather than undergo a ritual clitordectomy -- the removal of the clitoris and inner labia, usually with a razor blade -- and is seeking political asylum in France.
 
'Seeking Gender Balance'
 This morning, the political empowerment caucus voted overwhelmingly for one suggestion after another -- from "seeking gender balance" to the creation of an international woman's congress to exchange information and provide financial support for women candidates around the world to the creation of a third party -- without giving any emphasis to participation in traditional politics.
The group's embrace of the nontraditional had a kind of apotheosis late last year when The Advocate, a California magazine on gay and lesbian issues, put Ms. Ireland on its cover indicating she was "coming out" as a lesbian.
In the following month, Ms. Ireland has been interviewed about her sexual preferences and has persistently dodged any labels like "lesbian" or "bisexual," saying that she considers both her husband of 25 years, James, and an unidentified female companion in Washington "part of my family."
"I have become increasingly and very personally aware now how obsessed our country is with defining women by their sexuality," Ms. Ireland said in an interview. "If they don't know what and how and how often and with whom they just don't know how to deal with you."
But the group's conservative opponents, like the Concerned Women for America, have gleefully seized on the disclosure to argue that NOW is unrepresentative of American women.
Indeed, in the caucus of young feminists on Friday, several people expressed concern that the word feminist had become a political epithet that hampers their ability to carry their message to students.
"Do you realize that in the last 20 minutes we haven't said the word feminist?" said Tara Muir, a graduate student of journalism from Omaha, looking around at about 20 other women and one man gathered in the room.
"That's true; it's a loaded word," said Lisa Diamond, a 20-year-old student at the University of Chicago. "I don't know how else to get people not to be afraid of it, except to let them come at things from their own direction," and not start discussions by using the word feminist.
Marilyn Fitterman, head of New York State's NOW offices, said her membership's reaction to the articles about Ms. Ireland was twofold: "One group said 'Why did she do that? Now I'm going to have to start every interview by saying I'm not a lesbian,' and another group said, 'We're proud of her.' "

HEADLINE: Mining Unhappiness in a Changed New Hampshire

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 11

 BODY:
Facing their first primary election in a state that is home to some of the nation's most economically alienated voters, this year's candidates for President have begun a battle to define themselves that could set the course of the 1992 election.
For the Democrats as well as the Republicans campaigning in New Hampshire, it is no longer enough to politely introduce themselves to voters at house parties and coffee shops. The compressed campaign season leading to the Feb. 18 primary, coupled with a recession that has tripled the number of unemployed New Hampshire residents since 1988, has forced a different approach this year. 
 Each candidate must now prove, through radio and television advertisements and in appearances at plant gates and shuttered stores, that he is tough enough to end the bad times.
Campaign strategists are trying to cut through the economic malaise to appeal to voters like Lou Marchand, who stood alone in her rural Hillsborough restaurant during a nonexistent lunch hour rush one day this week. Mrs. Marchand cared little that Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska was campaigning nearby.
Noting that Hillsborough had lost a vegetable wholesaler, a lumber company and a coin laundry in the last six months, she said business was so bad that she hoped for nighttime snowstorms so road crews would drop by for breakfast. She said she and her husband, Ron, strain to pay their monthly $250 health insurance premium and keep their business afloat.
"It's been pretty tough around here," she said with the New Englander's gift for understatement.
 
More Pragmatic
 To reach people like Mrs. Marchand, who sees little difference among the Presidential hopefuls so far, the candidates have abandoned the customary warm and fuzzy biographical advertisements. Instead, the first spate of television spots, which began appearing here this week, illustrate the new, more pragmatic manner in which the candidates are choosing to make themselves known to voters.
In Gov. Bill Clinton's 60-second effort, Mr. Clinton is in front of a flag in his Arkansas State House office. Gazing into the camera, he talks about the "forgotten middle class" and his plan to rescue its members.
In Paul E. Tsongas's commercial, the second he has put on the air in New Hampshire, he boasts of his accomplishments as a United States Senator from Massachusetts, including his role in winning Congressional approval for a bailout of the Chrysler Corporation and in pushing for the passage of the Alaska Lands Act. As with his first advertisement, which featured Mr. Tsongas swimming laps, the spot emphasized the former Senator's toughness and his recovery from a bout with cancer.
Senator Kerrey, who began attacking Mr. Clinton on the stump earlier this week, joined the advertising fray on Friday. He abandons the recitation of his record in the Vietnam War to discuss health care and to chide President Bush for going to Japan to "beg for a few concessions."
In his advertisement, Mr. Kerrey strides across an ice rink and likens the trade imbalance to a hockey game. "Fight back, America," an announcer intones at the end of the commercial.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa shot his own New Hampshire advertisements on a visit here last week, but they have yet to appear. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who spent much of last week campaigning in Iowa, has also not broadcast television advertisements here.
The Democrats have not been alone in the candidate-definition derby. Vice President Dan Quayle's two-day visit to the state this week marked the Bush campaign's first foray into a race made competitive, in New Hampshire at least, by the presence of Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator.
Mr. Quayle warned Republicans unhappy with Mr. Bush for backtracking on his 1988 no-new-taxes pledge that they should not use Mr. Buchanan's candidacy to send a message. "When times are difficult, don't you want and deserve the very best?" Mr. Quayle asked his New Hampshire audiences.
Mr. Buchanan took out a full-page advertisement in The Union Leader, the influential Manchester newspaper, while Mr. Quayle was visiting. It began, "Hey Dan! Where's George?" while the slogan at the bottom of the page promised, "He'll keep the promises George Bush broke."
But the most vociferous early squabbling has taken place among the Democrats, particularly between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey. After Mr. Clinton's advertising hit the airwaves this week, Mr. Kerrey said his health-care plan was "more revolting than it is revolutionary," the latest in a series of jibes he has aimed at Mr. Clinton.
"Voters up here have a very short window to not just figure out who these guys are, but how they're different from each other," said Bill Shore, an adviser to Mr. Kerrey.
It is difficult to determine how much of the jockeying between Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton is merely political choreography. "It's my strategy to come and argue," Mr. Kerrey cheerfully acknowledged this week.
 
Weak Voter Interest
 Most political professionals here acknowledge that voter interest and support for particular candidates remain soft, in spite of early polls showing some popularity for Mr. Tsongas, who lives in neighboring Massachusetts.
Mr. Tsongas's advertising, intended in part to leaven his serious image -- "He's no movie star," his new advertisement begins -- sends the same can-do message the other Democrats are striving for. "This is someone who gets things done in Washington," said Mike Shea, a media adviser to Mr. Tsongas. "And that's a significant point."
Similarly, Mr. Clinton's advisers are seeking to tap into the anger of the economically depressed by appealing to the middle-class frustrations they detected when they conducted interviewed groups of New Hampshire voters. "They are demanding that politicians answer their questions and tell them what you want to do," said Mitchell Schwartz, who runs Mr. Clinton's New Hampshire campaign.
Mr. Kerrey's advertisements, filmed just this week, appeared little more than a day later. In them, he assails President Bush and, by implication, any Democrat who would do less than he would. "You've got an obligation to be explicit about it, not just to put yur ideas out there, but to say how they're different from the others," said Mr. Shore, Mr. Kerrey's adviser.
Mr. Harkin, who appeals to the party's left wing, is probably the most clearly defined of the five remaining major candidates, although he has not appeared on paid television. "Tom Harkin hasn't really changed what he has been saying from the very beginning," said Kathi Rogers, Mr. Harkin's New Hampshire campaign director. "He's saying, ' "If you want real substantial change, I'm the one to vote for.' "
Each of these candidates must find a way to appeal to skeptical and economically preoccupied voters like Helena Caldwell, who has worked at an electrical plant in Hillsborough for 20 years.
"I don't really know the fellow," she said as Bob Kerrey ambled by. "Hey, they're all alike. I'd like to see them talk about the economy. It's getting bad and people are worried."

HEADLINE: HAITIAN COMMUNIST SPEAKS OF HEALING

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Playing down his longtime Communist affiliation, a compromise candidate for the post of Prime Minister has begun efforts to reassure a torn society that his primary task, if he is ratified for the job, will be to tap talent from across the political spectrum and to heal the country's wounds.
In his first interview since his nomination was approved Wednesday in diplomat-brokered negotiations with the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Rene Theodore, Haiti's Communist Party leader, described a political evolution that he said had led him to favor "modern capitalism." He promised that any government he formed would be one of true national reconciliation. 
 "Haiti sometimes sends very strong images abroad, and often we may seem anachronistic," Mr. Theodore said of his country's violent, running political crisis and the choice of a Communist as a compromise leader. "It is true that Communism is not on today's agenda, but it is not a Communist power that we would be installing in Haiti.
"We must consider the task before us one of national salvation, of rescuing the nation. For this, we must bring together all of the parties represented in the National Assembly. One could not think of forming any government that was not one of national reconciliation."
 
'The World Has Changed'
 Asked of the widely noted irony of the United States, which has pledged to support him if he is approved, backing a Communist after decades of determined efforts to contain the spread of Marxism in the hemisphere, Mr. Theodore, who said he studied history and politics at the Institute of Social Sciences in Moscow during his years of exile, smiled gently.
"Perhaps it is because the world has changed and the United States finds itself in an ideal position to support the social and economic development of our country," Mr. Theodore said, speaking in French during the interview on Friday in his sparely furnished home in the suburb of Petion-Ville. "We hope they will now be able to do so in accordance with their ideals."
Even as a debate raged in the country's Parliament, with one angry rightist deputy waving a pistol in the air to denounce a political settlement he said was being imposed by the United States, Mr. Theodore, a 51-year-old mathematician who has spent most of his adult life in exile, expressed confidence that he would be ratified in the job in a vote next week.
"I think that I have every chance of being approved," he said. Of the conservative elite, he said: "I have no concerns on that score. The positions we have taken since 1986 allow me to believe that no one would have any reticence about me."
 
Chosen Over Conservative
 Mr. Theodore was selected by Father Aristide after leaders of the National Assembly proposed him, along with a conservative politician, each of them among the exiled President's strongest critics, to form a new Government.
Once formed, the new Government has been promised international support for the quick lifting of a three-month trade embargo and the reconstruction of a shattered economy.
Under the settlement brokered by the Organization of American States, Father Aristide, the leftist populist who was the country's first democratically elected President, would return to Haiti as head of state from exile in Venezuela. Father Aristide was overthrown in a violent military coup on Sept. 30.
Although he retains much of the popular support that enabled him to win 67 percent of the popular vote in the country's December 1990 elections, Father Aristide was overthrown in part because of concerns among politically active people over his commitment to the Constitution, and growing fears of political and class-based violence, which many believe the President endorsed.
Mr. Theodore denounced what he said often appeared to be Father Aristide's guiding belief: "What the people want, God wants."
"One cannot gauge at every moment, either by elections or referendum what the people want," he said. "The work of government is much more complex than that."
To gain the confidence of the army, Mr. Theodore said, he has pledged himself to noninterference in its internal affairs, which he defined as "discipline, promotion and hierarchy," three areas in which Father Aristide's Government frequently became involved.
Despite his often stern criticisms, Mr. Theodore said he would have no difficulty sharing power with Father Aristide, who was widely accused of accumulating the functions of the President, Prime Minister and even individual ministerial portfolios during his nearly eight months in office.
"The Haitian Constitution is very clear on this," he said. "You have a head of government who manages the public administration and a President who assures the continuity of state and serves as the moral guarantor of engagements taken vis-a-vis the republic and the society."

HEADLINE: With Return of a Mob War, Prosecutor Presses for Peace

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Faced with a deadly end to a holiday truce in New York City's most vicious mob war in 30 years, the Brooklyn District Attorney's office has recruited up to 120 Federal, state and city officers to try to push the battling factions into a new peace, a law-enforcement official said yesterday.
In the last seven months, since the struggle in the Colombo crime family broke into the open, there have been 10 attempted killings of members of two factions, leaving six men dead and seven people wounded, including at least four innocent bystanders. 
 After the fifth killing, District Attorney Charles J. Hynes subpoenaed 96 suspected mobsters to testify before a grand jury. There was a 30-day respite in the battle.
But last Tuesday, the peace was shattered when a captain in one of the factions, Nicholas Grancio, was gunned down in Gravesend.
 
'Economic Pressure'
 Mr. Hynes declined to comment yesterday. But another law-enforcement official, who demanded anonymity, confirmed that the task force was being organized, as first reported yesterday in The Daily News.
"It's the latest in a series of steps to create economic pressure on the warring factions so that they'll have to accept a truce," the official said.
"The first step was the subpoenas and the roundup of identifiable members," he continued. "Then, when Grancio was killed, a second phase went into effect -- an intensification of surveillance.
"Now there's another phase, a coordinated Federal, state and city task force in which more than 100 law-enforcement agents will be employed" to clamp down on the Colombo family's loan sharking, betting and numbers operations. The official said the task force would tighten surveillance on the four other crime families in the city so that the bosses of those groups would also pressure the Colombos.
The Colombo family, long known among authorities and in Mafia councils as erratic, was named for Joseph Colombo, its leader during the last major outbreak of mob violence in the city during the 1960's. After Mr. Colombo was shot at an Italian-American civil rights rally in 1971, Carmine Persico emerged as the family boss.
 
Hits and Misses
 Mr. Persico, 58 years old, is currently serving 100 years in prison for racketeering and bribery. In 1989, he named Victor J. Orena, 57, of Cedarhurst, L.I., as acting boss. "He believed he could trust him," the law-enforcement official said.
"Also in prison is Carmine Persico's son, Alphonse; he's supposed to get out in '93," the official continued. "Carmine's plan was that Alphonse would take over the family. But once Orena got the taste of honey, he not only took things over, he stopped the flow of tribute to the Persico faction."
Mr. Orena was the target of the war's first ambush. On June 20, he came home unexpectedly "and spotted a hit team from the Persico faction," the official said. He fled, and no shots were fired.
Then, on Nov. 18, Gregory Scarpa, a Persico soldier, escaped injury when shots were fired at his two-car caravan in Bay Ridge. On Nov. 24, Henry Smurra, a Persico loan shark, was shot to death in his car in Sheepshead Bay.
And in the next 20 days members of the rival groups were shot and killed, shot and wounded, shot and missed. People near them were also hurt.
Mr. Grancio, an Orena faction captain, was killed while sitting in his recreational vehicle in Gravesend -- ending the 30-day truce.

HEADLINE: Under Political Steam, Health-Care Issue Gains Wider Support in Congress

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
In the last few months health care has jumped to the front of the Presidential race and to the top of the Congressional agenda, with proposals as radical as the creation of a national health insurance plan like Canada's gaining momentum.
Yet for all the commotion, most Congressional leaders expect only modest change this year. They say the issue is so complex and the differences among members so wide that it will take months of study and hearings to arrive at a consensus. Stop-gap measures, like an expansion of Medicaid and Medicare benefits for pregnant women and children or tax incentives to expand private health insurance, are picking up strong support, but the leaders say such changes are only the beginning. 
 Both Democratic and Republican spokesmen on health care say the escalating campaign debate has set a course for more far-reaching plans in the next Congress and Administration, whether they are Republican or Democratic.
"Elections are an inducement to action," said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, who noted that many lawmakers were being forced to wrestle with the health-care issue for the first time. "There's been a dramatic change in popular interest and political concern about the problem."
 
Bipartisan Effort Predicted
 Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, predicted that political pressure would help forge a bipartisan majority this year to pass a limited measure that he supports. The legislation would expand tax deductions for health insurance for the self-employed and provide continuity of coverage for workers changing jobs. "Later, we'll federalize low-income access to medical care," he said.
The recession has aggravated the problem of how to extend access to health care to the 35 million Americans who are uninsured or underinsured, without breaking the Federal treasury and fueling inflation. Among the uninsured are 450,000 pregnant women, increasing the likelihood that they will not seek the prenatal care they may need to avert premature delivery, an important factor in birth defects.
New layoffs have increased the number of uninsured in recent months, while the more gradual employment trend away from manufacturing toward the service sector has put workers in jobs that are less likely to provide coverage. And as fewer workers are insured, fewer of their dependents are covered.
 
Town Meetings by Democrats
 At the same time, the costs of health care have outstripped the rate of inflation by a considerable margin for more than a decade, making it more difficult for individuals and businesses to afford the health insurance plans they are enrolled in. The Commerce Department estimated that Americans spent about $817 billion on health care in 1991, about 11 percent more than in 1990.
House Democrats will try to exploit growing public concerns by holding 200 town meetings around the country on Tuesday night to publicize their various health-care proposals and put President Bush on the defensive. Representative Vic Fazio of California, the organizer of the events, said: "It's going to be a very interesting and educational campaign debate, which will be the precursor of real fundamental change in the aftermath of the campaign."
Democrats and Republicans have been jockeying for advantage on health care since last November when Senator Harris Wofford, a Democrat, defeated former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in a special Pennsylvania election largely by contending that all Americans deserved decent medical care. Only hours after the polls closed, dozens of Senate and House members, including an unusual number of Republicans, made speeches criticizing President Bush for moving too slowly to develop a health-care policy.
In the last week, Administration officials responded to the pressure by embracing a number of proposals already outlined by Republican members of Congress, including restrictions on medical malpractice lawsuits and the establishment of new incentives for people to enroll in prepaid group health plans like health maintenance organizations.
Labor Secretary Lynn Martin and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, sharpened the debate on Thursday when they charged that a plan favored by Senator Mitchell to force employers to provide health insurance would devastate small businesses and cause higher unemployment.
Senator Mitchell shrugged off Administration criticism, saying he was happy President Bush was responding to the political pressure. "Just getting the President to discuss the issue is an accomplishment," he said, adding that another dip in the President's popularity would increase the possibility that major insurance legislation could be passed and signed this year.
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, has been pressing Democratic Presidential candidates to hone their message on the issue by organizing two debates exclusively devoted to health care. In the first, only Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts offered detailed plans. But Mr. Rockefeller hopes the other candidates will be forced to tackle the issue before the next debate.
 
30 Plans Before Congress
 "You have to think of building political pressure through the political process," said Mr. Rockefeller, who is sponsoring a bill that would phase in requirements for employers to provide health insurance or pay an additional payroll tax to finance Government-supplied insurance. "I think the Presidential campaign helps the legislative prospects on health care."
Of the more than 30 health-care insurance bills now before Congress, only a couple that offer tax incentives to extend coverage appear to have a real chance for quick enactment. National health insurance has substantial support in the House but far less than it needs to win in the Senate. Plans like Mr. Mitchell's and Mr. Rockefeller's are gaining momentum, but opposition from Congressional conservatives and the White House is stiff.
One viable bill, proposed by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and supported by the Republican Senate leadership, would provide employers and employees who cannot deduct health insurance costs with tax incentives to buy coverage, and encourage small businesses to form insurance-buying groups to limit rate increases. It would also put controls on medical malpractice suits to lower insurance costs of doctors and hospitals. These costs are usually passed on to patients.
"The Chafee bill can be passed," said Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, "but it won't end the debate."
Mr. Packwood predicted that within three years the Government would enact either national health insurance or sweeping mandates requiring businesses to provide and pay for the health insurance of their employees. "The battle will come between those two plans," he said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Health Care: Four Plans"
 
Congress is considering more than 30 health care insurance proposals, which fall into four basic categories.
 
EMPLOYER MANDATES
 
A number of bills would require private industries to insure their employees.
 
One approach, sponsored by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, would offer private companies a choice of providing coverage to employees and their families or making a contribution to an expanded public insurance plan. The mandated coverage would be phased in over four years for businesses with between 25 and 99 workers; for businesses with fewer than 25 workers, the phase-in would be five years.
 
MEDICAID AND MEDICARE EXPANSION
 
Some proposals would permit the unemployed to purchase Medicare, while others would eliminate the 24-month waiting period for Medicare benefits for the disabled or make early retirees eligible for coverage. A few plans would eliminate limits on Medicaid benefits to the disabled, aged and children.
 
One proposal, sponsored by Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, would permit people to buy Medicare at age 55, 10 years before they would be otherwise eligible.
 
Another, introduced by Representative Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, would extend Medicare benefits for prenatal, child and preventive health care.
 
TAX INCENTIVES
 
Several proposals would use the federal tax system to encourage more companies to provide health insurance and aid more individuals to purchase it. Some would grant low-income families tax credits to subsidize their expenditures on health insurance, while others would permit taxpayers to deduct more health care costs than they can now.
 
A proposal, offered by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, would provide employers and employees who cannot deduct health insurance costs with tax incentives to buy coverage. The bill, endorsed by the Senate Republican leadership, would also attempt to reform malpractice law to lower insurance rates for health providers. President Bush favors the tax approach.
 
UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE
 
Several proposals, given little chance of passage, would replace all private and public health insurance coverage with a nationalized universal health insurance program.
 
Some are modeled after Canadian and Western European plans, in which the government pays for the medical care of individuals who continue to use their own private doctors; others would provide a mix of Government payment for private care and Government-established services like the British National Health Service.
 
Still others would mix Government and private financing by combining an expansion of Medicaid with mandated employer-provided insurance.

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Donors Help Despite Pain of the Recession

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
The recession and the suffering it is causing are cited by many of the donors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund as their reasons for giving. What is more surprising, perhaps, is that scores of donations received so far have come from casualties of the economic slump.
"As a victim of the downsizing of one of this country's major corporations, this is not the best of holiday seasons for me," wrote a Manhattan woman who gave $100. "And yet I am well aware that it is so much worse for so many other New Yorkers. So instead of feeling sorry for myself, I decided it was more important to focus on those who could really benefit from some help." 
 The nation's unemployment rate rose to a five-and-a-half year high of 7.1 percent in December, according to figures released by the Labor Department on Friday. The Northeast continued to be the country's hardest hit region -- with an unemployment rate of 7.4 percent -- and New York State's jobless rate remained above the national average, rising one-tenth of a percentage point, to 8.1 percent, last month.
Despite the financial and psychological hardships those numbers only hint at, many contributors to the Neediest Cases said their difficulties have made them realize that basics they once took for granted are truly blessings.
 
More Conscious of Problems
 "I'm sorry I can't be as generous as last year but I haven't been fully employed since then and my prospects don't glitter," wrote a New Jersey man who gave $30. "Still, I have a place to call home and enough so as not to go hungry. I hope this amount helps and that next year I can send last year's level or more."
Another New Jersey man, who gave $100, echoed those comments: "I feel especially sorry for people who need help this year since I am unemployed and much more conscious of what can happen."
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases has -- through two world wars, through the roaring 20's and the Great Depression, and through the booming 80's and the slumping 90's -- enabled millions of people to lend a helping hand to New York's sick, poor and disabled.
A Manhattan man said that he had been out of work so long that "I think I'm no longer part of the statistics of the unemployed." In a note attached to his $250 contribution, he wrote: "On the so-called trendy Upper West Side where I live -- among the sushi restaurants, the avant-garde clothing stores and the exorbitant toy stores -- everyday I see the homeless, the impoverished, the lonely old folks, all who have somehow slipped through the the government's fiscal safety net. But let us not forget the proverb:
'I cried because I had no shoes; then I met a man with no feet.' "

Working-Class Pair Now Reigns in Skating

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Jan. 11

 BODY:
The marinated chicken sandwiches are waiting for Calla Urbanski back at Kid Shelleen's restaurant in Delaware. So are the customers, who miss the tiny blonde waitress with the hoarse Chicago accent.
"She scoots around pretty good," Russell Jennings, one of the cooks at Kid Shilleen's, said over the telephone. "Those little legs can move fast." 
 Those "little legs" will be back toting trays in the Trolley Square section of Wilmington, perhaps later this week. Better times are coming, but Calla Urbanski still needs the money, and she is not too proud to admit it.
Instead of working at Kid Shelleen's last week, Urbanski captured the national figure-skating pairs championship along with her partner, Rocky Marval, who has been known to drive a truck when not skating.
 
No Longer a Novelty Act
 The waitress and the truck driver. They were a novelty item right up until Thursday night. They started in third place, but a few chords into Thus Spake Zarathustra, she came out of her throw triple loop in perfect form, with a huge smile on her face, and as her coach, Ron Ludington, said later, "They were electric."
A few minutes later, Calla and Rocky accepted their gold medals and became the biggest sentimental American favorites going into the Winter Games in France next month -- "Do You Believe in Miracles?" crossed with Mary Lou Retton.
In the movie, Calla would be played by Cissy Spacek or Sally Fields, but with his polished, well-coiffed manner, Rocky is more Michael J. Fox or John Ritter than Sylvester Stallone. And the truck he occasionally drives is part of a company that he and his brother own, that is to say in collaboration with a bank or two.
But call them the waitress and the truck driver, anyway. They are graphic examples of the current success of figure skating, which will be given approximately 33 per cent of the air time by CBS from Albertville.
The money is so good in figure skating right now that the federation can support enough skaters to insure depth and competition. People from working-class backgrounds like Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan and Todd Eldredge have moved to the top of the American program, and Urbanski has stayed in skating 10 years past the time most female skaters are subtly told to let somebody else have a chance.
 
Skaters From Working Class
 The 31-year-old waitress and the 26-year-old truck driver have both felt the pinch of the recession first-hand rather than hearing about it from their parents.
Rocky is really Rocco Marvaldi from New Egypt, Pa., whose family has been in the meat-packing business for generations. He recalled being rejected by a tony Philadelphia skating club when he was 10.
He also recalled his nose being broken three times -- once in a fight, once on a left hook from his own father ("a little disciplinary action," he said) and once in a 70-m.p.h. dirt-bike collision that left him without memory for three days. He nearly lost his left eye in that one.
 
Buttons for Donations
 When Marval and Urbanski were first put together five years ago, he warned her not to hit his nose while they were performing. The match didn't take but they were reunited two years ago, two determined adults who were ready for each other.
To pay for their partnership, they created buttons that said "I Helped Urbanski & Marval Go for the Gold," and distributed them in bars and restaurants in Delaware -- "for a donation, not for sale," Urbanski noted.
On Friday, the new champions talked with gratitude about how the children at Gauger Junior High School in Newark had raised $4,000 for them. They both conceded that their four and a half minutes on Thursday night had raised the stakes.
 
'We Have a Title Now'
 "We have a title now," Urbanski said, hopeful of exhibitions and circuits in the near future. "We can get a few more zeroes."
Meanwhile, Urbanski's size 2 or 4 tan slacks and green shirt are waiting for her at Kid Shelleen's this week.
"Will the tips be good?" somebody asked her.
"They'd better be," she said crisply. "That's the reason I'm going back."

The Stomach Thing

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Historians will analyze for years to come the causes and effects of the President's recent intestinal flu, or what Mr. Bush has begun to call "the stomach thing." Some have blamed fatigue, others jet lag, and a few have even posited that Mr. Bush intentionally fell ill to win sympathy from the Japanese, a kind of Bush-bugged-himself scenario that, if true, failed.
Americans considering protectionism, free trade and sushi watched the President keel over on the dais and shouted, "Lose the sea urchin, George." They were unaware that the Japanese had feted the President with the sort of country club cuisine that reached its zenith during the Administration of Gerald Ford: to wit, cold salmon, clear soup and the ubiquitous medallions of beef -- a dinner as much like a traditional Japanese banquet as cars made in Detroit are like what American consumers want to buy. 
 In fact, certain reports over the last three days suggest that the President's illness originated with a 3-year-old with a runny nose named Samantha in Bethesda, Md.
Samantha contracted the stomach flu in early December, a case made notable mainly by the fact that she only made it as far as the toy box when disaster struck, the unfortunate triumph of necessity over locale that may have prefigured the Bush incident at the banquet. Samantha then gave the flu to her brother Jonathan, and he to their mother, a Democratic lobbyist for various liberal organizations.
Jonathan gave it to his friend Alexander, whose father, a middle-level official in the Commerce Department, frequently used the Stairmaster at the gym just after the squash partner of one of the Secret Service agents assigned to the Japanese trip. All were later stricken, but not before the agent had stood next to the President with one of those little things in his ear, looking silly.
This is what is called the trickle-up effect, and is not unlike the song about the knee bone being connected to the thigh bone or those endless begat sections of the Bible. The scenario seems plausible since this is the way the stomach flu has traveled through most of America in the last six weeks. In fact, when they first saw the film of the President pitching over and heard of his symptoms, roughly a million people, Republicans and Democrats alike, struck themselves in the forehead and yelled, "That was the thing that I got from Phil just before the holidays!"
Mr. Bush's bout with the flu recalled his handling of the recession. He got it after everyone else did and he kept trying to pretend it wasn't that bad. When Mr. Bush suggested that he had only grossed out the dais and scared the bejesus out of his wife to get attention, Samantha's mother, for example, who had spent an entire week doing laundry after her children got the flu, found herself out of sympathy with him, a feeling that only grew when she was questioned by the F.B.I. and asked for the names of those in Samantha's preschool class and Gymboree group.
It is too late to tell whether the flu outbreak affected the outcome of the trip to Japan, or if it would have been just as big a bust if Mr. Bush had cleaned up his medallions and moved on to the passion fruit dessert and a splash of decaf. The illness did provide some public moments in New Hampshire for Vice President Dan Quayle, currently riding the crest of an amended American standard for high officials that, taken from the Latin, translates roughly as "Not half as bad as we originally thought."
What remains unclear is whether the President will use the stomach thing to boost his re-election chances by presenting it as an indelible link between himself and ordinary Americans, not unlike that magic moment when he discovered he was out of socks -- "Barbara, how in blazes do you always manage to let the dryer eat just one of each pair?!"-- and hightailed it over to J. C. Penney.
"I shared your pain," he could tell the nation. "Not to mention a few other piggy things I think we'd all prefer to forget."
A moment of disaster could become a defining moment, not only for Mr. Bush, but for the future course of American politics, in which we accept our national leaders as human beings.
A President as sick as the rest of us: it resonates.

HEADLINE: Power Struggle

BYLINE: BY SAM HOWE VERHOVEK; Sam Howe Verhovek is a reporter in the Albany bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
AS THE GREAT WHALE River rises east out of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada, its broad sandy shores quickly give way to a carpet of light-green lichen studded with granite outcroppings. Beyond the banks lies a vast expanse of black spruce and tamarack, great coniferous forests broken here and there by lakes and bogs and kettle ponds. In winter, the taiga can be harsh and remorseless, a region racked by "wind, snow and natural violence of every sort," as an adventurer described it a half-century ago. But it is also a landscape that teems with life in fall and spring, when enormous herds of caribous stomp across the earth and millions of migratory birds tarry in the estuaries of James and Hudson Bays, some stopping to double their weight as they feast on eelgrass and coastal shrimp before flying as far south as Tierra del Fuego. It is quiet in summer: on an August evening there is utter silence in the northern Quebec bush, save for the rippling of the river or the honking of a pair of geese overhead in a salmon-colored sky.
This subarctic wilderness is, in any season, an unlikely subject of an international controversy. But that is precisely what it has become hundreds of miles away, in southern Quebec and in New York State's capital, Albany, where the central question about the Great Whale River basin is this: Should large parts of it be underwater?
Hydro-Quebec, a utility owned by the province of Quebec, envisions flooding the Great Whale as the second of three phases in a planned hydroelectric power system of colossal proportions. To harness the kinetic energy in 20 wild rivers, Hydro-Quebec plans to erect three dozen huge dams and hundreds of dikes across the taiga, ultimately redrawing terrain in an area the size of France. 
 Affecting the regions east of James Bay and southeast of Hudson Bay, the James Bay development project would be one of the largest hydroelectric complexes in the world, churning turbines with a dozen times the force of Niagara Falls. It would easily rank as one of the largest construction projects ever undertaken.
The work already completed in the first phase of the project, south of the Great Whale basin and known as the LaGrande River complex, used enough fill to build the Great Pyramid of Cheops 80 times over. A feat like diverting the Caniapiscau River, so that it flowed west into James Bay, rather than northeast into Ungava Bay, as it had for eons, was considered a routine engineering matter, hardly worthy of comment -- until 1984, that is, when 10,000 migratory caribous died in its raging waters.
In Phase 2, Hydro-Quebec intends to push north into the Great Whale area and, in Phase 3, plans to divert the Nottaway and the Rupert Rivers into the Broadback River, storing the water in seven new reservoirs, sending it through 11 powerhouses and transforming the lower parts of the diverted rivers into dry bedrock. With all phases completed, sometime after the turn of the century, the project would produce 26,400 megawatts of electrical power, of which 15 percent would be available for export.
But Quebec's expansive plans are drawing bitter resistance from native Cree Indians, concerned about preserving the land and traditional Indian ways of life, as well as from environmentalists, who warn of impending ecological disaster. And, while the Quebecois tend to see hydropower as the province's pathway to economic, and possibly political, independence from the rest of Canada, there is a competing claim. The native people in the north -- there are about 12,000 Crees and 6,000 Inuit Eskimos living in the James Bay region -- say that if Francophone Quebec gains recognition as a "distinct society," they should be granted the same recognition and more authority over what happens to their land. Indeed, the Canadian Government lent renewed force to their argument last month, when it said it would grant the Inuits control over nearly two-thirds of the Northwest Territories, an area to be known as Nunavut.
And James Bay is the object of an increasingly fierce debate in New York, where Gov. Mario M. Cuomo must decide within the next year whether to go ahead with a 20-year, $19.5 billion contract to buy some of this power from the Canadian north.
At first glance, the agreement seems like the perfect match of Quebec's supply and New York's demand. By early next century, if the plan goes through, 10 to 12 percent of the state's electricity (compared with about 2 percent today) would come soaring down high-voltage lines from the taiga and into electrical outlets from Massena to Manhattan to Montauk.
Yet opponents have raised a number of disturbing questions that already have forced New York officials to postpone the decision once. Is the importing of "clean" hydropower the salvation of a state that has labored unsuccessfully to comply with Federal clean-air standards? Or is it simply tantamount to exporting environmental and cultural destruction to the taiga, the ultimate not-in-my-backyard solution to New York's energy needs? Will energy demand truly rise by 2 to 3 percent a year, as was forecast a few years ago, before the growth in demand slowed in the face of the current recession? And, finally, should New York not in any case try harder to meet its energy needs through conservation?
By virtue of its financial clout, New York will cast what many analysts say is the decisive vote on Great Whale. Hydro-Quebec officials insist that they will go ahead with the $50 billion to $60 billion project no matter what New York decides. The only effect, they say, will be to delay it for a few years. But less-interested observers doubt that Quebec can proceed without the contract and the capital it represents. "The whole essence of James Bay 2 depends on export sales," says Ihor Kots, managing director of Canadian Bond Rating Service Inc., the largest credit-rating service in Canada. "The electricity demand in Quebec won't be sufficient to take up the capacity for years to come. If there is not demand from elsewhere, it would add considerably to the financial risk."
WHILE HYDROPOWER HAS LONG BEEN TOUTED AS clean and cheaper than any other available source of power, virtually everyone involved in the James Bay dispute agrees that this is no longer completely true. Given current long-range projections for energy costs, the New York State Energy Office says the Quebec power would actually cost slightly more than electricity generated from oil, coal and natural gas. This could change, however, if New York, as some state officials predict, succeeds in negotiating a lower price with Hydro-Quebec this year.
For the moment, though, the debate about James Bay turns primarily on environmental questions. Proponents of hydropower purchases, including the New York Power Authority, warn of increased fossil-fuel pollution if the contract is rejected. They cite an energy office study that shows emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide rising by 7 percent, 10.4 percent and 6.1 percent respectively in New York, without the hydropower. And, they point out, some of this pollution would be transported across the border and deposited on Canadian territory.
Critics insist that the only sure way to reduce pollution and avoid environmental destruction is to conserve energy use. Jeffrey Wollock, the executive director of the New York City-based James Bay Defense Coalition, a group representing 24 environmental and native rights organizations, calls the James Bay contracts "a case of exporting New York's environmental problems to another part of the planet. This is not environmentalism, but pseudo-environmentalism."
Hydro-Quebec's brochures stress its commitment to building "in harmony with nature," and feature pictures of Hydro-Quebec workers carefully airlifting animals to safety from islands created by the flooding. Nevertheless, the utility is fighting an uphill battle to improve its image, especially after the caribou disaster in the Caniapiscau River.
The mass drowning happened to occur the first year the reservoirs were full enough to require controlled releases down the riverway. Hydro-Quebec claims that, because of the torrential rains that year, the caribous very likely would have died anyway, and notes that the overall caribou population in the James Bay region has increased in the last 20 years. But the natives and some biologists insist that the mass drownings would never have occurred if the river had been left alone.
The most profound, but also most problematic, questions involve long-term threats to the James Bay region as the subarctic habitat is altered on such a dramatic scale.
Hydro-Quebec insists that the overall impact will be minimal, that humans and animals will adapt and that no animal species is threatened with extinction. Environmentalists paint drastic scenarios. Jan Beyea, chief scientist at the National Audubon Society, has concluded that "in terms of wildlife and habitat, the devastation of James Bay is the northern equivalent of the destruction of the tropical rain forest." Others say New York should back out of James Bay simply to avoid becoming "an accomplice to the crime," in the words of William B. Hoyt, a Buffalo Democrat who is chairman of the State Assembly's energy committee and a principal opponent.
The New York Power Authority has vigorously insisted to Hydro-Quebec that New York wants a proper environmental review of the project, and Canadian Federal officials have also vowed to monitor Quebec's plans. Still, some state officials have protested that cancellation of the contracts on ecological grounds would amount to drastic interference in Canada's internal affairs. But that is precisely what the Cree opponents are requesting.
"How can we expect the Quebec government to be fair?" asks Chief Robbie Dick, the band, or tribal, chief for the Crees of Whapmagoostui (also called Kuujjuarapik, in Inuit), the village at the mouth of the Great Whale River. "They are the proponents and the analyzers, the judge and the jury."
The James Bay dispute involves starkly conflicting visions of the landscape. "Who would consider the total elimination of the Hudson River?" Matthew Coon Come, the chief of the Grand Council of the Cree, asked a United Nations panel last year. "Yet great rivers have been destroyed where my people live."
Yet Robert Bourassa, the Quebec premier and original mastermind of James Bay, looks at the wilderness and sees kilowatts vital to the province's future. Northern Quebec, he wrote in a 1985 book, "Power from the North," is a "vast hydroelectric project-in-the-bud, and every day millions of potential kilowatt hours flow downhill and out to the sea. What a waste!"
THERE IS ONE POINT ON WHICH JUST ABOUT everybody involved in the clash over James Bay concurs: Hydro-Quebec knows how to build hydroelectric power plants, gargantuan structures that attract astounded engineers from all over the world.
There is the enormous dam, known as LaGrande 2, whose 16 turbines 450 feet below the surface of the water generate enough thrust to power 50 Boeing 747's at takeoff. And there is LaGrande 2-A, called the "baby sister," a generating station still under construction, whose 2,000 megawatts will be more powerful than the combined output of all the gas- and oil-fired plants and the single nuclear reactor in Quebec. (A megawatt is a million watts, or the power needed to light 10,000 100-watt electrical bulbs. A suburban shopping mall with 100 stores or so draws roughly 3 megawatts, the towers of the World Trade Center use about 32 megawatts each.) A few miles from LaGrande 2-A, across the reservoir, is a giant spillway blasted out of the rock and capable of carrying the combined flows of all the rivers of Europe (excluding the territory of the former Soviet Union).
Sixty-eight people died in construction accidents during the 13 years it took to build the first phase of the LaGrande project. Hydro-Quebec is quick to assert, however, that given the 150 million man-hours involved, this actually represents one of the best safety records for a major construction project in North American history.
Hydro-Quebec, which generates 95 percent of the province's electrical power and accounts for 5 percent of gross domestic product, has become a kind of adopted stepchild of Bourassa, the Quebec premier. He was in office to make the 1971 announcement kicking off the first phase of the project and, after an interval in political exile, returned to announce James Bay 2 in 1988.
The fantastic plans the Premier has already made for James Bay pale beside his grandest vision. In a project that would cost well more than $100 billion and that is not likely to be taken seriously until decades into the next century, if ever, Bourassa has advocated transforming James Bay into an enormous freshwater lake by erecting a dike across its mouth -- a distance of 100 miles. From there the water would be pumped through a series of enormous channels to the arid stretches of the Great Plains, the American Southwest and California. Bourassa has referred to his plan simply as the "Grand Canal."
STILL, WHILE NO ONE questions Hydro-Quebec's technical prowess, the company has enjoyed far less success in assuaging concerns about the environmental toll. These range from the still-disputed caribou drowning in 1984 to undisputed releases of toxic methyl mercury, which have led to limits on the consumption of fish in the region, a staple in the diets of the Crees and Inuits.
As vegetation decomposes underwater, bacteria transform mercury -- a common and harmless component of soil and vegetation -- into a toxic methylated form that is absorbed by fish, which then become dangerous to eat. A 1984 study of the Cree village of Chisasibi, downstream from the LaGrande complex, found that 64 percent of the residents had methyl mercury levels classified as unsafe by the World Health Organization. Methyl mercury is thought to cause numerous birth defects, including palsy and retardation, as well as stillbirths and convulsions.
Hydro-Quebec officials concede that methyl mercury will continue to be a problem for 25 to 30 years at LaGrande and, if it is flooded, Great Whale. Yet, through medication and strict limits on the consumption of predatory fish like trout and pike, they say, the incidence of unsafe mercury levels among residents of Chisasibi has been reduced to 30 percent since the 1984 study.
But the talk of limits on fish angers the Crees. "Telling us that we'll be O.K. if we don't eat fish is like telling us that we will be O.K. if we just cut our own legs off," says Andrew Natachequan, a Cree elder in the village of Whapmagoostui.
Hydro-Quebec has invested $18.5 million in studies for a methyl-mercury advisory committee. But other than coming up with the consumption limits and suggesting the Crees might turn a profit by grinding fish into commercial fertilizer, the committee has been largely stumped.
Longer-range questions about the effect of the construction on the James Bay habitat remain, in many ways, unresolved.
A number of Canadian and American environmental organizations argue that cumulative changes will have unpredictable and in some cases devastating consequences. For one thing, the James Bay project has already succeeded in reversing the normal flow of water in many of the dammed rivers. Water now runs faster in the winter, corresponding to the peak demand for electricity in Quebec (where more than 70 percent of homes use electric heat), and slower at other times as the water is stored in reservoirs. This means that coastal marshes and tidal flats have fewer nutrients in spring and fall, the times of heaviest migration, when many birds must eat voraciously to prepare for their flights. The scene at James Bay during such times has been described as a "rite of gluttony."
These migrants "may have no substitute habitat if key sites in James Bay are destroyed," according to a study of the area released in November by the National Audubon Society. The report further states that "many species of migratory shore birds would be severely threatened, possibly even to extinction, if a crucial stopover area were damaged."
Gaetan Guertin, director of environmental studies for Hydro-Quebec, asserts that any animals displaced by the flooding or the man-made reservoirs would thrive elsewhere in the area. While acknowledging that the company does not keep specific counts of species populations in the James Bay region, he insists that little damage will be done. "We have enough data, and we're very confident in the quality of our data, that our predictions will be borne out," he says. "They show that it's not a disaster there."
Hydro-Quebec further notes that all three projects together would flood only about 1.5 percent of the dry land in the James Bay region. But that figure still amounts to an area nearly the size of New Jersey, and it does not include the lakes and ponds swallowed up by the new reservoirs. Finally, for all the concern about flooding, the project's many diversions would also turn hundreds of miles of roaring riverways into dry riverbeds.
THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED IN THE Canadian north races down the transmission lines that stretch like forests of steel across the taiga, into New York State and ultimately across a grid that reaches into every home, apartment, factory and office in the state. Under a 1978 contract with Hydro-Quebec, New York buys anywhere from 800 to 1,000 megawatts during the peak demand period of the year, from April 1 to Nov. 1. The new contracts would extend this arrangement to the year 2018, and add a new year-round commitment of 1,000 megawatts beginning in 1995.
The question of whether New York State "needs" the James Bay hydropower is, on one level, unanswerable. Public utilities have achieved substantial energy savings in recent years through "demand-side management" practices pushed by the chairman of the state's Public Service Commission, Peter A. Bradford. Demand management includes both conservation and the manipulation of rates to discourage use during peak daylight hours and to encourage use during slack times at night.
These measures, coupled with the lengthy recession, have worked. As recently as two and a half years ago, Consolidated Edison, which serves New York City and neighboring Westchester County and is the state's largest utility, was projecting annual consumption increases of between 2 and 3 percent. Now the utility says it will meet all demand growth in coming years through demand management. And one official for the Long Island Lighting Company, at a rate-setting case before the P.S.C. last spring, said the utility appeared to be "reaching the point where we may have too much power," even after the closing of the Shoreham nuclear plant.
But many state energy planners caution that such optimism can extend only for the next few years. After that, with a hoped-for return to robust economic growth and the phasing out of New York's dirtiest fossil-fuel plants, the picture will be far more uncertain. And in any event, they say, even if conservation measures could succeed beyond anyone's wildest imagination, tapping Quebec's hydropower is still a lot better than burning fossil fuels.
And even as total consumption appears to be flattening out, there is another ominous measure of electricity use that keeps rising. That is the figure for "peak demand," which typically comes on a sweltering summer day, when nearly everybody seems to stay close to an air-conditioner. New York State set a new all-time record this July with a peak demand of 26,839 megawatts. Without adequate reserves, officials warn, technicians may some day have no choice but to impose widespread brownouts and blackouts at the worst possible time.
Opponents of the contract are skeptical of this doomsday scenario. In any event, some energy analysts contend it would be cheaper for New York to pay for an energy-conservation program in Quebec and then to import the freed-up electricity than for Hydro-Quebec to build Great Whale.
HARDLY A THOUSAND people live in the wind-swept village at the mouth of the Great Whale River. But in a reflection of the polyglot culture there, it has the distinction of being known by four names: Great Whale, in English; Poste-de-la-Baleine, in French; Whapmagoostui, in Cree; and Kuujjuarapik, in Inuit. Europeans settled there a few hundred years ago -- first arriving as missionaries and traders at the outpost of the Hudson's Bay Company. Another group arrived in the mid-1950's, to help build and maintain a huge airstrip for the Canadian Air Force.
Great Whale is an odd mix in another way. Most people live in trailerlike housing with all the modern conveniences, but they are more likely than not to have a canoe or a tepee in the backyard. And while about half the Cree natives still go miles out into the bush for months at a time to fish, hunt and trap, they often fly out there in floatplanes operated by a Cree-owned airline, Air Wemindje. "It's really a lot easier that way," explains Robbie Dick, the local council chief.
But the placid patterns of life in the village have been shattered in recent years as the Crees and Inuits, alarmed by the LaGrande hydro development to the south, have geared up to fight the Great Whale project. It is in many ways a different battle than the one waged by the Crees and a smaller number of Inuits in the mid-1970's over LaGrande, when no public hearings were held on the project outside of a lawsuit filed by native leaders against Hydro-Quebec. After months of hearings and a trial in which lawyers spoke in French, English, Cree and Inuktituk, the Inuit tongue, a Quebec Superior Court Judge shocked the province by ruling in favor of the natives and ordering a halt to construction.
Within a week, though, an appeals court had overturned the ruling. In 1975, with many natives now accepting the LaGrande project as inevitable, Cree, Inuit and Quebec officials signed the landmark James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. In return for allowing construction to be completed on the first phase, the Crees and Inuits received more than $170 million in land-use compensation, including trapping subsidies, government housing financing, mineral-rights royalties and hospitals -- and even a network of snowmobile trails. The pact also called for an environmental review and consultation with the natives on any future development in the James Bay region.
In light of the agreement, some Quebec officials have suggested that the native peoples' opposition to Great Whale is simply a tactic designed to gain another generous compensation package. But the Crees insist that they were misled about the ecological and sociological effects of LaGrande, which brought into their area tens of thousands of Quebecois workers and, with them, all the attributes -- good and bad -- of modern life. If they had known what was coming, they now say, they would never have signed the agreement.
The Inuits' opposition is not quite so adamant, possibly because they have not been as severely affected by development as have the Crees. While many do indeed object to further development, at least two Inuit communities have elected mayors in the past year who argue that the James Bay project is unstoppable, and that the Inuits should negotiate another deal with Hydro-Quebec.
Curiously, both the Cree and Quebec officials cite the same evidence as proof of their diametrically opposed views on the social effects of development: Chisasibi, the village at the mouth of the LaGrande, 165 miles south of Great Whale.
Development has brought some undeniable benefits to the 2,500 people there, most of them Crees. Infant mortality is significantly down compared with 30 years ago, life expectancy is up and tuberculosis, which used to ravage whole communities, is almost unheard of. Almost everyone lives in comfortable, modern houses; from the air, in fact, Chisasibi looks like a miniature Levittown on the taiga. There is a hockey rink, a post office and a shopping mall.
But there are also alcoholism, drug abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, family violence and suicides, all of which the Crees say scarcely existed a generation ago. And many of the Cree leaders find it distressing that elders and young people alike, once resourceful enough to survive winters in the bush, can now be found idling in the mall, playing checkers or eating junk food.
"What we have said is that yes, our life is in many ways much easier now than it used to be," says Violet Pachanos, elected chief of the Chisasibi band council. "But we are also prey to all the social diseases of the south. We are no longer in control of our lives."
Back in Great Whale, the protests against James Bay have occasionally turned militant, and some leaders have warned they will become increasingly so. For example, in June, a team of Hydro-Quebec engineers who had come for an Inuit-sponsored hearing on the hydroelectric project was blockaded by a crowd of Crees at the Great Whale airport. The officials left on the same plane, after native leaders said they could not guarantee their safety.
The anger so evident in these incidents is also softened by a sense of irony. For example, when asked what kinds of progress had come to his village since he was a boy, Sappa Fleming, the former Mayor of the Inuit in Great Whale, says, "Well, my children can choose from six different kinds of potato chips at the Northern," referring to the local store that is a direct descendant of the Hudson's Bay Company outpost. "I suppose that is a kind of progress."
IN COMING MONTHS, officials and politicians in Quebec and New York will try to balance their best estimates of future electricity demand, based on shaky forecasts, against the expected environmental effects of the James Bay project, which past experience shows are unpredictable. They will try to balance the rights and needs of native people, and of animals with exotic names like the beluga, bufflehead, Eskimo curlew and Hudsonian godwit, against the rights and needs of city dwellers. In the end, they will try to answer one of the basic questions of North American history: Do the land and its natural inhabitants have certain rights that outweigh the demands of urban, industrial society?
Canadian and New York officials will weigh Bourassa's assertion that James Bay represents "the means of liberating Quebec's people," economically and politically, against the observation of the Cree chief, Robbie Dick, that if the Great Whale project comes about, "we'll lose part of our lives, because the land is our life."
The rivers and lakes of northern Quebec can be harnessed to suit the demands of humans and to relieve ecological strains elsewhere. Or the taiga, the largest stretch of wilderness left in eastern North America, can simply be left alone. But in James Bay, you cannot have it both ways.

HEADLINE: No Guts, No Glory: Short-Selling in a Bull Market

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Steven Kibbey of La Jolla, Calif., could be speaking for any number of bearish investors on Wall Street when he described what it has been like in recent weeks to watch the stock market flirt with new highs.
As a person who helps run Centurion Capital's $15 million fund devoted to short-selling stocks and thus an expert at pinpointing overvalued stocks that might be ripe for a corrective decline in price, he watched help lessly as his fund dropped 24 percent last year, versus a 42 percent rise the year before. Many sure-fire bets "went from being overvalued to wildly overvalued to downright silly," he said. "And then they doubled," he added, lest anyone mistake what kind of year 1991 was. 
 Certainly for short-sellers, 1991 will go down as being longer on pain and shorter on gain than any other year since market watchers began keeping track of the shorts' performance. The same trends that produced dazzling gains for investors -- a swift end to the Persian Gulf war and lower interest rates -- devastated the short-sellers.
"Nineteen ninety-one was a difficult year," said Harry Strunk, a Palm Beach investment manager who tracks 24 of the leading short-sellers as part of a larger universe of money managers. Losses ranged from 8.2 percent to 57.4 percent after fees were deducted. "It was the first year since 1985, when I started my index, that they've been down," he said.
Short-sellers are a much misunderstood group that actually helps police the stock markets against stocks that are selling for too much, whatever the reason. To play this risky game, the shorts borrow stock from brokers and immediately sell it at the prevailing price. If they're right about the stock's true worth and it does, in fact, decline, they will be able to buy back the same number of shares at a lower price by the time the borrowed shares need to be returned. If they are wrong and the stock price rises, they can lose their shirts, since they will eventually have to return the borrowed shares no matter what the price.
Over the decades, the strategy had always enjoyed a following among a handful of mavericks. Industry lore has it that Joseph P. Kennedy, the patriarch of the Kennedy clan, increased the family's fortune by shorting stocks during the Depression. But short-selling has only gained popularity since 1983, when investors like the flamboyant Feshbach brothers, Kurt, Joseph and Matthew, of Palo Alto, Calif., and James Chanos, a New York short, gave the maligned specialty its cachet with some savvy trades.
But last year's poor returns have started what could be a long shakeout. At least three portfolio managers appear to be pulling out or winding down.
"I'm out of the business because it's just too painful," said a San Francisco-based newcomer who insisted on anonymity. He recently returned the $1 million he had raised from investors. Paul Sonz, another respected San Francisco manager, is not accepting new money for his short-selling fund. And last year, Neil Dolinsky of Minneapolis cut back his short-selling after a change in heart by one of his major backers.
Still others are having to settle with being shadows of their former selves, most notably the Feshbach brothers. They started 1991 with $800 million in capital, which easily made them the industry's kingpins. Between losses, which approached 60 percent, and redemptions by shareholders in their fund, they are now down to $250 million.
"In 1992, with the market as strong as it is today, we need to tread rather carefully," said Joseph Feshbach. "But in the long run, the types of things we have traditionally shorted, companies that misrepresent their prospects, their potential or their true earnings power are still great prospects to make money on and that's what we'll focus on."
The short-sellers who look the best are those whose losses were only in the single digits: Leo Mandrakos of Mandrakos Capital Management of New York and Benjamin E. Kopin of Lynx Partners in Chicago, whom competitors snipe at by pointing out that he started up last February and thus missed a punishing rally at the end of the gulf war.
Just how much financial muscle the shorts have had in the markets in years past is difficult to assess, though it is clear their power has waned considerably in the last year. At the peak about a year ago, there might have been as much as $30 billion of short positions in United States markets, versus $4 trillion of long positions, according to Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates in New York. Such estimates, however, include all short positions, even those that exist merely to take advantage of price discrepancies in different markets, to bet on takeover fights or to accomplish other objectives that have little to do with making a bearish bet on a particular stock. Of that $30 billion, classic short-sellers, like the Feshbach brothers, probably control less than $2 billion, down from a high of perhaps $3 billion.
This erosion of power is likely to continue, even if the rising markets stabilize, because there are other factors at work that don't augur well for the shorts.
For example, many shorts that correctly bet on companies that went bankrupt, continue to hold the position rather than pay the tax on the gain. But the spate of bankruptcies has fueled speculation in these distressed securities, unexpectedly driving up their prices, catching many short-sellers.
"You have all these poor guys who thought that Continental Airlines, which declared bankruptcy in 1990, could do nothing but go to zero," said Bruce Hauptman, an investment manager in Fairfield, Iowa, who evaluates the performance of short-sellers and other managers who occasionally short stocks. "The stock went from $1 to $5, and they got completely beat up."
At the same time, many shorts are convinced that some large institutional buyers -- Fidelity Investments, Alliance Capital Management and Fred Alger & Company are often mentioned -- have become more brazen about buying stocks that have large short positions in hopes of driving the stock price up and forcing short-sellers to scramble to replace the shares they have borrowed at higher-than-expected prices. "There were always short squeezes in little stocks," said Centurion's Mr. Kibbey. "But this is the first time where it was almost institutionalized."
Shorts point to a public filing on Dec. 30 by an affiliate of Fidelity, the big mutual fund company, as an example of institutional investors squeezing shorts. Though it is nearly impossible to prove, the shorts contend that Fidelity, through its mutual funds, accumulated a large stake in Bolar Pharmaceutical, long a favorite target of the shorts. A spokeswoman for Fidelity said, "We do not engage in short-squeezing. We buy on fundamentals for the long term, and obviously in a strong market like this short-sellers are going to get hurt. It's easy to point the finger at a large mutual fund."
Such comments may signal a shift in the longstanding rhetorical battle between shorts and longs. The shorts were once decried as the bad boys of Wall Street for bad-mouthing battered stocks to drive the price down. Now, it is the shorts who are accusing a posse of big institutions of manipulating the market upward.
"Short-busting has been around for a long time," said Mr. Feshbach. "It was a little more popular in 1991 and apparently more effective. But those kinds of strategies, if they're based on collusive trading, will come to an end and it will be far more painful for the short-buster than for the short-sellers." He and other shorts contend that if buyers holding long positions are artificially driving up the prices of stocks, they may get caught, and suffer large losses when the markets settle down and stocks return to more realistic prices.
Such pressures, imagined or real, are causing even prominent short-sellers, a group that always operated quietly on Wall Street's fringes, to go underground in recent weeks. "My New Year's resolution is not to talk to the press between the months of January and December," said Mr. Chanos, whose $400 million fund is believed to be the biggest pot of money devoted to short-selling now that the Feshbachs have fallen. Like others approached about being interviewed, he is determined not to divulge what stocks he may be stalking, lest the short-busters gang up on him.
 
 
 
GOING OFFSHORE WITH THE SHORT-SELL
 One bright spot for short-sellers still earning decent returns is foreign stocks, largely because they have yet to attract much of a crowd. "I don't think anybody had a good year, unless they were shorting outside the United States," said Budge Collins, an investment manager in Newport Beach, Calif., who advises companies about alternative investment strategies, including short-selling.
Japan, Canada and Britain, and, to a lesser extent, Austria, Germany and Australia, have all opened up their markets a crack to short-sellers. The big concession for them was allowing brokers to lend stock in their inventories to short-sellers.
These countries are generally less interested in helping shorts get a toehold than they are in encouraging the use of futures and options. Of course, options trading cannot take place in any meaningful volume if investors cannot hedge their positions by selling short.
One New York short who has pursued that tack profitably is Michael Katz, whose $21 million short-selling fund was down 26 percent last year, versus a 70 percent climb the year before.
"One position where everything worked the way it was supposed to work was Central Capital," Mr. Katz said. Listed on the Toronto exchange, the heavily indebted company owns two subsidiaries that met Mr. Katz's test of "advancing internal rot."
One is a trust company, much like an American-style savings and loan, that lends money out against real estate. The other is a mortgage insurer that is on the hook if large waves of homeowners default on their mortgages.
Mr. Katz shorted the preferred stock at $20 a share and was eventually able to replace the shares he borrowed at 60 to 70 cents apiece.
Going abroad, of course, is not for everyone.
"To do that, you need a large staff, you need to be able to hedge currency risk and you need to understand accounting rules that may be different than U.S. accounting rules," said Benjamin E. Kopin of Lynx Partners in Chicago. "I have a hard enough time keeping track of what's going on here."

HEADLINE: Booking With a Computer

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS; PETER H. LEWIS writes The Executive Computer column
in the Sunday Business section of The Times.

 BODY:
THESE days, a journey of a thousand miles can begin with a single tap of the computer keyboard.
 The best way to get somewhere, some travelers assert, is through the personal computer. Using a computer and a modem, which allows two computers to exchange data over telephone lines, travelers can scan flight schedules and fares, check the weather at the destination, research restaurant reviews, uncover unadvertised bargains and in general tap into the knowledge of most of the world's travel providers and many veteran travelers. 
That's a lot of traveling without leaving home, and it is a clear trend in the business and leisure travel industry. The rise of personal computers and lightweight portable computers, as well as the growing sophistication of automated telephone services, have allowed tens of thousands of individual travelers to gain access to the same information used by professional travel agents.
 According to Steven Sieck, vice president for electronic services for the Link Resources Corporation, a market-research company in New York City, more than six million American households have modem-equipped computers capable of tapping into the various information and electronic mail services. Millions of business computers have modems, too.
 "Virtually every electronic mail service and on-line service has access to airline guides, typically O.A.G. or Eaasy Sabre," said Bill Howard, author of the "PC Magazine Guide to Notebook and Laptop Computers" (Ziff-Davis Press, Berkeley, Calif.). O.A.G. is the Official Airlines Guides Electronic Edition and Eaasy Sabre is the electronic information service owned by the parent of American Airlines. Another popular electronic airline guide is Worldspan Travelshopper, jointly operated by T.W.A., Northwest and Delta airlines.
 O.A.G., Eaasy Sabre and Travelshopper are, in essence, data bases that contain scheduling and fare information on tens of thousands of flights daily. Many business customers subscribe directly to O.A.G. or the other services. Others gain access to the services through such consumer information services as Compuserve, which says it has 903,000 subscribers; the Prodigy Services Company, which reports a million members; Dialog Information Systems Inc.; Delphi; Dow Jones News Retrieval, and M.C.I. Mail.
 But while on-line travel services are increasingly accessible, the people who might be expected to use them most -- frequent flyers in the computer industry -- say it is still faster, easier and cheaper to call a travel agent or the travel provider directly.
 "Yes, you can use a computer, and it's almost as good as the way you've done it for the past 20 years, and that's stupid," said Jim Seymour, a computer consultant who lives in Austin, Tex. "I use the telephone" and a pocket diary, Mr. Seymour said.
 Mr. Howard agreed, and said even skilled computer users find the travel services daunting to navigate.
 But "even the best travel agent makes mistakes," Mr. Howard said. "Having a laptop is the great equalizer because you can check airline schedules at the last minute, even when your travel agent's office is closed. But once you've done that, it's still important to pick up the phone and check person to person."
 Mr. Howard recounted a recent trip to Ithaca, N.Y., from New York City. His travel agent told him that he could choose a return flight at 6 A.M. or noon. "I took the 6 and had to get up at 4:30," he recalled. "It turns out there was a 9 A.M. flight that would have been perfect. Had I checked it through my computer I would have gotten the right flight."
Worldwide air fares are updated daily, and schedules are updated weekly, which makes the electronic versions much more accurate than the printed schedule booklets available at airports or by mail. For 17 major airports, including the three major ones in the New York City area, one can even check to see if a flight is on time and which gate and baggage carousel it will use. The information is as current as on air terminal monitors.
 On-line reservation services like O.A.G. and Eaasy Sabre "maximize the benefit of each travel dollar spent," said G. C. Bellaire of Dallas, who commutes weekly to a job in Wichita, Kan. "I can't say how much Eaasy Sabre has saved me over the years, but it is a pretty significant sum."
 Some leisure travelers, however, take an opposite view. "The only negative is that it's too darn expensive," said Lan Sluder of Asheville, N.C., responding to a reporter's electronic query in the Travel Forum on Compuserve.
 Subscribers in major cities can tap into Compuserve or the other services by dialing a local telephone number, so there is no long distance toll, but Compuserve charges $12.80 an hour for connection time. In addition, O.A.G. assesses a surcharge of 17 cents to 47 cents a minute for using its service, depending on the time of day. (There is no additional fee for using Travelshopper or Eaasy Sabre.)
 So, while using a computer to track down bargain fares can pay off for frequent flyers, the cost of using the computer and browsing through the services can mount quickly.
 A recent expedition into the O.A.G., Travelshopper and Eaasy Sabre travel systems via M.C.I. Mail and Compuserve revealed that it is difficult to do anything useful in a few minutes, and easy to spend hours browsing through data bases, all while the meter is ticking. O.A.G. seems to offer the most information for those willing to learn its complex system, while Travelshopper is the easiest but most limited system. Eaasy Sabre seemed more like O.A.G. than Travelshopper. Some travelers and travel agents have complained that Eaasy Sabre displays American Airlines' flights more prominently than competitors', but I saw no evidence of this.
 A typical session starts by loading the communications software that allows two computers to "talk" to one another. Using typed commands, I connect my P.C. to a Compuserve mainframe in Columbus, Ohio. The Compuserve "host" computer asks for an identification number and password, which are issued when one subscribes to the service. Once my identity is confirmed, the screen fills with a list of possible services.
 GOING to the Travel section yields a new menu, offering such choices as Airline Information and Reservations, Hotel Information, Rental Car Information, U.S. Domestic, International Information, Potpourri, Forums and an Electronic Mall where one can even buy luggage and other travel accouterments.
 I choose the Airline Information and Reservations branch, which triggers a new menu that includes O.A.G., Eaasy Sabre and Travelshopper. I choose O.A.G., and yet another menu appears.
 The O.A.G. choices include Airport Arrival-Departure and Gate Information, Accuweather Forecasts, Lodging and Dining, Worldwide Travel Facts, Travel Industry News, Frequent Traveler Programs, Leisure & Discount Travel, Cruises, and so on.
 Then I tap into flight information and the fun begins. The goal is to book a vacation for two to Hawaii. The computer asks the departure city name or three-letter airport code, and I type AUS, for Austin, Tex. It then asks my destination and, since I don't know the three-letter airport code for Maui, I simply type Maui. The computer helpfully tells me that I want to go to OGG. It asks the date I want to begin travel (01JUN) and what time of day I want to fly(600A? No thanks. How about 800A?).
 The screen fills with what at first appears to be gibberish, but which on closer inspection is a string of characters that provide details on each possible choice: departure time, departure city code, arrival time, arrival city code, airline, flight number, type of plane, meal service, number of stops (0 for nonstop), on-time rating, plus all the same information for the connecting flight, if any. There's also a note of the total travel time.
 None looks good. I press "+" for more choices, and suddenly there it is: a 7:35 A.M. flight on American to Dallas, a change of planes, and a one-stop direct flight to OGG. Total travel time: a few minutes over 10 hours.
 It takes several more minutes to find a return flight, going through the same drill.
 Now, how much will it cost? Using the "fare" command, I am presented with an array of prices, starting with the cheapest, $698 round trip, and ascending to more than $2,500 for regular coach and a breathtaking first-class fare so high I've forgotten it. I choose the $698, and ask to see the restrictions.
 Oops, that fare is not available; it must be sold out. So, I ask the computer to show me the lowest available fare. After a few seconds, it finds a $758 round-trip fare per person and notifies me that I have saved $2,568 over regular coach on the two tickets.
 Ticketing is handled in different ways, depending on the service. Travelshopper will make reservations, but tickets must be purchased from a travel agent or from the airline. Eaasy Sabre keeps a traveler's profile, including credit card information, and will send the tickets by mail or, using its optional and more expensive Quiktix feature, by courier or overnight delivery. O.A.G. tickets can be sent by mail or routed through a travel agent; a list of cooperating agents is shown, sorted by ZIP Code.
 My daytime search of 30 to 40 minutes on O.A.G. was slogging along at a rate of more than $40 an hour ($12.80 for Compuserve and $28 for O.A.G.), but even in the wee hours, when O.A.G. charges $10 an hour, it would have been $22.80. (Users of especially fast modems are charged even more on Compuserve. Prodigy, which charges a fixed annual fee of about $120, is more economical.)
 I prowled around for another half hour investigating hotels, rental car rates and other information. And then I called my travel agent. With the same information I had given the computer, she called back in four minutes with a cheaper flight that, using a combination of commercial flights and tour packages, included a three-day car rental. Using a personal computer to book tickets is "very handy when a person has a good grasp of airlines, rules and fare structures," the travel agent, Jane Levan of West Lake, Tex., said. "But sometimes a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing."
 But there is another side to traveling electronically, one that is difficult to assess in terms of dollars and cents. The travel forums allow travelers to exchange subjective data, as well as facts.
 Indeed, for about 25,000 keyboard travelers in the last year, including many members who participate from overseas, the Compuserve travel forum has become a destination in itself.
 "The typical user loves to travel and loves to talk about traveling," said Jerry Schneiderman of New York, the Travel Forum administrator on Compuserve.
 MR. SCHNEIDERMAN rattled off some recent topics. "I'm going to North Korea and want to know if there are any good beaches," he said. "I'm going to Hanoi and want to know if they accept Visa cards. I heard there's a trip you can take on a Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker."
 "Those are some of the more adventurous ones," Mr. Schneiderman conceded. "You'll see any conceivable question about travel or customs. And the answers are unbiased, based on bona fide experiences."
 Even specialized computer data bases have travel services, for specialized interests.
 Marcus L. Endicott of Saint Simons Island, Ga., said that he regularly taps into a worldwide electronic network operated by the Institute for Global Communication (I.G.C.). The I.G.C. includes forums for "green" or environmentally-oriented travel, and a Servas forum, for those who want to volunteer their skills in developing countries.
 And, of course, it helps to be able to tap into the computer system while traveling, regardless of mode of transport.
 "During the last six months of 1990 I bicycled solo from Yugoslavia to Estonia, through all of the Eastern European countries except Albania," Mr. Endicott said. "I took a solar-powered, fax-compatible laptop computer, which I used successfully to telecommunicate with the I.G.C. from each country."

 
SAMPLING OF ON-LINE SERVICES
 All on-line travel services require a personal computer, a modem, communications software and a subscription or membership. There are many services, and most offer access to travel planning data bases. The two most popular on-line services are Compuserve and Prodigy.
 Compuserve, of Columbus, Ohio, can be reached at (800) 848-8199. Membership kits, which include a $25 connect-time credit, have a list price of $49.95 but are frequently discounted or given away with modem purchases. Connect time is $12.80 an hour at modem speeds of 1,200 and 2,400 baud, and $22.80 an hour at 9,600 baud.
 Prodigy Services Company, of White Plains, can be reached at (800) 776-3449. Subscriptions are $12.95 monthly, with no connect-time charges.
 The Institute for Global Communication (I.G.C.), of San Francisco, is at (415) 442-0220. The first-month fee is $15, and $10 a month thereafter (includes one free hour of connect time). Additional connect time is $5 an hour on nights and weekends, or $10 an hour weekdays.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 12 about the use of computers to make travel arrange ments referred incorrectly to a serv ice that provides overnight delivery of airline tickets. The service, called Quiktix, is offered by Prodigy Infor mation Services, not Compuserve. A similar overnight service on the Com puserve network is called AA Online.

HEADLINE: An Ethnic Road to Riches: The Immigrant Job Specialty

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
When Parmjit Singh left his job as a mechanic on a Greek ship in 1981, he settled in New York City, instead of returning to the family farm in India. After working three years as a busboy and cook in a Greek restaurant, Mr. Singh met a fellow Punjabi who owned a gas station in the city.
 "He taught me how to run a station," the 32-year-old Indian recalled. "It's very hard work but it's easy to run -- to order gas, to clean, to keep the books." 
By 1990, Mr. Singh, with an Indian partner, owned 13 gas stations in the New York area. He has competitors, however -- chiefly, other Punjabi Sikhs who began buying and working in gas stations in the city at the same time he did, some of whom now own as many as 40.
 
Growing Economic Force
 Indian ownership of gas stations reflects the enormous ethnic transformation of the city during the last decade. With one million newcomers, the latest wave of immigration is the second largest in New York City history. Just a decade ago, gas station ownership usually mirrored the ethnic makeup of the surrounding neighborhood. But now, about 40 percent of the city's stations are run or owned by South Asians, estimated Linda Sachs, a spokeswoman for the the city's Department of Consumer Affairs.
 This turnover in gas station ownership is one of the many images of a changing New York. While the new immigrants come from a vast spectrum of countries, with a heavy emphasis on Asian, South American and Caribbean nations, and work in a variety of jobs, they have also developed their own specialized niches, virtually monopolizing certain businesses or professions and slowly changing the commercial, political and cultural profile of the city.
 The forces that draw immigrant groups to certain occupations and businesses -- Indians to gas stations, Koreans and Dominicans to grocery stores and Afghans to fried chicken places -- are complex and varied. Their occupational choices are based on factors like skills and values learned in the old country, the paths followed by fellow immigrants who preceded them, or merely a lack of more attractive economic options.
 Sociologists agree that there is no universal pattern to these ethnic niches and that often labor specialization is random and hinges on availability of positions in certain localities. Indians, for example, may be preeminent in gas stations in New York, but in Los Angeles those business are dominated by a Korean quasi-monopoly. But once a niche is found, it creates a snowball effect, gathering in labor from that ethnic group and expanding exponentially.
 The common thread linking all immigrant work niches is the insider's edge on the profession. "Recruiting through the ethnic network is the most efficient way the employer gets labor," explained Roger Waldinger, a sociologist at UCLA who has studied and written extensively on Koreans and Dominicans in New York City. Ethnic labor, in particular family labor, is cheap and easily exploited and there is no linguistic, cultural or discriminatory barrier.
 Many immigrants are self-employed entrepreneurs. More than 85 percent of the 1,600 green grocer stores in the metropolitan area are owned and run by Koreans, sociologists say. The more than 100,000 Koreans who have come to New York also own novelty shops, beauty salons, liquor stores and dry cleaning. Indians and Pakistanis -- close to 95,000 of whom reside in the city -- have a virtual monopoly on newsstands. Since the mid-1980's, they have been buying into gas stations, and their growing presence in the jewelry trade has made them the second largest ethnic group -- after Hasidic Jews -- in the Diamond District.
 Guyanese -- the fourth largest immigrant group -- can be found throughout the city's pharmacies and machinery repair shops. They also stand out, along with the Jamaicans and Irish, in the child-care business. Even the smallest of immigrant groups, like the Afghans and the Senegalese, have carved out their own niches. There are fewer than 4,000 Afghans in the city -- almost all war refugees -- yet they own more than 200 fast-food chicken restaurants, Afghan businessmen say, in particular a non-franchised chain of more than 40 called Kennedy's Fried Chicken. The Senegalese, many of them already traders by profession, came to the United States via Europe and have prospered hawking a variety of wares on street corners throughout the city.
 
Korean Success: Toil and Innovation
 One of the the most visible successes has been the Koreans. An estimated 100,000 Koreans have come to the metropolitan area since the 1970's and 65 percent of Korean families own at least one business, said Pyong Gap Min, a professor of sociology at Queens College, who is a specialist on Koreans in the United States. "No other group is as highly self-employed," Professor Min said.
 Few Korean green grocers owned such stores in their homeland. But they arrived in the United States at a propitious time, when many Greeks, Italians and Jews were leaving the grocery business. Most were highly educated professionals with limited English skills and no business experience. But they had money to invest. The grocery stores were attractive because, although they required long, hard hours, they could be run with only basic shards of English. In the United States, they revamped and spruced up the stores, filling the demand for items beyond the basics of the old grocery store. New immigrants learned the business from fellow Koreans before they invested in their own stores.
 Professor Min said that the first Korean to open a green grocery in Manhattan, To Sup Kwak, invested about $5,000 to start his business in 1970. Although Koreans in New York City were already firmly entrenched in the trade of Korean products, green grocers were their first businesses not tied to the products of their homeland, Professor Min said.
 The snowballing success of Korean grocers is due in part to an extensive and well-organized support system. New arrivals can rely on a 500-page Korean business directory, as well as dozens of business groups, including the Korean Green Grocer Association. When black residents of Flatbush, Brooklyn, organized a boycott of two Korean grocers in 1990, for instance, fellow Korean grocers put up money to help the stores remain in business. In the last several years, as a visible testimony to the phenomenon of ethnic succession, Koreans have begun hiring Central Americans and Mexicans to perform the menial tasks in their stores.
 Anderson Han, 41, has owned his green grocery on the corner of Union Street and 41st Avenue in Flushing for three-and-a-half years. His story reflects the successes of many Korean immigrants.
 Most of Mr. Han's 18 years in the United States have been spent working six-day weeks in the grocery business. In 1973, after his father bought a fruit store in Manhattan for $30,000, Mr. Han dropped out of college to help the family.
 "Before he died, my father wanted each of my six brothers and sisters to own a grocery store," Mr. Han said. The dream was realized, with each sibling owning a green grocery.
 In 1988, Mr. Han bought his store for about $200,000 from a Greek-American. His first year, Mr. Han and his wife worked 16 hours a day, seven days a week. In a good month, they make a net profit of about $4,000. He has been held up and robbed. But like many first-generation Koreans who have succeeded in their business, Mr. Han says he will not allow either of his two children to work in the store and wants them to become doctors or lawyers. Already he is employing two Central Americans because they are cheaper to hire than Korean laborers.
 
Indian Immigrants: A Society Recreated
 Indian immigrants offer a stark contrast to the Korean experience. Although most Indians who came to the United States in the 1960's and 1970's were professionals who spoke English, the arrivals since then are not as well-educated. Unlike many Korean immigrants, who came from the cities, many Indian immigrants come from small towns or the countryside. As Indian families have reunited in the United States, many have recreated the extensive social and kin networks of their homeland, said Madhulika Khandelwal, a sociologist in the Asian American Center at Queens College.
 For instance, various communities in India are devoted to certain occupations, a characteristic reflected in the professions Indians pursue in the United States. One example is the Indians working in the Diamond District in Manhattan, many of whom are Gujerati Jains, reknowed as traders and merchants throughout India. Most of the Indians involved in the motel business, which is completely built around the extended family network, carry the last name Patel, a sub-caste from the province of Gujerat that is known for its entrepreneurial expertise.
 And most Indians in the gas station business are Punjabi Sikhs.
 In India, Sikhs are known as farmers but also as transporters and mechanics. The largest fleet of trucks in India is owned by Sikhs who control more than 80 percent of the bus service throughout the country, said Baldev Singh, a former lawyer who now owns several gas stations in Long Island as well as the fifth largest truck stop in the United States in Jessup, Md.
 "It is not sheer coincidence that they are taking up these jobs," Mrs. Khandelwal explained. "Sikhs are very enterprising and they don't mind going into areas where no one else will work."
 At Parmjit Singh's Mobil station at 125th Street between Broadway and the Hudson River, the workers -- all Sikhs -- seem almost numbed by the long hours and grueling work. They earn $300 a week and save half of it. "All I know is this gas station and the Punjab," said Amrit Singh, a clock merchant who has been in New York for only five months and spends his only day off washing clothes, buying groceries and sleeping.
 Parmjit Singh's gas stations are held up an average of two times a month. Two Indian employees have been shot and killed during stickups, Mr. Singh said. But the station still makes a net profit of about $4,000 a month. "They see me and they want to be like me," Parmjit Singh said of his workers.
 
Afghan Refugees: Evading Barriers
 In the vast maze of cultures, Afghans offer yet another insight into the ethnic division of labor. One of the smallest and most recent groups of immigrants in the city, they are refugees from the fierce decade-long war in Afghanistan. Many of them lack higher education, trade skills, and have little knowledge of English. They are generally poor when they arrive. And unlike the Koreans and the Indians, their struggle for survival has had an impact on only a very specialized part of the city's economy.
 In the last decade, with more than 200 stores, the Afghans have become specialists in the fast-food chicken business. To circumvent language and discrimination barriers, even their carpenters and chicken suppliers they use are Afghans. Their niche in the business originated in 1979, when Abdul Karim Halemi, a student from Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, got his first job was in the kitchen at Kansas Fried Chicken. A year later, he opened the first Kennedy's Fried Chicken. Now there are 40 unfranchised restaurants with that name -- all owned by Afghans, Mr. Halemi said.
 Mr. Halemi said he and other established Afghan immigrants in New York lead the new arrivals by the hand through the chicken fast-food business. The tough part is teaching them the intricacies of running a business in New York City. "It's like a formula," Mr. Halemi said. "We tell them how to go to the building department, how to save money by cutting and installing their own bulletproof glass."
 "You have to have some connection with somebody to succeed," said Mr. Halemi, who still works at his restaurant on Rockaway Boulevard in Queens behind the protection of bulletproof glass. "We all know each other. When the new ones come to the store, they sit. They watch. They learn and then they work."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 12 about immi grants in New York City who have developed special niches in business misstated the monthly profit of the gas stations owned by Parmjit Singh. As Mr. Singh's lawyer explained in a recent letter, it is $3,000 a month total, not $4,000 at one station. Because of an editing error, a picture caption with the article misstated the number of gas stations Mr. Singh now owns. It is two.

His competition is chiefly from other Punjabi Sikhs, who began buying and working in gas stations at the same time he did. Mr. Singh stood outside the Mobil Gas Station on 125th Street in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: ...and a New Home for a Pioneering Theater

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
IT'S a success story that could be attributed to impeccable timing, terrific luck and slick marketing. But it took more than that to move the nonprofit Crossroads Theater Company from its modest beginnings 13 years ago on the second floor of a rickety factory in a depressed area to a new $4 million building in a revitalized district of New Brunswick.
It took the persistence, vision and understated power of Ricardo Khan, who has been instrumental in gaining for Crossroads the artistic credibility and high visibility that affirm its place in the forefront of black theater in America. All this at a time when the fortunes of the arts in general and professional black theater in particular are withering. 
 At an early rehearsal of "Black Orpheus," which closed last Sunday, Mr. Khan, the company's co-founder, producer and artistic director, worked the room. To a group of actors he said, "Let's talk it out so we can understand what's really going on."
 
Myth Set in Carnival Time
 He joined the musicians and beat on the congas. "Man, you got it," he said to the percussionist on the steel drums. In a corner, he huddled with Jesse Moore, who was playing Orpheus in a contemporary adaptation of the myth set in Trinidad at carnival time.
"Carnival brings the blood up closer to the skin, and you're closer to your feelings than you ever are," Mr. Khan said. "Things that used to be right are not so right. Something's a little dangerous -- but now it looks too comfortable."
The rehearsal ended, as they all do, with the company members' gathering in a circle. "We end every day by saying, 'Thank you for that,' " Mr. Khan said -- just as every performance he directs begins with a backstage prayer "to bring everybody together before you go out there."
About Mr. Khan's directing style, Mr. Moore said: "He takes the moment and carves away at it -- and he trusts you. He's very spiritual. And I can ask his advice. He knows that you get more flies with honey than with vinegar."
 
Ending in 'Place of Beauty'
 Suddenly reacting to being called a director, Mr. Khan said: "Only when people are lost. Everybody else, I guide. I believe the vision I have for this piece is spiritually driven. Although the outcome of the myth involves the loss of life and of love, it will end in a place of hope, a place of beauty."
Setting the piece in Trinidad was Mr. Khan's idea. "That's where my ancestors came to, from India as indentured servants," he said. "This is kind of like my personal way of claiming our new space for them."
Ricardo Mohamed Khan, the oldest of five children of Dr. Mustapha Mohamed Khan and Jacqueline Driver Khan, turned 40 years old on Nov. 4. He was born in Washington and raised in Camden and in Cherry Hill, where his parents still live.
His father, now a semiretired physician, left Trinidad to attend Howard University. "He was the baby of a family of 10 and the only one they saved up money for, because he had the best chance for success," Mr. Khan said.
While Mr. Khan's fervor can come off as theological as much as theatrical, he acknowledges that it is nondenominational.
"I was baptized Catholic and grew up Episcopalian," he said. "In Trinidad, where my grandparents lived -- we went back every summer until I went to college -- we were Muslim. Then, at Rutgers, I started to go to Baptist churches. By the time I hit grad school, mother found a Pentecostal church in the middle of Glassboro, in a little place that looked like a lodge, so we were Pentecostal for a while -- and after that, we ended up being everything."
By the time Mr. Khan was in graduate school, he was married to Dana Hollowell, another acting student, who came from Detroit. The marriage lasted 10 years.
"My ex-wife is a Catholic -- and I don't go to church that much, but I'll go into any one, anywhere -- mosques, synagogues," Mr. Khan said. "I don't worship any one religion because I think they're all one; it's not the building you go into -- it's coming into a place where there's a community, where people, like you, believe in the spirit."
He went on: "I don't leave my house in the morning until I've prayed and meditated. Once I've hooked into that, I say, 'Now I can go and get the elevator.' Otherwise, it's like going into a battle without armor. You don't do that.
"Every day, it's a battle. Everything worth fighting for is difficult, because there's a different force that does not want you to get it, so you need armor, and for me, the armor is myself."
For Mr. Khan, that armor came in handy after the 1989 Crossroads production of "Sheila's Day," which involved the collaboration of five South African women, three of whom were aliens. A hoped-for production at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater in Manhattan led to a dispute with Actors' Equity.
"We had to replace the nonresident aliens with American citizens or pay Broadway scale to a whole company of 12, and Joe Papp couldn't afford that," Mr. Khan said. "So Equity killed it. Having the committee that is called alien tell you to find five Africans who are Americanized is an insult. We have a union that is scared of the future. Its inability to deal with our global experience is a tragedy -- and that came up again with 'Orpheus.'
"I wanted a brother from Trinidad who was disapproved by Equity. Luckily, Jesse happened to be in the cast already. During the days of rehearsing and not having an Orpheus and fighting Equity, he was kind enough to read the part. The union should open the world up. I want to wage war on Equity. If the theater is not reflective of who we are, it is going to die."
The opening of a state-of-the-art showplace is a startling anomaly, given cutbacks in arts spending and the attrition of professional black theater companies. But it is the emergence of Crossroads as a high-profile nurturing center for new works and, by all accounts, the nation's foremost black theater company, with a budget this season of $2.8 million, that lends artistic credibility to a success story that looks like a variation of being in the right place at the right time.
"Money was created to make this building happen when the economy was high," Mr. Khan said, alluding to a 1981 city-appointed arts commission that led to a proposed New Brunswick Cultural Center, of which a new Crossroads Theater was to be a part.
 
Impressive Track Record
 In spite of a disappointing 1990-91 season, Crossroads has an impressive track record. Its reputation spread to Manhattan theatergoers by means of such moves from New Brunswick to Off Broadway as "The Colored Museum" -- the company's breakthrough play in 1986 -- "Spunk," "Further Mo'," "Ground People," which was produced here under the title "The Rabbit Foot," and "Black Eagles."
For all that, Mr. Khan has not been beguiled by commercialism, says Peter Zeisler, the executive director of the Theater Communications Group, the national organization of nonprofit theaters.
"Ricardo has come into his own as an artistic director," Mr. Zeisler said, "because he is centered in what the theater is trying to do: make a home for developing black artists -- and avoiding the traps of the transfer syndrome. It would have been so easy to change that after the success of 'Colored Museum,' but the Crossroads work still happens organically."
Practically speaking, Mr. Khan and Crossroads have been favored by one publicity triumph after another. After a widely praised televised version of the Crossroads production of George C. Wolfe's first play, "The Colored Museum," in 1990, a White House reception was held in February 1991 for the cast of "Black Eagles," which Mr. Khan directed.
It was prompted by President Bush's enthusiasm for Leslie Lee's play about the Tuskegee Airmen, unsung heroes of World War II and the Army's first black pilots. The reception preceded the play's move to the Manhattan Theater Club.
 
Aided by Cosby Shows
 And a week of festivities last October, proclaimed Crossroads Theater Week by Gov. Jim Florio and Mayor James Cahill of New Brunswick, was capped by five donated -- and unsolicited -- performances by Bill Cosby. The first marked the opening of the 264-seat Crossroads Theater, and the next four shows took place at the nearby 1,867-seat State Theater. Mr. Khansaid the net proceeds of the Cosby benefit and its attendant receptions were $240,697.
"It's not like Crossroads is rich or anything," Mr. Khan said. "We had nothing to raise for the building, but when we moved, we needed a cushion of money -- and to expand our base of support.
"You don't raise money for programs you want to do, but for programs you have already committed to. And people give you money because they buy into a passion, a belief, a faith. That's how I approach funding. That it's meant to be."
"And subscribers -- we had 2,000 last year and our goal is 4,000 for this year -- provide you with unconditional love," he added. "But if you think you have to cater to them, you end up being an institution that just serves them what they want, and that's not enough. You have to develop a relationship that leads them to a new place. We started by bringing people into the theater who had never been to a theater before. They stayed -- and now we've all gone further."
 
Began With Federal Funds
 The company's co-founders, Mr. Khan and L. Kenneth Richardson, then known as Lee Richardson, started Crossroads as a federally financed theater project in 1978. Both had received undergraduate and graduate degrees in acting and directing from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University. They began Crossroads with a $50,000 grant under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, and with the George Street Playhouse, now next door, as its sponsor.
Mr. Khan recalled that the project was intended to hire "hard core unemployed" and that black actors filled the designation.
"We wanted jobs, and what was out there?" he said. "Roles for pimps, drug dealers, addicts and black men who beat their wives, not artistically challenging or spiritually uplifting parts that were about helping your people. You either gave in or you changed it."
By the time Mr. Richardson left in 1988, Crossroads was on the threshold of international recognition, with "The Colored Museum," staged by Mr. Richardson, having had acclaimed runs at the Public Theater, the Royal Court in London and the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Mr. Wolfe, the playwright, was later to be named one of the resident directors in charge of the festival by its producer, Mr. Papp.
By then, Crossroads was going forth with new-play development instead of falling back on such staples of black theater as "The First Breeze of Summer" (its first produced play), high-voltage revues ("Bubbling Brown Sugar") and novelties for the purpose of nontraditional casting ("American Buffalo" and "Agnes of God").
Although the reasons for Mr. Richardson's departure remain unaccounted for and Mr. Khan said that relations between the two men were "strained," Mr. Khan has dedicated a seat in the new theater to Mr. Richardson's 6-year-old son, Garrett. The boy had taken part in a parade during the opening-week celebration.
"There's no reason for a child not to know what his father helped to create," Mr. Khan said.
 
'A Moment of Hope'
 Similarly, the importance of children as the stronghold of the future framed Mr. Khan's staging of "Black Orpheus." He said, "The first rhythm in the show comes from a child, and in the very last moments, the kids pick up the guitar and the sun rises on them. That is a moment of hope."
Oyamo, who wrote "Black Orpheus," commented on the significance of Crossroads in the contemporary black theater movement. "Black theater is in trouble," he said. "More risky black plays are being done by white theaters. You can't stick to plays about black people on the porch eating biscuits. Crossroads still is in a state of evolution -- and Rick is trying to create a vehicle for all kinds of approaches to a black esthetic. That makes Crossroads the most legitimate black theater in the United States."
Larry Leon Hamlin, artistic director and founder of the National Black Theater Festival, an event held every two years in North Carolina, cited Crossroads for being "an excellent role model for black theaters in America" and for its "acute financial management." Mr. Hamlin, who is also the head of the North Carolina Black Repertory Company, said of Mr. Khan, "The man is a visionary."
Mr. Khan, speaking about his vision of Crossroads as a world theater, which came to him when he heard Paul Simon's "Graceland" concert, declared: "I heard Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Soweto Rhythm Section. Those rhythms sounded so much like what I knew from Trinidad, and that started me trying to get in touch with people in South Africa, which led to productions like 'Bongi's Journey' and 'Sheila's Day.'
 
'Celebrate Who You Are'
 "We are all political beings,and there is nothing you can do about that. This is not something that I want to feel, but there's a tinge of that in any black person who walks into a white world. And within that racial reality, if you can create and celebrate who you are and your color, your heritage, your ancestors, your work, your rhythms, then it becomes a movement that is international, that causes change, and that to me is what Crossroads is, not just a black theater. It denounces the forces that try to homogenize you -- and that's a revolution, a human revolution.
"Ultimately, we're attempting to turn the world a different way and say, 'This is good' -- and in doing that, we end up redefining black theater.
"Too many black theaters have died because they never created a leadership around the organization. I'm not interested in an ego trip. I tell my staff: 'I'm not into creating followers. I'm into empowering leaders, and if you're interested in becoming a leader, let's talk.' This is about longevity."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
By the Way, Whose Money Is It?

BYLINE: By LEAH D. FRANK

 BODY:
ONE reason our economy is in its present condition is provided in Jerry Sterner's play "Other People's Money," at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale.
The play, which won awards Off Broadway and became a recent movie, is a wry examination of the back-room corporate politics leading up to the 73d shareholders' meeting of the New England Wire and Cable Company. In a sense, it provides the flesh-and-blood excitement behind the profit-and-loss columns of a standard annual report. 
 The players in what develops into a bitter takeover game include William Coles, president of the company and a clever and careful manager; Andrew Jorgenson, chief executive, who inherited the company from his father, and Bea Sullivan, Mr. Jorgenson's professional assistant and longtime friend.
The outsiders are Kate Sullivan, Bea's daughter, who has grown up to become a powerful corporate lawyer, and Lawrence Garfinkle, a ruthless man known in Wall Street circles as Larry the Liquidator.
As in any annual report, what is important in the long run is the bottom line, and Mr. Sterner's explanation of the balance sheet involves the sterling principle of looking out for one's self, a philosophy that is 180 degrees from the Golden Rule.
Depending on the view of the capitalist system, you will find the ending happy or tragic. In either case, the play, if not this production, will satisfy.
In Frederic De Feis's direction, "Other People's Money" has lost its harsh comic edge. The evening takes on a monotonous rhythm, and whatever laughter or suspense might be in the script is missed. Part of the problem lies in the unfortunate casting.
Michael Fredericks, as Coles, sees his golden parachute descending unopened, and his bottom-line instincts are for self-preservation. Jacqueline Muro is chilling as Sullivan, the sharp lawyer who succumbs to her mother's pleas to save a small company from a corporate raider.
Ms. Muro and Mr. Fredericks give performances that are in no way matched by the three other actors.
A major problem is Jack Mertz's interpretation of Jorgenson. He portrays Jorgenson more as a narrow-minded doddering old man who is approaching senility than as a champion against corporate injustice. Mr. Mertz lacks believability as a hard-nosed but decent New England executive. He delivers his dialogue in a dull monotone, repeating each line by rote. The performance skewers the outcome, because the way of life Mr. Jorgenson is defending never seems real.
The sinister machinations of Larry the Liquidator are not particularly threatening. Anthony Bellucci manages to turn Larry into a charming Wall Street hero. His crudeness, cold-hearted nature and vacuous morality are lost in the folds of Mr. Bellucci's sweetness as a doughnut-eating tycoon. Mr. Mertz turns Mr. Jorgenson into a fool, and Mr. Bellucci creates a purring kitty out of a Wall Street fat cat.
Patricia Wallace does not provide Bea Sullivan with the iron will necessary for the character to be Kate's mother or Mr. Jorgenson's mistress.
I am told that the film has a different ending from the play. Even in this far-less-than-perfect production, "Other People's Money" provides much to think about. It also offers a painless lesson in Wall Street economics.
"Other People's Money" continues at the Second Stage Theater through Feb. 2.

HEADLINE: Following A Rough Year, Bankers See An Upswing

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
IN 1991 a record 20 banks and savings and loan associations failed in Connecticut, and about half the financial institutions still in business are under some type of special regulatory watch.
"I don't think it's ever been this bad in the past," said Barbara S. McGrath, Deputy Commissioner of the State Banking Department. "We've never closed this many banks before. We've never had this many regulatory orders outstanding. I guess the 1980's were too good to be true. It's not clear all the problems have been recognized yet, either." 
 Despite the problems, though, Ms. McGrath and others who work in or follow trends in the industry say that banking might have hit bottom, and that they even saw a few signs that it might be climbing back.
They point to a number of signs: New-home construction statistics for 1991 should end up about the same as they were a year earlier, ending a three-year slump. An increasing number of banks are breaking even or even posting small profits. During the third quarter of 1991 -- and apparently in the last quarter, although the statistics are not all in -- the banks had fewer loan defaults. The stock market rally has caused many investors to look for the place to make their next killing, and bank stocks are attracting attention. Another advantage, the bankers say, is that while the loan rates that bank charge their customers have dropped in the last year -- the prime rate has declined to 6.5 percent from 9.5 percent since last January -- the banks' cost of borrowing has dropped even more precipitously, by half, to 3.5 percent from 7 percent for the Federal Reserve's discount rate. "A lot of people think bankers like high interest rates," said an economist for Connecticut National Bank in Hartford, Nicholas Perna. "But that's not true. What bankers like is a wide margin between what money costs them and what they earn on it."
Predicting that "the worst is behind us," Mr. Perna recalled that at the start of 1991 one of the state's largest banks, the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, was being taken over by Federal regulators, a war loomed in the Persian Gulf, and most economic indicators were plummeting.
"Put into that perspective, 1992 is starting out on a fairly positive note," Mr. Perna said.
 
Returning to Profitability
 William R. Attridge, president of the Maritime Bank and Trust Company in Essex, the only bank to start up in the state in the last couple of years, said: "We're far enough through the problems now that most banks have taken their biggest hits and set up decent reserves. We've hit bottom and, maybe, are starting back up."
David E. A. Carson, president of People's Bank in Bridgeport, said: "We're all striving to return to a level of profitability that makes banking a good business, and that's going to take a while. But I think things are going to take a turn for the better in 1992."
Others are much more guarded, including Edward J. Deak, a forecaster for the New England Economic Project and chairman of the economics department at Fairfield University.
"I would be surprised if we saw another 20 banks fail this year" in the state, Dr. Deak said. "But there are still several banks, half a dozen maybe, that have serious problems."
The president of the First Federal Bank of Waterbury, James C. Smith, said banks should also be uneasy until they have the answer to the most important question facing the industry now: what is the true value of commercial real estate?
"We were way overbuilt," Mr. Smith said. "And we have an increasing supply going on the market as banks take title through foreclosure and try to dispose of it, as demand is still on the wane. Ultimately, bank losses are going to depend on what they realize from the sales of these properties, so the full extent of these losses might not be felt for another year or two."
The president of Gateway Bank in Norwalk, Reginald DeKoven, agreed that commercial real estate could drag down earnings in 1992, but he saw some reason for optimism.
"The residential market has held up better in Fairfield County than I anticipated," Mr. DeKoven said. "And the other bright spot is the dramatic decrease in the cost of deposits."
Mr. Carson of People's Bank also pointed out that in the waning months of 1991 a lot people paid off or reduced the balances on their credit cards.
"Consumers are learning to be more conservative," he said. "And when the economy turns around, the consumer may have the resources to come into the market, which could make the recovery a little better."
Last year was the worst ever for banking in Connecticut, with 17 banks and 3 savings and loans closed by regulators. They ranged in size from the $7.1 billion Connecticut Bank and Trust to small hometown banks like Harbor National in Branford. Some were newcomers, like Enfield National, which lasted only two years; others had been around many years, like the 167-year-old Merchants Bank in Norwalk.
Hartford and Bridgeport lost three banks each, and the rate of failure statewide seems to have tainted everybody in the business. Bankers at Farmers and Mechanics in Middletown had to gear their advertising to address fears about the safety of their deposits when the similarly named Mechanics and Farmers in Bridgeport failed. At the Savings Bank of Danbury, an officer declined to comment on the effect on its business of the failure of the nearby Danbury Savings and Loan Association.
"There is, throughout the state, a real sense of caution about banks, much more questioning by the customers about how you're doing," said Mr. Carson. "But people are also concerned about when the recession will be over, and most understand the two are linked."
Dr. Deak said one of the biggest problems facing banks in 1992 will be their lack of capital, particularly with regulators pushing for increased levels of capital to cover loans that go bad. "It's not that banks don't want to lend money," he said. "It's that they don't have the money themselves to back the loans."
 
More Efficient Structure
 Ms. McGrath said banks are increasing their capital, through the sale of assets, the sale of part of their business to investors or through private or public stock offerings. As they begin to raise capital, banks will be able to write loans again, which will be one factor in helping the economy pull out of its slump, she said.
At the same time, bankers say, the closing of branches and merger of operations that follows each takeover is resulting in a much more efficient banking structure in the state.
"Yes, you can improve the efficiency of banks by consolidation, but that also decreases competition," Dr. Deak said. "And besides that, it's a very long process. What we need in Connecticut is a much faster process."
Dr. Deak said he advocates mergers with institutions from other parts of the country, like opening the regulatory gates to Bank One of Ohio or Bank of America in California. Banks that come in from elsewhere in New England or New York would bring many of the same problems as Connecticut banks have now, and they would be more apt to treat Connecticut banks as a "deposit-gathering subsidiary," he said.
"My preference is for banks to come in from a long distance, because they're going to have to set up a more autonomous organization here, which means a major commitment to the region," Dr. Deak said.
 
Regulatory Attention
 But he also said that allowing such mergers would require legislation, and this year, with a short session planned, the General Assembly is likely to be so busy with tax and budget matters, it will have no time for banking legislation.
"I don't see them being able to deal sensibly with any of these issues during this session," Dr. Deak said.
Ms. McGrath said the Banking Department was keeping a close eye on all banks, particularly those under special regulatory restrictions. These range from rather informal memorandums of understanding that require, for instance, that banks raise more capital before writing commercial loans, to cease-and-desist orders, which can go as far as requiring that banks charge off problem loans that are still on the books, or that their boards assess the banks' management.
"We are getting more detailed information on a quarterly basis from those banks," Ms. McGrath said. "We want to get a sense of how well they're able to cope with the problems."

HEADLINE: Responding to Academic Achievers as School Budgets Tighten

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

 BODY:
IN a classroom decorated with children's self-portraits and essays -- along with globes, games and boxes labeled with different mathematical processes -- about a dozen third graders are intently engaged in proofreading logic puzzles before binding them into books. All is conducted under the watchful eye of their teacher, Judi Sternberg.
If it is difficult to determine exactly where these activities fit into a third-grade curriculum, that is because these students are not in an ordinary classroom. They are participating in Highview Elementary School's High and Wide program, one of the Greenburgh Central 7 District's answers to the special needs of academically able students in grades two through six. 
 These children -- who have been identified as intellectually gifted through a screening process that includes teacher recommendations and cognitive testing -- leave their regular homeroom class twice a week to meet with other children of similar abilities. They receive special instruction through activities designed to challenge and stimulate.
 
'Sometimes Children Decelerate'
 "There's a myth that all these children will make it on their own," said Mrs. Sternberg, who has taught in Greenburgh's gifted and talented program for 12 years and now also serves as its district coordinator. Mrs. Sternberg, a board member for the New York State Association for Gifted and Talented Education, views her program as a pull-together resource for these children.
"The fact is that sometimes these children decelerate, starting in second or third grade, and become underachievers or the class clown," she said. "I definitely believe that their needs must be addressed as gifted children. They must be challenged all the time. If you don't use it, you lose it. Society loses in the end."
At a time when the national educational agenda calls for raising academic standards and improving student performance, it would seem that programs for the gifted and the talented would be fully accepted. But those concerned about education for gifted students in the county are finding that many programs are in jeopardy, especially after recent cutbacks in the state education budget.
"There are two trends now that hurt," said Alan Kramer, director of the Westchester Institute for Student Enrichment, part of the institutional services division of the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services. "We're running out of money generally for education. That's reality. In context, special programs to meet the needs of kids who are not problematic is last in line. We are bemoaning that we are losing out to the Japanese in technology. But we take the intelligence of the country and mush them down.
"There is a very deep mistrust of intelligent people, of using resources to make bright kids brighter," Mr. Kramer added. "As a nation, we've never come to terms with exceptional abilities. We don't apply that to sports. But when it comes to intellectual issues, we don't make the same connection. We need to help these kids learn how to harness their abilities."
Although the state requires schools to screen students to determine if they need special education, including services for the gifted, New York is not among the 27 states mandating gifted education. State law requires that schools provide special education for those students needing remedial help or those classified as learning disabled; a school's obligation to meet the needs of academically talented children theoretically ends with the screening process.
"It's appalling that there isn't more for gifted in the county," Mrs. Sternberg said. "We're going into a bumpy period because of financial constraints, and I'm scared."
 
Support for Programs Expressed
 But state education officials proclaim their support for gifted programs. "We're quite interested in seeing that gifted children receive an appropriate education," said Dr. David Irvine, coordinator for Gifted Education in the State Education Department in Albany. "We encourage school districts to take a broad look at giftedness," he said, adding that this encompasses such talents as leadership, kinesthetic ability and artistic skills, among others. "There's a real contradiction in what we're facing nationally and internationally and our willingness to sacrifice the education of gifted children," he said. "Many, many gifted children who don't have special programs drift along as good students, but not at what they would be capable of doing if we gave them the opportunities."
Many educators believe that gifted students would be better served if they were thought to be as needy of special education as children in remedial programs.
"Our philosophy is that these are children who have needs similar to special ed," said Joseph Rodriguez, principal of the Dows Lane school in Irvington. "We're not going to split hairs to try and identify whether a child is gifted or not. Youngsters do have a need to be with their peers."
The county's reputation as an enclave of affluent, well-educated professionals sometimes conspires against delivering appropriate educational services to those children who need them, some educators say.
"Westchester parents confuse smart kids with gifted kids," Mrs. Sternberg said. Some districts, like Scarsdale, don't offer any differentiated programs for gifted and talented youngsters. Some communities are suspicious of special programs for the intellectually gifted, viewing them as elitist frills that can be dropped in economic hard times.
And many districts that do provide some special instruction in the lower grades drop such programs by the time students enter middle school, arguing that honors classes and advanced-placement courses meet the needs of intellectual youngsters.
 
Program Expanded in Ardsley
 Debate within the educational community on how to deliver education for the gifted or, indeed, whether there should be differentiated programming for intellectual high achievers also complicates the issue of gifted education in the county.
In districts like Greenburgh, Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry and Irvington, gifted and talented children leave their homerooms to meet in small groups for special programming once or twice a week. Teachers refer to this practice as a pull-out program.
"Our philosophy is that children who have exceptional abilities need an opportunity to work with others of exceptional abilities," said Laurel Woolf, resource teacher and teacher of the gifted at the Concord Road School in Ardsley, which recently expanded its gifted program to the middle school. "Very bright children need each other. They need to work in areas above and beyond the regular classroom curriculum."
For example, second graders study endangered species, while third graders investigate architecture and fourth graders study communication and pursue independent-study projects.
Then there are districtwide magnet programs, like Yonkers's Pearls -- the acronym stands for Program for Early and Rapid Learners -- which offers a challenging educational program to talented youngsters who are clustered together in a particular school. Instead of simply offering fourth-grade math to third graders, for example, the curriculum is designed to meet the relentless curiosity of its gifted students.
 
Not Faster, but More
 "It's not just accelerating the curriculum but enriching it to give them more," said Lillian Mein, the Pearls program director and magnet supervisor for the Yonkers school system. "We encourage kids to be creative and productive thinkers. They can get facts anywhere."
Some districts also offer students who aren't selected for their school's on-site gifted education the opportunity to participate in a before- or after-school enrichment program sponsored by Boces. Southern Westchester Boces offers an after-school enrichment program in science, math, theater, writing and art for about 230 students in grades three through eight from seven participating school districts. During the spring semester, enrollment increases slightly when second graders are invited to attend.
Boces also gives about 90 high school students the opportunity to take college-level courses in the performing and visual arts at the State University of New York at Purchase, under the auspices of the Foundations Program for Visual Arts.
The Putnam/Northern Westchester Boces also offers high school students the chance to work with professionals in the fields of science or English. Through the SUNY Purchase-Westchester Partnership, 10 high school seniors can take a college-level course at the Purchase campus through a Young Scholars program. As an extracurricular activity, motivated Katonah students at the John Jay Middle and High Schools can participate in Future Problem Solving, a think-tank activity, which has its national headquarters at the University of Michigan.
Then there are educators who believe that students are best served through enrichment activities in the homeroom. "The philosophy of our school district is meeting the needs of children throughout the educational program," said Maryann Doyle, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction in Chappaqua, which discontinued its special classes a few years ago. Sel Shimmerlik, the gifted resource teacher, offers problem-solving activities and higher thinking skills exercises to 700 third-to-fifth graders in the district's three elementary schools.
"I feel that children have multiple talents," Mrs. Shimmerlik said. "If you select just a small group based on achievement tests or IQ, you're missing so many students. I can throw out lots of ideas for students and can meet many children's needs.
A similar sentiment prevails in Byram Hills, which offers an enrichment program to its middle school students as well as special classes for its third and fourth graders. "One problem with gifted and talented programs is that they can be exclusive," said Joel Goldsholl, the enrichment teacher in Byram Hills.
But if a seventh-grade group is studying algebra, Mr. Goldsholl can work on developing a unit of more difficult problems for those students who need more stimulation.
 
'Kids Know Where They Stand'
 Supporters of the enrichment model rather than special classes cite other benefits. "When I worked with classroom teachers as an enrichment teacher, I stressed higher-level thinking skills. The teacher could see kids in a different environment and would say, 'I didn't know that child could do that.' "
Whatever their individual philosophies about how to address the need to challenge academically talented children, or any children, many educators agree that the effort must be made.
"The attitude has to be that you take every child and develop them, and deliver services in a way that does not affect others in a negative way," said Dr. Karen Zumwalt, a Chappaqua resident and professor in the department of curriculum and teaching at Columbia University's Teacher's College. "Kids know very soon where they stand in the academic hierarchy. It doesn't mean that the child with unique potential should be ignored. Rather, you need good, old-fashioned teaching where a child's needs can be met, away from a whole class, lock-step approach."
 
Gifted Students Seek Companionship
 FOR many gifted children, their abilities can be a burden. Just as children whose abilities place them at one end of the bell-curve struggle to fit into the educational system, so too do academically gifted students.
"Kids who are truly gifted really have a hard time in the world and need support," said Jeri Waldman, a former teacher for the gifted who is a fourth-grade teacher at the Murray Avenue school in Larchmont.
Children whose intellectual capabilities outstrip their chronological age can have difficulty fitting in with their classmates. A child whose consuming interest is archeology or military history may not enjoy lunchtime discussions of the latest Nintendo strategies.
Patti Robbins, who had to struggle with the Springhurst School in Dobbs Ferry to have her 7-year-old son, Benjamin, recognized as gifted, said: "The school would not think of a child as being gifted before third grade. He needed other bright boys to be with, and he needed flexible teachers."
Jerry Buchanan, the mother of two children in Greenburgh's High and Wide program and president of the Greenburgh Association for the Gifted and Talented, added: "People think these children are gifted in everything, and that's not true. Kids need to know they're smart, but that's only one facet to them."
Children who participate in special classes, known as pull-out programs, appear to benefit as much from having a compatible peer group as from the intellectual challenges that the teacher offers.
"It's fun," said Jason Weingarten of Hartsdale, an 8-year-old at the Highview School. "You get to get away from class and be with people who have the same intelligence as you. I like studying one thing at a time and doing projects on it."
Melissa Goldstein, a classmate who is also 8 and lives in Hartsdale, said: "You can create your own thing and other people can see your work. It's more fun than my regular class."
Teachers and administrators say gifted children learn as much from each other as from the instructor.
"Gifted and talented kids have frustration and have uniqueness that needs to be addressed," said Patricia Tatlow, a fourth-grade teacher in Ardsley. "They need a chance to talk about their frustrations and their social and emotional needs. You need to offer some companionship to these kids. Gifted and talented kids weren't meant to raise themselves."

HEADLINE: Anger Lingers After Leak at Atomic Site

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEAUFORT, S.C., Jan. 10

 BODY:
The scare is over, but in the "Prince of Tides" setting of golden coastal marshes, moss-draped live oaks and seaside resort communities, the questions linger after a leak of radioactive water from the Savannah River Site raised new questions about the safety of the nuclear weapons plant there.
At recent public hearings in Beaufort (pronounced BYOO-fort) and on nearby Hilton Head Island, residents demanded a halt to plans to restart the aging reactor that caused the leak about 150 miles from the coast. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and other officials said that Federal monitoring and notification procedures should have been better but that there was no risk to public health in the incident 
 Still, the leak of 150 gallons of radioactive water on Dec. 22 has starkly demonstrated how high the economic and environmental stakes remain in a nuclear weapons industry that lives on after the cold war has died.
The leak at the Savannah River Site, the nation's only installation for making the tritium needed for nuclear weapons, has pitted Georgia against South Carolina and coastal residents affected by the spill against upstate residents whose jobs depend on the plant. The debate involves South Carolina's largest employer, with 24,000 jobs, and a site that is already storing 34 million gallons of radioactive waste.
 
Embarrassing Questions
 And the leak has raised embarrassing new questions about the Government's decision to spend more than $1 billion to repair the reactor amid general agreement that it is not needed now, and some doubts that it will ever be needed.
"I'm certainly a loyal American," said Robert E. Huber, an official with Hilton Head Island Water Utilities, which is considering using the Savannah River, where the spill occurred, as a drinking water source. "I believe in national security. I believe in high-risk situations the people have to take more risk, but that's certainly not the case in the 1990's. Therefore, the risk to people should be commensurately reduced."
The incident began Dec. 22 during preparations for the restart of the 37-year-old K Reactor on the 310 square miles of the Savannah River Site near Aiken, S.C. The reactor is the nation's only source of tritium, a radioactive gas that increases the explosive power of nuclear weapons and must be replenished periodically.
The reactor had been closed for nearly four years because of safety concerns. After years of debate, Secretary Watkins on Dec. 13 ordered it to be restarted.
But during the beginning of startup procedures, about 150 gallons of highly radioactive cooling water containing tritium leaked into the adjacent Savannah River through a crack the size of a pencil lead. The leak went undetected for two days because the official in charge of authorizing transportation of water samples to a nearby laboratory was out with the flu.
Because of elevated tritium levels, drinking water plants that serve the coastal area and oyster beds on the Georgia and South Carolina coast were closed. There was no disruption of water service. Tritium is not considered as hazardous as some other radioactive substances, but its ability to bind with water and flow through the body makes it a health concern.
Two industrial users, the Savannah Foods and Industries sugar refinery and Fuji Vegetable Oil, were also closed as a precaution but have reopened. Tritium readings have since returned to normal, and the normal uses of the river water have resumed.
 
Secretary Visits
 Mr. Watkins flew to the area to say that the reaction was unwarranted and that state officials and news organizations overreacted to the leak, which was equivalent to four bathtubs full of water. The Energy Department says there was no need to close the water plants. "There was never any danger to the public," Mr. Watkins said.
Peter M. Hekman, Jr., manager of the Savannah River Field Office for the Energy Department, said: "We are talking about one-hundredth of what a person can have in a year's time from tritium. This is not the first time, nor even the largest dose of tritium released by us."
Local and state officials agree that the amounts of tritium detected did not pose a hazard. But they say it was prudent to react cautiously and they disagree with the Energy Department's standards. One reading found tritium in the river to be as high as 67,000 picocuries per liter.
The Energy Department uses a safety standard that is based on the average of readings taken over a year. It says the average should not exceed 20,000 picocuries of tritium per liter.
"It's a meaningless standard," said Dean Moss, general manager of the Beaufort-Jasper Water and Sewer Authority. "If we operate on a nebulous annual average, no restraint is put on any polluter in its day-to-day operation."
And it is precisely the history of leaks that has raised concerns over the plant. An Energy Department report before the restarting warned of the possibility of such leaks and called for increased safety measures.
 
Huge Economic Stakes
 "It's the overall picture that bothers me," said State Representative Harriet Keyserling of Beaufort. "Two years ago they had a similar spill, and an internal report said they had to start monitoring it in a different way. Two years later, they have never done it. Now when everyone is screaming, they say, 'We're going to do it tomorrow.' "
The incident reflects the huge economic and environmental stakes. The area around the plant has boomed as employment at the plant has more than doubled in recent years. Officials there tend to be sanguine about the incident.
"The people who work there should be the ones who know the truth of what went on behind the fence, and they are feeling fine about the safety," said Jane Murff, head of the Aiken County Chamber of Commerce.
Near the coast, where the environment is the economy, the feelings are more intense. Federal officials received some withering, and often hyperbolic, responses at public hearings on Wednesday.
"I don't believe a thing that you're saying," one man said to loud applause at a hearing. "I'd like to see them shut down the plant for this reason: We have not used a nuclear weapon since World War II. We're not killing our enemies. We're killing ourselves."
 
Rift Between States
 There is a similar geographic breakdown between Georgia and South Carolina. Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, a Republican, has been firm supporter of the plant, the state's largest employer. Across the border in Georgia, Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat, has been a consistent opponent of plans to restart it or build a new reactor unless emissions are reduced into the air and water and existing contamination is cleaned up. Although most employees come from South Carolina, about 7,200 are from Georgia.
The fate of the plant is tied both to changes in technology and the startling changes in world politics brought on by the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Because tritium decays at the rate of 5.6 percent a year, it must be replenished for weapons to work properly. Officials say enough tritium has already been made to last at least three or four years, and some say recycling tritium from deactivated warheads could make it last far longer than that.
The Energy Department does not view the K Reactor as a long-term solution. Instead, it sees it as an interim solution until a new reactor is built.
Some critics say the shrinking tritium needs could be met by newer technologies that would not generate high-level nuclear wastes. Others go further. "We ought to stop fretting about where the next supply of tritium will come from and think instead of not needing it at all," said Kevin Knoblock of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.
Still, even the end of tritium production, not a likely result, would not be the end of the Savannah River Site. Officials say the cost of cleaning up the plant's current contamination will dwarf the billions spent on maintaining it and getting the K Reactor running.
For now, officials have stepped up monitoring at the plant, now sampling river water every 2 hours instead of every 12. And some officials took pains by week's end to repeat Mr. Watkins's statement that there was no health risk. Mayor Susan Weiner of Savannah and plant and Energy Department officials drank the city's water at a press conference on Thursday.

NEW YORK CITY
 
A FREE RIDE THAT COSTS A LOT
Fare beating has long plagued the New York City subways, but in the last 18 months it has reached epic dimensions. Despite stepped-up police efforts, parts of the city have become virtual no-fare zones. One recent day, 11 people entered the 135th Street station in a 15-minute period. Two paid the fare. A1. 

A MOTHER SPEAKS OUT, ON HER OWN TERMS
Nellie Wilson, the mother of two children who were attacked by four young white men who squirted them with a white liquid, has guarded her children's privacy even while speaking out on her fury over the attack. Her decision, along with efforts by the Dinkins administration and Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, seems to have kept down the level of public hysteria that has characterized other bias attacks. B3.
 
MEMORIAL SERVICE BREAKS OUT IN PROTEST
A memorial service at City College for the nine young people who died there two weeks ago turned into a heated political rally. Organizers chanted "Whose school? Our school!" as they denounced college and city officials and rushed the guarded doors of a student center. The only bereaved family to attend it did not approve of the speakers' statements. "I don't see any need for hatred," said the father of Yul Dargan, one of the victims. B4.
 
AN EMIGRE'S DEATH STIRS HIS COMMUNITY
The slaying of Leonid Vinokur on Jan. 5 in Brighton Beach has revealed a new willingness among the neighborhood's 35,000 Russian immigrants to participate in the political and social life of their Brooklyn community. Michael Tartakovsky, a cousin of Mr. Vinokur, who was shot and killed as he struggled with a man trying to mug his wife, addressed a crowd of 250 people yesterday in Brighton Beach. "We will not let this happen again," he declared. "We demand justice." Brighton Beach Journal. B3.
A popular pastor who increased membership but clashed with church elders resigns from Fifth Presbyterian Avenue church. B3.
 
REGION
 
A RISE IN DEATHS OF HARBOR SEALS
For the last several years, more and more harbor seals have been stranded or washed up dead on Long Island beaches. While some of the increase may be from natural forces, biologists have begun to explore the possibility that man-made pollution, particularly PCB's, may be responsible for the condition of animals like NY-870, a harbor seal who died despite being cared for by the Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation. A1.
 
NEW YORK DEMOCRATS HUNGRY FOR A WIN
New York's 1992 Democratic Presidential primary campaign formally begins this week with two factors missing besides Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. So far, this year's campaign in New York has been dominated by electoral mechanics rather than by ideological jousting. No gut issue like the war in Vietnam or the vivid symbolism of a vigorous black candidate divides Democrats. Hungry after 12 years out of the White House, most want to win. Metro Matters. B2.
 
PASTOR AIDS POLICE IN ARREST
The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d knew his part-time handyman as a young man from a fine churchgoing family. But the police told him that the man was wanted in a robbery that left an ice-cream store manager shot in the head. Two New York City detectives asked for the pastor's help in arresting the man, and yesterday he turned himself in to Mr. Butts. B2.
 
A CLASH OF PARTIES IN LONG ISLAND
Nassau County Democrats are flexing their newly won strength and are closely monitoring the impact of 3,000 layoffs and painful cuts in services as Repbulicans fret over their losses and squabble over who is blame for the budget woes. Both sides agree, however, that old approaches, like raising taxes, will not sell in the depths of recession. B7.
 
RAILROADS A NEW THREAT TO HARBOR
The amount of cargo that once steamed into New York harbor from Asia has been cut in half over the last four years. The reason is high-tech railroad flatcars, hauled on trains often a mile in length, that dash in from the West Coast in three days. It is a trend, experts say, that rivals the impact of the development of containerizing cargo three decades ago. B7.

HEADLINE: Despite Grief, Thinking of Neediest

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
People find many reasons to contribute to The New York Times Neediest Cases, but among the most touching are those that move people to give despite their own difficulties.
"With my marriage falling apart and my work very stressful because of the economic difficulties," wrote a Manhattan man, who gave $1,000, "I am thankful I have a job and a place to live. This contribution is the beginning of my efforts to give back more to the world this year." 
 Another Manhattan man gave $50 in tribute to his mother's three-and-a-half-year fight against bone cancer. "We were able to celebrate one more Christmas together," he wrote.
Shelly Orringer of Harrison, N.Y., who gave $100, wrote that both her parents had taken ill, "he with a recurrence of lymphoma, she with vision problems, leaving her barely able to see." She added that it was more difficult to care for her mother because her son was recovering from a ski accident and knee operation.
 
Honoring Dead at Lockerbie
 She continued: "Many years ago my husband, a Pan Am pilot, died in a plane crash. I was fortunate enough to rebuild my life. Enclosed is a contribution to honor those who died at Lockerbie, Scotland, on Pan Am 103 and for the demise of a once great airline, Pan Am. This year the need to reach out is greater than ever."
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled. What began as the "Hundred Neediest Cases" has expanded to meet needs of thousands. So far this year more than $4.1 million has been raised from 12,163 donations.
As in the past, The New York Times is covering all the overhead so that every dollar collected can go directly to seven charities. The money provides relief including food, housing and clothing. The charities also use it for job training for the disabled, drug and alcohol counseling and many AIDS-related programs.
Many people, like Wendy Stedman Sheard of Stony Creek, Conn., have used contributions to the Neediest Cases to memorialize loved ones. Mrs. Sheard gave $100 in memory of her neighbor's sister, Hope Barnes, whom she described as an "inspiring leader in women's athletics, intrepid rock climber and loving daughter and sister who died in January 1991 in a climbing accident."

HEADLINE: Trade Proposal Draws A Lukewarm Response

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
A proposal to pull down world trade barriers has received a lukewarm response from many countries because of its provisions on farm products, forcing negotiators to focus more on opening world markets for other goods, American and European trade officials said today.
In the last three weeks, the European Community, the United States and Japan have all declined to endorse strongly a proposal made on Dec. 20 by Arthur Dunkel, the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. All three trading partners have expressed concerns about exposing their farmers to international competition. 
 Mr. Dunkel's proposal was not comprehensive. When trade negotiators resume their talks in Geneva on Monday, they are likely to start off with loud complaints about his suggestions on agriculture but then shift their emphasis to issues Mr. Dunkel did not address, trade officials and analysts, both American and foreign, said today.
Most economists consider the lowering of trade barriers to be good, because it allows countries to specialize in producing and exporting the goods they make most efficiently, while importing other goods. Carla A. Hills, the United States Trade Representative, said on Thursday that the average American family of four would gain $17,000 over the next decade if a GATT pact is approved.
But American critics of the GATT negotiations contend that while many exporting industries would benefit somewhat, and hire some new workers, other industries would be severely hurt by imports and many of their employees would lose their jobs.
GATT is a Geneva-based organization that organizes talks on rules for international trade.
Negotiators from each of the GATT's 108 member nations are scheduled to announce on March 1 their proposed tariff reductions for 4,000 categories of manufactured goods and their proposed schedules for reducing trade barriers in the financial services, telecommunications, transportation and textile industries.
 
'Down to the Nitty-Gritty'
 After two weeks of reviewing other countries' offers, the negotiators are scheduled to make their final offers on March 15.
The March talks are, "where you get down to the nitty-gritty, that's when it means something commercially," said Willard A. Workman, the vice president for international issues at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "That's where U.S. industry will finally know whether it's a good agreement or not."
Trade officials hope that resolving these questions could give countries an incentive to strike a deal on agriculture after 13 months of squabbling that has blocked agreement on every other issue.
But farm groups remain influential in many countries. Largely because of agricultural concerns, the United States and Japan issued noticeably lukewarm endorsements of Mr. Dunkel's text on Thursday.
 
Pressure From the U.S.
 The European Community's council of trade ministers, acting under strong pressure from the community's farm ministers, said on Dec. 23, "Insofar as the Dunkel paper calls into question the foundation of the community's agricultural policy, the paper is not acceptable and therefore has to be modified."
Despite pressure in the last three weeks from the United States to change that position, including repeated calls for a GATT agreement by President Bush during his recent trip to Asia, the same ministers reaffirmed their statement at a meeting in Brussels on Saturday.
The community's trade negotiators have been told that "they're not to go to Geneva and say 'it's over,' " the same official said, adding, "They're to go to Geneva and ask for changes, notably in agriculture but also in other issues."
After initially seeking a 90 percent cut over 10 years, the United States had recently pushed for a 30 to 35 percent reduction in tonnage and spending over five years. The European Community seeks much smaller cuts.
France has been the most vocal advocate of agricultural subsidies within the European Community. An important question has been the extent to which Germany is willing to join the Dutch and the British in confronting the French.
The willingness of the community's trade ministers to condemn repeatedly the agriculture portions of Mr. Dunkel's text has been widely interpreted as a sign of German reluctance to cut subsidies. A German official who insisted on anonymity said today that "Germany has not abandoned the idea of shearing subsidies, nor has the European Community, but we have to find a reasonable compromise."

HEADLINE: Russian Scientists to Detail Plans For a Fast Nuclear Space Rocket

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Scientists from Russia say they have made important strides over the decades in perfecting nuclear-propelled rockets, enhancing the prospects for faster space travel, and they plan to detail their achievements this week for the first time.
They will also propose a joint venture with the United States to build, test and use nuclear engines for sending humans to Mars, a feat whose distances and dangers might be beyond the powers of conventional chemical rockets. 
 In theory, nuclear-propelled rockets are at least twice as energy efficient as ones that burn chemical fuels. By generating vast power, they could substantially shorten a Mars voyage and enhance its feasibility.
 
Built for Efficiency
 Russian scientists say they have attained an important milestone in making nuclear-powered rockets. They say they have used highly heat-resistant metal alloys to build an engine that rapidly heats propellants to the highest temperatures ever. The propellants are not burned, but the heating causes them to expand, producing thrust. The hotter the engine, the more rapid the expansion and thrust.
Nuclear reactors have long been used to generate electrical power for spacecraft, especially by the Soviet Union. But they have never been used anywhere as powerful engines for pushing rockets away from Earth or deep into space.
Decades ago the United States built and tested prototype nuclear rocket engines on the ground but scrapped the work in 1973 for lack of a clear mission. The Federal Government has recently rekindled the effort with an eye toward new military and civilian uses, including a speedy way to send astronauts to Mars.
Some Western techinical experts have vaguely known of the secret Russian work but have gathered few technical or historical details, which turn out to be substantial since the work goes back many decades.
The disclosures are to be made this week by a team of Russian scientists at a meeting on space nuclear power held annually in Albuquerque, N.M. The conference starts today. But the new engine disclosures have already been outlined in advance.
"We have definite achievements in this field," Dr. Nikolai N. Ponomarev-Stepnoi, a high official of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, said Saturday in a telephone interview from his Albuquerque hotel. "The temperatures were higher than those obtained by our American colleagues."
Dr. Ponomarev-Stepnoi added that his team would propose a joint venture with the West to perfect such engines and "to go to Mars together."
Steve Aftergood, a nuclear expert at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington, said the Russian work appeared to be worth close study.
"It seems clear we have something to learn from their advances," he said, adding that a joint program with Russian nuclear scientists might also help boost their employment in a time of economic discord in the former Soviet Republics and lessen their temptation to become nuclear mercenaries.
"We could help them preserve and stabilize their nuclear infrastructure," he said, "which is in their interest and ours."
Elliot B. Kennel, a nuclear engineer at Applied Sciences, of Cedarville, Ohio, who recently met with the Russian scientists, said his company had already agreed to help them further their engine work, which he described as impressive.
"They say they have several reactors that have been tested over a long period of time," he said.
 
Masters of Metallurgy
 Generally, the Russians, though backward in some fields of technology, are seen as metallurgical wizards who have mastered high-strength, high-temperature alloys that are virtually unknown in the West. These metals can be important in the design of advanced reactors, which generate great amounts of heat, by preventing the the reators from burning up.
The Pentagon wants to buy an advanced Russian reactor meant to power spacecraft, but the $15 million deal has been stymied by red tape. The existence of that reactor, known as Topaz-2, was disclosed three years ago at the Albuquerque conference, which is sponsored by the University of New Mexico.
In the interview, Dr. Ponomarev-Stepnoi said Russian achievments in nuclear rocketry involved super-hot reactors that used hydrogen as a propellant.
Extensive trials of the technique have been conducted at the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site in Kazakhstan, now part of the Commonwealth of Independent States, he said, most recently on a large scale in the late 1970's. He added that the technology was still being developed but that progress was imperiled by the collapse of the Soviet economy.
"Taking into consideration the disintegration of our country, this technology also disintegrates," he said.
Tests of nuclear engines at the Semipalatinsk site are thought by some Western experts to have been viewed by American spy satellites and falsely interpreted as relating to lasers and other types of beam weapons. In the 1970's, speculation about mysterious tests at Semipalatinsk helped fuel American interest in exotic arms for attacking enemy missiles, which culminated in the 1980's with President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program.
Dr. Ponomarev-Stepnoi said the Russian achievement of high reactor temperatures could result in far more powerful nuclear rockets for a Mars voyage than ones now envisioned by American scientists.
He added that the Semipalatinsk site would probably be available for future tests with the West to develop a Mars rocket.
"I believe that with joint efforts this problem could be solved in several years," he said. But he noted that much care would have to taken with ecological issues, which could slow things down. The exhaust from nuclear rocket tests can be radioactive unless precautions are taken.
To further the Mars goal, he said, American scientists would be invited to a September meeting in Semipalatinsk on the development of nuclear rocket engines.
Dr. Ponomarev-Stepnoi said the Russian engine work was to be detailed at the Albuquerque conference on Tuesday. A preview was published last week by The Dayton Daily News after Dr. Ponomarev-Stepnoi stopped in Ohio to discuss his work with the experts at nearby Applied Sciences, Inc.
In the United States, nuclear rocketry received a boost last June when a report to the White House praised nuclear-powered rockets as one of the safest ways for human to reach Mars.
Known as the Synthesis report, it said nuclear propulsion could sharply shorten the travel time to Mars, thereby reducing crew exposure to weightlessness and space radiation. It also said nuclear propulsion could cut by about one-half the materials that must be lofted to low earth orbit and increase the number of launching opportunities for the start of a Mars expedition.

How It Would Work
Diagram: "Next Stop, Mars"
Hydrogen pumped into the nuclear reactor would be heated to extremely high temperatures, converted to gas and expelled through the rocket nozzle, providing thrust for the launching of heavy payloads or for blasting spacecraft on long-range missions. Some experts advocate using conventional chemical engines to loft the rockets, so that their nuclear engines would not be fired until they were far form the earth's atmosphere. (pg. B10)

HEADLINE: SLUMP PLAYS ROLE IN PICKING COLLEGE

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
The recession has forced many freshmen to put aside educational considerations in selecting their college, according to a survey released today.
The number of freshmen who chose colleges because of low tuition, financial aid or to live near home reached record highs in 1991, the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles found. 
 And the number of freshmen who said they went to college because they could not find a job was at its highest point since 1982, in the last recession.
More than 210,000 students enrolled at 431 colleges and universities responded to the survey, which is in its 25th year. The study, sponsored by the American Council on Education, found that 27.7 percent of the students surveyed chose colleges based on low tuition, compared with 23.4 percent in 1990. Financial aid lured 27.8 percent, compared with 25.2 percent the previous year. The survey said 21.3 percent selected colleges to live near home, compared with 19.8 percent in 1990.
Also, 7.3 percent of those surveyed attended college because they could not find jobs. That was the highest level since 1982, when 7.4 percent said they went to college because of the stagnant job market. In 1978, 4.4 percent attended college because they were unable to find job.
More than 37 percent saw a "very good chance" they will have to get a job to help pay expenses, compared with 34.7 percent in 1989. The percentage who expect to work full time during college rose for the third straight year, setting a record at 4.8 percent, compared with 3.5 percent in 1988.
The survey included these other findings:
*Health professions are increasing in popularity, with a record 12.9 percent of the students selecting a major in the field. About 7 percent of the students majored in health-related field in 1987.
*Business careers are losing their popularity, with 15.6 percent of those surveyed planning to major in that area. That compares with 18.4 percent in 1990 and 24.6 percent during the peak year of 1987.
*Freshmen who said they smoke increased to 11.3 percent after declining from 16.6 percent to 8.9 percent from 1966 to 1987.
In addition, beer drinking among freshmen was shown to be at its lowest level in the history of the survey, 57.3 percent. It peaked in 1981 at 75.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Government Service Gets Nasty

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
When the Comptroller of New York State, Edward V. Regan, announced last week that "there are no philosophical differences or partisan differences" between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature over the state budget, he drew this snarling response from John E. McArdle, the spokesman for the Senate majority leader and a fellow Republican. "What is he -- on drugs?"
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the Connecticut Governor whose high-handed manner almost undermined his crusade to impose the state's first income tax, was asked recently if he had learned any lessons from his heated, ugly fights with the Legislature. "No," Mr. Weicker snapped. 
 Lawmakers in New Jersey, seeking to hand off responsibility for a $2.8 billion tax increase, were too busily engaged in parliamentary feints and stalling techniques last week to speak ill of one another publicly. There, inaction spoke louder than words.
A new spirit of churlishness has invaded the region's legislatures, executive mansions, and local governments. Elected officials are refusing to attend meetings, boycotting quorum calls, hanging up on one another, leveling insults and threats at their opponents, and in general, being as nasty as they want to be.
Resentment, testiness, and rudeness have become so pervasive that they have even soured discourse among political allies. Politicians do bicker even in the best of times, but the stress and frustration of trying to reach agreement on budget cuts and tax increases in the middle of the recession have strained political civility to its limits.
New York State's normally mild-mannered Lieutenant Governor, Stan Lundine, a Democrat, distributed a news release on New Year's Day that heatedly blamed the Republicans for New York's budget impasse. He received dozens of irate phone calls from Republican legislators, including one from State Senator John B. Daly of Niagra Falls who got so angry that he hung up on Mr. Lundine. But not before he told him what he thought of his news release.
"I called it a piece of," said Mr. Daly, stopping himself and noting that he had used a word, "very direct and to the point."
Voters may be dismayed at the vitriol, but psychologists are not surprised by the increase in boorish behavior. "When people are under pressure or stress, they tend to regress and act like children," said Dr. Michael P. Nichols, a professor of psychiatry at the Albany Medical Center. "For some, it takes the form of aggressive defiance, and for others, sullen withdrawal."
Senator Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican from Brunswick, engaged in a high-volume shouting match with Mr. Cuomo at the first leadership meeting that the Governor called after announcing he would not run for the Presidency.
"Frustration and anxiety is causing short tempers and low-boiling points," Mr. Bruno explained. Mr. Bruno is one of many Republicans who have demanded "structural reform" of the state budget system.
In his State of the State Message, Governor Cuomo could not resist taunting his old adversary. "Someday," he said, "we're going to reform your structure, Senator Bruno."
 
Breach of Etiquette
 Yet the most noticeable breach of etiquette on the day of the Governor's address occurred between two Democrats from Queens. When Mr. Cuomo suggested docking his own pay and that of each lawmaker for every day that the budget remained late. He was brashly interrupted by Assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio.
"Don't tell me I won't get paid for my work -- that's political nonsense," he shouted. "We're here every day, 14 or 15 hours a day." Even by Albany's frontier standards of behavior, the outburst was considered unusual.
Throughout the region, frustration took many forms, from tiny social solecisms to more drastic assaults on governance.
At the first meeting of the newly expanded New York City Council last week, the mood was festive and upbeat. When Speaker Peter F. Vallone gave his State of the City address, the council members rose repeatedly to give standing ovations, all except Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn, a longtime critic of the speaker, who alone remained sullenly in his chair.
The sniping was decidedly more serious in New Jersey. After two years of budget shortfalls, despite a $2.8 billion tax increase -- the biggest in state history -- fiscal crisis has become a way of life in Trenton.
Last fall, the Democrats lost their majority in both houses because of a fiery tax revolt that was fueled, gleefully, by Republican candidates. In their last lame-duck session, the Democrats decided to call the Republicans' bluff by recommending a repeal of their own tax increase, an "apres moi, le deluge" gambit that would almost certainly bankrupt the state's coffers and force the Republicans to raise taxes on their own.
 
Retreat to a Diner
 The Republicans retaliated by refusing to show up for the Senate appropriations hearing on the rollback proposal. When the Democrats managed to squeeze the rollback bill onto the Senate floor and get it passed, the Republicans proceeded to boycott any discussion of measure in the General Assembly. When the Democrats called a quorum, the Republicans retreated en masse to a nearby diner leaving their opponents to fume in the State House without enough votes to take any action on the measure.
When the Democratic leadership finally corralled enough Democrats to reach a quorum on their own last Monday, the Republicans, who had camped out in a rented meeting room across the street, sourly filed onto the floor and called for a quorum every time a Democrat strayed from the floor.
Republican minority leader, Garabad (Chuck) Haytaian, repeatedly nagged the Democratic Speaker, Joseph V. Doria Jr., about whether he had maintained a quorum. Peering pointedly about the chamber, he said, "I don't think you have 41 people here. I don't believe it." Mr. Doria replied menacingly, "Believe it!"
When the measure finally came up for a vote on Friday, it fell six votes short of passage.
In Connecticut, where a new state income tax was greeted with about as much enthusiasm as Lyme disease, discontent was expressed in ways both ancient and state-of-the-art. Some political opponents regressed to the 18th-century tradition of burning Governor Weicker in effigy; others improvised "chain-fax" hate-mail, faxing doctored pictures of Governor Weicker with a Hitler mustache to the offices of lawmakers and business executives throughout the state.
Irritability, like laughter, is contagious. Even lobbyists, who usually lionize lawmakers, are getting testy. Richard Miller, the chairman of the coalition of New Jersey Sportsmen, for instance, reacted in a less than sportsmanly manner when a vote to override a bill obliging the owners of assault weapons to dispose of their guns failed to reach the floor. "The Legislature is just a bunch of prostitutes," he fumed in front of television cameras, "and the Governor is their pimp."

HEADLINE: Uncertainty and Recession Prevail at Electronics Show

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Jan. 11

 BODY:
The future of television, stereos and video games was on view here at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, which concluded on Sunday. But like the direction of the national economy, the course of the industry seemed sluggish and tentative.
That was due, in part, to uncertainty over the shape and cost of new technologies like high-definition television, mini-disks and digital compact cassettes, and compact diskread only memory, which could drastically change the video-game business. 
 Adding to the hesitancy was manufacturer nervousness over the receptiveness of a public already reeling from rapid and expensive changes in the last decade in consumer electronics formats, including the demise of eight-track tapes, the near-extinction of vinyl records and the recent decline in sales of audio tape cassettes.
As if waiting for Godot, most television makers coped with high-definition television, the cinema-like format due in the late 1990's, by moving essentially nowhere. Most contented themselves with small innovations, like Goldstar's prototype of a voice-recognition television that changes channels in response to shouted commands.
The biggest innovation at the show was also the one least likely to be bought by anyone except fanatical consumer electronics buffs. Thomson Consumer Electronics, the maker of the General Electric and RCA brands and the biggest company in television manufacturing, offered an innovative wide-screen television that more closely resembles the rectangular shape of the theatrical film format.
A version is on limited sale in Europe for $6,000, but the wide-screen television is likely to cost half that when Thomson introduces the RCA Cinema Screen in the United States this fall. It would be for a limited production run of 5,000 to 10,000 units in an American color television market of nearly 20 million units.
Although the price has not been determined, the television is likely to be slightly more expensive than the current $2,900 for a 52-inch projection set, the most costly now on the market. The Philips Consumer Electronics Company and the JVC Company of America may come out with their own versions.
Today's television sets have proportions of 4 by 3 , but the RCA Cinema Screen is 16 by 9, meaning the wider screen has 30 percent more space on each side. The new sets will come in three sizes -- 26, 30 and 34 inches, measured diagonally.
That means that in wide-screen epics like "Lawrence of Arabia," both the British adventurer T. E. Lawrence and King Faisal of Saudi Arabia can be seen simultaneously on screen. Currently, when such films are broadcast or transferred to videotape, a technician dictates the camera movement with a technique called pan and scan, shifting back and forth between Lawrence and King Faisal.
 
Old TV Standards
 But Cinema Screen is only as good as the television signal it receives and the videocassettes and laser disks played on it. Network and cable-television broadcasts are in the square format, as are most videocassettes, although a growing number of titles are in the so-called letter box format that forms black strips on the top and bottom of nearly square sets.
Thomson will have to work out agreements with broadcasters and film studios for wide-screen programming. Currently, the sets will only get a nearly square picture.
Another problem that Thomson will encounter is with television technology itself. In North America, the broadcast standard, which is nearly 40 years old, uses only half of the potential sharpness of a color television set. The signal only incorporates 330 lines of resolution, compared with the nearly 600 lines possible on today's televisions.
 
The Effect on Music
 More lines of resolution mean a sharper picture. High-definition television, or HDTV, has yet to work out its standards, but is likely to have as many as 1,000 lines of resolution.
But RCA Cinema Screen has only 600 lines of resolution, like today's sets. Until the mid-1990's, when the most optimistic experts expect HDTV standards to be set, Cinema Screen may be caught in an awkward transition between plain-old television and HDTV.
Also caught in a transition are the makers of compact disks and tape cassettes, as well as the prerecorded music industry. With their digital clarity, compact disks have nearly supplanted scratchy vinyl records and are hurting sales of analog tape cassettes. But CD's have one big drawback for consumers: They cannot be used to record voice or music.
Philips Electronics N.V., the Dutch company that helped to invent the analog cassette, has also helped develop a new digital version called digital compact cassettes. Philips introduced a $700 recorder in Las Vegas that also accepts the old audio tapes; the company says the unit will be available to retailers this spring.
BASF A.G. of Germany, a leading maker of audio cassettes, plans to sell the digital cassettes in Europe for about $8.50, quadruple the price of analog cassettes, but the American price has not been determined.
A rival to digital compact cassettes is a recordable compact disk called the Mini Disk, made by the Sony Corporation. But the Japanese giant did not even have a product exhibition at the show, leading to speculation as to whether it will meet its announced introduction date this year.
 
Improving Video Games
 Overshadowing both formats is proposed Congressional legislation about royalties to music companies, since consumers will inevitably use the machines to copy prerecorded compact disks. A Senate version is near completion, but the House of Representatives is still considering legislation.
Another version of compact disks, known as compact disk-read only memory, or CD-ROM, promises to revolutionize video games by incorporating cinema-quality live action and animation in video games. CD-ROM technology could incorporate actual scenes from movies like "Batman" and "Terminator 2."
Nintendo of America Inc., the largest maker of video-game systems, plans a CD-ROM offering in January 1993. But Sega of America, whose 16-bit machines have been selling strongly against Nintendo's version, plans to have one on the market this fall.

HEADLINE: No Recession for Firearms Industry

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Other businesses may feel the gloom of recession. But at the Shooting, Hunting Outdoor Trade Show, the annual meeting of the firearms manufacturing industry, the glow of prosperity was in the air.
The 1,200 companies that took part in this year's SHOT Show, as those in the gun industry call the four-day gathering, needed 15 percent more space than last year to show their wares, from high-tech rifles and pistols to scopes, decoys and "Bee-A-Tree" camouflage. Most of the 15,000 manufacturers, gun shop owners and weapons buffs attending the meeting, which ended today, had little to complain about. 
 "Profitability was up in 1991 over 1990," Alan Gottlieb, publisher of "Gun Week," one of several trade journals that took a booth here, said of the manufacture and sales of weapons in the United States. "They're making more, and the feeling is that they are going to do well in 1992."
Not even the threat of gun-control legislation could dampen the mood. At booth after booth, exhibitors cited both the fear of such restrictions and the recession itself, which they say has increased concerns about crime, as factors driving purchases of weapons.
 
Handgun Production Is Up
 According to government statistics, United States firearm production in 1990, the most recent year for which figures are available, totaled 1.8 million pistols and revolvers, down slightly from 1989, but up about 20 percent from the mid-1980's. Domestic rifle and shotgun production was 1.7 million, and more than a million weapons of all types were imported.
One of those enjoying boom times is Ronnie Barrett of Barrett Firearms Manufacturing in Murfreesboro, Tenn. A photographer turned gun designer, Mr. Barrett became something of a cult figure in the firearms industry after the .50-caliber semiautomatic rifle he designed was certified by the United States military and performed well in the Persian Gulf war.
"I'm real proud," said Mr. Barrett, who is 37 years old.
At $6,600 per rifle, plus another $1,000 for a scope, Mr. Barrett's weapon is not cheap. Mr. Barrett said that his main market would remain the armed forces of the United States and 16 other countries, "all friendly," but that he was happy to sell to gun buffs.
"It's a fun toy, a nice collectible," Mr. Barrett said of his creation, which has also appeared in "RoboCop," "Navy Seals" and other Hollywood action movies. "This is not something a drug lord or a bank robber is going to want to use. It's not easy to conceal."
 
Seeking the Female Buyer
 Traditionally, guns have been considered a male preserve. And it is true that this year's show had its share of models in camouflage miniskirts and its stacks of posters of bikini-clad blondes cradling rifles and shotguns.
But gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers appear to have realized that women also constitute a large and mostly untapped market. "We need to teach women that handling a gun is no different than driving a car," said Roy Melcher of Interarms, a weapons distributor with its headquarters in the Washington suburbs.
Smith and Wesson has responded with its "Ladysmith" line of handguns, the latest model of which was introduced here and will be in stores this spring. "We've lightened up the trigger and smoothed out some of the rough spots," said a shooting instructor, Paxton Quigley, who taught the actress Geena Davis how to shoot for her role in "Thelma and Louise.
 
Foreigners Make Inroads
 Jean Warren, owner of a gun shop in Amarillo, Tex., estimates that 15 percent of her customers are women, compared with less than 10 percent a few years ago, and that most are just like her: living alone, either widowed or divorced. "I can relate to them and them to me," she said.
The SHOT Show also attracts makers of foreign weapons, which are gaining in popularity here. Suppliers from countries like Brazil, which produces one-third of the 683,000 handguns imported into the United States in 1990, and Italy were here, along with companies from Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which were forced to scramble for new markets after the end of the cold war.
"The American market today represents 40 percent of our production," said Luciano Rossi of Amadeo Rossi Municoes, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of handguns.
Glock, an Austrian manufacturer, was also here, hoping to increase sales of models equipped with its popular "New York trigger." That device, introduced less than two years ago, was made to fulfill a request by the New York State Police for a trigger with more uniformity of response.
"It's become very popular throughout the country in law-enforcement circles," said Richard E. Perkins, a former armorer for the District of Columbia police who works for Glock.

HEADLINE: Worldwatch Report Calls 1990's Decisive Decade for Environment

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Two years ago, the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute warned that the world had about 40 years in which to reverse environmental deterioration or face a long decline into economic and social ruin.
But in its latest annual report, the institute asserts that the 1990's are the "decisive decade" for environmental change, declaring that nothing short of an "environmental revolution" will save the planet. 
 This revolution will require radical changes, from a reduced reliance on fossil fuels to redistribution of resources and a rapid shift to smaller families, the report says.
Lester R. Brown, president of the institute and director of the study, said that the world had "not succeeded in turning around a single major trend in environmental degradation" since environmental issues came to global prominence at the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.
The report lists several warning signs of potential environmental disaster, including continuing evidence of global warming, excessive population growth and deforestation.
Environmental degradation has affected global food production, the report says, citing statistics indicating that temperature changes, soil erosion and air pollution have reduced crop yields by about 1 percent annually since 1984. As a consequence, it says, personal incomes have fallen in more than 40 countries with a total population of 800 million people, nearly one-sixth of the world's population.
"We've underestimated what it will take" to reverse these trends, Mr. Brown said. "Stabilizing the climate depends on restructuring the world economy to phase out fossil fuels. Stabilizing the population will require a revolution in human reproductive behavior."
The report emphasizes the "pivotal role" of governments and corporations in stopping environmental degradation, and points to some positive signs that people are responding to the crisis: the European Community's proposal to replace some of its existing taxes with an energy consumption tax; Germany's pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2005; the reduction of soil erosion on American croplands by a third in the last five years, and Denmark's ban on throwaway beverage containers.
But these steps are "all too few," Mr. Brown said, adding that it may take a nuclear accident, catastrophic climate change or a food crisis to rally global support for drastic measures.
If the world does not respond to environmental degradation, he said, it will lead to economic distress that is politically unmanageable. He said a look at many archeological sites provided hints of what might come.
"North Africa was once the granary of the Roman Empire," Mr. Brown said. "Now it's largely desert."
Copies of the report may be obtained for $10.95 from the Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20032.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
F.B.I. Shifts Its Course After Cold War Thaw

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
On the surface, the redeployment of 300 counterintelligence agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation to combat street gangs represented a small but concrete example of what the collapse of the Soviet bloc can mean at home.
But within Federal law-enforcement circles, the shift announced last week by Attorney General William P. Barr came as a stunning break with the past. It represented the first substantial contraction of the F.B.I.'s counterespionage operations in 50 years and is the largest single reallocation of resources in the bureau's history. 
 In a stroke, an agency whose institutional character has been partly defined by its preoccupation with chasing spies, staking out embassies and investigating security leaks had succumbed to the shake-up that has swept the rest of the intelligence community following the transformation of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
At its core, the move seemed to symbolize a change in attitude within the senior ranks of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department about the role of counterintelligence. That shift appeared to be prompted by the grudging recognition that global political change had rendered some of the agency's operations superfluous.
"I think realism hit them," said Representative Don Edwards, the Democrat of California who is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee that oversees F.B.I. activities. He has criticized some counterintelligence activities, like the Library Awareness Program, in which librarians were asked to report people seeking access to scientific and technical materials.
Mr. Barr played a catalytic role in the reallocation of agents, department and agency officials said. He is trusted by senior F.B.I. managers and has a background in intelligence, and since he became Attorney General last fall, he has prodded subordinates to look for ways to expand the Federal role in combating violent crime.
Federal law-enforcement officials said that some counterintelligence officials at the bureau had opposed deep reductions in staff. But in a view that eventually proved persuasive to top managers at the bureau and the Justice Department, other officials in the bureau's criminal division had been pressing for the personnel shift as a long-overdue reassignment.
Still, senior law-enforcement officials insisted that the move did not represent a downgrading of counterintelligence. "What this represented was a mid-course correction based on resources and needs," said George J. Terwilliger 3d, the Acting Deputy Attorney General.
The precise number of F.B.I. agents engaged in counterintelligence remains classified, but Government officials said the reallocation would bring about a reduction of 15 percent to 20 percent.
Mr. Barr said further cuts would come in next year's budget. Government officials predicted that these planned reductions could result in the redeployment of as many as 100 additional counterintelligence agents to violent crime.
The reassignment seems abrupt because until recently the F.B.I. stoutly tried to protect its counterintelligence budget. Last spring, William S. Sessions, the bureau's Director, said in testimony before a House Judiciary subcommittee that a world in flux demanded an enhanced counterintelligence effort.
"The political, economic, social, cultural and military structure in every region of the world will undergo significant stresses that will result in diverse political transformations," he said. "As a result, U.S. plans, programs and capabilities will be increasingly targeted by our traditional and non-traditional adversaries."
Despite Mr. Sessions's assertions, Congress balked at the bureau's request for a sizable increase in its counterintelligence budget, whose dollar amount is secret, Government officials said.
Since then, the world has undergone even more radical changes. Once-active espionage efforts by East Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have disappeared, and one senior Justice Department official said the K.G.B., the Soviet secret police, had virtually dissolved its operations in the United States.
As Mr. Barr put it at a news conference, "Some of the intelligence services that used to be operating against the United States are no longer in existence."

HEADLINE: Volunteers to Help Ex-Soviet Lands

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Richard Garnitz, a 70-year-old former furniture store owner, is considering leaving his two-bedroom apartment overlooking the third fairway in a suburban retirement community to enter a two-year life of uncertainty where he may find himself in long lines just to buy eggs and milk and fretting over a scarcity of fuel to heat his living quarters.
Mr. Garnitz, a former Commerce Department employee, Foreign Service officer and international trade expert, may join the Peace Corps to become a part of its first group ever to enter and assist what was once the Soviet Union. 
 The Peace Corps director, Elaine L. Chao, announced recently that the organization, for the first time in its 30-year history, will send more than 600 volunteers, mostly with business backgrounds, to the former Soviet republics over the next two years to help their transformation into capitalist democracies.
 
Businesses and Governments
 Volunteers will assist business people in the Commonwealth of Independent States with concepts of private enterprise and will help governments define their goals.
"This is an opportunity for volunteers to participate in shaping world history," Ms. Chao said in a recent interview. "This is a very special and exciting period of time."
Shortly before his trip to several of the republics last month, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said, "I would like to see at least 250 Peace Corps volunteers on the ground by next winter."
While the volunteers have yet to be selected, Mr. Garnitz and his wife, Sydelle, are part of a new breed of potential candidates, many of them older than the usual Peace Corps volunteer. The average age of Peace Corps workers is 31.
 
'Take the Plunge'

"We both like adventure, if you will, and both feel we could contribute to the democratic and open market economy of the countries," said Mr. Garnitz, of Silver Spring, Md., a Washington suburb. "We're physically able to go. No problem about that. If we decide it's right, we might take the plunge."
Mr. Garnitz's interest in answering the republics' appeals for American help has as much to do with his views about Communism and American foreign policy as it does with adventure.
"The best way to help what amount to new countries to develop a democratic and market economy is to help them help themselves rather than pour a lot of money into them," he said. "I feel very strongly that an economically stable country is not a danger to its neighbors and the rest of the world. Communism is a wasted way. They've got about 75 years of wasted time. I don't want to see them go back to that type of economy and that way of life."
The volunteers will most likely be working as alone, and they will receive only a modest living allowance, health care and housing.
 
'Unique Period'
 Ms. Chao said: "The conditions will not be easy, so volunteers will have to have a high level of motivation. But as evidenced by the high number of phone calls we've gotten already, a lot of people are eager to participate in this very unique period in world history."
So far, the Peace Corps is not having trouble luring business executives away from comfortable jobs to endure two years in an area of political unrest, economic uncertainty, scant food and hyperinflation.
In fact, the average number of inquiries received by the Peace Corps a day jumped from about 250 to 750 since the beginning of this month.
The Peace Corps is actively recruiting volunteers for the Baltic republics, Armenia and Ukraine, which have formally requested assistance, Ms. Chao said, adding that she expects other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Russia and Kazakhstan, to follow suit.
 
Technical Expertise
 Participants can look forward to assignments like teaching English, educating business people about marketing products, cost accounting, structuring and managing new businesses, seeking addition capital sources, determining whether a private venture is worthwhile. They will also help local governments design systems and procedures.
"This is really an opportunity to work on a close basis with a local community at a very grass-roots level, very hands-on," Ms. Chao said. "This will enable them immediately to see the impact of their work."
The Peace Corps seeks volunteers with either a degree in marketing, business administration or public administration with five years' work experience, or five years of "significant experience" in fields like finance, management, accounting, marketing, operations or transportation, Ms. Chao said.
It is not necessary that candidates speak the language of the host country or be knowledgeable about its culture because the Peace Corps provides a preliminary three-month intensive language and cultural training period, Ms. Chao said.
The Peace Corps plans to send 60 volunteers by June to the Baltic republics -- Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia -- about 150 to other republics by late summer and another 100 by November. Then in 1993, another 60 will be sent to the Baltic lands and 250 to the other republics, bringing the total number of volunteers there to 620 by the end of next year, Ms. Chao said.
Bob Russell, 56, who has a master's in business administration and works in Richmond as an independent consultant in organizational development, is interested in going to the republics that have sought America's help.
"This would be an opportunity to work in a field where I have some expertise in a completely different culture, to help broaden my perspective of the world and see how other cultures look at life," Mr. Russell said. "It sounds like an adventure."
Some former Peace Corps volunteers and Congressional Democrats are concerned that the corps' move into the Commonwealth of Independent States could come at the expense of the organization's mainstay -- developing nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Similar criticism arose when the corps began sending volunteers into former Soviet bloc countries in Eastern Europe last year.
"I think it's great to want to put them in the former Soviet Union," said Steve Lamar, who served in Botswana in southern Africa in the mid-1980's and now works as a consultant in Washington. "But they also need to consider what new countries in parts of Africa and Asia need assistance."
The Peace Corps says the new program will operate with new financing and will not reduce the amount going to third world countries.
"Our commitment to the rest of the world remains strong," Ms. Chao said.

HEADLINE: Connecticut's Tax Agency Is Facing Chaos in Its First Collections

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 10

 BODY:
In the shabby, overcrowded building that houses Connecticut's Department of Revenue Services, optimism reigns: The 1.6 million blank tax returns that went out last week under the new income tax will be filed in timely fashion by April 15, officials insist. Refund checks, they say, will be processed just as smartly.
But some ominous portents say otherwise. 
 Widespread confusion and antipathy toward the income tax, which was adopted last year after a tortuous battle in the Legislature, plus understaffing at the tax department, errors and ambiguities in the tax tables and the likelihood of yet another drive next month to repeal the statute, could make Connecticut's leap into income-tax-law compliance a messy, chaotic affair.
The Revenue Services Commissioner, Allan A. Crystal, said that given the time pressures -- payroll withholding began just three months ago, 38 days after the law was signed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. -- his staff has performed brilliantly. But he concedes that the next few months will be the real test.
 
Software Unfinished
 Consultants hired to write the software for processing returns are still completing the work. The banks signed up to process the tens of thousands of checks in turn will depend on the software and the ability of less-than-seasoned tax processors to keep up with the flow of returns.
Some anxious department officials sought out advice in New Jersey, the last state to impose a broad-based income tax, in 1977. But the neighborly advice was cold comfort: every state is different, New Jersey officials said; you just have to jump in and hope for the best.
"It's an absolute crush unless you've prepared properly -- and it's hard to imagine what proper is," said Robert K. Thompson, the assistant director of audit activities for the New Jersey Division of Taxation, who worked the telephone banks answering taxpayer questions in 1977 and vividly remembers being skewered by arcane questions that no one had ever thought of. "The magnitude of implementing something like an income tax is unlike anything else," Mr. Thompson said.
In Connecticut, deep political divisions about the tax, labor turmoil in the state government and the effects of the recession have all compounded the difficulty in getting the tax up and running.
 
Returns More Complex
 One of the biggest problems is that income-tax returns for 1991 will be far more complex this first time around than they probably ever will be again. Because the law took effect only in the last quarter of 1991, the returns had to be contrived as an amalgam of old laws and new, covering differing types of income calculated under different formulas. Dividends, interest and capital gains income have separate tables this year that will be scrapped when the tax season is over. Next year, all income will be treated equally and taxed at 4.5 percent of the adjusted gross total.
Forms for out-of-state residents who work in Connecticut will not even be ready until the end of the month.
And there have been repeated stops and starts. Forms were sent out in October, for example, telling residents who had substantial income from dividends and interest that estimated tax payments would be due before the end of the year. People who called the state directly, however, were told that if they did not file, it really would not matter.
"It was a law that for some strange reason had no interest or penalties if not adhered to," said Hank Hofflich, a managing partner at Schwartz & Hofflich, an accounting firm in Norwalk, "and most people who didn't have professional advice probably sent a check." Mr. Hofflich said his 30-member firm told any client who called to simply throw the October paperwork in the garbage.
Tax tables have also been completely overhauled, causing confusion about how much should have been withheld from residents' paychecks. The initial tables, for 1991 income, were harshly criticized by some lawmakers who said the state was taking out too much money from paychecks and thus hurting residents and the already battered economy.
 
Refunds Will Be Missing
 New tables that took effect on Jan. 1 cut withholding. As a result, most people will not get refunds on their 1992 taxes, and residents who have income from savings or investments may face large bills.
And questions have continued to plague the department about whether it can hire additional staff to handle taxpayers' questions. The agency, which had 835 authorized job positions as of July 1, had requested nearly a 30 percent increase in personnel, about 250 new people.
Last week, only 40 of those people had been hired and trained, however, and a conflict with other state agencies threatened even many of those. Most of the 40, said a department spokesman, A. J. Janschewitz, were state workers who had been laid off from other agencies during a prolonged standoff between the unions and Mr. Weicker last fall.
Last month, however, the labor dispute was resolved, and the original agencies said they wanted their workers back. A decision late Friday afternoon by the Department of Administrative Services, which oversees personnel matters, said the workers could choose whether to keep their new jobs or go back to their old ones. Mr. Janschewitz said he thought most would stay.
Another uncertainty is that some residents may be so angry that they will deliberately mess up their returns or not file at all, a strategy that many phone-in listeners on radio talk shows have advocated. But one anti-tax leader, Thomas Scott, who helped organize a huge rally at the Capitol in October that drew more than 40,000, said he believed most people would comply with the law.
"People are going to continue to resist this thing any way they can, you know, within the law," Mr. Scott said.
But the tax department has also clearly set itself up as a target for critics who have argued that taxing wages will sap the state's economy, or at least not help it. Clearly, it has not been helped by the fact that the 1.6 million tax returns that will begin arriving in mailboxes this week were printed in Illinois, Tennessee and Pennsylvania, then addressed and mailed from Wisconsin.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Contradictory Signals Cloud Outlook on Bonds

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
It has been a wonderful six months for credit market participants, as weak economic data and an increasingly concerned Federal Reserve Board allowed interest rates to move in a predictable downward direction. The economy remains weak, but some credit market analysts suggest that the buying and selling of fixed-income securities is going to be a bit more complex over the next weeks and months.
Movements in market interest rates will probably become less predictable for a number of reasons, these analysts said. Chief among these is the still-resonant message sent by the Fed on Dec. 20, when it cut the discount rate by a full point and lowered its target for the overnight Federal funds rate by half a point. 
 The fact that the Fed took such a drastic step has done much to change opinions about the future, some analysts contend. For traders, it has raised the question of whether the steps previously taken would be sufficient to start a rebound.
 
A Paradox View
 "The discount rate cut has changed people's opinions about the outlook," said Thomas Synnott, chief economist and senior vice president of the United States Trust Company. "Part of the reason for the decline in confidence has had to do with the uncertainty as to whether the Government was really concentrating on the economy."
Mr. Synnott and others say the sharp rise in stock prices over the last three weeks indicates how much better people are feeling about the future. And the bond market, which had largely ignored the rally in stocks, seemed to sit up and take notice last week.
"Financial market participants are grappling with the paradox of slowly improving expectations of economic recovery and a lack of supporting data," Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, wrote in the firm's weekly newsletter on the credit market.
Indeed, there are many reasons to buttress the notion that the brighter mood about the future is very fragile.
Chief among them, as Mr. DiClemente noted, are reports that attest to continued weakness in the economy.
The December employment report surprised many economists because it showed that payrolls actually expanded last month; many had expected them to shrink.
But virtually all of the gains were for health-care and government workers. Given the financial condition of most states and localities, analysts said government jobs were unlikely to keep increasing.
A decline of 32,000 in manufacturing jobs put the number of factory workers at the lowest level since March 1983, said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. And private-sector payrolls have not been so low since March 1989.
"These numbers are pretty dismal looking," Mr. Resler said. "Apart from people who want to buy stocks, I find it difficult to see how confidence has been improved."
Despite its recent decisive actions, even the Fed seems on uncertain ground.
In Congressional testimony on Friday, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said he was optimistic that cuts in interest rates engineered by the central bank in recent months would provide "considerable impetus" for economic recovery.
But Mr. Greenspan also used recession-like words like "disinflation" and phrases like "personal and corporate balance sheet restructuring" to explain what is happening to the economy.
"Our gut impression is that the Fed knows no better than the average person what will yet happen to the economy," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants.
To underscore the message he helped to telegraph on Dec. 20, Mr. Greenspan intimated in his testimony last week that if the most recent declines in interest rates were not enough to revive the economy, the Fed would move again.
That note would have reassured the credit markets, were it not for worry about what role Congress and the Administration will play in creating a turnaround.
Some analysts contend that although the concerns are real, they will probably prove to be unfounded.
Fiscal policy initiatives are likely to be modest. Over the last decade, the power of the financial markets and the growing budget deficits have narrowed the options available to legislators.
"Anything that causes any financial market to get hit hard in reaction to proposals from our elected officials results in those proposals being retracted," said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "These are enormously fluid international capital markets, and it is relatively cheap to shift money from market to market if you see something you don't like."
With President Bush back in Washington and his State of the Union Message scarcely two weeks away, the focus on proposals coming out of the capital is likely to intensify.
Of the economic reports expected this week, analysts said that December numbers on retail sales, expected on Tuesday, and on consumer prices, scheduled for Thursday, would probably be most important for participants in the fixed-income markets.
Of the two, the retail sales figures may be more critical, said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust. The sales figures "will be looked to for signs of how much more weakness" in the economy can be expected, Mr. O'Sullivan wrote in a weekly letter to clients.
"Most likely, sales fell sharply in the key December shopping season, pointing to a further run-up in inventories and the need for additional employment and production cutbacks in the months to come," he wrote.
Morgan's analysts are projecting that retail sales took a giant drop of eight-tenths of a percent last month after rising three-tenths of a percent in November.

HEADLINE: For Detroit, Time to Buckle Down

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 12

 BODY:
With token concessions and little relief from President Bush's mission to Japan, the nation's auto industry enters a new and critical phase in which it must seek its own strategies to keep from being overwhelmed by competitors and a floundering economy.
The negotiations last week over America's access to the Japanese automotive market were mostly a sideshow to the American auto industry's overriding concern: how to fix its operations in this country, which are steadily losing ground to Japanese competition. To make matters worse, the industry also suffered a public relations black eye last week as it was cast as a supplicant seeking help from the Japanese Government to sell its wares, an image that could repel even more customers. 
 The chairmen of the Big Three had little choice but to accept the President's invitation to participate in the Japan trade mission. They have gamely sought to portray the trip as helpful in raising business and economic issues to the same level of international importance as military matters or diplomacy.
"We started a meaningful process in Japan and we mean to follow up on it," said Robert C. Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation. "For the first time, Japan saw the power of a joint U.S. Government-industry initiative."
But consciousness-raising won't change the stark reality that the financial might of the Big Three and thousands of suppliers has withered to dangerous levels. With car sales slumping and their market share eroding over the years, Detroit must accelerate the reorganization of its manufacturing, engineering and marketing networks to reduce costs and build better cars and trucks.
Detroit has begun to sweep away the hierarchical bureaucracy that impedes development of new models and execution of business strategies. In its place are "flatter" organizations with fewer bosses and more responsibility at lower levels of the company.
But top executives are candid in saying that lots more must be done. They all speak of too many meetings, memos and tasks unrelated to improving products, sales and customer service. They are avoiding, as Mr. Stempel has often noted, wrenching reorganizations that confuse, anger and upset workers.
The industry's organizational strategies amount to trying to get "a dollar's worth of development for 90 cents," in the words of Alex Trotman, executive vice president at the Ford Motor Company. That will mean more efficiency akin to what the Japanese use in plants and engineering laboratories, with fewer meetings and less activity of all kinds related directly to designing, building and selling vehicles. G.M. and Ford Motor are closely watching the Chrysler Corporation's development process as a possible model for changes. It has been stripped to its essentials because of Chrysler's lean resources.
In Washington, the auto industry also may throw its weight behind protectionist legislation soon to be introduced in Congress. Although passage is uncertain, protection could restrain the sales of Japanese cars, including many models assembled in the United States, at least temporarily.
In the early 1980's, the United States and Japan agreed to what were called voluntary export restraints that limited the number of cars Japan could ship to the United States. The idea was to give Detroit a few years to adjust its product line to the reality of higher gasoline prices.
In retrospect, those restraints are regarded by most Detroit executives as a failure. Japanese auto makers used their limited allocation to ship mostly higher-profit luxury models, which hurt sales of Detroit's highest-profit models. And the restraints encouraged Japanese auto makers to build more plants in the United States; consequently, Japanese auto makers have more political and popular support because they employ many Americans, contribute to charity and, thus, seem less foreign.
The Toyota Motor Company, Japan's largest, as well as other Japanese auto makers have become significant producers and employers in the United States. Toyota estimated that 72,000 workers were directly employed by its factories, dealerships, engineering centers and other installations. This fact poses difficulties for Democrats like Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Representative John Dingell and Senator Donald W. Riegle, both of Michigan, who are proposing to limit sales of Japanese-brand cars and trucks -- even those made in the United States.
Robert B. McCurry, executive vice president of Toyota's American sales operations, naturally opposes such limits and believes they are mis-- directed. "We need solutions, not scapegoats," he said. "Instead of blaming others for what we've become, we need to look in a mirror and ask ourselves what we can do to get back on track."
Mr. McCurry like many American executives now employed by a Japanese auto maker, worked for one of the Big Three, in his case, Chrysler for 28 years.
Also, the National Automobile Dealers Association, representing 19,000 dealers, on Friday proposed reinstatement of the investment tax credit to stimulate business purchases of cars and trucks and a repeal of the luxury tax on vehicles costing more than $30,000.
The industry's public relations could use some polishing as well. The last week clearly has been galling for an industry that never dreamed its leaders one day would find themselves asking the Japanese "to play fair." Lloyd Reuss, president of General Motors, assured reporters previewing the North American International Auto Show in Detroit: "Contrary to what is being written, we have not been defeated."
But that image could stick, given all the news accounts over the last week and the longstanding perception that Japan builds better cars than Detroit. The result could be further defection to foreign makes by Americans fed up with Detroit. On the other hand, Phil Guarascio, head of G.M.'s advertising, believes the week's events in Japan may spark interest in domestic models. "We're seeing some signs," Mr. Guarascio said.
In coming weeks, Detroit is expected to announce 1991 losses that will be the industry's worst ever. Those losses will further impair its ability to invest in new models. G.M. and Ford Motor are "postponing" some future models because there is little cash for development that must be paid for now. Chrysler has bet its last billions on a new Jeep Grand Cherokee utility vehicle that is just coming off the assembly lines, and a series of mid-size cars due later this year. If those models fail, Chrysler's future as an independent company will again be in grave doubt, experts say.

Consumers and Pros Pick Same Commercials as Tops

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WHENEVER advertising executives gather to bestow honors on one another's campaigns -- in other words, every week or so -- they always ask this question: What do consumers, at whom those award-winning ads are aimed, think of them? One awards organization was curious enough to seek an answer.
The New York Festivals, which annually presents awards to international television commercials, has inaugurated a Consumers' Choice Award. At its initial presentation, at the organization's 34th annual awards banquet in Manhattan on Friday, the winner was a humorous spot for DHL Worldwide Courier, created by Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in Sydney, Australia. 
 It turned out that the same spot, in which a cat connives to get DHL to ship a noisy parakeet to Siberia, also won the 1991 Grand Award for best commercial from the ad executives who served as the organization's judges. In fact, the consumers and the ad professionals also agreed on their choice for second place, a whimsical spot created by Hunt Lascaris TBWA in Johannesburg for Nashau color copiers, in which a boy hands out valentines, inscribed, "I love only you," to every girl in school.
"I was expecting some overlapping, but it was a surprise to me they came in exactly the same," said Marcio M. Moreira, chairman of the judges, who is also vice chairman and chief creative officer-international at McCann-Erickson Worldwide.
The award was Mr. Moreira's idea. "Consumers are what the game is all about," he said. "Who in the world sets out to write advertising for their peers?" When it was suggested that those who want to win awards from their peers do that, he replied, "That's irresponsible."
To determine the consumer award's winner, Audits & Surveys Inc., a market research firm, was hired to canvass 202 people in four cities: Buenos Aires, London, New York and Sydney. They were shown the 12 gold-medal winners that the judges scored highest from more than 4,000 initial entries.
"Researchers look for consistencies and confluences," said Solomon Dutka, chairman and chief executive of Audits & Surveys. "So I was pleased." He praised Mr. Moreira "for saying, 'Let's stop talking to ourselves. What is the impact on consumers?' "
On the 10 remaining spots, the opinions of the consumers and the ad professionals diverged. The widest disparity was six places apart; a commercial the judges voted No. 5 was voted No. 11 by the consumers, for instance.
In those cases, said David Silverstone, senior vice president and director of market planning for McCann-Erickson U.S.A., the consumers seemed to favor emotional appeals, like a spot by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, in which a boy shyly gives his teacher a Hallmark card. The professionals, he added, favored well-crafted spots, like one by BBDO Worldwide in New York, in which celebrities from Tiny Tim to Jerry Lewis sing a Diet Pepsi jingle.
Next year, Mr. Moreira said, he would like the organization to expand the consumer participation to at least 10 cities worldwide.
"It's a learning tool and a lesson," he added. "Sometimes, something is so cleverly done that only we in the industry get excited by it."
Three more Grand Awards were presented by the ad professionals. Burnett won for best television campaign, for three spots in a long-running series of offbeat commercials for Cheer detergent. GGK London won for best creative and production achievement, for three animated spots featuring human-like animals for the Electricity Association. And winning for best public service announcement were Contrapunto, an advertising agency, and Film Deluxe, a production company, both of Madrid, for a spot for the Spanish Government promoting condom use.

Looking for the Democratic Vision

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
NEW York's 1992 Democratic presidential primary campaign formally begins this week with two factors, besides Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, missing.
So far, this year's abbreviated campaign in New York has been dominated by electoral mechanics rather than by ideological jousting. No gut issue like the war in Vietnam or the vivid symbolism of a vigorous black candidate divides Democrats. Hungry after 12 years out of the White House, most want to win. 
 "Sensitive people," said Representative Thomas J. Manton, the Queens Democratic leader, "are putting aside their litmus paper."
Since Mr. Manton has endorsed Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the chief beneficiary of organizational support from New York's political and labor leaders, his view may represent short-lived wishful thinking. Things could change if the candidates challenge their rivals' access to the ballot and as their philsophies become more defined.
Another factor that is still missing from the campaign was more predictable: few candidates have focused on an urban agenda.
That was true, too, in previous presidential campaigns. Early primaries are in predominantly rural states, the influence of big cities has declined and urban problems seem so intractable that proposed solutions can represent political liabilities.
Those excuses will be even less valid this year, though. Social and economic woes have gotten worse and are no longer unique to big cities. By comparison, security threats from overseas have largely evaporated.
This week, would-be delegates for the five surviving Democratic candidates begin circulating their green petitions to get on the April 7 primary ballot.
Today, John A. Marino, the Democratic State Chairman, will submit 25 questions to the candidates seeking to define their urban vision in the 12 weeks before the New York primary: How would you cut taxes, invest in human capital and still reduce the deficit? How would you reduce defense spending without harming communities that are dependent on it? How would you increase access to health care and housing? How would you define the Federal role in protecting a woman's right to abortion, in reducing prison overcrowding and in fighting illegal drugs? Should any drugs be legalized? Where do you stand on gun control?
Mr. Marino's questionnaire marks a good beginning, but only a beginning. Ask these questions, too: Which positions do you hold that are regarded as unpopular? What have you accomplished that would not have gotten done without you?
How would you match job training and employment needs? Would you provide drug treatment on demand? Should welfare mothers be required to work? What if they refuse?
What is it about American society that precipitated the drug epidemic? What is government's responsibility in dealing with the failings of family? How would you handle homeless people with mental problems? How would you help people with AIDS?
How would you encourage private developers to build affordable housing? How would you reduce segregation in housing and schools and further bridge ethnic and racial gaps?
And the question that Mr. Cuomo suggested in 1976, which provoked Jimmy Carter's poorly worded pledge to preserve a community's "ethnic purity": Should low-income housing be built in middle- or upper-income neighborhoods?
There are no easy solutions. There are not even easy answers. There will be no answers at all, though, unless somebody asks the questions.
That the three candidates who are leading in early public opinion polls -- Mr. Clinton and Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska -- represent predominantly rural states near the center of the continental United States may signal the nation's priorities.
Presidential candidates bred in a big city have rarely gotten elected. Rarely have Democrats who win the New York primary gone on to win the nomination and the presidency.
But even in New Hampshire, unemployment has tripled since 1988. And last week's withdrawal of Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia may trigger a recognition among the remaining candidates that vague slogans are no substitute for well-defined vision.
Regardless of the outcome April 7, the Democratic nominee will be selected in New York -- at the party's national convention in July. How he answers compelling urban policy questions may determine whether the candidate runs away from New York once the convention is over.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Three Whine Mice ...

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
The Bush mission to Japan was so ill conceived and executed as to raise fundamental doubts about the President's capacity to manage U.S. foreign policy in the post-cold war world.
Here's what the trip shows about Mr. Bush: 
 * He doesn't understand that international power now depends on domestic economic strength. And so, he went to Japan in the worst possible position -- to bash on bended knee.
* Neither he nor his closest advisers know the first thing about Japan, perhaps the country that will have the most profound impact on U.S. interests. In their ignorance, they unleashed a whole new level of Japanese contempt for America, an attitude that could have the direst consequences.
* He doesn't get the point that he ought to be fighting to open up markets for American industries that can compete, not those that don't. Because of that, he used up his chips on U.S. automotive manufacturers, the least worthy of help.
* He hasn't begun to tailor his Government toward the new agenda in world politics, namely the issues of trade and competitiveness and the connections between foreign and domestic affairs. Just look at who didn't accompany the President to Tokyo -- Secretary of State James Baker and Carla Hills, the chief trade negotiator.
All these Bush weaknesses were hidden by his skillful handling of the Persian Gulf war (until its end game) and the devolution of Soviet power. Mr. Bush is good at the old security and power issues. He knows how to muscle other nations on such matters, and that's useful . . . on such matters.
But economic issues, the heart of new world politics, are not such matters. Power in this world turns on internal economic strength. By that measure, the U.S. is in relative decline -- on education, infrastructure, the running of many traditional industries and self-discipline.
Mr. Bush seems to perceive this central fact only dimly. What he did in Tokyo proceeded from weakness and not strength. That's why he missed the point that his muscling actually came across as begging.
His bashing on bended knee generated only contempt in Japan. And it is deadly dangerous for Japanese to harbor such feelings toward America. Respect for America helps to contain a Japanese cultural arrogance ever close to the surface and always threatening. Regard for America helps to anchor a Japanese democracy ever fearful of being overloaded by conflicts.
Mindful of these inner demons, Japan's leaders wanted to stay close to the U.S. Their main and unrealized aim for the Bush trip was to form a global partnership. But that idea is now sinking in a new contempt for America that could cause Tokyo to assert itself in ways all will regret. Clashing Japanese and American titans could unhinge the fragile democracies of Asia, further unnerve a churning China and destroy prospects for freeing world trade.
Mr. Bush seemed particularly unprepared in Tokyo, arriving without a viable trade strategy. He should have been helping to clear away Japanese hurdles to dynamic American businesses that know how to compete -- like services, telecommunications, computers and construction.
Instead, he hitched his and America's prestige to the Big Three automobile whiners who, along with Mr. Bush, had to be among the select few blind to the looming catastrophe. These whiners are the guys who pay themselves more than 100 times their workers' salaries, or 10 times higher than their Japanese counterparts; who raise their compensation even as their companies' profits plummet, and who cry about not being able to sell left-hand-drive American cars in Japan when the Japanese drive from the right side.
Even into his fourth year, Mr. Bush simply isn't organized to think about and manage these critical trade and economic issues. His emphasis in staff and structure remains on the old security agenda. That -- and the upcoming Presidential elections -- explain why the policy people like Mr. Baker and Ms. Hills got brushed aside and the Bush pols took over the President's Asia trip.
Mr. Bush's judgments throughout the Japan trip were deeply flawed. And the questions are now inescapable: Does he comprehend his mistakes? Can he change and lead America in today's world of power and diplomacy?

The April Surprise

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Last week, approaching the first anniversary of Desert Storm, George Bush again called on the Iraqi people to "take matters into their own hands and get [Saddam Hussein] out of there . . ."
That caused much wincing among the Kurds and Shiites who rose up in the aftermath of our stop-short victory last winter. 
 They trusted Mr. Bush to suppress the Iraqi helicopter gunships, but Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, in his own word, was "suckered." Mr. Bush, persuaded by Brent Scowcroft and James Baker on March 26, 1991 -- the turning point of his Presidency -- that a Kurdish victory would lead to "dismemberment" of Iraq, allowed the rebels who answered his oust-Saddam invitation to be slaughtered.
We will hear much this week about the wisdom of the war. Democrats who opposed it were at first embarrassed by its success, and will now disparage its results. Thanks to the moral cowardice of March 26, Mr. Bush snatched defeat from the jaws of victory: Saddam remains in power, persecuting his people, and the Kuwait we restored remains a feudal fiefdom.
Through all the posterior-covering denigration, let us remember what would surely have happened had we not struck decisively to drive Iraq from Kuwait. Bad enough that Saddam Hussein would have dominated the world's supply of oil, driving up the price, adding inflation to recession; much more important, he would now be a nuclear power.
That, lest we forget, was what the war was about. Not for the noble spirit of collective security, though that was a part; not for "jobs," as Secretary Baker insisted, a political bleat echoed thrice in Mr. Bush's recent Japanese rejection; not to allow the royal family in Kuwait to force an exodus of its Palestinians, and not to exorcise our Vietnam syndrome, making us feel good by flexing our muscular technology.
When the debate was going on before we struck, the single argument that got through to the American people was this: Saddam Hussein, a ruthless murderer and aggressor, was within a year of developing a nuclear device. American security would be at stake, and ultimately American cities at risk of atomic destruction.
Though that was pooh-poohed at the time as deliberate disinformation to stimulate war hysteria (and the C.I.A., misleading most of our media, was still in its dream world of "5 to 10 years away"), we now have on-site proof that Iraqi scientists were well on their way to bomb production. Riyadh, Tel Aviv and Cairo would be under nuclear blackmail today, with Paris and New York vulnerable to Baghdad's nuclear-tipped missiles next year.
Thanks to George Bush's courageous initial decision, overriding Sam Nunn's wrongheaded talk of delays for unworkable sanctions, the world dodged that bullet. Iraqi nuclear production was set back.
But not destroyed. The threat -- not as immediate, but now more widely understood to be real -- has once more begun to grow. Both Iraq and Iran are obtaining technology and materials from China and from K.G.B. renegades, easily hiding it from U.N. inspection teams.
Mr. Bush knows that he will have to return to Saddam Hussein. As Manuel Noriega can testify, this American President is better the second time around. He has asked the Joint Chiefs for a plan to strike again. The Pentagon replies: for the coup, try the covert boys across the river next time -- test ye everlasting Gates.
Perhaps we will see a U.N. relief column to the starving, freezing Kurds through Iraqi territory, with an aerial counterattack if it is stopped; or a similar reaction to a refusal to allow inspectors into areas where mass-destruction weapons are being made. The military punishment would be accompanied this time by a coordinated internal Arab-Kurdish uprising (with a freelance Mossad backup if all else fails; the Scud attacks have not yet been answered).
A majority of Americans may not support a war to save the Kurds from genocide. But most Americans would cheer overt-covert aid to a Kurdish-Shiite uprising to drive Saddam from Baghdad -- if convinced the overthrow will stop a terrorist threat to American cities. Even America-Firsters can handle that. And Iranians planning a similar nuclear buildup would get the message.
When? An October "surprise" would be too obviously political. Much depends on Saddam's cooperative recalcitrance, but some of our spooks expect a balloon up in April or May.

HEADLINE: Race and Crime: Let's Talk Sense

BYLINE: By Barney Frank; Barney Frank, Democratic Representative of Massachusetts, is author of "Speaking Frankly," from which this article is excerpted.

 BODY:
Crime has become -- for conservatives and liberals -- a marker for race. If America were a racially homogenous country, the crime problem would not be a significant factor in Presidential elections.
For most of this century, crime was not an issue in national elections, and certainly was not the problem for liberals it has since become. Then came the 1960's, when the growth of violent crime in the cities and active, vigorous civil disobedience by antiwar protesters helped cement the impression that liberals supported the disturbers of the peace. 
 The police response to these actions became a major issue, especially after the Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968. A willingness to speak out against police brutality and other misconduct became very important for those seeking support from the increasingly organized and vocal left.
The unhappy consequence of all this was that just as many Americans were becoming more frightened of crime, more unhappy at disorder and more supportive of strong police action, they saw liberals explaining away the actions of the lawless and harshly criticizing the police. Most important, for many white Americans the fear of crime became a fear of crime by young black males.
The first Republican efforts to take advantage of this in the Nixon-Agnew law-and-order campaign in the 1970 Congressional elections fell short. But as fear of violent crime became more and more a factor in American life, the notion that the Democrats were soft on crime took on more political strength. And the racial element of the crime question merged with the perception that Democrats were so much the prisoners of special interests that we wouldn't even support tough anticrime measures lest we offend some of these groups.
For many swing voters specifically, Democrats appear unwilling to stand up firmly against criminals because we fear alienating black voters. Of all the political misperceptions from which we liberals suffer, this is the worst -- the least accurate, the most socially pernicious and the most politically corrosive.
It is also the one where all of our internal contradictions, guilt feelings, and disabling cultural lags work against an effective Democratic response. Unfortunately, especially for Michael Dukakis, these elements came together perfectly for the Republicans in 1988 in the person of Willie Horton.
Race and crime together show the "notsaposta" syndrome at its worst. Liberals are notsaposta take note publicly of the fact that young black males commit street crimes in a significantly higher proportion than any other major demographic group. We are notsaposta admit this because we fear that if we do, we will give aid and comfort to those who will draw wholly inaccurate, racist inferences about African Americans and crime.
What happens, of course, is that liberal efforts to ignore the racial aspect of crime today rarely work, and when we do address the issue, we do so defensively and in a manner that exacerbates our political difficulty without effectively combating racism. Liberals over-argue the point that social and economic conditions are the cause of crime. By asking people to believe too much of this argument, we end up with their not believing as much of it as they should.
Of course, the point that social and economic conditions heavily influence the crime rate should be central to the liberal approach to this issue. And given the history of racism in this country, African Americans suffer most from these conditions and most often manifest their effects.
But we must avoid the mistake of appearing to be justifying -- or even mitigating -- the actions of individual criminals by stressing the poverty and racism around them as if that made their actions less heinous. Poverty, racism, social disorganization all explain the prevalence of crime to some extent, but in no way do they justify it. We liberals have allowed ourselves to be restrained from saying what the public at large wants -- and has every right -- to hear: that people who assault, rape, rob, or otherwise terrorize others are bad people from whom the innocent majority must be protected.
Nothing causes liberals more political harm than the perception that we are as sympathetic to criminals as we are to their victims.
A related mistake liberals make is to use the bad social conditions that lead to crime as if they were an argument that will help persuade people to support social equity programs. In effect, we are telling voters who bitterly resent the incursions that crime has made on their lives that if we improve welfare benefits, fix up public housing, provide more job opportunities for minority teen-agers and do a better job of integrating our work force, the beneficiaries of this largesse will be less inclined to rob or beat them. This does not advance our chances of success.
What happens through this process is that a series of morally justified, sensible programs to improve social conditions comes to look like a form of sophisticated bribery. Measures to combat racism and reduce inequality have a far better chance of gaining support when they are defended on their inherent merits than when they are presented in a way that makes the swing voter see them as preferred rewards to get people to stop behavior that they should never have adopted in the first place.

HEADLINE: Now Let's Learn Self-Help From the Japanese

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Don't Look for Jobs in Japan" (editorial, Jan. 6), you assert that "the number of employed Americans is unrelated to the size of the trade deficit" and invoke the experience of the 1980's, when full employment accompanied the huge trade deficits. 
 But, how were those people employed in the 80's? You ignore the basic restructuring of our economy away from manufacturing and toward the service sector, a trend that began before the 80's but accelerated with the economic fuel of the Reagan tax cuts. Increasingly, Americans were employed in a sophisticated broker network, marketing and servicing imported manufactured goods. In balance, we exported plenty of manufacturing jobs and capital.
Our living standards were "improved" by the availability of less costly imports, but at the expense of our economic strength today.
Yes, the trade deficits are home-grown, and certainly not made in Japan. But it is a United States Government responsibility to do something about them. When the financial decision makers in American business are not rewarded for keeping their factories open and modernized, but are instead encouraged to manufacture their goods abroad, with immediate benefits to the bottom line, you have the incentives stacked against the United States, and our manufacturing jobs are exported. When American consumers have no American alternatives to the goods they wish to buy, our capital flows out of the country.
The Japanese are not to blame for taking advantage of our gluttonous consumption of consumer durables, regardless of the country of origin. It has been smart business for them to purchase our Treasury bills and feed our coffers, so we could keep shifting our manufacturing base to Japan.
And it is not the formal Japanese trade barriers to foreign goods that make the Japanese resistant to American products. It is their desire to purchase products from their own country. The same can be seen in our European trading partners. Japanese trade barriers to a foreign product are only eased when a Japanese competitor has been safely established.
You state that the Japanese have been losers because their standard of living has suffered, that they have not had access to foreign goods that were better value than Japanese-made goods. If only we had made the same sacrifices! Look at their economic growth, their national savings, their overall prosperity.
Neither is it a given that if we bought fewer Japanese cars, the consequence would be fewer American goods exported to Japan because of increase in the value of the dollar. The Japanese will buy the American products they cannot live without. During the years that the yen more than doubled in value, exports of Japanese products, in units, to the United States continued to rise. A strong dollar, not a weak currency, is the envy of the world, and if the return of manufacturing to America leads to a stronger dollar, that would only be to our benefit. We would buy their companies and land, not the reverse.
Yes, we Americans would be better off if we did not outspend our income. However, you call for further lowering of interest rates or a reduction in taxes and an increase in Government spending. All of which might not be injurious to the economy in the long run, if we recycled the capital and did not use it to buy so many foreign goods. But unless we use such a capital infusion toward rebuilding our manufacturing base, those measures would produce a short-lived recovery.
In addition to them, we must also make sure we restructure to deliver longer-term economic health, and not just a temporary kick. That will mean altering our tax structure to favor savings and investment, particularly investment in manufacturing plants here. And it will require leadership to make it clear that American consumers should favor American products, when given the alternative. And that is good common sense, not unfair trade policy.

HEADLINE: As West and South Grow, Northeast Continues Slip

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Americans continue to abandon the Northeast for the West and South, making Nevada, Alaska and Idaho the fastest-growing states since the 1990 census, the Census Bureau says in a new report.
"We're still abandoning cities in the Northeast to a large degree and building up new ones elsewhere," said Carl Haub, a demographer at the Population Reference Bureau, a research group based in Washington. 
 The report covers population changes for April 1990 through July 1991. Unlike the 1990 census, which was based on house-to-house surveys, the new report consists of estimates based on state records like utility accounts and birth and death rates.
The estimates showed that the nation's population as a whole grew 1.4 percent during the period, which the Census Bureau said works out to an annual growth rate of 1.1 percent.
 
Feeling the Slump
 Population growth was far below that in the Northeast because of the economic slump, it said. New York State's population grew 0.4 percent, to 18,058,000; Connecticut's grew 0.1 percent, to 3,291,000, and New Jersey's grew 0.4 percent, to 7,760,000.
The estimates showed that population continues to shift to the South and West, a trend that began more than 30 years ago.
Nevada's population jumped by an estimated 6.8 percent during the period, to 1.28 million; Alaska grew by 3.7 percent, to 570,000 people, and Idaho gained 3.2 percent, to 1.04 million.
The Census Bureau cited the economic downturn in New England as the reason for the small increases in Maine and Vermont and the population losses in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The only other places to show declines were North Dakota and the District of Columbia.
 
Growth in Midwest
 In the Midwest, population growth increased notably from April 1990 to July 1991. Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota, which reported losses from 1985 to 1990, showed small increases in the latest figures. Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin showed much higher growth rates than from 1985 to 1990.
"The Midwest has stopped losing people at the rate it once did," Mr. Haub said. He added that the gain of about 500,000 people during the latest period was due mainly to reduced migration from the region, rather than new people moving there.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 14, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart yesterday showing population growth since the 1990 census mislabeled figures for three states in some copies. Alaska grew from 550,000 to 570,000 between 1990 and 1991, an increase of 3.7 percent; Arizona grew from 3,665,000 to 3,750,000, an increase of 2.3 percent, and Arkansas grew from 2,351,000 to 2,372,000, an increase of 0.9 percent.

HEADLINE: 2d Wall St. Agency Downgrades Bond Rating for New York State

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Going beyond the censure issued last week by another Wall Street credit monitor, Standard & Poor's today lowered its rating on a wide range of New York State securities, including the bonds regarded as the state's safest investment.
The downgrading will force a state that is struggling to close multibillion-dollar budget gaps to pay millions of dollars in additional interest costs on the sale of new bonds. Just as damaging, it may also affect the creditworthiness of bonds sold by dozens of school districts from East Islip to Niagara Falls. 
 If the state's credit rating drags down school district credit ratings, school boards already facing the prospect of devastating cuts in state aid will also have to pay more to borrow. As a result, several superintendents predicted today that they will have to consider deep cuts in staff and instructional programs or higher property taxes, or both.
 
Far More Damaging
 Because the downgrading by Standard & Poor's affects virtually all of the state's debt, including its general-obligation bonds, it is considered far more damaging than last week's downgrading by Moody's Investors Service.
Standard & Poor's announced about 11 A.M. today that it had dropped the rating on the state's general-obligation bonds from A to A-, the state's lowest level ever. New York, which had been tied with Louisiana for the second-lowest general-obligation bond rating, now claims sole possession of that dubious distinction. Only Massachusetts, with a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB, is lower.
None of the state's school districts were downgraded today. But Vladimir Stadnyk, a managing director with Standard & Poor's who is the chairman of the rating committee who voted to approve the downgrading, said it was possible that some of the 40 school districts with A ratings would also be downgraded after a case-by-case review, which is expected to take several weeks.
Last Monday, Moody's lowered the rating on what is known as the state's appropriation-backed debt but did not change the rating on general-obligation bonds, which are the state's most secure debt instrument.
Unlike appropriation-backed debt, which must be repaid through annual appropriations by the State Legislature, general-obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the government. Their repayment is the first obligation of the state's revenues. At least theoretically, the repayment of appropriation-backed debt must compete for resources with the state's other fiscal demands.
Standard & Poor's, like Moody's before it, attributed the downgrading to a confluence of factors that included the continuing deterioration of the New York economy, the state's chronic operating deficits and the stalemate over the state budget. The agency stressed that the recurring failure of New York's political leaders to deal with its budget difficulties had fueled a crisis of confidence on Wall Street.
"Failure by legislative and executive leaders to come to a consensus resolution -- not only of the fiscal 1992 financial imbalance but also of the chronic structural budgetary imbalances -- in a timely and permanent manner significantly increases credit risk," said a statement released by Standard & Poor's. "Current and past legislative standoffs provide little comfort that ongoing financial balance is forthcoming."
Wall Street bond traders said the downgrading pushed down bids on outstanding New York State agency securities by as much as three-fourths of a point, or about $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount of bonds.
But given the current low level of interest rates, demand for New York State securities is likely to remain fairly robust, traders said.
 
'A Real Problem'
 "They've got a real problem up there," one trader said. "But there certainly doesn't appear to be much risk that New York won't honor its obligations as they mature."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo agreed. "The notion that this suggests that maybe you won't pay your debts is a joke when it comes to New York," he said. "But there are a lot of things that are dumb that you have to accommodate in this life, and this is one we should have been able to accommodate."
Almost ritualistically, state officials reacted to the downgrading with news releases and news conferences but offered little hope that the budget impasse would be resolved anytime soon. For more than two months, Mr. Cuomo has been negotiating unsuccessfully with the leaders of the Legislature to craft a plan to close the $875 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget and the gap of nearly $4 billion projected for the next fiscal year, which begins on April 1.
Mr. Cuomo called the downgrading "a disgrace" and said it seemed likely the state would end its fiscal year on March 31 with a budget deficit of nearly $500 million. He said the state would have to borrow for the fourth consecutive year to erase the deficit, adding to the accumulated debt disparaged by Standard & Poor's.
Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, said, "For four weeks, I've been warning that the state was sliding closer to the brink. Today is the brink."
And the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., used the downgrading to reinforce his call for deeper cuts in the state's Medicaid program. He said the downgradings encouraged him to stand his ground rather than to compromise. "The time to say no is now," Mr. Marino said.
Because state aid to schools can be used to repay school district bonds if school boards cannot afford to do so, rating agencies use the state's credit rating as a floor for district ratings, Mr. Stadnyk of Standard & Poor's said. As of today, that floor was lowered from A to A-, and Standard & Poor's began evaluating the ratings of the 40 districts with A ratings.
School officials around the state expressed frustration that they might become the innocent victims of the state's financial failures.
 
'No Fault of Their Own'
 "The school boards are being told that because the Legislature and Governor can't get their houses in order, they're going to get hit through no fault of their own," said Louis Grumet, the executive director of the New York State School Boards Association.
Anthony J. Napoli, the Superintendent of the Port Chester-Rye Union Free School District in Westchester County, which has an A rating, said a downgrading would be a capping blow in a year when his district's state aid was cut by 30 percent and property tax revenues were softened by a weak real-estate market.
"I can't keep going back and raising property taxes," he said. "So we'll have to cut staff, physical maintenance, sports programs and programs for gifted students."

HEADLINE: Israel Is Said to Expect Less In Loan Aid for Immigrants

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Israel's leaders are increasingly resigned to the likelihood that they will have to settle for far less than the $10 billion in United States loan guarantees that they are seeking to resettle new immigrants, Government officials and representatives of American Jewish groups say.
Although the Israelis are formally pressing ahead with their request -- $2 billion worth of annual loan guarantees spread over the next five years -- "they are accepting the inevitable," an official of one Jewish group said. 
 That inevitability, several officials said, is that Israel will be lucky now to get a $2-billion commitment for a single year. Even if it does, they said, it will almost certainly have hundreds of millions of dollars chipped away from the total as a penalty for the Government's insistence on building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories in the face of the Administration's vociferous objections.
 
New Taxes Considered
 As a sign that the Israelis recognize they probably will not get all that they want, the Finance Ministry is said to be studying alternatives, including new taxes, to cover additional borrowing costs that the country may face if it does not get the American assistance.
According to one newspaper report, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai, who counted on getting a full $2 billion in guarantees to keep his 1992 budget together, has asked for a list of the world's wealthiest Jews, so that he can turn to them for help if the United States fails to come through. But an official of an American Jewish group cautioned, "There is no way in my mind that American Jewry can make up this enormous shortfall."
The requested guarantees, which are not actual loans but rather an American commitment to be ready to provide money in case Israel defaults, would enable this country to get relatively favorable interest rates from commercial banks for the billions of dollars it expects to borrow. Assuming Israel does not default -- and officials here insist that that will not happen -- the actual cost to the United States will probably be a few hundred million dollars that must be set aside under new budget rules.
Israeli economists warn that times will get tougher here if the loan guarantees fall through. At the least, they say, it will be appreciably more difficult for Israel to absorb 1 million Jews from the former Soviet Union who are expected to arrive by 1995.
When the aid issue first arose last September, President Bush demanded that Congressional debate be postponed for 120 days so as not to complicate the nascent Middle East peace process. That decision led to one of the nastier disputes in many years between Israel and the United States.
Now the waiting period is about to expire, and although both sides are trying to keep the discussions on a lower key this time, bruised feelings are apparent all around.
For one thing, Israeli officials acknowledge that the mood in the United States has turned against foreign aid. For another, Mr. Bush is strongly opposed to Israel's settlement-building in its occupied territories, and the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has been warned by a series of visiting members of Congress and American Jewish leaders that the President is more fervent than ever on this matter.
But Israel has dug in its heels, thereby potentially inviting the sort of confrontation with Washington that it says it wants to avoid.
If anything, settlement housing in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip is by certain yardsticks being erected at an accelerated pace. Two-thirds of the new houses and apartments anticipated in the 1992 budget are to be built in the territories. Moreover, documents put together by the Housing Ministry and disclosed last week by two opposition legislators show that 21,000 housing units had been started over the last 18 months in the territories and the Golan Heights, annexed in 1981.
Altogether, the lawmakers estimated that the construction program had totaled $1.5 billion and accounted for 25 percent of the Government's public-housing budget for that period.
Leaders of some American Jewish groups are plainly angry with Mr. Shamir, both for putting them in a difficult bargaining spot with the White House and for spending limited resources on an ideological goal that they argue means far less money to resettle newly arrived Jews and to combat spreading poverty in Israel proper.
One widely accepted view is that the Israel is ready to "take a hit," as one knowledgeable person put it. That means going along with a formula that would reduce the value of the loan guarantees by an amount equivalent to what Israel spends on settlements.
According to estimates, a $2 billion program for one year could be cut by a quarter or even one half under such a formula.

HEADLINE: Bush Raises Trade Issue In Bid for Farm Support

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Jan. 13

 BODY:
In a speech laced with patriotic slogans, promises of economic recovery and defensiveness about his recent Pacific trip, President Bush appealed for support from American farmers in the first of several ventures before the start of the Presidential primaries.
Appearing before the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual meeting here, Mr. Bush previewed the themes of his re-election campaign, presenting himself as the candidate "savvy" enough to maintain America's position of leadership in the world. 
 "Do not listen to those prophets of doom, those frantic politicians who say we are a second-class power," Mr. Bush said, nearly shouting in his appearance at the Municipal Auditorium. Proclaiming that the war against Iraq had "lifted the spirits of our nation," Mr. Bush added, "We are the undisputed, respected leader of the world. We are the U.S.A."
 
New Hampshire Looms
 Because Mr. Bush has yet to announce his candidacy for re-election and because he was speaking to a national business organization, the White House was able to list today's trip as "official" and charge it to the Federal Government, not to the Bush-Quayle campaign.
But virtually everything Mr. Bush now does is seen by the White House as part of his re-election effort and today's trip was one of several forays around the country that the President will make in the five weeks remaining before the Feb. 18 New Hampshire primary. On Wednesday, he will make his first trip to New Hampshire and on Friday he will fly to Atlanta to commemorate the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Clearly stung by heavy criticism of his recent trip, weeks of attacks on his economic policies by Democrats and conservative Republicans and concern about his health, Mr. Bush seemed to be intent on portraying himself in his speech as a strong leader prepared to champion American business interests abroad. But today's speech also underscored some of the political problems facing Mr. Bush in his re-election bid. These include the conflict between his strong anti-protectionist stance and his insistence, repeated here today, on keeping American farm subsidies in place.
While Mr. Bush was warmly received here as he tried to address the economic concerns of American farmers, the difficulties he faces in courting the farm vote also were clear.
Speaking before Mr. Bush, Dean Kleckner, President of the Federation, offered a stinging attack on the Federal Government and on the 1990 budget deal between the White House and Congress. The agreement, which sets specific limits on government spending for the military and social and other programs, is the cornerstone of Mr. Bush's economic policies.
Declaring that "Republicans and Democrats are equally guilty," Mr. Kleckner added: "Our Government's economic policy, if you could call it that, refuses to recognize the need to reduce spending. A year ago, to reduce the budget deficit, a deal was made to cut spending and raise taxes. We got half that deal -- higher taxes."
Mr. Kleckner said the Federal Government should "scrap" the 1990 budget agreement. The President has made clear that while he is willing to renegotiate the balance of spending within budget categories, he has said he is not willing to jettison the overall budget agreement.
 
Anxious About Support
 Mr. Bush's critics have said his visit to Japan last week failed to produce any significant agreements on lowering Japanese barriers to American trade, and the White House launched an effort to counter those assertions as soon as Mr. Bush set foot on American soil last Friday.
Today, Mr. Bush called the visit to Japan "an important and successful step" toward a new trade balance. "Some political critics say I should not have taken this trip," he said. "Wrong! I will continue to fight for American jobs -- everywhere."
Mr. Bush acknowledged that agricultural export subsidies "stifle growth, burden the taxpayer, cost consumers and make industry less competitive." But, keenly aware that he needs the support of American farmers and anxious not to surrender any leverage in ongoing talks aimed at lowering trade barriers worldwide, Mr. Bush said, "I also know that I must -- and will -- safeguard the interests of American farming. I will not let American agriculture disarm unilaterally."
In the global trade talks, the United States is demanding that the European Community end its broad farm subsidy program as part of an effort to achieve a more equitable balance of world trade, but the Europeans have so far refused to make any concessions and Mr. Bush repeated today that he would not reduce American subsidies until that happens.

HEADLINE: G.M. Announces Recall To Repair V6 Engines

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 13

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation confirmed today that it was recalling about 1.5 million cars to repair defective V6 engines.
The announcement comes at an awkward time for G.M. as it tries to win back American customers by saying that the quality of its cars matches that of Japanese autos. 
 The recall had been under way for about six weeks, but was first made public in the Jan. 13 issue of Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade newsletter, which did not disclose how it learned of the action. Recalls are never good for an auto maker's image and are often kept quiet when they do not involve safety.
Among the cars affected by the announcement are several models of 1986 and 1987 Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac, compact, midsize and large. The cars are equipped with either a 3-liter or 3.8-liter engine. A G.M. spokesman said as many as a quarter of the engines covered by the recall tended to stall when starting or at normal driving speeds.
With the economy soft and the market share of foreign cars increasing, G.M. and other American auto makers have been trying to persuade shoppers that the latest models erase the perceived gap in quality between American and Japanese vehicles.
The American auto makers are also using that argument in pressing for more access to the Japanese market. The chairmen of the three big auto makers asserted last week in Japan that that country's inspection and certification procedures are used to exclude American autos. Japan says they are used to spot defects.
Back in the United States, Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, and other company executives have complained that many Americans will not consider buying G.M. models because of defects in those sold in the mid-1980's and earlier.
The recall also underscores a problem for consumers: How can they be sure that current G.M. models will not develop similar problems? In the case of the flawed V6 engines, a G.M. spokesman said, the problem was not determined until July 1990, nearly five years after the first were built.
The company initially fixed the defective engines under its warranty program. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently said that sudden stalling could be a safety problem, and the company decided to notify all owners of the cars affected that the engines would be inspected and repaired without charge.
The offer of repair or reimbursement expires at the end of 1992, or when the vehicle has 100,000 miles, whichever comes first.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reviewing Ways to Prevent Flipping of Cars

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
The Federal highway safety agency has begun reviewing how to prevent thousands of the most dangerous automobile accidents, those in which a vehicle tumbles out of control and rolls over.
The review could lead to mandatory design changes in many small cars, pickup trucks and sporty off-road vehicles. Depending on what changes are required, prices of these vehicles, including some of Detroit's hottest sellers in recent years, could increase by hundreds of dollars. Some models might even be discontinued if they could not be made safer. 
 About 10,000 people are killed every year in the United States when the vehicles in which they are riding overturn. That number has been growing as cars get smaller and light trucks become more popular.
 
Lifesaving Measure
 Some lifesaving measures might be relatively straightforward, like requiring automatic seat belts, which alone might eliminate more than half of the fatalities in cases when people are flung from tumbling cars. Current regulations do not require automatic seat belts in vehicles that have air bags, which do not help prevent ejections from rolling cars.
Other measures might be considerably more difficult to devise, and potentially much more costly to implement.
Among the types of changes that could be required are lowering the center of gravity of some cars by requiring wider wheel bases; improving drivers' control over their vehicles by requiring anti-lock brakes; improving the chances of surviving an overturn by installing stronger roofs, and consumer education, perhaps using window stickers to identify the most dangerous types of vehicles.
Despite years of pressure from safety advocates, the Federal safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, has never before proposed performance standards to reduce deaths from this kind of accident.
 
'Significant Safety Rule'
 "This is the agency's most significant safety rule right now," said Barry Felrice, the highway safety agency's associate administrator for rule making. "It deals with the largest safety problem that we are working on right now."
Brian O'Neill of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research organization in Arlington, Va., said: "Potentially it is very important, but there are many difficulties ahead if the rule making is really going to have an impact. If they are going to make a difference, they have to influence the design of the vehicle. What they face if they issue regulations that are going to have any effect is very, very strong opposition from the manufacturers."
The prospect of new rules is of particular concern to Detroit's three major car manufacturer's, since the domestic industry has been battered by imports as well as the lingering recession. But officials of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which represents the auto makers, said they had not yet presented their views on the issue to the Government.
"Roll-over rule making is inevitable," said David R. Houston, a safety expert at the Ford Motor Company. "The Congress wants it, the consumer people want it, and there is tremendous pressure on N.H.T.S.A. to come up with something."
While the automobile industry is anxious, he said, its objective is not to block regulations, but to "help come up with a rule that is good for the motoring public."
 
New Rules Required
 The transportation law approved in Congress last year requires the safety agency to write new rules within the next two years to prevent such accidents, and although the agency had already announced plans to begin its review and issue proposals this year the topic is so complex that the full two years are likely to be taken. It might then take auto makers years to completely adopt whatever design changes are ordered.
The agency announced its review early this month in a formal notice seeking comments from the industry, consumers and other interested parties. The notice included a broad range of possible measures that the agency wants to study.
The safety review could fuel a continuing debate within the Bush Administration over how far the Federal Government should go in writing regulations when both the benefits to consumers and the costs to businesses are potentially great.
So far, the highway safety agency has published no estimate of either the costs or the benefits of the actions it is considering. That will not be possible until the agency decides how it wants to go about solving the problem.
One possibility would be simply to put test vehicles on a tilting platform and measure the inclination at which the wheels on the uphill side lift up. Under this approach, vehicles that begin to overturn at relatively slight angles would have to be redesigned.
 
Reducing Highway Deaths
 More complicated approaches would make other changes in vehicles so as to prevent the skidding that often leads to overturns, or to protect passengers from being crushed or ejected from a rolling car.
In newly published technical documents, the agency calls such accidents "the most dangerous collision type" based on the rate of death and serious injury per person involved.
Among the leading causes of highway deaths, only head-on collisions and accidents involving alcohol rival overturns, safety experts say.
The highway agency has taken on the problem at a time of significant progress in reducing highway deaths. Through a combination of new laws, driver education, road improvements and changes in car designs, among other things, the highway death rate in the United States dropped 7 percent last year, to about 41,000. That was the lowest number of highway deaths since 1962.
The agency is not considering simply outlawing types of vehicles that tend to overturn most easily, like all-terrain vehicles. But it could order drastic design changes in the worst cases. It might also decide to set performance standards only for some types of vehicles, exempting those that are already less likely to overturn.
"We are taking a kind of scattergun approach," said Mr. Felrice of the safety agency. "We really have not narrowed our focus yet.
"We would like to be able to do something in the crash-avoidance area," he added. "To keep the vehicle from rolling over, that is the ideal solution. We are not certain how to do that, or whether we will be able to do so."
One of the leading ideas, he said, is to require anti-lock brakes on vehicles that are known to frequently overturn. The agency is seeking detailed comments from experts on this and other ideas.

HEADLINE: Pension Fund's Housing Effort

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13

 BODY:
California's public-employee pension fund said today that it would invest up to $225 million to build homes as part of an effort to help the state's depressed housing market.
Officials said it was the first time the California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, with an investment portfolio of nearly $60 billion, had budgeted money to invest in residential real estate, a field that pension funds generally avoid. 
 The decision illustrated the growing pressure on funds from elected officials to invest in their own states.
"Housing is the backbone of the California economy, and this investment means more construction jobs," said Gray Davis, the state controller, a Democrat who is a member of the fund's board.

HEADLINE: Big Denver Cattle Show Reflects Sunset on West

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Al Rose, a tall, craggy 66-year-old rancher, leaned an elbow against a fence post and watched a handsome Hereford strut past the reviewing stand at the National Western Stock Show. "Used to be, almost everyone I knew was a rancher," he said, tipping back his Stetson. "But there just aren't many of us left out in the country anymore."
But even as so many cowboys fade from the range, this most powerful of American myths only grows stronger. To many urbanites who rope their paychecks from behind computer terminals and glass-covered desks, the ranch has become the nation's most exotic place. 
 This year, the 14-day Denver Livestock and Rodeo Show, which has been called the "Super Bowl of cattle shows," aims to surpass last year's record attendance of more than 500,000. And across the country, there is an extraordinary appetite for rural and western symbols.
Garth Brooks, the country singer, sold more albums last year than any other musician in any category. The movie "City Slickers" and "Dances with Wolves" were wildly successful. Old West tourism has been shattering records. The recent spring fashion show in Europe was replete with "Cowgirl Chic."
"No question about it, the American cowboy is riding back at full bore," said Jack Ravage, a professor at the University of Wyoming and expert on western pop culture. "The sociologists would point to the breakup of the family and say we're looking for the mythic, nuclear family. And some people would just say we like antiques."
 
Life Styles Under Siege
 And antiques are just what ranchers fear they are becoming, or something. For all the popularity of cowboys, ranchers say they are under siege. Price supports for farmers have been cut. Environmentalists, who now outnumber ranchers, are pressing for a reduction of grazing on public lands. Red meat and eggs have become illicit substances for many people.
The number of ranchers has dropped by nearly half since the 1960's. And the average age has risen to 59, as fewer young people have been willing, or financially able, to bear the risks and hardships of working the land.
"I'd like to ranch full time, like my dad did, but there's just no way," said Dan Webster, as he ran his hand across the back of Mocha, a South Devon breed heifer in competition at the show.
Mr. Webster, a 30-year-old graduate of the University of Wyoming, works as a computer operator in Gillette. In his spare time, he works as a ranch hand, his first love.
 
The Trend to Bigger
 "When my dad was a young man in South Dakota, you could lease 300 acres for little or nothing, buy a few cows and you're in the cattle business," he said. "But now it's mostly big operations. And the guy whose got grazing rights on public land, his granddad had it. And he ain't giving it up."
The stock show, now in its 86th year -- it was canceled only once, in 1915, after an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease -- gives urban dwellers a rare chance to see and smell what real cowboy work is about.
More than 10,000 head of livestock are exhibited, including cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, horses and llamas. Vendors in booths hawk everything from fudge to tractors to shots of whisky. And most city people who come to the show wear cowboy hats and boots.
Jim Carrier, a columnist for The Denver Post, recently described the stock show as a handshake between rural and urban. "Denver extends its soft city hand today to a bunch of callused palms from the country."
Noting the divisions, he added, "We're all westerners, but the gap between Denver and its neighbors has never been greater, resentment and suspicion never sharper."
 
Where Are the Horses?
 The basic mission of today's cowboys remains largely the same: raising cattle. But the business of ranching has changed remarkably. Today's rancher, said Chuck Lambert, an official with the Cattleman's Association, knows less about roping skills and more about embryo transfers and is more likely to ride the range by truck or motorbike than on a horse.
"There are ranches in some parts of the country where the rugged terrain means you've still got to have a horse," he said. "But a lot of ranches in other places haven't had a horse on the land for a generation."
The vast majority of ranchers today run fewer than 100 head of cattle, he said. But only 5 percent of ranches produce nearly 50 percent of all beef in the country. Texas, Nebraska and Kansas are the leading beef producers.
About 3 percent of ranchers run cattle on public lands, mostly on acreage administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Ranchers lease the public land for about $1.89 per animal unit month, or the estimated amount of forage needed for one range cow each month. Environmental groups and some members of Congress, led by Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, have vowed to try to raise the fees to more than $8, which they say would more fairly reflect the open market. The low prices have encouraged overgrazing, they say.
But that contention is disputed by ranchers like Mr. Rose, who runs about 500 head of cattle, some of it on national forest land, near Longmont, Colo. "We've been running cattle on the land for four generations," he said curtly. "And the land is in a lot better shape now than it was then."
Mr. Rose, whose ranch is seven miles from the nearest road, recalled the solitary old days. "At the end of hunting season, that was the last we'd see any people," he said. "But that was before the four-wheelers, of course. Now they're everywhere. They're running over fences with their jeeps. They're knocking on the door in the middle of the night, wondering where the heck they're at."
For Denver, where an earlier generation of cowboys drove cattle to slaughterhouses and trains headed for Eastern markets, the stock show has been an economic boon. City officials estimate that $80 million is pumped into the local economy during the show, which runs through Sunday.
For many participants, the show is like a family reunion. But 11-year-old Emile Hoffner wanted only to show off her prize Yorkshire pig, nicknamed "Yorkie." Like many young people here, she belongs to a 4-H club.
Her father, Jeff Hoffner, encourages his children to work with animals, a recreation he deemed "a lot better than playing video games."
But Mr. Hoffner, whose grandfather started the farm in Ault, Colo., when he came from Russia, said he does not want his children to follow the family's tradition: "It's just too risky. I want them to go to college."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
If Clinton Leads Pack, Teeth Are at His Heels

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
If the buzz inside the Capital Beltway can be believed, the Democrats may well have a candidate before they ever have a real campaign. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, by virtue of his early strength in organizing and fund raising, not to mention message-making and pundit-stroking, has become the hot candidate of the post-Cuomo period.
Some of the more cautious Democrats note that at this point in 1984, Walter F. Mondale was a much more prohibitive front-runner and former Senator Gary Hart barely showed a pulse, yet Mr. Hart proceeded to win New Hampshire and nearly destroy Mr. Mondale's campaign. 
 Front-runners, in other words, are often bleeders, particularly front-runners who acquire that status with no input from the voters, like Mr. Mondale or Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine in 1972.
Still, the Democrats have constructed not only a primary calendar but also a state of mind for 1992 that could allow a well-organized Southerner like Mr. Clinton to wrap up the nomination early. But quickly settling on an untested nominee from an under-financed, struggling field carries risks of its own.
"It's an extraordinary myth that all the party needs is an early nominee," said Harrison Hickman, the poll taker for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. An early nominee might have more time to organize against President Bush, but he misses the seasoning of a tough campaign and is open to the pre-convention jitters that produced the panicky "Anybody But Carter" movement in 1976.
The scenario for an early Clinton victory was fueled by recent polls showing him at the head of the pack in New Hampshire, neck and neck with a neighboring son, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. If Mr. Clinton wins there, many Democrats believe, it will be hard to stop him.
The major reason is March 10, Super Tuesday, which involves a large number of delegates, as its name suggests, and has a strongly Southern cast.
Twelve states hold primaries or caucuses that day, eight in Southern or border states. Mr. Clinton's fund-raising edge is also important; because of its sheer size and expensive media markets, Super Tuesday demands super money to compete.
Between New Hampshire and Super Tuesday, Democrats have only a handful of opportunities to change the zeitgeist of the race.
Still, as Thomas E. Donilon, a veteran Democratic strategist puts it, "It's late, but it's early." In other words, it is just five weeks before New Hampshire, but real people are only beginning to pay attention.
This week will be important to Mr. Clinton, as he tries to maintain the image of a sleek front-runner with a national campaign and the ever elusive "Big Mo," as George Bush called it in 1980 before he lost it to Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Clinton was in Chicago today, and will head on to California, Nevada and Florida, then back to Boston and New Hampshire. Next Sunday could be his first, full taste of the downside of front-runner status: Most of his rivals will probably be gunning for him in the televised debate that night in Manchester.
Chief among them will be Mr. Kerrey, who is clearly -- perhaps desperately -- looking for his opening and can ill afford another week of underachieving.
The Senator from Nebraska was widely predicted to be one of the most formidable competitors. But he entered the race late, drifted for most of the fall, and has gone through the kind of downgrading by the press and the political professionals that comes to candidates who fail to live up to expectations.
He has now reorganized his campaign and signed on Doak and Shrum, the consulting firm that produced television ads for Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri in 1988 -- emotional appeals to economic nationalism that ran under the theme, "It's your fight, too."
Mr. Kerrey is on the air in New Hampshire with a similarly trade-oriented message that urges "Fight back, America." The question is whether he has time to pull off this transformation.
Senator Tom Harkin's rallying cry for traditional Democratic values certainly has its appeal in the party, but the Iowan has yet to begin his television campaign in New Hampshire and has shown little movement in the state.
Mr. Tsongas still has to persuade many in his own party that his candidacy has credibility beyond New Hampshire, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California is running more of a crusade than a campaign for the nomination.
In other words, Mr. Clinton may be breaking from the pack -- but this has not been the most powerful pack. These are the candidates who entered the race when Mr. Bush was at the top of the public opinion polls; they may be risk-takers, but with the exception of Mr. Brown, they are all novices to Presidential campaigns, all largely unknown, all forced to scramble for money.
Down the road is President Bush, who might look vulnerable now but already says, bluntly, that he will do what is necessary to win. His advisers are expert at raising the risk factor for a little known Democratic challenger.

HEADLINE: Grocers' Own Fancy Brands Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
A.& P., like a growing number of the nation's largest supermarket chains, is pushing a fancy new line of cookies, pastas and olive oils: its own.
Store brands have been around for years, but the latest generation is a far cry from A.& P.'s plain, and now defunct, Ann Page bargain line of canned goods. The new ones feature olive oil laced with garlic essence, champagne mustard packaged in handsome ceramic pots and blue corn tortilla chips with sesame seeds. They are likely to be called President's Choice, Sensational or World Classic. 
 Faced with slow sales growth in the competitive food retailing business, grocers are emphasizing their own higher-quality goods as a way to cement customer loyalty and increase profits. In Europe, where food retailers rely more heavily on their own brands, grocers' profit margins are nearly twice as high as those in the United States.
The sharp interest in what one food analyst calls "non-cheapo" store brands is a significant shift for the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and other food retailers, whose main selling efforts used to be devoted to national brands like Coca-Cola, Ocean Spray juice products and Pepperidge Farm cookies.
Now, many chains like Kroger, Safeway and Von's have been improving the quality and packaging of their store brands, which are sold primarily under the chain's name. Managers often set up signs that encourage shoppers to save money by buying the store brand of pasta sauce instead of the more expensive Ragu.
Profit margins are 4 percent higher on store brands than on name-brand products, A.& P. executives said. A.& P.'s Master Choice cookies cost 10 cents to 20 cents less than Pepperidge Farm cookies, which are about $2 a bag.
The shift has created tensions between grocers and food manufacturers, who are seeing their products shoved aside to give store brands more favorable displays.
"They are zeroing in on our section," said Mick Sidari, vice president of biscuit sales for Pepperidge Farm, a unit of the Campbell Soup Company. "Obviously, it changes the relationship somewhat."
While denying that store brands have nibbled away business, Pepperidge Farm executives complain that store brands are taking over valuable shelf space. Mr. Sidari said Pepperidge Farm cookies had been moved from the most desirable eye-level shelves to make room for A.& P.'s shortbread cookies. "It was somewhat upsetting," he said, to walk into a supermarket and see that his cookies had literally been moved down a notch.
The weak economy has lifted sales of all store or private-label brands, including the inexpensive versions of dog food, paper towels and juice. These low-cost store brands still outnumber their more expensive cousins, although no statistics are kept on the size of the market for premium store brands.
For the third quarter of 1991, unit sales of coffees, cereal and other dry grocery products increased a meager four-tenths of 1 percent, compared with the corresponding period the year before, according to the latest data available from Nielsen Marketing Research in Chicago. For the same period, however, private-label sales rose 4.1 percent.
In all, store brands accounted for 13 percent of supermarket sales, for the year ending June 30, 1991, the most recent period for which data are available, according to Information Resources Inc., a Chicago market research firm. During that period, sales of private-label goods grew by 6 percent, nearly twice as quickly as those of the overall industry, the firm said. Overall supermarket sales increased by only 3.65 percent during that period.
 
Similarity to the 50's Seen
 Some marketing experts are convinced that consumer interest in private-label brands will outlast the recession. "People don't want to pay for the enormous marketing cost of branded products," said Sid Doolittle, a marketing consultant in Chicago. "The times are getting much more like they were in the 50's, when private label was very popular."
In one telling sign of the growing interest in store brands, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently started selling colas, juice and cookies under its own Sam's American Choice label.
The Finast chain recently introduced its Sensational brand in the New York area. Wegman's in upstate New York and Topco's in the Midwest with its World Classic line also offer high-quality store brands.
Gary M. Giblen, a supermarket analyst with Paine Webber, called the move toward improving store brands "one of the most important trends for the 90's" in the supermarket industry.
Supermarkets can charge slightly less for cookies and crackers than national manufacturers can because they do not have to spend tens of millions of dollars on advertising and new-product introductions. Another expense that grocers avoid is the fee for new-product placement that most stores charge manufacturers to get new products displayed.
To order a warehouseful of pasta, grocers turn to makers of packaged goods, like the Hershey Foods Corporation. C. Mickey Skinner, president of Hershey's pasta group, said he did not mind selling retailers pasta that would compete with his own Ronzoni brand. The reason, he continued, is that he makes the same profit on a case of Ronzoni pasta as on a case of pasta he makes under contract for a supermarket chain.
For lessons in developing their own products, many supermarket executives are looking north to Loblow Companies Ltd. of Toronto, a supermarket chain that makes the top-selling chocolate-chip cookie in Canada. Store brands account for 20 percent of Canada's supermarket business.
 
'The Next Great Trend'
 David Nichol, president of Loblow International Merchants, is now focusing on the United States, where, he predicts, premium store brands will be "the next great trend in the food industry." Mr. Nichol, like many other marketing experts, says that packaged-goods companies have squandered their valuable brand names by blanketing consumers with money-saving coupons each week, encouraging shoppers to buy whatever is cheapest.
Loblow's President's Choice is sold in D'Agostino supermarkets in New York, Bell's in upstate New York and Smitty's in Phoenix. The products will soon be sold in the company-owned National Tea Stores in St. Louis. Mr. Nichol said he would offer the President line to just one supermarket chain in an area.
A.& P.'s interest in private label is a byproduct of the European influences on the company, which is 52 percent owned by the Tengelmann Group of Germany and has several senior managers from Europe. There are 140 Master Choice products, ranging from cookies to tea to bread sticks to pasta and pasta sauce. A.& P. is keeping its low-budget store brands at its A.& P., Food Emporium and Kohl's supermarkets, while it expands its Master Choice label.
"A bit watery" is how Deidre De Blasio, a broadcast analyst with A. C. Nielsen, described Master Choice marinara sauce. But she still uses it regularly. "It's cheap; that's the No. 1 reason I buy it," she said. Ms. DeBlasio, 26 years old, used to buy Newman's Own tomato sauce, but it costs about 60 cents more a jar. Still, when she has friends over, she splurges for Newman's.
A.& P.'s private label business has jumped to 22 percent, from 18 percent in 1990. The company plans for private labels to account for 25 percent, but no more.
"It would be very dangerous to push private label too far," said Peter J. O'Gorman, executive vice president of A.& P. Twenty years ago, the company was nearly destroyed by its attempt to foist too many private-label goods on consumers who were in search of national brands.
Mr. Skinner of Hershey's is not convinced that premium store brands will be a permanent fixture in America's pantries. "While store brands might be in vogue in the early 90's, something else will be the vogue in the mid-90's," he said.

HEADLINE: James I. Loeb, 83, Former Envoy And Organizer of Liberal Group

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
James I. Loeb, a former Ambassador to Peru and Guinea and the first national executive secretary of Americans for Democratic Action, died on Friday at the Alice Peck Day Extended Care Facility in Lebanon, N.H. He was 83 years old and was a resident of Hanover, N.H.
He died of pneumonia, said Ralph Knight of the Knight Funeral Home in White River Junction, Vt. Amy Isaacs, national director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal public-policy organization, said Mr. Loeb had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
 Long active in politics, Mr. Loeb was the Kennedy Administration's Ambassador in Peru from 1961 until he was recalled to Washington in July 1962 as a gesture of disapproval against a military junta that seized control in Peru earlier that month.
The military coup ousted a democratic Government and annulled general elections that had been held the previous month. It was a blow to President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress program of aid for Latin America. The charter of the alliance called for economic and social progress in a framework of developing democratic institutions.
United States officials in Washington said that in accordance with policies personally approved by President Kennedy, Mr. Loeb repeatedly warned the military against mounting a coup and later carried out sanctions, including suspending diplomatic relations and cutting off economic aid.
From 1963 to 1965, he was Ambassador to Guinea, in West Africa.
Earlier, Ms. Isaacs said, Mr. Loeb was "instrumental in bringing together liberals, educators, theologians, labor leaders and businessmen" for the founding in 1941 of the Union for Democratic Action, which became Americans for Democratic Action in 1947. He was executive secretary of the union and then of its successor from 1947 to 1953.
From 1953 to 1970, he was part owner and co-publisher of The Adirondac Daily Enterprise in Saranac Lake, N.Y.
Mr. Loeb, who was born in Highland Park, Ill., received degrees from Dartmouth College and Northwestern University and then taught French and Spanish for some years.
His marriage to the former Ellen Katz ended in divorce.
He is survived by his second wife, Anna Frank Loeb, of Hanover; a son, Peter, of Boston; a daughter, Susan Loeb Luppino of Florence, Italy, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Economy, Not Politics, Is Focus in New Hampshire

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HENNIKER, N.H., Jan. 10

 BODY:
The bulletin board by the entrance to Daniel's Restaurant and Pub displays the usual assortment of small-town business notices for house painting, massage therapy and firewood. Recently the offerings have been updated with a flier advertising a consumer seminar on "foreclosure, bankruptcy and alternatives."
That such a seminar could be useful is a given among the early evening patrons at Daniel's, much the same way falling real estate prices are now seen as normal. Touched briefly by the boom of the 1980's, Henniker is now settling back, albeit somewhat sullenly, into just getting by. 
 "It's not in vogue to be rich anymore," said Lorrie Russell, a mother of three. "It's in vogue to survive."
With the New Hampshire primary, the nation's first, just five weeks away, President Bush and his many rivals are trying hard to convince voters in this recession-wracked state that they have what it takes to lead the country through hard times. But such is the pessimism among voters here that they question not only the candidates' abilities, but even whether a solution exists.
"I think it's basically gone beyond the point of anybody solving it," Jim Brown, a supervisor at a local sawmill, said over a beer. "The way the country usually gets out of a recession is government spending, but with the debt so big we can't do that. I just see things getting worse and worse."
Tom Seavey, a self-employed carpenter, offered a similarly gloomy prognosis. "If a poor guy with a sensible brain got in the White House, it would take five generations to heal what has gone wrong," he said.
With his recent overseas trip, President Bush tried to export some of the blame for the country's economic ills to Japan. But the bar crowd in Henniker seemed to think the problem would more reasonably bear the label "Made in America."
Duane Bishop, a supervisor at the Henniker Hardwood and Pallet sawmill, suggested that the auto executives who traveled to Asia with the President ought to do some soul searching before they criticize the Japanese. "The auto industry doesn't have anybody to blame but themselves," he said. "You've got to look in the mirror when you make $4 million."
Mr. Brown agreed. "I don't understand how Bush could expect the Japanese to buy American cars," he said, noting that he himself drove a Volkswagen.
 
Trying to 'Buy American'
 Inspired by all the talk of Japan, several Henniker residents said, they had made an effort in recent months to "buy American." It turned out, they said, to be surprisingly difficult.
After her husband was unemployed for a few months last year, Mrs. Russell decided to buy only American-made goods at Christmas. The clothes were too expensive, she said. And the electronic goods simply were not as good.
"The sad truth is their technology is better," she said.
Melanie DeWit, a real estate agent, said that she had gone out to purchase a stereo with the intention of buying one that was made in this country. "I went into several places and I couldn't find any American product to buy," she said. "So I bought Japanese."
 
The Boom Is Gone
 Henniker, population 4,151, is typical of the white clapboard towns of New Hampshire that flourished as suburbs spread in the 1980's. To escape higher real estate prices to the south, commuters from Concord, Manchester and Massachusetts built houses in town, supporting a small army of builders.
Now the town is reeling from job losses in distant cities. The commuters are losing their jobs, the building has stopped, and the houses cannot be resold. The only steady work these days comes from New England College, a small liberal-arts college in town.
Looking back on the go-go years of the 80's, Henniker residents express a certain nostalgia for the time before the boom, when the town still counted cows among its residents.
"I think people have forgotten the simple life," said Daniel Carmichael, a telephone repairman, who was having a cup of coffee at the fountain of Henniker Pharmacy. "We used to have 10-party lines, five farms on each line," he said. "Now not only are the 10-party lines gone, so are the farms. The last one sold out last year."
As for the coming election, Mr. Carmichael said that he would probably not focus on it until the summer. When he did, he said, his main concern would be health care.
Mr. Carmichael said he and his wife had recently taken out supplemental health insurance to provide coverage if one of them ever needed long-term care. "It's almost to the point where you have to be working till the day you die," he said.
Although there is only a little more than a month left before the New Hampshire primary, most of the residents of Henniker said they did not know whom they would vote for, or if they would vote at all. There seemed to be a widespread opinion that President Bush had been a disappointment, and that the Democrats had not distinguished themselves.
"They're all stereotypical pols," Mr. Brown said. "None of them really impresses me much."
Lisa Rudolph-Cushman, a resident of nearby New Boston who was visiting Henniker, said she would probably vote for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas in the Democratic primary. "But," she said, "I would have loved to write in Mario Cuomo."
Several people said they applauded Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, and his campaign against the wealthy interests in politics, but they doubted he could get elected.
"I think Jerry's coming from a great place," Mr. Seavey said. "Democrats, Republicans, it's all become a gigantic, business-run thing. A lot of grown men are wasting huge amounts of time."

HEADLINE: D'Amato Cleared in Roosevelt Raceway Sale

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Jan. 13

 BODY:
The New York State Investigation Commission said today that it had found no criminal wrongdoing in the publicly financed purchase of Roosevelt Raceway by private investors in 1984 or in Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's efforts to secure Federal tax relief for the raceway.
The commission's report, issued after an 18-month inquiry, was another victory for Senator D'Amato, who was cleared last August by the Senate Ethics Committee after accusations that he had violated Senate rules and Federal laws to help campaign contributors and political associates. 
 Mr. D'Amato, who faces a crowded field of Democratic challengers for his seat, said he was elated by the report.
"It basically says that what I did was right and proper in trying to help a development in my state to create jobs," he said.
The investigation was ordered in 1990 by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo following allegations that Senator D'Amato had helped secure a Federal tax exemption for the track's owners in return for $4,800 in campaign contributions and the hiring of his brother, Armand, as the track's legal counsel.
 
No Evidence of Collusion
 The commission said it found no evidence of collusion between Senator D'Amato and the track's owners, Roosevelt Raceway Associates, noting that the Senator ultimately voted against a legislative package that included the tax exemption. The commission also concluded that the hiring of Armand D'Amato's firm was not connected to the Senator's initial efforts in behalf of the track owners.
Senator D'Amato, however, is not yet free of official investigations into his activities. Allegations that he performed favors for his brother's law clients remain under investigation by the Justice Department, law-enforcement officials say. Federal prosecutors are examining allegations that real-estate developers and other businesses around the country hired Armand D'Amato's Mineola law firm as a way to curry favor with the Senator.
Senator D'Amato supported Federal legislation in 1984 that would have removed the Federal tax exemption on various industrial development bonds, but included Roosevelt Raceway in a list of continued exemptions. The legislation was approved by Congress, although Mr. D'Amato ultimately voted against it because of certain restrictions on the use of the bonds that had nothing to do with the raceway.
 
$52 Million in Financing
 The raceway, once the nation's premier harness racing track, is on 172 acres in the heart of Nassau County. It was sold in 1984 by Madison Square Garden, a subsidiary of Gulf and Western Industries, to Roosevelt Raceway Asssociates, headed by Charles L. Evans, an investment banker and race horse breeder.
The group put up $750,000 and received $52 million worth of financing in the form of tax-free bonds issued by the Hempstead Industrial Development Agency. The track is in Westbury in the town of Hempstead.
Although the buyers had said they intended to continue to operate the site as a race track, they shut it down in 1988, citing falling revenue. At that time, the value of the site as commercial property was estimated at more than $200 million.
Critics charged that Hempstead had been duped and that the buyers had always planned to develop the property as a real-estate venture.
 
Municipal Bond Review Urged
 The state commission, in its report, said it had found no evidence that Roosevelt Raceway Associates had "used fraudulent or other criminal means" to obtain the financing. It also said it found "no evidence that any party to this transaction violated any law."
But the commission said it found shortcomings in the way the $52 million in public financing was arranged and it recommended a statewide review of the practices of local development agencies empowered to issue bonds that may be exempt from Federal, state and local income taxes.
"While we were confident that there was no criminal conduct committed, we did see a lot of problems in this particular case," said Donald O. Chesworth, chairman of the Investigation Commission.
He said the Hempstead Industrial Development Agency "was remiss in its obligation to adequately investigate the raceway project prior to approval of the I.D.A. financing."
But he said there was "no basis" to recommend that Governor Cuomo appoint a special prosecutor.
Joseph N. Mondello, the Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead -- the office held by Mr. D'Amato before he won his seat in the United States Senate -- said today that he was "delighted with the result that there were no criminal or fraudulent actions."
 
'I See Affordable Housing'
 "This now frees governmental officials to be able to deal with Roosevelt Raceway in a way that will benefit the people of this county," he said. "I see affordable housing for senior citizens and other projects that this area needs and would help pull us out of the recession."
But Peter King, a fellow Republican and Nassau County Comptroller, said he remained skeptical of the investors in the raceway.
"The owners may have relied on the letter of the law in this deal, but they certainly were not abiding by the spirit of the law," Mr. King said. "I felt from the beginning, and I still do, that they never intended to run it as a raceway, but to cash in on the real estate."
Besides Mr. Evans, the partners included Barry B. Goldstein, a public accountant, David Stevenson, a former jockey, and William B. Hopkins, the former president of Roosevelt Raceway for Madison Square Garden.
 
Attempt at Development
 Jonathan Kantor, a lawyer for the group, said, "My clients welcome being exonerated."
In 1986, as racing revenues were steadily declining, Roosevelt Raceway Associates unsuccessfully tried to develop part of the property commercially. After it tried to sell off part of the site, the Town of Hempstead imposed a moratorium prohibiting development of the raceway.
By early 1987, the continued decline of racing and the failed attempt at partial development caused the partnership to decide to sell or redevelop the entire parcel. It redeemed the development bonds that year and replaced them with private financing. The land, its old raceway and extensive parking lots have remained something of a ghost town.
Despite the recession, the property has continued to increase in value, real-estate brokers say. It is in the middle of a commercial area surrounded by shopping malls, restaurants and small businesses.
Senator D'Amato faces re-election in November. Likely Democratic challengers include former United States Representative Geraldine R. Ferraro, Representative Robert A. Mrazek of Long Island, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams and Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman of New York City.

Getting the Most From Each Ruble

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
MINDFUL of Russia's destructively high inflation, the Savings Bank of Russia announced higher interest rates last week for the millions of people who keep their savings in the bank's numerous branches. Rates on passbook accounts went to 3 percent from 2 percent, while the returns on certificates of deposit now range as high as 15 percent for a five-year certificate, up suddenly from 9 percent.
That is not much help when the annual inflation rate is more than 300 percent and a 15,000-ruble account -- for many middle-class Russians a once-handsome sum that two years ago could buy a country dacha -- is now barely enough to keep a family in food and other necessities for a few months. 
 Still, Russians are not rushing to withdraw savings. Wild inflation is still new to them, and they have yet to develop the investment dodges to preserve savings that are so common in the West.
"People got used to government supporting their lives, and now that times are bad, the first reaction is that we have to get the government to take care of us," said Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a sociologist and the director of the Soviet Center for Public Opinion and Market Research. "We still have a great share of such people, but their numbers are declining. Life is teaching them."
The second reaction to the commonwealth's first intense experience with inflation, according to Ms. Zaslavskaya's polls, is a scrambling for ways to increase wages: working more hours, trying to get a raise, holding two jobs, starting a business, trying to get on the payroll of a joint venture involving a foreign partner where wages are sometimes paid in hard currency. That's the good life in a country where a dollar sold on the black market for 100 rubles late last year, is 150 rubles now and might easily be 170 rubles next week.
Only slowly is the Western reaction to inflation and currency devaluation -- seeking out clever investments that sustain the value of savings -- taking hold. Or, as Ms. Zaslavskaya, 62 years old, puts it: "How can I talk seriously about savings at all when my monthly salary is 2,000 rubles, and I am not a poor woman in this country."
Her own savings totaled 16,000 rubles several years ago, enough to buy a three-room dacha or a small car then, but now she has only 7,000 rubles, equal to $47 in American currency. The cheapest dacha, meanwhile, goes for about 150,000 rubles, and in the last two weeks, the Russian Government has allowed new-car prices to jump to more than 250,000 rubles from 20,000.
"What you have here is a psychological tragedy," said Irina Z. Yarigina, a manager at the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs. "People did not think of interest income on their savings as valuable. It was a gift from the state, which took care of their needs."
Clearly, such blase disregard is out of place, and changing attitudes are increasingly evident, particularly in Moscow. Mutual funds and money market accounts with floating interest rates are still unknown here, but stocks aren't. Frequent television commercials and newspaper ads urge Russians to buy shares in newly private companies, promising big returns.
Buying an apartment is now widely permitted, and owning one is viewed as an inflation hedge. So is holding dollars, purchased on the black market in Moscow and a few other major cities. Now officials are saying that ordinary citizens will soon be allowed to buy dollars legally at some banks. That is a step toward making the ruble freely convertible, but one that could make holding dollars a commonplace family investment.
For the moment, owning dollars or stocks or apartments is limited to the most entrepreneurial. For the vast majority, the response to inflation is more primitive. While a New Yorker can easily buy a mutual fund that invests in foreign stocks or bonds -- an investment that rises in value when the dollar weakens -- a Muscovite buys vodka.
Certain goods have become, in effect, hard currency. Vodka is high on this list, largely because it is so widely consumed, creating a demand that can be counted on to exceed supply. The confidence in vodka's steady value explains why payment in a bottle or two of vodka happens often -- to a plumber, for example, to fix a pipe.
Vodka's value as a currency brought Yuri Kislikov to a line that stretched around a corner outside a liquor store recently. "If I go to a worker and ask him to get me a spare part for my car, he'll refuse an offer of money, but he'll do it for vodka," said Mr. Kislikov, a 34-year-old computer dealer who had already made one purchase of second-grade vodka and was in the line for a second time, to buy two more quart-sized bottles at 58 rubles each. "The money is less reliable than the vodka."

HEADLINE: Castro Cracking Down As the Hardships Grow

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 13

 BODY:
With Cuba's economy spiraling sharply downward, leading ever-larger numbers of citizens toward desperate efforts to flee the island, the Government of President Fidel Castro has stepped up efforts to crush internal opposition. At the same time, it is seeking to forge greater unity by raising the specter of invasion by the United States.
After a year in which more than 2,000 Cubans escaped the island on makeshift rafts, the largest number of refugees since the Mariel boatlift in 1981, the New Year began with a spate of spectacular new efforts by its citizens to flee a life where annoying shortages have given way to grinding hardship in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
 Less than a week after 34 Cubans dashed across the Straits of Florida in a comandeered tourism helicopter to request asylum in the United States, three policemen were killed in what Havana says was a bungled attempt by five men to steal a boat to flee the island.
With foreign broadcasts that reach Cuba giving abundant play to the incidents, Cuban authorities were obliged to acknowledge their occurrence quickly, rather than allow them to pass unmentioned or note them in terse statements buried in the news, as has often been the case in the past.
 
Three Exiles Captured
 Rather than simply condemning the flight of its citizens, however, the Government has woven the incidents into a campaign already well under way to attack dissidents, warn of a predatory United States and urge greater unity in the face of economic hardships.
On Dec. 29 three Cuban exiles were captured while trying to invade the island carrying small arms and equipment the Government said was intended for economic sabotage. The three were convicted Saturday and sentenced to death by firing squad.
Experts in Cuban affairs say that while the capture of the exiles may have provided a welcome leap in morale for the Government and lent some credibility to its fever-pitch campaign warning of an increasingly hostile United States, Havana's greatest worry is an economy in near free fall whose continued deterioration will only increase emigration pressure and political discontent.
Until recently, economists say, the Soviet Union and its Communist allies of Eastern Europe provided Cuba with over 85 percent of its imports. By some estimates, about 40 percent of the island's gross domestic product was generated by these imports, many of which were obtained through subsidized barter arrangements and outright aid.
With the generous arrangements severed, however, even common goods like soap, rum and cooking oil have become rare luxuries. Meat has disappeared from most diets. Other sources of protein, like fish, which was once plentiful on the island, have also become extremely scarce, and rations of chicken, long a staple of the diet, have been repeatedly cut. Cubans must wait in long lines for virtually all consumer goods, and the supply and variety, never rich, have become scanty.
Television and movie theater programming has been cut back to save electricity. Newspapers have been forced to publish fewer pages on reduced schedules for lack of newsprint and public transportation has become all but unavailable because oil supplies have been interrupted.
"In 1989 Cuba imported just over $5.5 billion of goods from the Soviet Union," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College in Massachusetts who travels frequently to Cuba. "We are looking at a falloff to about $1.74 billion in 1991, and even worse for Eastern Europe. With a drop like that you are no longer talking about economic performance, you are talking about staying alive and feeding people."
In interviews last year, many mid-level officials in Cuba and ordinary citizens said they expected that with the country's crisis growing graver by the month, a Communist Party congress last October would usher in changes that would at least allow more people to work for themselves and farmers to sell their products freely.
Instead of sweeping changes, observers of Cuban affairs say, Mr. Castro has limited himself to calls for Cubans to increase their "resistance" against the United States and to defend the island's Communist system. Experts say he has introduced only relatively minor economic and political changes, including direct elections to the National Assembly, which has never played a central role.
But even the modest hopes created by these changes have been wiped out by the continued slide of the economy and a harsh crackdown on dissent, many experts say.
To build morale, Mr. Castro has spoken repeatedly in recent speeches of the high hopes the Government places in tourism and biotechnology, whose exploitation he says promises to replace the revenues lost from the collapse of former Communist allies.
Economists and political scientists who follow Cuban affairs say they doubt either of these areas alone can provide the lift needed to keep the economy afloat. Moreover, they say, efforts to develop tourism and attract other private investments are hindered by the climate of political repression.
"We are in a situation where one has to weigh what the Government is saying about the promise of foreign investment, tourism and biotechnology against the cost of the debacle in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe," said Marifeli Perez-Stable, an expert on Cuban affairs at the New School for Social Research in New York. "Even if the Government plan could work on paper, it faces problems of motivating people amid such constraints and shortages that it seems beyond realistic."
In recent weeks, the Government has announced a new crackdown on political dissenters and human rights advocates and many have been arrested.
At the funeral ceremony for the three policemen slain in the failed attempt to flee the island, the President's brother, Raul Castro, who is Armed Forces Minister, warned that if necessary Cuba would revert to "revolutionary courts" to try and punish political opponents quickly. Mr. Castro blamed the United States for both Cuba's internal and external opposition, saying of those who cross the Government, "He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword."

HEADLINE: 4th-Quarter Loss Seen By Citicorp

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citicorp, at the midpoint of a two-year plan to restore its financial equilibrium, said yesterday that it would report a loss of $125 million to $150 million for the fourth quarter of 1991, mostly because of bad real estate loans, but would earn a profit this year.
There is little Citicorp can do immediately to cure its problems with bad loans, but the company said it was making good progress in reducing expenses in its far-flung network of corporate and consumer banking businesses. 
 In addition, the company expanded its four-member top-management team, which John S. Reed, as chairman, continues to head. Pei-yuan Chia, head of Citicorp's consumer businesses in the United States and 36 other countries, was promoted, and H. Onno Ruding, a Citicorp director since 1990 and the Dutch Finance Minister from 1982 to 1989, was reportedly also brought in.
 
Well Known Among Bankers
 Mr. Ruding, who was head of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making arm for much of the 1980's and is well known among bankers, will oversee the corporate banking business in Japan, Europe and North America. That business, which Mr. Reed says is still "the intellectual heart" of Citicorp despite the recent losses from bad loans, was most recently headed by Michael Callen, who is leaving Citicorp. Lawrence Small, who previously headed the group, left Citicorp last year to joint the Federal National Mortgage Association.
The importing of Mr. Ruding "is another move by Citicorp to rebuild its credibility in the marketplace," said James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm that specializes in banks. Mr. Ruding's appointment was reported in The Wall Street Journal, but has not been confirmed by Citicorp.
 
With Citicorp Since 1974
 Mr. Chia, who joined Citicorp in 1974 from General Foods, has headed many of Citicorp's consumer businesses, including domestic credit cards and the introduction of automated teller machines in 1977, which helped pushed Citicorp far ahead of its New York rivals. He comes from a Chinese banking family and was educated in Taiwan and at the Wharton School, where he earned an M.B.A.
Although Citicorp will not issue its complete earnings report until Jan. 21, several big banks have already reported their results. Yesterday Chase Manhattan said its earnings dropped 30 percent in the third quarter. [D7.]
Although Citicorp cut costs by $700 million last year, it remains far from its goal of $1.7 billion in cost reductions by the end of the year. To keep up momentum in the cost-cutting program, Mr. Reed outlined a new organizational plan to top officers this weekend. It is intended to preserve the entrepreneurial spirit the company has cultivated, while squeezing out more cost savings.
Mr. Reed said in an interview yesterday that with the weak economy preventing any rapid growth in revenues and with loan losses remaining high, the shuffling of senior management was needed for the company "to get down to earth" and make the expense cuts.
The four present members of the top management group that Mr. Ruding and Mr. Chia will join are: Richard Braddock, president; William R. Rhodes and Paul Collins, both vice-chairmen, and Mr. Reed. That group will meet monthly with each of the 15 executives in charge of Citicorp's main businesses.
The 15 executives have a mandate to manage the day-to-day operations of their businesses as they see fit. But their success will be measured by the health of Citicorp as a whole, rather than comparisons with their budgets.
 
'Big Cultural Change'
 "This is a big cultural change for us," Mr. Reed said, noting that in the past, cooperation among different Citicorp units "was not high on the list" of qualities that would be rewarded. If Citicorp falls behind its goals, he said, "we are going to pass the hat" among the various parts of the company, including those that might be exceeding their goals.
Intense speculation in financial markets about its prospects led to yesterday's announcement of a loss of $125 million to $150 million. Citicorp's stock, which fell 16.8 percent last year while other large banking companies rose an average of 67.3 percent, rose sharply yesterday and was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. At the close, Citicorp was up $1.50 a share,to $12.
 
Increase in Write-Offs
 The fourth-quarter loss, which will lift Citicorp's loss for all of 1991 to about $450 million to $475 million, was caused primarily by a sharp increase in write-offs of bad loans to businesses. The $650 million of loan write-offs, including about a $125 million decline in the value of real estate Citicorp owns after foreclosure of delinquent loans, compares with a $370 million write-off in the third quarter.
Mr. Reed said Citicorp's holdings of troubled business loans rose by less than the $407 million increase of the third quarter. He added that Citicorp's internal records showed that loan problems were stabilizing, after deteriorating rapidly in the last two years.
Citicorp continues to hold fewer reserves to cover losses on bad loans than many analysts say is needed. The company says it prefers to charge off bad loans as a loss, rather than to set aside reserves, but it is gradually building its reserves, nevertheless. The company said it added $200 million in the fourth quarter.
The combination of a modest $300 million increase in revenues during 1991 and a $700 million cut in expenses meant that Citicorp's operating margin -- the difference between revenues and expenses before the costs of bad loans -- grew by $1 billion during the year to $5.8 billion. The company hopes to increase the operating margin to $7 billion by the end of this year.
Frank DeSantis, a banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette who recently predicted that Citicorp's profits would rebound strongly, said he was not surprised by the large write-off of bad loans in the fourth quarter.
"The year was going to be terrible anyway," he said, "and I expect that the write-offs of bad loans in the fourth quarter were exaggerated because they absorbed some losses that could have been delayed." Mr. DeSantis and other analysts were impressed by the cut in Citicorp's expenses, a skill the company had not shown in previous years.

HEADLINE: Candidate With U.S. Citizenship Blocks Clear Victory in Bulgaria

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, Jan. 13

 BODY:
The surprising third-place finish of a dark horse candidate who holds United States as well as Bulgarian citizenship was being credited today with siphoning off votes that would have given President Zhelyu Zhelev a clear victory in this country's first direct presidential elections on Sunday.
In tallies reported today Mr. Zhelev, the candidate of the Union of Democratic Forces, received almost 45 percent of the vote. Velko Valkanov, the candidate of the Socialist Party, which evolved from the former ruling Communist Party, received 30.6 percent of the vote for a strong showing in a field of 21 contenders. Mr. Zhelev and Mr. Valkanov will now face off in a second round, since neither won a majority. 
 Diplomats and political commentators here agreed today that Mr. Zhelev would have almost certainly won such a majority if not for the unexpected third-place finish of George Ganchev, a previously unknown businessman who captured 16.8 of the vote.
 
Business Bloc Candidate
 A former Olympic fencing champion who ran as the candidate of the tiny Bulgarian Business Bloc, Mr. Ganchev promised to give the freest rein to businesses, arguing that only such policies would insure Bulgaria's economic well-being. Before the voting, his candidacy drew attention primarily because of challenges asserting that he had not lived continuously in Bulgaria for the last five years, as candidates are required to do.
Little concrete information has emerged here about his life in the United States, except some reports that he had studied acting and had been involved in business.
His Presidential campaign and his showing recalled the case of Stanislaw Tyminski, a Canadian businessman who returned to his native Poland as a unknown to mount a presidential campaign. In Poland's first direct elections in 1990, Mr. Tyminski, came in second to Lech Walesa. But Mr. Tyminski returned to Canada after his effort became the subject of ridicule and jokes.
 
'A Joke Candidate'
 Referring to Mr. Ganchev's run for the presidency, a Western diplomat here said: "Sure he's dashing, cavalier and jocular, and he learned to manipulate the camera. He is a joke candidate who turned out to be a bad joke, because he prevented Zhelev from winning on the first ballot."
Bulgarian commentators also offered their analyses of the preliminary results, which are expected to be officially confirmed by the Central Election Commission on Tuesday.
"The results show the new Government's accumulation of negative effects, especially its slow response to the needs of the economically weak," said Dimiter Dimitrov, political scientist at Sofia University.
Inflation in Bulgaria reached 4.9 percent in December, up from an average 3.5 percent in previous months. Unemployment is about 10 percent.
"The problem now will be the struggle for Ganchev's electorate," said Peter Emil Mitev, director of the Bulgarian Sociological Association.
Many surmised that most of Mr. Ganchev's supporters had defected from Mr. Zhelev's camp, either as a result of the gradual fragmentation of the democrats' movement, or in anger over the President's soft approach to former Communists.

HEADLINE: Nonstate Plants in China at Risk in U.S. Talks

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: XIAMEN, China, Jan. 10

 BODY:
As American and Chinese negotiators wrangle over trade issues this month, the credit or blame for China's growing surplus with the United States goes to people like the 1,400 Chinese working at a factory here to assemble coffee-makers and ship twice as many to the United States this year as in 1991.
The workers, mostly young women hunched over assembly lines, earn about $74 a month -- dazzling salaries in China -- and the ethos here is capitalism rather than Communism. The factory is financed by Taiwan, which lies just across the Taiwan Strait from this city in Fujian Province, and there are no political study classes as there are in most Chinese companies. 
 In its three years of production, the Eupa Company and thousands like it have expanded sales to the United States sharply -- and added to frictions about China's estimated $12 billion to $13 billion trade surplus in 1991, the largest after Japan's.
"America is a good market for our coffee makers and toasters," said Tsay Mingshan, a senior Taiwanese manager at the plant. "And it's a very lucrative market."
Yet now Mr. Tay and his eager employees are facing new risks because of the trade disputes between Washington and Beijing, and the possibility of a trade war in which Chinese factories would be the big losers. If by Thursday there is no substantial progress in negotiations now under way in Washington on copyright and intellectual property issues, the United States is expected to impose much higher tariffs on some Chinese products.
If that happens, China has threatened to retaliate against American exports of airplanes, steel and corn. In such an atmosphere, and in an election year in which candidates may point to China's continuing brutal treatment of political prisoners, there would be a greater chance that Congress would succeed in its efforts to attach human rights conditions to a one-year extension of China's "most favored nation" trade status.
The challenge for American policy makers is to force the Communist Government in Beijing to protect American computer software, music tapes, books and videos -- hundreds of millions of dollars worth are pirated each year in China, often by the Government itself -- without harming the private and collective enterprises that make a growing share of China's exports. Many of these factories like the Beijing Government no more than Americans do, and they are considered a force for economic and political change.
A Hong Kong-financed factory in Guangdong Province last year exported one million pairs of leather loafers, athletic sneakers and other shoes -- half of its production -- to the United States. But last month, two of its large American customers canceled their orders out of concern over the trade talks, said the venture's senior Chinese manager, who spoke on the condition his company not be further identified.
"We're extremely worried," he said at his booth in a trade fair in Xiamen. "If the tariffs cut into our sales to the U.S., we'll have to let some of our workers go."
Most of the foreign-financed ventures in China's south may escape injury, and about a dozen other Chinese managers at foreign-financed ventures did not seem particularly concerned.
Washington has indicated that if it imposes sanctions because of the lack of protection for intellectual property, it will pick from a list that includes industries like textiles, shoes, electronic instruments and pharmaceuticals. It will try to select imports made predominantly by Chinese state-run companies rather than by small collective and foreign-financed enterprises.
But many products on the list are made by small entrepreneurial ventures.
Not everyone is worried, and enterprises in this southeastern special economic zone are looking more toward markets in Southeast Asia and Europe rather than the United States. Some believe they can continue to sell to the United States and outwit trade and customs officials even if stiffer tariffs are imposed on Chinese-made imports. Already, some factories evade quotas on textiles by stitching "Made in Philippines" labels on their products.

Boeing Seen Near Selling De Havilland

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 13

 BODY:
The Boeing Company is close to an agreement to sell its de Havilland commuter aircraft division after a year and half of trying to unload the money-losing Toronto company, the Canadian Auto Workers union said today.
 Merv Gray, chairman of the union's Local 112, representing 2,000 production workers at the de Havilland plant, said: "We're close. We'd better be. If this deal doesn't come through very shortly we're not going to be here." 
 Craig Martin, a spokesman for Boeing in Seattle, said, "Negotiations are continuing." He declined to give further details.
 Mr. Gray said that under the terms of the deal, Bombardier Inc. of Montreal would take a 51 percent stake for $51 million (Canadian), or $41 million (United States), and the Ontario government a 49 percent interest for $49 million (Canadian), or $43 million (United States).
 The Ontario government would also cover up to $100 million (Canadian), or $87 million (United States), a year in losses for three years, Mr. Gray said.
 A Bombardier spokeswoman, Linda Coates, declined to furnish additional details.
 A deal with Bombardier, which owns Lear Jet Inc. through its Canadair Group, would extricate Boeing from what many analysts have said has been a costly mistake.
Boeing bought de Havilland in 1988 from the Canadian Government for $155 million (Canadian), equal to $137 million (United States), in a bid to diversify its product line into smaller commuter aircraft. It invested millions of dollars, but analysts say the unit has been losing between $50 million and $100 million (Canadian), about $44 million to $88 million (United States), a year.
 De Havilland's work force was cut in 1990, to 3,700 from 6,200, as orders for the maker's Dash 8-300 40- and 50-seat planes slumped during the recession. Another 140 workers are scheduled to be laid off at the end of January. Boeing has had de Havilland on the block since July 1990. This summer, a deal to sell the division to Alenia S.p.A. of Italy and Aerospatiale of France was scuttled by the European Community on antitrust grounds.
Boeing's share price gained 50 cents on the New York Stock Exchange today, closing at $48.875.

HEADLINE: Chess

BYLINE: By Robert Byrne

 BODY:
The recession is having its effect on Swiss-system open tournaments in the United States. Entries are down, and since entry fees are almost always the source of financing for this type of competition, so are the prizes.
The American Open at the Marriott LAX Hotel in Los Angeles at Thanksgiving was typical: only 320 players turned out when 500 were needed to sustain the hoped-for prize list. Thus, the winner, Joel Benjamin, was awarded $1,800 instead of the intended $3,000. Benjamin, a New York grandmaster, had scored 7-1 in the eight-round event to finish a half-point ahead of the grandmaster Patrick Wolff and the international master Douglas Root, who tied for second place. 
 Overall, Benjamin played an enterprising brand of chess. His game with the Czechoslovak grandmaster Lubomir Ftacnik (who now resides in Seattle) was one of the most exciting of the tourney.
In blocking with 4 Nbd2 against the Bogo-Indian Defense, White counts on obtaining the bishop-pair after 4 . . . O-O 5 a3 Bd2 6 Qd2, but this costs time and it soon allowed Benjamin to invade on the light squares with 8 . . . Ne4.
Ftacnik prepared to drive out the intruding knight with 12 Nd2, but perhaps after 12 . . . Bd7!, he should have chosen the low-key 13 f3 Nd2 14 Qd2 and planned on a slow maneuvering game. In the method he selected, 16 f4 gave the important e4 square back to Black.
Benjamin boldly reinforced it with 16 . . . d5!, offering a gambit that would yield Black a promising attacking position after 17 cd Nd5 18 Bd5 ed 19 Qc7 Bb5.
Benjamin's 23 . . . Nf6!? was a thematic pawn sacrifice for the sake of achieving iron control of e4 after 24 Bc6 bc 25 Nc6 Nde4. After 26 Kg2 Nh5, both players said after the game, White should have played 27 Ne7 Kh8 28 Rh3 and the outcome would have been unclear after 28 . . . c6.
In the Dec. 23 issue of Inside Chess, Ftacnik castigates himself for playing the immediate 27 Rh3 and underestimating Benjamin's nice sacrifice of rook for knight with 27 . . . Rc6!? 28 Qc6. But it need not have worked out badly: Benjamin said during a recent conversation that after 28 . . . Qg6 29 Kh2 Qg4! 30 Re1 Nhg3, Ftacnik had misanalyzed the consequences of 31 Rg1! Qe2 32 Rg2 Nf1 33 Kg1 Qe1 in his annotations, overlooking the powerful defense, 34 Qc1! Benjamin further pointed out that he would therefore have had to take a draw with 31 . . . Nf1! 32 Rf1 Qe2 33 Kg1 Qg4 34 Kh2 Qe2, forcing a repetition of position.
After 31 Qc2?, Benjamin bored in with 31 . . . Qf4 32 e3 Qd6 33 Kg1 f4! 34 ef Rf4. Ftacnik mentions that he could have tried 35 Qg2 Rf2 36 Rg3 Rg2 37 Rg2 Qf4 38 d5 but that after 38 . . . e5, Black should win.
Benjamin allowed the position to be repeated twice, at moves 38 and 40, in order to gain time on his clock. What prevented Ftacnik from claiming a threefold repetition was that the h4 pawn was still on the board at Move 36.
Benjamin's last move to the time control, 40 . . . Ng5!, was a crusher. On 41 Qd1, there could have followed 41 . . . Nh3 42 Kh2 Ne2! 43 Kh3 (or 43 Kh1 Rg2 44 Kg2 Qg3 45 Kh1 Nf2 mate) Rg3 44 Kh2 Rg2 45 Kg2 Qg3 46 Kf1 Qf3 mate. On 41 Qd3, there could have followed 41 . . . Nh3 42 Kh2 Ne2 43 Kh3 (or 43 Kh1 Rg2 44 Qh3 Nf4 45 Qc3 Qd5 46 Re5 Rg1!) Rg2 44 Kg2 Nf4, winning the queen.
Ftacnik tried 41 Re5, but after 41 . . . Nf3 42 Kf2 Ne5, he could not play 43 Rg3 because of 43 Qf8 Kg2 44 Qf3!, winning outright.
Dazed and defeated, Ftacnik wandered into 45 . . . Qf3 mate.

$28,300 a Second? A Bit Too Super

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
For many mega-marketers, the Super Bowl still provides a glitzy backdrop for extravagant advertisements and promotions. But others that once thought the game as super for them as for the football teams that play in it intend to sit out Super Sunday this year.
The game's diminution, which began after several ho-hum matches in the late 1980's, has accelerated for three reasons: the relentless rise in the cost of a commercial, to more than $28,300 a second; the sluggish economy, and a sense that Super Bowl hyperbole might be just another example of the excesses of the 80's. 
 For each 30-second spot during its telecast of Super Bowl XXVI on Jan. 26, CBS is asking a record $850,000. That figure is up by 6.25 percent from $800,000 last year, despite the softest television sports ad-sales market ever. Commercial time is still not sold out, as Super Bowl XXV on ABC was not sold out at this time last year.
 
Enticing Sponsors
 Trade publications have reported that to entice advertisers, CBS is offering deals that include spots in the pre- and post-game shows or in its Winter Olympics coverage. CBS reiterated yesterday that it expected all of its time to be sold out, at full price, before the game.
The high cost of advertising, particularly amid a sagging economy, has persuaded a long list of advertisers to seek exposure elsewhere. One result is that some of the marketing battles that had made the game an annual advertising showcase will not be waged when the Washington Redskins meet the Buffalo Bills at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis.
Though Pepsi-Cola will be a sponsor, Coca-Cola will not. L. A. Gear, which skirmished with Nike and Reebok during last year's game, is not expected to appear. Consumer electronics, once a hot category, is losing last year's sole participant, Panasonic. And the automotive category, once fiercely competitive, will have just a single representative again. Last year, it was Audi of America. This year, it will be American Isuzu Motors.
"Maybe the best word to describe Super Bowl advertising is 'throwback,' as in a throwback to the 80's," said Andy Berlin, a principal in Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein in San Francisco, which handles the creative portion of American Isuzu's account.
"The Super Bowl as the great American advertising contest has kind of petered out," he added. "It's not what's happening. It's a habit." Though Goodby, Berlin created a 30-second American Isuzu spot to run during the game, touting incentives on the Isuzu Rodeo sport-utility vehicle, the decision to buy the time was made by SFM Media, the auto maker's media-buying service.
 
Nike Stays the Course
 Given the tough times many marketers are suffering through, those "that look at their advertising on a strict cost-per-thousand basis just might see themselves elsewhere," said Thomas E. Clarke, the vice president for marketing and a general manager at Nike Inc.
But Nike does not count itself among them, he added. "The Super Bowl is the most watched sports event of the year," he said, "and, as a company that made a name for itself in sports and fitness, it's very important for us."
So, at the start of the second and fourth quarters of the game, Nike will run its new 60-second "Hare Jordan" commercial, teaming the basketball star Michael Jordan with the cartoon character Bugs Bunny. In the spot, Mr. Jordan comes to Bugs's aid after the rabbit is harassed by basketball bullies who ignore his greeting, "What's up, jock?"
Those marketers still eager to participate in the Super Bowl contend that consumers consider such advertising "to be an event in and of itself," said Paul M. Bentley, the senior vice president and director of client services for Cramer-Krasselt in Milwaukee, the agency for Master Lock. Once more, the lock company will spend its entire annual ad budget on one 30-second Super Bowl spot.
Cramer-Krasselt says its research has shown that on average 60 percent of Super Bowl viewers agree that the ads they see are more interesting than commercials during prime-time programs. And 54 percent can recall a Super Bowl spot, compared with an average of 23 percent for a conventional commercial.
Other advertisers returning for Super Bowl XXVI include Anheuser-Busch, with its fourth annual "Bud Bowl" mock football game; Gillette; McDonald's, and Merrill Lynch. In all, CBS's revenues from sales of the 50-odd spots is likely to reach almost $43 million, slightly ahead of what industry executives estimated ABC took in last year.
"The Super Bowl is part of Americana," said David Green, the senior vice president for marketing for the McDonald's Corporation, "and participating is one of the ways we at McDonald's reaffirm our relationship with American families."
Another reason marketers give for Super Bowl advertising is that among the game's 110 million or so viewers every year are people other than customers -- franchisees, wholesalers and retailers, for example -- they are seeking to reach.
Though critics scorn the Bud Bowl, which pits bottles of Budweiser, Bud Light and Bud Dry against one another in a fanciful football game, Anheuser-Busch says it is particularly popular with beer distributors.
And before each Super Bowl, Cramer-Krasselt sends special mailings to hardware wholesalers, "reminding them that because we're the only guys on television establishing a brand," Mr. Bentley said, "people will pay a premium for Master Lock."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Except vs. Yen; Gold Prices Off Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined on world foreign exchange markets yesterday against all leading currencies except the Japanese yen, which was buffeted by a scandal involving a Government official.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $353.80 an ounce, off $2.40 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold lost $2.50 an ounce to settle at a late bid price of $353.75. 
 Currency trading was slow and choppy as dealers took profits following the sharp run-up in the dollar late last week, analysts said.
Word of the arrest of Fumio Abe, a senior political ally of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, sent the Japanese yen lower. Mr. Abe, who is charged with accepting bribes from a company facing fraud charges, is the first Japanese lawmaker taken into custody since 1976.
 
Speculation on German Rates
 Elsewhere, speculation that German interest rates would remain high kept the dollar depressed against the mark. Michael Malpede, a senior analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago, said the Bundesbank, the central bank, was not likely to lower interest rates while negotiations were under way with a leading trade union.
Talks with a leading union of metalworkers have reportedly stalled over wages. "Psychologically it is not good for the mark to be confronted with labor problems," said Randolph Donney, research director of Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Higher interest rates abroad are negative for the dollar because they make dollar-denominated securities with relatively lower yields less attractive to investors, thereby reducing their need for the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.45 yen to close at 126.30 yen. Later, in London it was quoted higher, at 126.80. In New York the dollar settled at 127.00 yen, up from 126.90 yen on Friday.
In London the British pound rose to $1.8030, from $1.7925 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.7990 to buy 1, more expensive than Friday's $1.7885.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5765 German marks, down from 1.5850; 1.4040 Swiss francs, down from 1.4120; 5.3790 French francs, down from 5.4090; 1,190.25 Italian lire, down from 1,197.00, and 1.1493 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1548.

HEADLINE: Careers;
For M.B.A.'s, Dim Outlook This Spring

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
MORE than 70,000 M.B.A.'s will be awarded this spring, but many proud holders of those degrees will find slim pickings in the job market. Recession has stripped away whole layers of middle management, and even companies that are hiring aggressively, like financial firms, are taking experienced people who have been laid off elsewhere. Those who are lucky enough to find jobs will have to settle for less than the $60,000 to $70,000 typically offered by many large companies in the New York area. And many will end up with small- to mid-sized companies.
William E. Mayer, dean of the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Rochester, suggested one possible outcome of this fierce competition for jobs. "We see many fewer graduate business schools in the future," he said, citing about 900 currently, which might eventually evolve into 75 or so. "Only the best ones will survive." 
 Last week more then 100 prospective M.B.A.'s from the Simon School were in New York for two days to interview for jobs at some major financial companies.
Mr. Mayer, former chairman and chief executive of CS First Boston, listed some of the companies recruiting -- A.T.& T.; Goldman, Sachs; Salomon; First Boston; J. P. Morgan, and Equitable Life.
This is the 12th year of this type of recruiting for the school. As might be expected at a school named for a financier, many of the students like the idea of taking jobs with financial and other well-known companies in the New York metropolitan area, and they have been trained for the relatively conservative corporate culture of most of the financial companies that interview them
Mr. Mayer discussed the possible glut of new M.B.A. degree holders in an interview at the luncheon meeting.
In fact, William J. Morin, chairman of Drake Beam Morin Inc., the large nationwide outplacement firm, has pointed out that financial companies are "hiring aggressively" this year. But he warns that many are rehiring M.B.A.'s dismissed in recent years because they have the needed experience with the companies. This, he said, can make it harder for the 1992 crop of M.B.A.'s.
Business schools have been trying to adapt curriculums to the new managerial needs -- global perspectives, ability to work with a team, skills that can motivate and manage people, negotiating skills, selling skills and ethics. One group, the Japanese M.B.A. holders, who are often financed by their companies because Japan has few graduate business schools, go back to the same jobs they held before at the same salary. Americans typically expect higher salaries after they have earned their master's degree in business.
One trend influenced by the recession is for M.B.A.'s to take jobs with smaller companies. With this in mind, Duke University began in 1990 a center for mid-size company education and research -- an indication of where it thinks jobs for many of its M.B.A.'s will be in the future.
Even with the dearth of jobs, some universities report that their applications for M.B.A. programs have increased sharply. For example, Anne Sandoe-Thorp, director of admissions at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, said applications had increased by a startling 83 percent this year compared with this time a year ago.
"The jump in applications is evidence of the ongoing strong interest in M.B.A. programs in general and the Fuqua school in particular," she said.
She attributed the increase to people planning career changes and to those who want to strengthen their professional background "at a time of corporate layoffs and a sluggish ecnonomy."
John Reddy, who heads the business department and teaches telecommunications at the Wilkes-Barre campus of Pennsylvania State University, said the layoffs of middle managers are expected to continue this year at a rapid pace,
Mr. Reddy, who worked for A.T.& T. for 32 years, said that A.T.& T.'s financial success after big layoffs had influenced other companies like I.B.M. and General Motors to cut back as well.
" A lot of big companies thought that if A.T.& T. had been overloaded with people, maybe they were, too." he said. The breakup of A.T.& T. into regional companies, which have also been laying off personnel, means that "we sacrificed our telephone system on the altar of competition without thinking about the toll it would take in human terms," he said.

HEADLINE: In Russia, Secret Labs Struggle To Survive

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
TEN previously unknown cities of the former Soviet Union have suddenly emerged from the mists of the cold war, prompting anxious speculation about their fate.
The cities, with code names like Tomsk-7 and Arzamas-16, formed the heart of the Soviet military's vast industrial complex for the design and production of nuclear arms. Their disintegration is now seen as threatening to send scientists and materials flying into foreign hands in a new kind of international peril. 
 But scores of interviews with experts in the United States and Moscow, including Russian arms scientists themselves, show that the nuclear cities and their hidden reservoirs of scientific talent are also struggling to save themselves. Lifting some secrecy, they now want to go commercial, embark on joint projects with the West and do nearly anything in their power to survive and avoid falling apart.
These cities are mirrored in America by a coast-to-coast complex built over the decades. Its major sites, Los Alamos, Livermore, Hanford, Pantex, Savannah River, are well known and far less secretive. The American complex employs nearly 100,000 people in 13 states and costs about $11 billion a year to operate.
It turns out that the former Soviet complex is far larger. Its fate poses far larger problems -- and perhaps opportunities.
The Bush Administration recently warned that economic chaos, military decline and high unemployment could shatter the complex and scatter its experts to the wind. Yet some Western analysts, and Russian ones as well, express guarded optimism.
"There is hope," Dr. Nikolai N. Ponomarev-Stepnoi, a high official of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, said in an interview. But he added that if cuts in government financing were not offset by new revenue or joint ventures with the West, "there is danger."
Not all experts agree. Russian Government officials often dismiss the specter of atom mercenaries as a scare tactic used by arms scientists intent on stabilizing their salaries in a time of economic discord. Cultural barriers, these officials say, would bar the easy transfer of scientists and their families to foreign lands.
Yet ferment is real. Russian nuclear experts have received job offers from Iraq and Libya and a few are said to be taking up Western posts, in Albuquerque, N.M., for instance. Meanwhile, Russian bomb makers in the secret cities are striving to invent new ways of making money at home. Some of the initiatives would hinder atomic leakage, others encourage it.
A Russian leader trying to save the cities is Viktor N. Mikhailov, a chain-smoking apparatchik who directs the bomb complex from his Moscow post at the Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry. He exudes confidence, even when asking for a handout.
Smiling broadly, he argued last month in Moscow that $400 million recently appropriated by the American Congress for warhead dismantlement in Russia should be given exclusively to his agency, saying his workers "are almost unemployed these days." Some American experts fear any American aid might covertly be used to bolster Moscow's arsenal.
In a different area, Mr. Mikhailov has stirred Western anxiety by encouraging his legions in the secret cities to sell atomic services abroad, including peaceful nuclear explosions for the bulk incineration of chemical weapons and toxic wastes. Western experts fear such nuclear sales will expand to include bomb parts and weapon materials, but Mr. Mikhailov derides that idea.
A favorable outcome from all this is possible, some experts say. But many speak only of lessening the dissemination threat, not eliminating it.
 
'Window of Opportunity'
 Dr. William G. Sutcliffe, a senior physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, a Federal center for the design of nuclear arms, recently went to Russia to speak with his counterparts there. He said the danger was acute.
"The brighter people are likely to drift away" unless steps were taken to aid them, he said. "The more we get in now, and the better we do it, the greater the chance that we can redirect them toward societal problems. There's a window of opportunity opening that could close in the near future."
The Soviet Union got a late start in the nuclear arms race but then forged ahead in perfecting weapons for the cold war. Its first atomic bomb was detonated in 1949, four years after America's initial mushroom cloud. Its first hydrogen bomb was exploded in 1955, three years after the United States set one off. In 1961, the complex came into its own by detonating the largest nuclear blast of all time, one equal to a staggering 58 million tons of high explosive or nearly 4,000 times more powerful than the bomb that leveled Hiroshima.
By the late 1980's, the Soviet Union's secretive maze of nuclear design labs, reactors and factories had grown enormously, dwarfing the American complex.
 
900,000 Weapons Workers
 "It was several times larger, if only because it had 14 reactors operating" simultaneously to make plutonium and tritium for bomb fuel, said Dr. Robert S. Norris, senior researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington and co-author of the "Nuclear Weapons Databook," a multivolume reference series.
A recent Federal intelligence report estimates that the complex now employs some 900,000 people ranging from blue-collar workers running lathes to members of the military guarding nuclear arms. Federal officials said as many as 2,000 people know how to make nuclear arms.
The newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun of Tokyo, citing a secret Russian document, reported late last year that 755,800 experts and their families lived in the 10 top-secret Soviet cities devoted to nuclear arms work. American experts are familiar with only some of the cities.
The Soviet complex was a closed society for decades. But it is now opening to the outside world in a desperate bid for survival, giving a rare glimpse of its inner workings.
 
City Disappeared in 1940's
 Some 200 or so miles east of Moscow, not far from Nizhny Novgorod, or what used to be called Gorky, lies the main nuclear weapons laboratory of the former Soviet Union, Arzamas-16. It is now regaining its former historical name, Sarov. This ancient city was once known for the famous Sarov monastery and one of Russia's most hallowed saints, St. Seraphim. But in the 1940's it was ringed with barbed wire and disappeared from maps as it was turned into the first Soviet center dedicated to the design of nuclear arms. It created the first bomb.
Today the site has 80,300 residents, including scientists, their families and townspeople, Yomiuri Shimbun said. In addition to designing arms, the laboratory has developed powerful lasers for trying to harness nuclear fusion for energy production.
The laboratory's day-to-day activities are run by Dr. Yuri A. Trutnev, a elder physicist who speaks of shifting the lab's nuclear work toward peaceful ends. "The genie is out of the bottle," he said in an interview last month. "Let's use it for the benefit of mankind."
But Dr. Trutnev was quick to add that the weapons legacy would not suddenly disappear. "Realistic politicians say nuclear weapons must be preserved," he said. "That doesn't mean we shouldn't reduce them. But the knowledge and the know-how must be preserved."
 
Plan to Destroy Arms
 At a Kiev meeting on warhead dismantlement in December, Dr. Trutnev outlined a plan to use underground nuclear explosions to destroy the cores of discarded nuclear arms. A single blast could demolish up to 20,000 cores, he said. Such work would give the laboratory a new challenge, at least for a while.
In a similar vein, Arzamas-16 is allied with Mr. Mikhailov in marketing nuclear blasts for the incineration of highly toxic wastes. It has close ties to a new Soviet company, International Chetek Corporation of Moscow, which is promoting the work, and has a team of scientists preparing a bomb for a test. Yet some analysts said political foes of underground blasts might succeed in blocking the project.
Just east of the Ural Mountains, some 25 miles north of Kyshtym, lies Chelyabinsk-70, founded in 1955 as the second design laboratory. Today it has 46,300 residents, according to Yomiuri Shimbun.
Ahead of the times, the scientific director of Chelyabinsk-70, Dr. Yevgney N. Avrorin, went to the Livermore weapons laboratory in California to discuss joint research in 1990. On his agenda was what to do with nuclear materials from old warheads, how to conduct ecologically clean blasts in closed chambers and how to make fuels for laser fusion. To date his efforts have yielded no joint projects.
 
Selling Personal Computers
 More successfully, Chelyabinsk-70 has gone commercial. Soviet television reported last year that it was producing and selling personal computers. And it has perfected the explosive synthesis of very small industrial diamonds, which are now for sale.
"Entrepreneurs and business are the best way to go," Dr. Vadim A. Simonenko, the senior arms designer at Chelyabinsk-70, said in an interview.
Stalin's early interest in the bomb got serious in 1943 when he directed that its feasibility be studied in Moscow. Dr. Igor V. Kurchatov led the work, which included building the Soviet Union's first nuclear reactor. Since then, the Kurchatov Institute, as it is known, has focused on making innovative reactors, including ones for use in space. Though not a secret city, it is facing serious problems as budgets fall and temptations rise to send its nuclear expertise abroad.
Dr. Ponomarev-Stepnoi, the institute's first deputy director, said Kurchatov experts had been recently courted by Libya, adding that the job offers were rejected.
"Our scientists should work in the civilized world, in civilized countries," he said. "There is danger that our people will try to find employment in third world countries if their desire to work in the civilized world is not appreciated."
To help finance its scientists amid growing turmoil, the institute last year agreed to sell one of its formerly secret technologies, a Topaz-2 space reactor, to the Pentagon. But the $15 million deal has been stymied by American red tape.
Dr. Mohamed S. El-Genk, a nuclear engineer at the University of New Mexico, has bought Kurchatov equipment, saying the power of the dollar over the ruble is so great that even relatively small sales can keep Russian teams supported financially for years.
In a sign of the times, Dr. El-Genk noted that he now runs a collaborative research project with Kurchatov and that some of its Moscow experts were soon to take up posts at the University of New Mexico.
Russia and other former Soviet republics have many other secretive nuclear sites, including Krasnoyarsk-26, Penza-19 and Zlatoust-36. New projects at them could easily include the accelerated cleanup of pollution.
Western experts say the fate of the Russian complex partly depends on the American Government, which is still pondering its options and wary of aiding its former foes. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group whose Washington office has strong ties to Russian weapon scientists, is mounting a crash effort to finance their research and shift it toward environmental issues, including how to clean up Russia's mountain of nuclear waste.
"The U.S. should hire all of them and put them to work on some hard technical problem," said Dr. Thomas L. Neff, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who attended the Kiev conference last month. "It would be cheaper than buying a battleship."
Indeed, Dr. Sutcliffe of the Livermore laboratory has calculated that as little as $10 million a year could finance the work of 10,000 important nuclear experts in the former Soviet Union.
But many experts say the Federal Government is likely to balk at direct bailouts, given the reticence it has already shown in buying Russian technology.
"There is hope," said Dr. Ponomarev-Stepnoi of the Kurchatov Institute. "But the American bureaucracy works very slowly. Up to now, there is no agreement between our countries for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. And this makes any other contacts and programs very difficult."

Secret nuclear sites of the former Soviet Union are starting to go public in a bid for survival. This vast network, which designed, made and tested Soviet nuclear arms, is today estimated to be 900,000 workers strong, with some 700,000 people in 10 formerly secret cities. (pg. C9)

HEADLINE: The Talk of Hollywood;
'Europa' Surfaces In Oscar Angling

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 13

 BODY:
As Academy Award fever seizes this town, the angriest and most emotional controversy is not over Oliver Stone's "J. F. K," but instead over a foreign film called "Europa, Europa." And the ramifications reach far beyond Hollywood.
The startling and highly acclaimed movie is based on the autobiography of Solomon Perel, now 65 years old and living in Israel, who survived World War II by hiding his Jewish identity in Poland, slipping into the German Army invading Russia and finally attending an elite school for Hitler's youth. Terrified of being revealed as a Jew, the boy encounters, on a nightmare journey that is sometimes darkly funny, a German Army officer and a woman who learn his identity but protect him. 
 "Europa, Europa" has been named best foreign film of the year by the New York and Boston film critics and the National Board of Review. Written and directed by a well-known European film maker, Agnieszka Holland, who is Polish-born and lives in Paris, the film is almost entirely spoken in German and its producer, Artur Brauner, is German, as is most of the cast and crew. It would be up to the Germans to propose an Oscar nomination for best foreign film for the movie, but they have not done so, leaving its creators and producers outraged and saying, essentially, that the reason is that it touches too many raw nerves.
"They hate this subject, they really hate it," said the 42-year-old Miss Holland, who in the 1970's directed movies, theater and television in Poland.
During an interview here, Miss Holland, whose father was Jewish, said angrily: "I have many German friends, but I was really shocked at how the minds of the people changed after unification. The arrogance and xenophobia which was hidden is now official. I cannot imagine making a movie in Germany. They felt guilty many, many years after the war, but it was official guilt. This time is over. This generation hates all those people who put them through the official guilt. What is left is arrogance and stupidity. My presence and my cinema is an offense to these people."
Under the regulations of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which will announce its nominations on Feb. 19 and present the awards on March 30, any country may submit a single entry for the best-foreign-film award. In Germany, a statement by the German Export Film Union, which oversees the eight-member committee of producers and executives that selects the country's entry, said no German film possessed the high quality to become a nominee. Helga Schmid, a press attache at the German Embassy in Washington, said that the Government had nothing to do with the decision, and that it was "purely a private matter."
An export committee member was quoted in weekly Variety as calling the film "junk." The Export Union head called it "an embarrassment." Newspaper articles in Germany said the film was not actually German because it was filmed largely in Poland and produced with French as well as German financing.
Now the film's distributors, Orion Classics, are sending letters to members of the Motion Picture Academy urging them to see the film and support it in other categories: best picture, best director, best screenplay, best production design, best musical score. Winning an Academy Award could tap wider audiences and result in more theaters showing it.
"For some reason, this committee did not want the film to represent Germany for the Academy Awards, and that has got to relate to the politics and content of the film," said Michael Barker, the vice president for sales and marketing at Orion Classics. "When I heard about all this I was shocked."
 
Hard Times
 Over a recent lunch at the Ivy, an expense-account hangout for the film crowd, a studio executive contrasted the way Hollywood agents negotiated before the recession and now.
"Two or three years ago," the executive said, "you made an offer for an actor or director and the agent used to say, 'How can you offend me with such an offer.' Now they'll accept what you can pay."
Although the recession in Hollywood hardly resembles that in Detroit -- studio executives still pick at lavishly expensive raspberries and out-of-season fruit in their sleek offices -- the mood of vulnerability shadows virtually every studio. Stars and directors, whom studios competed to sign up last year, are hardly in demand unless their first names are Arnold or Kevin or Julia.
At 20th Century Fox, for example, one of the most successful studios in town, the word has been passed around by Joe Roth, the chairman: The fewer high-risk films, the better.
As a result, "Hoffa," a big project based on the life of the former Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa, though set to start filming in February, has been the subject of considerable debate and concern. The script is by David Mamet, the producer is Edward R. Pressman, whose credits include such prestigious films as "Reversal of Fortune" and "Wall Street," the director is Danny DeVito, and Jack Nicholson will star in the title role. Mr. De Vito told Fox that as he conceives the film, which covers a period of nearly 40 years, it would cost about $40 million to $45 million, and possibly more. Mr. Nicholson, who does not compromise on his salary, recession or no recession, will probably earn about $9 million. Fox placed a ceiling of $35 million on the movie, but quietly told Mr. DeVito, who will also appear in the film, that he could shop it around. Mr. DeVito did, but found no takers, largely because of the film's cost. So he is back at Fox, but his own company will put up the cash difference.
"A year ago this would have been unthinkable," said another studio executive. "Two stars like this and a Mamet script -- there would have been no question. But the economic climate has changed. Drastically."
 
A Preference for TV
 Several years ago, after Scott Turow saw the screening of his novel-turned-into-a-film, "Presumed Innocent," he phoned his agents and his lawyer and said he wanted his new novel, "The Burden of Proof," made into a television mini-series.
"I liked the movie a great deal, but I realized the story of 'The Burden of Proof' could not be contained in a two-hour film," said Mr. Turow. "Unless someone makes something like 'Dances With Wolves,' a long movie, the story just won't fit in."
Mr. Turow acknowledged that most novelists would prefer the glamor and prestige, not to mention the money, of a movie sale as opposed to television. "The general perception in our culture is that when you have commercials, when you're selling toothpaste in the middle of your story, you've cheapened it," he said. "That's a perception. That's the counterweight argument. I have no question I made the right decision."
The four-hour drama will be televised on ABC on Sunday and Monday, Feb. 9 and 10. The story, about Alejandro (Sandy) Stern, a prominent Midwestern lawyer -- and also a character in "Presumed Innocent" -- whose life is shattered when his wife mysteriously commits suicide, stars Hector Elizondo, Brian Dennehy, Mel Harris, Stefanie Powers and Victoria Principal. Mike Robe, who directed the Emmy Award-winning "Son of the Morning Star," is the director and executive producer.
"Mike approached me and told me that he would include me at every stage," said Mr. Turow. "He was remarkably faithful to his word. I did a lot of kibitzing on the television play. I saw all the dailies. I saw the rough cut. I made suggestions about editing. Mike was absolutely true to his word. He may be the last honest man in Hollywood."

HEADLINE: Debate on Buildings: To Scrub Or Not

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
FOR the next three to five years, the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials in Washington, those soaring marble arias to democracy and inspiration for thousands of tourists each week, will be partly obscured by decidedly unpoetic girdles of scaffolding, fences and thick green nets, as workers struggle to shore up the crumbling monuments and restore a bit of their dimming grandeur.
The monuments are suffering, not so much because they have been battered by grit, grime and acid rain or even because pigeons shamelessly roost on the heads of the Presidential statues within, but because in the half century since the monuments were built they have been kept so meticulously clean. To help assure the appearance of unsullied timelessness at the monuments, the National Park Service hoses down the entire structures twice a year and swabs off the Lincoln statue with detergent and water every other day. 
 Partly as a result of the constant washing, the marble has eroded so badly in spots that last year a chunk of one 42-foot column at the Jefferson Memorial crashed to the ground and other columns were found to be teetering dangerously. Now the National Park Service is racing to gauge the extent of the deterioration and how best to correct it.
The fragile condition of two of America's most treasured monuments underscores an ongoing and often vitriolic debate among preservationists, engineers, real estate developers and those who simply feel passionate about architecture: is it best to scrub a building now and again, or simply leave it alone?
Some argue that a building coated with dirt or graffiti or bird droppings is an offense and that a city of grimy buildings is a dark, unsavory place, bespeaking economic and social disintegration. They also say that pollution and filth are harmful to a building and that surely the expeditious removal of grime is in the building's best interest.
Others insist that cleaning a building almost always does more harm than good, driving water deep into the capillaries of the stone, where it can expand if it freezes and crack the masonry. They say a spattering of grease and graffiti on the facade is far preferable to deep structural damage that can follow a cleaning, and they say cities are full of buildings that have been mangled by cleanings past.
The critics of cleaning, echoing with the 19th-century architect and neo-medievalist John Ruskin, argue that there is something pleasing about "the sweetness of line the wind and rain have brought" to buildings that have been around long enough to qualify as landmarks. They decry the desire to clean, clean, clean as evidence of America's restless obsession with novelty and youth.
Yet a third camp, composed of preservationists with a strong background in engineering, chemistry and even geology, sits between the two extremes, saying the technology for cleaning and restoring buildings has progressed so far in just the last several years that even the most delicate of structures can sometimes benefit from a deft and carefully executed cleaning.
Using methods like electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography, preservationists can now determine whether dirt on a building is merely smudging the stone on the outermost layer or has pervaded the pores like a sickness and thus threatens the whole structure. The preservationists say it is now possible to combine the best of both worlds, removing deleterious dirt without compromising the craftsmanship and subtleties of a beloved landmark.
"We're moving from a macroscopic to a microscopic point of view," said Kate B. Ottavino, a preservation specialist with Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut Associates in New York. "The debates in the past were romantic and esthetic, but now there is so much science to work with that we're trying to make the theory of preservation catch up with the technology."
 
New Methods
Caution Becomes The Watchword
 Some recent refurbishings of famous buildings that have used the new technology have nevertheless given passersby a shock. For as long as most New Yorkers can remember, Trinity Church in lower Manhattan had been a looming black tower, a somber gothic meditation amid the controlled bedlam of Wall Street. But a gentle cleansing removed the accreted soot from the 19th-century church and returned it to its original color, a light and confectionary pinkish tone that some New Yorkers actively dislike.
Elsewhere in Manhattan, the first cleaning in its history is about to commence on the century-old Dakota, a brooding Beaux-Arts apartment house on Central Park where the movie "Rosemary's Baby" was filmed and where John Lennon was shot to death. As a test patch on the building reveals, the operation will transform the streaky, espresso-brown building into something the color of fawnskin. Hardcore antiquarians compare cleaning up the Dakota to painting over the Sistine Chapel, but preservationists in charge of the project insist the building will be healthier and comelier as a result.
"In the early days, I felt the dirt had this wonderful romance about it, and I didn't want to touch it," said Joseph Bresnan, an architect, longtime preservationist and president of Remco, the New York company that will be cleaning the Dakota. "But as we investigated the exterior and saw the conditions up close, I realized the building must be cleaned. And it is going to look more beautiful, no doubt about it."
For most people, buildings seem indestructible, designed to withstand the abuses of the elements and certainly far more stoic than the mortals who create them. But conservationists compare their specialty to medicine, using the same terms to describe damage and decay in a building as might be applied to a patient. They talk about whether the building suffers from any "pathology" and they ask whether or not its stone can breathe and sweat.
Restorationists also take the position increasingly favored by doctors that if you do not have to go in and poke around or do any sort of emergency surgery, stay away.
"The most important principle in medicine is, first do no harm," said Nicolas F. Veloz, who works on protecting and restoring monuments for the National Park Service. "The same goes for buildings. You generally do the least amount of intervention possible."
Mr. Veloz takes the analogy to medicine quite seriously, speeding to the scene of a decaying building or a graffiti-marred monument in a refitted ambulance.
 
Past Sins
An Excess of Zeal Brought Damage
 Conservationists are especially wary of being too aggressive in cleaning a building in the wake of the extensive damage that has been done by overzealous grooming squads in the past.
In the 1960's and 1970's, many buildings whose stones or bricks had merely begun to weather a little were sandblasted with an abrasive spray shot at the facade at a wilting pressure of about 150 pounds per square inch to strip off dirt the quickest way possible. The practice was viewed as sanitizing a building, but the results were devastating.
"When you sandblast, you lose most of the surface, and all the decorative details that give a building character," said Martin Weaver, director of the Center for Preservation Research and a professor of architecture at Columbia University in New York. "You strip the building down to something that looks like molten candy."
 
Giving Statues the Measles
 Another popular cleaning item was hydrofluoric acid, a compound so powerful it is used to etch glass. Masonry buildings, with their craggy surfaces, were thought to be able to withstand an acidic drizzle, and the treatment did have the seemingly miraculous effect of instantly lifting away filth without any immediate impact on the stone. But many building materials, particularly those with a base of calcium or magnesium carbonate, like marble and limestone, were later shown to be able to dissolve in acid as sugar does in a cup of tea. And whenever these compounds were bathed in hydrofluoric acid, portions of the structure's skin gradually turned to dust and blew away.
Compulsive cleaning crews would try anything, scrubbing at dirty marble with a steel wire brush, for example, which had an immediate brightening effect that eventually turned into a horror show.
"A lot of marble statues were given measles," Mr. Weaver said. "Invisible steel fibers were deposited below the surface, where they rusted. The statue would be white one day, and all of a sudden these brown spots would appear everywhere."'
A related problem plagued St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York when the marble neo-Gothic landmark was cleaned in the mid-1980's with water dripped gently from hoses strung along its roof. As the water flowed over the surface, natural iron pigments deep in the marble began migrating outward, turning the huge white cathedral a rusty brown. Eventually, further water applications washed the iron away and restored St. Patrick to its creamy sheen.
At Trinity Church, a building of sandstone, which is naturally porous, conservators in the 1920's decided they would try to waterproof the masonry by coating it in paraffin, as one might wax a car. But the clever notion proved disastrous. The paraffin immediately absorbed far more soot, coal dust and grime than the building would have otherwise, until New Yorkers came to believe that any church so thoroughly black must have been designed to be funereal.
When decomposition of parts of the tower forced preservationists to clean the church recently, the paraffin was stripped off with a mild solvent revealing a shockingly rosy stone beneath. "None of us expected that the stone would be so pink," said Alex Herrera, director of the Landmarks Preservation Society in New York. "The coating of paraffin had been a really bad idea, and now the architect's orginal intentions come through more clearly."
Conservationists complain that rotten cleaning jobs are still commonplace, usually as a result of ignorance. Mr. Veloz said that he was recently out on a job attempting to remove lewd graffiti from a public statue. He and other workers applied a combination of mild chemicals, but the best the team could manage was to lighten the graffiti, not erase it altogether. One member of the team suggested sandblasting.
"I told him, I can show you four instances of graffiti in Washington where the graffiti is absolutely permanent and indelible, because it was sandblasted," Mr. Veloz said. "Instead of having painted letters that are half an inch wide, you get sandblasted outlines that are two inches wide, and that will never weather off."
 
Case Histories
Moving Ahead One Stone at Time
Leery of quick solutions, most conservationists today begin by asking what the dirt on a building is, and how it is bonding with the architectural material. Sometimes the dirt turns out to be beneficial to the stone, and restorationists may recommend leaving it alone. The wall surrounding Central Park in New York, for example, is covered with dirt that extensive tests have shown is able to repel moisture and thus protect the stone, and during recent restorations of the park preservationists opted not to scrub the wall at all.
But dirt can sometimes be as rotten as it appears. At the New York Public Library, a grand Beaux Arts temple on Fifth Avenue, conservationists examined samples of surface dirt by using X-ray diffraction analysis and infrared spectroscopy, which broke down the gray smears into their constituent elements. The researchers found that the sculptural details on the building, including the bas-relief lions, had interacted with pollutants from acid rain. As a result, the calcium carbonate on the surface had been transformed into calcium sulfate, or gypsum, and the pathology was spreading in fungal fashion through the stone.
"It was migrating inward, invading the lion's ear like a disease," said Ms. Ottavino. "The gypsum had formed a scab, and underneath the scab it was turning to powder. We had to clean to extend the life of the building."
Sometimes preservationists must clean a building just to get in and do emergency surgery to save the structure from collapse. At the City and County Building in Salt Lake City, a magnificent dark Victorian building, researchers recently took core samples from significant spots on the building. Through measurements of the porosity of the stone and its plasticity, the preservationists determined that the masonry was crumbling from within.
Part of the problem was that the building had been constructed of brownstone, a material too delicate for the extremes of temperature found in Utah, and over time the stone had been freezing, thawing and freezing again. With each cycle of expansion and contraction, moisture and dirt had penetrated deeper into the sandstone, causing hairline cracks and crevices and forcing salts from within the stone up to the surface, where they crystallized into ugly white shadows called efflorescences.
To shore up the decaying brownstone through the addition of supportive consolidating materials, the restorationists first removed several layers of pollutants.
 
Fighting the Food Chain
 In Washington, the National Park Service researchers are desperate to figure out how to keep the nation's treasured monuments presentable enough without resorting to regular scrubs, which are still part of the routine. Their investigations have revealed that at the Lincoln Memorial, a peculiar cross between technology and the food chain is to blame for some of the untidiness. Each day at sunset, small insects called midges emerge en masse to mate. At the same time, flood lights are switched on to bathe the building in a noble aura, and the excited midges fly toward the lights, smashing against the wall and forming a great proteinous mess.
Large spiders are attracted to the scent of decaying midge bodies, and they sully the structure with cobwebs and spider droppings. The spiders in turn beckon sparrows, which also defecate against the memorial.
"We've got quite an ecosystem going, and it's unsightly," said Rebecca Stevens of the Park Service. But neither spider feces nor midge bodies harm the building as much as attempts to wash the mess off with water. The saturated stone absorbs particles from automobile exhaust, and the mixture infiltrates the marble.
For the next several years, the Park Service preservationists will be analyzing every block of marble to determine in each case whether aggressive steps are necessary, like consolidating a weak stone with the addition of new binding materials. But they already have learned that a simple change in their lighting practice may help prevent future filth at the monument.
A year ago, the Park Service experimented with postponing the floodlighting of the memorial until an hour after sunset, when the midges' mating frenzy had already subsided. Entomologists were sent forth to count midge fatalies, and they discovered that the delayed lighting reduced the body count by 80 to 90 percent. The Park Service is now considering whether or not to delay lighting the memorial every night, cutting down not only on the midge problem, but its electricity bill as well.

(Jim Estrin for The New York Times) (pg. C8)
 
Diagram: "Preserving Architectural Treasures"
 Scientists are seeking ways to keep buildings clean without damaging scrubbing. At the Lincoln Memorial, for example, washing saturates stonework and carries damaging pollutants into the marble. But researchers found a simple way to untangle a combination of lighting, insects and birds that caused much of the problem. The chain begins with midges, tiny insects attracted by the memorial's lights in their mating frenzy.
 The midges crash into the walls, spiders are attracted to their decaying bodies and the spiders in turn attract birds. The creatures and their droppings sully the memorial, and the washing does even more damage.
 Scientists are analyzing the marble to determine how to preserve it from auto emissions and other pollutants that continue to assault it. Meanwhile, entomologists have devised a stopgap: leaving the lights off until an hour after sunset, which cut the memorial's midge population by 80 to 90 percent. (pg. C1)

HEADLINE: The Excuse Maker

 BODY:
Why, it's all Japan's fault, barks Chrysler's chairman, Lee Iacocca. Fresh from President Bush's dismal trip to Tokyo, he insists that "We do not have idiots running General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, or our suppliers. And our workers are not lazy and stupid." Detroit has declined, he says, because of unfair Japanese trade practices and "insidious Japanese economic and political power within the United States."
These accusations are worse than wrong. They're reckless. For someone so well known to make them is to incite chauvinism, even xenophobia. Something is wrong in Detroit, and for Mr. Iacocca to blast Japan is to dodge his, and his industry's, shortcomings. 
 The next stage of irresponsibility will be new calls for protectionist legislation -- some has already been proposed by members of Congress from Michigan -- that would rescue Detroit by making U.S. customers pay more for cars, and by destroying jobs in U.S. export industries like agriculture and computers.
Mr. Iacocca is right that the problem is not inept workers. And he's right that Detroit's executives aren't stupid. It takes a plenty smart chairman to rake in millions in compensation for firing tens of thousands of his employees. The problems were, however, made in Detroit.
Overpaid executives and overweight unions took advantage of the years following World War II when foreign competitors were virtually nonexistent. When Volkswagen, Toyota and Honda surged, Detroit was left stumbling. The solution lies in making better cars in this country, not angrier excuses about Japan.
Detroit needs to sell more cars at home, where imports now claim a third of sales. Mr. Iacocca yells foul, contending that the quality of U.S. cars now equals Japanese makes. But even if U.S. quality is improving, Mr. Iacocca ignores something every consumer knows. Capitalist companies live and die on reputation.
For decades the Big Three poured out badly designed, badly engineered products. They squandered their own reputations; they will have to regain them by performance, over years, to convince a public burned by false promises.
Mr. Iacocca's accusations about Japanese trade barriers are equally defective. Sure, the Japanese system is hard to penetrate. But businesses like Motorola that try can succeed. U.S. auto companies have never really tried. They persist in trying to sell cars designed for Americans but ill suited for Japan, and fail to invest in factories and distribution networks that would make sales possible.
The Big Three certainly do know how to make cars that foreign buyers find attractive. G.M. and Ford do plenty of business producing cars in Europe that are tailored to local tastes.
Is it all Japan's fault? Another of President Bush's traveling companions came back with a different answer. Asked whether exporting more cars to Japan would alter his plans to cut 74,000 jobs in the U.S., he observed, "Those two are completely separate issues." His name is Robert Stempel and he's the chairman of General Motors.

HEADLINE: Algeria: Democracy Betrayed

 BODY:
Algeria's army did its best on Saturday to destroy democracy in the name of saving it, forcibly intervening to interrupt an election that an Islamic fundamentalist party appeared certain to win. Western Governments, the Bush Administration included, have been shamefully reluctant to condemn an illegitimate and unwise move sure to heighten political tension.
The Islamic Salvation Front, cheated of the decisive electoral triumph its strong first round showing seemed to assure, has now called on Algerians to rise up and defy the army's decrees. 
 The Salvation Front is no paragon of pluralist virtue. But the democracy movement now belatedly lapping at the shores of the Arab world offers the best hope for managing the growing political tensions of a region long misgoverned by unrepresentative, self-perpetuating regimes.
The army's intervention wipes out the political progress Algeria has made since 1988. In October of that year the army crushed protests against corruption and one-party rule, killing hundreds of civilians. President Chadli Benjedid responded by moving quickly toward economic and political reform, a process that was meant to culminate in the two-round parliamentary vote.
Even after the Islamic Salvation Front won close to an outright majority in the first round of voting last month, secular parties like the second-place Front for Socialist Forces expressed their faith in the process. That spoke well for their own commitment to democratic principles. But it also reflected their reasonable belief that Mr. Benjedid would be able to use his considerable presidential powers to assure a smooth transition.
Mr. Benjedid apparently advocated that same approach in behind-the-scenes deliberations. But hard-liners within the army and the long-ruling National Liberation Front have now shoved him and his sensible advice aside.
If the Bush Administration is sincere about encouraging democracy in the Arab world, it has a responsibility to press Algeria's army to reverse its reckless course before the damage gets worse.

Making a Case For U S Sprint

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
IF MCI is David to A.T.&T.'s Goliath, then U S Sprint is David's smaller brother.
 As 1991 ended, Robert B. Morris of Goldman, Sachs estimates, U S Sprint had 9.8 percent of the market for long-distance calls, based on minutes of use, up slightly from 9.5 percent the year before. That is about half of MCI's 19 percent, which was up from the 18.4 percent a year earlier. He estimates A.T.&T. had 67 percent, down from 68.2 percent in 1990. 
Mr. Morris estimates that Americans and their computers talked at least 325 billion minutes last year, or more than 618,000 years worth of long-distance calls.
 U S Sprint's residential business is weak, compared with A.T.&T. and MCI, so most analysts are bearish on United Telecommunications Inc., U S Sprint's parent. That is despite United Telecom's significant cost reductions and improved profit margins. Those few analysts who recommend the company, based in Kansas City, Mo., say the stock is cheap at present. Yesterday, United Telecommunications closed at $25 a share, down 62.5 cents, far from its 52-week high of $31.50.
 United Telecom has been one of the more volatile stocks in the telecommunications group, peaking in late 1989 and early 1990 above $40.
 At about 14 times projected 1991 earnings and 11.5 times projected 1992 earnings, the shares are undervalued compared with the Standard & Poor's 500, which is trading at around 15 times earnings.
 Analysts estimate that United Telecommunications earned $1.65 or more a share last year and expect $2 or more this year, up from $1.43 a share in 1990, which included a $72 million charge for layoffs, a write-off of certain assets and other restructuring costs.
 The recession has hurt most long-distance carriers, especially in their lucrative business traffic. Although there is no precise estimate for business calls because the companies have no way of determining who is on the line, most analysts say business makes up about half of long-distance calls.
 While some businesses, trying to drum up customers, have made more long-distance calls, others have reduced their phone bills through closing offices and laying off workers. The newly laid off, in turn, often cut back their spending at home on long-distance calls.
 As a result, growth in the market for long-distance calls has slowed considerably. This year, analysts expect Americans to spend $60.9 billion on long-distance calls, up about 4 percent from 1990, according to Gregory R. Sawers, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. That anemic rate compares with average growth of 12 to 13 percent a year between the 1984 breakup of A.T.&T. and 1990.
 It is unclear how much of the 1991 revenue growth came from simple price increases, rather than overall growth in usage. American Telephone and Telegraph, the dominant carrier, has so-called public switched network traffic, the familiar telephone-in-the-wall service, as well as flat-fee private line traffic used by the computers of big corporations.
 But analysts say volume growth for all carriers was probably at best 6 percent, down from 10 percent or more in previous years.
 Mr. Sawers of Sanford C. Bernstein said: "The cost side of Sprint has improved, while they have lost market share among residential customers. They've had their eye on the cost ball, but lost their eye on the market-share ball." Charles W. Schelke, a Smith Barney analyst, said, "As a client told me, they can walk and they can chew gum, but they can't do both at the same time."
 But Mr. Schelke continues to recommend the stock because he figures U S Sprint is worth $20 to $22 a share and an investor can get the rest of United Telecom, which consists of a lucrative local-telephone company and other profitable businesses, for only a few dollars more.
 United Telecom's annual revenue in 1990 totaled about $8.34 billion. About 59 cents of every sales dollar in 1990 came from U S Sprint, but only 17 cents of every profit dollar, partly because of the big special charges.
 About 32 cents of 1990 sales dollars came from local telephone service, which accounted for most of United Telecom's profit, or 76 cents of every income dollar.
 William Esrey, chairman of United Telecom, acknowledged that U S Sprint's market-share growth had slowed, but said to focus on share was "too simplistic an approach."
 "We have underperformed, but just in the residential market," Mr. Esrey said, noting that it is often a less profitable, "low end" business compared with the corporate market. "If you look at the sophisticated business user, our market share has grown significantly."
 United Telecom bought the remaining 19.9 percent stake in U S Sprint from GTE earlier this month, and United Telecom plans to increase its 1992 advertising budget. Mr. Esrey said Sprint would market more aggressively to the residential customer, the focus of most television and print advertising.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Making a Case For U S Sprint

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
IF MCI is David to A.T.&T.'s Goliath, then U S Sprint is David's smaller brother.
 As 1991 ended, Robert B. Morris of Goldman, Sachs estimates, U S Sprint had 9.8 percent of the market for long-distance calls, based on minutes of use, up slightly from 9.5 percent the year before. That is about half of MCI's 19 percent, which was up from the 18.4 percent a year earlier. He estimates A.T.&T. had 67 percent, down from 68.2 percent in 1990. 
Mr. Morris estimates that Americans and their computers talked at least 325 billion minutes last year, or more than 618,000 years worth of long-distance calls.
 U S Sprint's residential business is weak, compared with A.T.&T. and MCI, so most analysts are bearish on United Telecommunications Inc., U S Sprint's parent. That is despite United Telecom's significant cost reductions and improved profit margins. Those few analysts who recommend the company, based in Kansas City, Mo., say the stock is cheap at present. Yesterday, United Telecommunications closed at $25 a share, down 62.5 cents, far from its 52-week high of $31.50.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: REPUBLICANS;
Buchanan's Alternative: Not Kinder or Gentler

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 10

 BODY:
The candidate of political incorrectness was on a tear.
Speaking to a packed auditorium of largely appreciative Dartmouth students in Hanover, N.H., the other night, Patrick J. Buchanan called the senior leader of China, Deng Xiaoping, an "85-year-old chain-smoking Communist dwarf." 
 He skewered Charles R. Black Jr., the Bush campaign strategist who has been lobbying for a Japanese consortium seeking American business, as "a geisha girl of the new world order."
He mocked Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development who has been the Administration's chief advocate for the poor and minorities, saying he had "gone native."
 
'None of the Above'
 To a young woman who complained about his jagged edge, Mr. Buchanan replied: "In this campaign, I have been called an anti-Semite, a homophobe, a racist, a sexist, a nativist, a protectionist, an isolationist, a social fascist and a beer-hall conservative. And then Sam Donaldson had the nerve on the Brinkley show to ask me if I was insensitive, too. I am none of the above."
Mr. Buchanan's comments on sensitive issues -- from immigration to Israel to the homeless to foreign trade -- are not gaffes. They are, in a way, the whole point of his "America First" campaign. Over the years, through his newspaper columns and television commentary, Mr. Buchanan has become a wealthy celebrity by wrapping his right-wing views in spicy rhetoric.
Indeed, he is well-heeled enough to drive a Mercedes-Benz and wear a Hermes tie, possessions that might go better with a "Germany First" or "France First" campaign.
The brawling teen-ager from Northwest Washington, who grew up in "a world of clarity and absolutes" where his father's "political holy trinity" was Francisco Franco, Joseph R. McCarthy and Douglas MacArthur, has turned into a brawling candidate seeking the Presidency, or more realistically, the leadership of the conservative movement.
"There is no conservative party in Washington today," Mr. Buchanan says. "There is a one-party government. The big-government Republicans and the big-spending Democrats have gotten together to raise taxes the country didn't want, to vote quotas the country didn't want, to vote Congress a 40-to-50 percent pay raise that everybody in America said they didn't want."
Mr. Buchanan openly longs for a return to the values and mores he grew up with in the cloistered world of 1950's middle-class Catholicism, days of Latin Masses and disciplinarian fathers who took off their leather belts to deal with smart-mouthed children, days when no one had heard of cocaine or marijuana and the fights were usually over "some girl," as Mr. Buchanan recalled.
William Buchanan, an accountant known as "Pop," taught his strapping sons to fight early, hanging a punching bag in the basement and telling the boys to hit the bag four times a week, 100 times with the left hand, 100 with the right, 200 with the "one-two."
By the time Patrick Buchanan and his brothers were teen-agers, they were spoken of among Washington Catholic high school students with the same awe and fear with which Romanian peasants spoke of vampires. On Monday mornings, in Catholic high schools throughout the city, clusters of boys would gather to swap stories about what trouble the Buchanan boys had wrought over the weekend, and to trade advice about avoiding the hooligans at all cost.
In his memoir, "Right From the Beginning," Mr. Buchanan recalls how he was suspended from Georgetown University after he assaulted a couple of Washington police officers who had stopped his car after he tried to pass them. He wrote that he attacked one of the officers by putting "a size 10 1/2-cordovan where I thought it might do some good -- and vaulted him into the street."
Mr. Buchanan still likes to poke people in the nose and kick them where he thinks it might do some good. He just uses words now. Certainly, his strength is that he offers no weasel words. He says things that many Americans believe but are reluctant to say except in the privacy of their own homes.
"A very smart person with very simple beliefs can be extremely effective," said Michael Kinsley, Mr. Buchanan's former partner on the political television show "Crossfire."
Mr. Buchanan's campaign slogan, "America First," harks back to an isolationist movement before World War II, several of whose leaders were considered German sympathizers.
 
Gauging New Hampshire
 But as he travels about New Hampshire, it is clear that Mr. Buchanan has correctly gauged voters' deep anger at President Bush for staying too long at the global ball -- "Skull and Bones International," as Mr. Buchanan calls the Bush Presidency -- while middle-class Americans were slipping into a deep recession.
Touring a gun factory in Claremont, one of the few New Hampshire industries that has not been hit hard by the recession, Mr. Buchanan told Jim Lavigne, "You vote for me, my friend, and there won't be all those foreign trips. Japan, China, Korea and Germany -- we've been supporting them for so long and they're putting nothing back."
Mr. Lavigne, a 47-year-old inspector with a cresting stomach standing in front of a rack of .38-caliber pistols, agreed that he did not intend to give Mr. Bush "the time of day" in the Republican primary next month.
After earning a master's degree in journalism at Columbia University and a stint as a reporter and editorial writer in St. Louis, Mr. Buchanan honed his pugnacious prose as a speechwriter in the Nixon White House, where he penned the phrase "pusilanimous pussyfooters" used by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. He also headed the communications shop in the Reagan White House, a center of right-wing ideological foment.
In person, he is more engaging and less beefy than he is on television, a man who likes movies and the poetry of W. H. Auden and walking on the beach by himself (but not with wingtips, like his former mentor, Richard M. Nixon). He has decorated his study at his home in McLean, Va., with portraits of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, a tip of the hat to his great-great-grandfather, a Protestant slave-owner who fought for the Confederacy.
 
Using Words as Power
 His years with the Jesuits at Gonzaga High School and Georgetown and his years on television have made him a deft debater with an understanding of the power of words to wound, to stir, to amuse, to finesse uncomfortable points.
Asked by a Dartmouth student if he still believed that AIDS was "God's retribution" against homosexuals, Mr. Buchanan won over the college crowd by asserting that he had never written that in a column, adding frostily, "I don't believe any individual knows the mind of God, my friend."
But what Mr. Buchanan did not say was that he had written a column calling AIDS "nature's retribution" against homosexuals. Asked about this later, Mr. Buchanan conceded that he wrote and believes this.
Mr. Buchanan also tried to finesse a question from another Dartmouth student about a memorandum he gave to President Nixon in 1971, attached to an Atlantic magazine article by Richard Hernnstein concluding that heredity, rather than environment, determined intelligence. In the memorandum, Mr. Buchanan suggested that if they could not refute the article then perhaps racial and economic-class integration in educational programs should be reconsidered because they would cause "perpetual friction."
Mr. Buchanan told the students that some published reports about the memo had failed to indicate that he had a line in the memorandum that the article be sent be sent to such political intellectuals as Irving Kristol and Daniel Patrick Moynihan for "possible refutation."
 
'Powerful and Seminal'
 But the full document also shows that Mr. Buchanan called the article "powerful and seminal" and he said "if there is no refutation," the piece "could serve, frankly, as an intellectual basis, for political decisions either 'realistic' or rather frightful."
The Boston Globe, which unearthed the Nixon memorandums, characterized Mr. Buchanan as a pioneer of Republican wedge issues. In another memorandum, he told Mr. Nixon that "there is a legitimate grievance in my view of white working-class people that every time on every issue that the black militants loud-mouth it, we come up with more money."
In a lengthy article two weeks ago in National Review, William F. Buckley, an early hero to Mr. Buchanan, said that he had reluctantly decided that Mr. Buchanan had made anti-Semitic remarks -- "whatever it was that drove him to say and do it: most probably, an iconoclastic temperament." It is an accusation disputed by many of Mr. Buchanan's Jewish friends and colleagues.
"You can't give someone a blood test," said Mr. Kinsley. "It's not a definite yes or no. He has said things that raise a lot of disturbing questions and are sort of offensive. But I discount it for several reasons. Pat is the kind of guy who likes to overstate his case. And in his own heart, Pat honestly believes he's not anti-Semitic, and that counts for something."
 
Treblinka Contentions
 One of Mr. Buchanan's more sensational contentions was in a column defending John Demjanjuk against charges that he was "Ivan the Terrible" at the Nazi camp of Treblinka. The diesel engine reported to have been used to kill Jews at Treblinka could not have been the weapon because "diesel engines do not emit enough carbon monoxide to kill anybody," he said.
The candidate stands by this suggestion, observing, "I believe it was a different kind of killing engine at Treblinka, a gas engine rather than diesel." Although Mr. Buchanan has implied that perhaps not as many people died as reported, he now says: "I accept the verdict of the Israeli court as to the numbers of those who died."
On economic issues, Mr. Buchanan's critics see a pattern of barely concealed animus toward all groups except his own, a pattern that plays on the fears that take hold in hard times.
"In 1988 George Bush said, 'We're going to create 30 million new jobs,' " Mr. Buchanan tells his audiences. "What he didn't tell us was that they were in Guangdong Province, Yokohama and Mexico."
 
'God Made All People Good'
 On the ABC News program "This Week" with David Brinkley recently, Mr. Buchanan observed: "I think God made all people good. But if we had to take a million immigrants in, say, Zulus next year, or Englishmen, and put them up in Virginia, what group would be easier to assimilate and would cause less problems for the people of Virginia?"
He complains about "a landfill called multiculturalism" and came up with the idea of the "Buchanan fence," a trench along the Mexican border to control illegal immigration.
He says that relentless homeless beggars should be picked up for vagrancy and locked up. He is strictly anti-abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, saying that it would be better to kill the rapist than the unborn baby.
Mr. Buchanan is focusing nearly all his efforts on New Hampshire. His advisers complain that the Republican Party has been trying to block their attempts to get on several states' ballots.
Mr. Buchanan says that he will support Mr. Bush in the general election if he loses, as long as Mr. Bush promises to support him, if he loses.
Given his punching-bag upbringing, it is not surprising that Mr. Buchanan is thriving on the contentiousness of the Presidential campaign, and making Mr. Bush's collegiality and bipartisan spirit a centerpiece of his complaints about the President.
"Ronald Reagan succeeded because he believed in the politics of confrontation which give us clarity and political accountability," Mr. Buchanan likes to say. "George Bush simply will not fight Congress and you can never get the government under control unless you're willing to confront."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Vows Change in Trenton As It Takes Over the Legislature

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The 205th New Jersey Legislature convened today, ushering in a new Republican majority and tough talk from party leaders who pledged to make sweeping changes in state government.
In a direct challenge to Gov. Jim Florio and his Democratic administration, the new Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said he intended to use the investigatory powers of Senate committees "to oversee government operations" and would not hesitate to subpoena uncooperative administration officials. 
 "The people sent us here with an unmistakable mandate for change," Mr. DiFrancesco told his Senate colleagues after they took their oaths of office. "I accept that mandate and send this challenge to those in government: 'Lead, follow or get out of the way.' "
 
Conciliatory Tone From Florio
 Two hours later, the often-pugnacious Mr. Florio delivered a measured, conciliatory State of the State address, focusing largely on New Jersey's economic recovery and the plight of the middle class. He asked the Legislature to support a series of plans to create more than 100,000 new jobs and to make it easier for the middle class to buy homes and send their children to college.
"People need help, and they need hope," Mr. Florio said. "Not next year. Not somewhere down the road. They need it now."
Mr. DiFrancesco, who styled his speech a "state of the future" address, said Republicans would push for a constitutional amendment to allow citizen lawmaking through initiative and referendum, and that they would propose campaign finance legislation that would include a limit on contributions.
At the War Memorial Building, across the street from the State House, Assembly members gathered for their swearing-in ceremony, and the new Republican Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, told them:
"Our people are overtaxed. Men and women are losing jobs. Our schools are in chaos and our citizenry has lost confidence in the ability of their leaders to move our state ahead."
Mr. Haytaian said the Republicans would solve those problems by creating new foreign trade zones in port districts, awarding tax credits to encourage exports and cutting the capital gains tax to induce greater savings and investment.
Campaigning against a $2.8 billion tax package that the Democratic-controlled 204th Legislature approved in 1990, the Republicans won majority control of the Assembly and the Senate last fall for the first time in 20 years.
With a 27-to-13 majority in the Senate and a 58-to-22 majority in the Assembly, the Republicans have enough votes to override any veto by Mr. Florio and will be able to influence policy on a variety of issues, from the budget to the way some agencies are run.
On Monday, the day before the Republicans took control, the outgoing Senate approved and sent to Governor Florio a package of welfare revisions that, among other changes, would cut off additional benefits to welfare mothers who have more children. Democrats said they hoped that by acting while they still had a majority, they could prevent conservative Republicans from passing only the punitive elements of the bill and eliminating the incentives intended to preserve families.
Since the Republicans' victory on Nov. 5, Mr. DiFrancesco had been conciliatory toward the Florio administration. But he made it clear today that Republicans intended to use their new power to try to make major changes.
Mr. DiFrancesco said Republicans plan to roll back the sales tax from 7 to 6 percent and to enact legislation that would exclude business machinery and equipment from local property taxes to spur economic growth.
He also promised to conduct "an aggressive re-evaluation" of the Quality Education Act, Mr. Florio's controversial plan to pour money into poorer school districts while gradually ending state aid to the richer districts.
"The Quality Education Act is a grossly expensive, failed social experiment," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "It has thrown our school systems into disarray; it has ruined public confidence in education; but worse, the Q.E.A. threatens to compromise our children's education."
Promising to strengthen the school takeover law, Mr. DiFrancesco said: "If Senator Jack Ewing and his Education Committee have to camp out in the cafeterias and auditoriums of every school in New Jersey to make sure tax money is being spent wisely, they will."
Mr. DiFrancesco said he would order a complete review of the Administrative Procedures Act, the law commissioners use in writing state regulations, and he announced the creation of a Select Committee on Economic Development.
 
Using Committee Powers
 Mr. DiFrancesco, a lawyer from Scotch Plains who has served in the Legislature since 1975, said the Republicans would change the state through the Senate committees.
"Our committees will thoroughly examine and analyze the operations of state government, the regulatory procedures of the bureaucracy, and the performance levels of all programs at every level of government," he said.
"We will not hesitate to draw on the subpoena powers of the Senate if there are any commissioners, civil servants, political appointees or elected officials who refuse to cooperate in a detailed assessment of existing government programs. The uncooperative will not be a barrier to our efforts."
 
A Younger Legislature
 The Senate Minority Leader, John A. Lynch, was conciliatory in his response, wishing the new Republican majority good luck and promising that the Democrats would work with them.
"We will support your programs when you are right, we will suggest improvements when you are nearly right and we will propose our own alternatives when we feel you are wrong and when a legislative vacuum exists," Mr. Lynch said.
The Republicans will preside over a Legislature that is dominated by lawyers -- 36 of them -- and is slightly younger, more diverse and much less experienced than the 204th Legislature. There are 33 freshmen legislators, 23 in the Assembly and 10 in the Senate.

HEADLINE: Nation's Retail Sales Take Fall, But Investors Push Dow to High

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Retail sales in 1991 were the flattest in 30 years, finishing with three straight monthly declines, the Commerce Department reported today. But the gloomy economic news raised expectations of further cuts in interest rates, an outlook that sent the stock market to a new high.
Retail sales fell four-tenths of 1 percent in December, the Commerce Department reported, adding that what had been an advance in November had been revised to a decline. 
 Investors, however, continued to focus on eventual economic recovery rather than the latest sobering statistics, and they drove stock prices to records on heavy volume. The Dow Jones industrial average soared in the afternoon to close up 60.60 points, to a peak of 3,246.20. [Page D1.]
The market appeared to benefit from a belief that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, might decide to reduce interest rates again in hopes of spurring the economy. Last week he called the economy "flat," with analysts inferring that this meant Mr. Greenspan was content with the credit-easing already applied to the financial system. But at the same Congressional hearing Mr. Greenspan said the Fed stood ready to lower interest rates further if the economy did not live up to his expectations.
 
Effect of Lower Rates
 Lower interest rates have the effect of tax cuts for many people, including those who refinance mortgages or have home equity or other loans that shrink monthly payments automatically as interest rates decline. And lower rates also make stocks relatively more attractive than bonds or other fixed-income investments, such as certificates of deposits. In addition, corporations benefit as their borrowing rates decline, raising the prospect of gains in corporate profits.
Still, recovery from recession seemed little closer today and those watching the economy rather than the stock market, whose reputation as a business-cycle forecaster has lost some luster in recent years, were disappointed in the retail figures, which indicated that the holiday shopping season was even weaker than previously thought.
It tended to confirm the growing view that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter after posting modest gains in the spring and summer.
"These numbers are pretty weak, worse than expected," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York. "It looks like we're sinking again."
Retail sales, which in December totaled $151.2 billion, cover restaurant receipts, car sales, and sales at drugstores, furniture showrooms and gasoline stations as well as at department stores. They account for about a third of total economic activity and, though generally not a pacesetter in recoveries, they need to rise to provide sustained expansion. The rise for all of 1991, seven-tenths of 1 percent, was the slimmest since 1961.
 
Restaurants and Bars Gain
 Today's report said sales of both durable goods and nondurables fell in December, with department stores and other stores that sell general merchandise showing a 2.2 percent drop that more than wiped out a November advance. The only sector with a substantial gain was restaurants and bars -- where Americans spent $16.231 billion during the holiday month.
Durables, defined as anything designed to last at least three years, declined five-tenths of 1 percent, while nondurables declined three-tenths of 1 percent.
Excluding automobiles, which represent about 20 percent of all retail sales, the number of consecutive monthly declines -- including two-tenths of 1 percent for both November and December -- stands at five.
"The consumer is not spending," Edward Yardeni and Deborah Johnson, economists at C. J. Lawrence Inc., told clients. "Low consumer confidence suggests the consumer won't be spending anytime soon."
At first glance, the report of December sales was not so bad, the four-tenths of 1 percent decline about matching expectations. But this was from a much lower level than had initially been estimated for November. Retail sales for November were revised to a total of $151.73 billion instead of the original estimate of $153.11 billion.
That means that what had been thought to have been an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent that month was reversed to a five-tenths of 1 percent decline. The October results were also revised downward, though only to a negative one-tenth of 1 percent from unchanged.
The figures are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and business-day differences but not for inflation, which, as gauged by the Consumer Price Index, ran at a 3 percent rate in the 12 months through November. This suggests there was an actual drop in the volume of goods moving across retail counters in 1991 since inflation exceeded the nominal seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in dollars spent.
 
Auto Sales Decline
 On the other hand, many stores forced by slack demand and competitive pressures to slash prices may have sold more goods but at severely depressed profitability.
Among durable goods, automotive dealers suffered a 1.1 percent sales decline last month after a 1.5 percent decline in November. Stores selling furniture and other equipment for the home had a one-tenth of 1 percent decline, but those selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes posted a six-tenths of 1 percent gain.
In nondurables other than department stores, sales fell 2.4 percent at gasoline service stations, partly reflecting lower prices, and fell seven-tenths of 1 percent at apparel and accessory stores. Food stores and drug and proprietary stores each produced increases of three-tenths of 1 percent while the jump for restaurants and bars was 1.5 percent.
Sales include merchandise sold, sometimes at wholesale, for either cash or credit by businesses primarily engaged in retail trade. Money received for layaways is included, as are receipts for rentals and leasing of equipment and for delivery, installation, maintenance, repair, alteration, storage or other services. Excise taxes, such as on gasoline, liquor and tobacco paid at the factory or wholesale level, are also included.

HEADLINE: Primerica's Net Surged 34% in the 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Primerica Corporation said yesterday that earnings surged 34 percent in the fourth quarter, a result of the rebound on Wall Street and improved performance within the financial-services company.
Primerica said it earned a record $132.1 million, or $1.18 a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $98.8 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.5 percent, to $1.85 billion, from $1.69 billion a year earlier. 
 Earnings of Primerica's brokerage firm, Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, more than quadrupled, to $49.8 million, compared with $10.8 million a year earlier.
The results reflected the prosperity enjoyed by the nation's securities industry in the last year, with large increases in underwritings for new offerings of stocks and bonds. The boom helped to end a recession on Wall Street that began after the 1987 stock market crash.
United States corporations issued a record $580 billion in new securities last year, nearly double the previous record set a year earlier, industry figures show. Stock offerings of nearly $75 billion more than tripled the number a year earlier.
On Wall Street yesterday, Primerica's shares jumped $2.125, to $40.75.
Primerica reported significant improvements in all of its businesses, which range from insurance and investment banking to mutual funds and asset management. Its most notable fourth-quarter revenue gains were in investment banking, up 119 percent, and in retail and institutional commissions, up 38 percent. Revenues from Smith Barney's public finance underwritings nearly doubled from a year earlier.
"We are enormously pleased that 1991 proved to be a banner year for Primerica," said Sanford I. Weill, chairman and chief executive of the New York-based company.
Mr. Weill said Primerica further strengthened itself in the last year by refinancing some of its debt at lower interest rates and repurchasing more than three million shares of stock. The company recently authorized another three-million-share repurchase.
For the year, Primerica earned $478.8 million, or $4.27 a share, up 28.4 percent from $372.9 million, or $3.27 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $6.61 billion from $6.19 billion, up 6.8 percent.

HEADLINE: H.I.V.-Infected Man Accused of Sodomy In Attack on Boy, 11

 BODY:
An 11-year-old boy was abducted yesterday as he walked to school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, taken to a fourth-floor apartment and sodomized, the police said.
The police arrested a suspect who, they said later, was infected with the virus that causes AIDS. 
 The suspect, an unemployed man who was on parole from prison, was identified as Troy Rivera, 27 years old, of 172 West 77th Street in Manhattan. He was arrested last night and charged with with sodomy, unlawful imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a minor.
The police said the boy was walking to school at about 8 A.M. when he was accosted on 77th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues by a stranger, a man who asked him to do an errand for him. The boy refused, saying he had to go to school, the police said. The man then seized the boy and brought him into a nearby apartment building.
The boy was later freed. He ran to school and told a security guard what had happened.
The boy was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where he was treated and released. The police said they arrested Mr. Rivera after the boy was able to bring them back to the apartment.
A police spokeswoman said last night that Mr. Rivera had been imprisoned in 1984 "for a similar crime," and that he had been out on parole since November 1990.
The police, who revealed late last night that Mr. Rivera was HIV-positive, would not say how they learned that information. Nor would they say whether it would have an affect on the charges against Mr. Rivera.

HEADLINE: The Surge In Stocks Resumes

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
After a two-day breather, stock prices resumed their advance with feeling yesterday, with many indexes again bounding to new highs. In heavy trading, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had set 8 records in the previous 12 trading days, repeated the feat, rising 60.60 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 3,246.20.
A chief factor cited by analysts for the market's surge was the weak retail sales report for December, which was disturbing but not unexpected. The reason such bad news appeared to please investors is that it raised hopes of yet another move by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which in the long run could help to lift corporate earnings. 
 Low interest rates have also driven small investors to the stock market, since it currently offers one of the few investments with an attractive return.
 
Oil Stocks Surge
 Some leading oil companies provided leadership for the market, giving it an early boost on speculation that the OPEC meeting next month could bring an agreement to reduce oil production and in turn raise prices. Texaco surged 2 1/8, to 61 1/8, while Exxon gained 1, to 60 1/4. Both stocks are components of the Dow. ARCO jumped 4 1/8, to 108 3/8, and Mobil rose 1 1/2, to 66 7/8.
Traders said American Express added stimulus to the market as it rose on reports that it may be considering selling a big stake in Lehman Brothers, its investment bank, but the company said it would not comment on market speculation. American Express rose 1 1/4, to 23 1/8, and was the fourth most-active issues yesterday.
The market may have also been influenced by rumors that the latest survey of consumer confidence by the University of Michigan would show a sharp rise. In addition, there were rumors that consumer confidence would be down and others that it would be flat.
 
Rise in Trading Volume
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 265.9 million, up from 200.4 million shares traded on Monday, as gaining issues handily outpaced losers by 1,250 to 525.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 6.10 points, for a new high of 420.44, as the New York Stock Exchange's composite index gained 3.10 points, to a new high of 231.57.
With trading active on the American Stock Exchange, its index moved 4.74 points higher, to yet another closing high of 412.63.
Similarly, trading in the over-the-counter market pushed the Nasdaq composite index to an all-time high of 625.75, up 8.12 points, while the Russell 2,000 rose 2.49 points, to 202.35, its highest closing to date.
The Dow's 60.60-point gain yesterday was the largest since Dec. 30, when the average rose 62.39 points.
 
Big Board's 50-Point Rule
 Trading would have been even brisker yesterday if it had not beenfor the Big Board's 50-point rule, which restricts program trading as soon the Dow moves up or down 50 points. By eliminating electronic trading and forcing program traders to buy stocks only on the downtick of stock prices, the market is able to control the volatility that program trading adds to a session.
John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president and director of research for Advest Inc., said that he could not put his finger on any one factor behind the market's rise, but that investors appeared to be more upbeat about the economy.
"What you had in yesterday's market were more of the same forces at work that have been accumulating since the monetary easing last month," Mr. Shaughnessy said. "It's money looking for a home and cash is not the king anymore."
 
'A Rush of Investors'
 Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal & Company, said the market seemed to be resisting any correction. "Each time the market pulls back, there is a rush of investors buying into the market and driving prices up," he said.
Mr. Seagle was referring to both small investors, who have been returning to the market for lack of better returns elsewhere, and some institutional investors, who at first did not believe that the market could sustain the rally and are now trying to get in.
Traders say that while investors have been quick to buy into the market, many are still concerned that the stock market may be placing too high a valuation on future corporate profits. "It is the professionals who worry about vaulations," Mr. Seagle said. "They were the ones who moved to the sidelines and now are waiting to get in."
Still, some stocks did lose ground yesterday. Biogen fell 1 3/4, to 40 1/2, as Denise Gilbert, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, reduced her rating on the biotechnology company's stock to "hold" from a "buy" and cut her 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates. Traders said Ms. Gilbert revised her recommendation because Biogen was putting more money into research and development than first thought. In December, Jeffrey Swarz, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, made a similar rating change because the company was using income from royalties to finance clinical trials of a drug that prevents blood clots.
 
Gains for U.S. Surgical
 Higher earnings expectations drove U.S. Surgical stock up 3, to 130 1/2. Kurt H. Kruger, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, said that the medical-supply company was to release its fourth-quarter results tomorrow and that he expected more than a 50 percent increase in revenues and more than a 70 percent increase in earnings per share, to 48 cents. Last year, the company's stock price tripled, and this year Mr. Kruger thinks it has a chance to double.
"The rise in revenues and earnings are being powered by a broad shift in surgery to less invasive methods, representing a potential $4 billion to $5 billion market in which U.S. Surgical will be a major player," he said.

NEW APPROACH ON TRANSIT
Faced with chronic budget problems, Governor Cuomo has decided the state cannot afford to commit itself to paying for another five-year program for improvement of subways, buses and commuter rail lines, his aides said. The decision signaled a major change in the state's approach to upgrading mass transit, with the Governor withdrawing the state from its commitment, maintained over all of the last decade, to long-term capital plans to buy subway cars and buses, rebuild tracks, fix signals and improve all the myraid elements of regional mass transit. But transit officials said that breaking the 10-year string under which $16 billion was spent since 1981 to revive the neglected transit system would wreak havoc with work already being planned and would add substantially to its eventual cost.

HEADLINE: Washington: It Isn't Wall Street

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The main thing he learned in Washington, said Robert R. Glauber, who is resigning Friday as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Finance and returning to academic life, is that there is no clean mechanism here to resolve conflicts.
On Wall Street, his academic specialty, "the markets force issues to a resolution," he said. 
 "They add up and weigh all the conflicting arguments," he continued. "Then, you either sell the stock or you don't sell the stock. It either goes up in price, or it goes down in price. You never have a stalemate."
But in government, he went on, summing up in a long interview his experiences here, "everything is negotiated."
"There are all these power centers, all these lobbying groups," he said. "When there are conflicting arguments, it is very difficult for anyone to add them up and weigh them, and more times than not, you get stalemates."
Mr. Glauber, who is 52 years old, is in an unusual position to make such a comparison. For more than 20 years, he was a professor at the Harvard Business School and one of the foremost academic authorities on the economics of the financial markets.
Then, in the fall of 1987, he was hired as the top staff member of Nicholas F. Brady's Presidential commission to explore the causes of that October's stock market crash. When Mr. Brady became Treasury Secretary the next year, he named Mr. Glauber to the department's No. 3 post.
It is extremely rare for someone with academic credentials like Mr. Glauber's and with no government or political background to be given such a central policy-making job in Washington. But he was thrown into some of the hottest political issues in town, and he showed no reluctance to get his fingernails dirty.
Over the last four years, he won some battles and lost some. The 1989 law that overhauled the way the Government regulates the savings and loan industry was in large part his doing. He persuaded his superiors in the Bush Administration to propose far-reaching changes and won support for them in Congress.
On the other hand, his attempt to rewrite the banking laws and rid them of restraints that were first adopted in the 1930's ended up in Congress's scrap heap last year. President Bush proclaimed it his top legislative priority. But to Mr. Glauber's disappointment, the President never really threw his weight behind the measure, and absent that, such controversial legislation never stood a chance.
 
Complexity and Simplicity
 At Harvard, he was used to tackling arcane issues. "In the academic world," he said, "the longer and more complicated the logical chain, the more people like it."
But in Washington, he said, he quickly realized that he could not get others to sit still for such arguments. "People down here are so busy they don't have a tolerance for great complexity," he said. "So you have got to find a simple melody. People can't hum complicated tunes. It's got to be simple enough that they can remember it."
He used that maxim when he was trying to sell Congress on changing the standards governing savings and loan associations. Some of the industry's lobbyists had persuaded friendly lawmakers that changing rules after deals had been made was unfair.
Mr. Glauber recalls that he carried the day with an analogy. If a new model of airplane crashed the first two times it flew, Mr. Glauber told the lawmakers, Federal aviation authorities would surely ground the plane even if its airworthiness had once been certified.
Another Washington idiosyncrasy he said he had not comprehended in his academic days is that top officials here are not expected to read or write. They get their information mostly through oral briefings. And they have large staffs to write their speeches, letters and other materials.
"I was used to writing everything that had my name on it," he said. "Here I got to write nothing I supposedly wrote. Here when you said you wanted to write something, people looked at you as if you were crazy. That's what you have a big staff for."
 
Time With the Family
 Someday, he said, he might enjoy being in the Government again. But not soon. He and his wife, Muffy, have a 7-year-old son and a 4-year-old daughter, and he intends to spend much more time with them.
"It isn't simply that you work longer down here," he said, "it's that you have no control over when you work. Problems arise, and you have to respond to them. But you do work harder. I came to the office at 7:15 or 7:30 in the morning, and I got home at 8 or 8:30 at night. You don't do that at Harvard."
Mr. Glauber was away from Cambridge so long he had to relinquish his tenure at the Business School. But he is going back to Harvard nonetheless, to lecture at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and to resume a lucrative side career as consultant, mostly to money center banks.
No announcement has been made about his replacement. Most likely, it will be someone already in the Government, possibly one of his top assistants -- Jerome H. Powell, Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance, or Sidney L. Jones, Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy.
As for Mr. Glauber, unlike many when they leave the Government, he has no intention of lobbying. But he does not mean to waste what he learned here. So if anybody needs a consultant with almost four years of experience at the very top of the Treasury . . .

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS BEGIN HEALTH OFFENSIVE

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 14

 BODY:
House Democrats held meetings with their constituents at 285 sites around the country today to publicize their proposals for sweeping changes in medical insurance and to underscore what they describe as a slow response from President Bush.
The events highlighted the emergence of health care as a potent Presidential campaign issue, one that Democrats say they are well-positioned to exploit. In his State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, Mr. Bush is expected to propose new tax incentives to extend private health insurance. But Democratic strategists contend voters will not be satisfied until the Government controls escalating medical costs and expands coverage to the unemployed and all women and children. 
 "We need to hear from you," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said at a town meeting in St. Louis. "We've got to look for solutions. We have to figure it out together." In response, people complained that the quality of the medical care they received was poor, that drug companies engaged in price-gouging and that they feared they could lose their health insurance if they change their jobs.
Several in the audience called for a national health plan similiar to those offered in Canada and Western Europe, but just as many warned that a government plan would bring exorbitant taxes and inefficiency.
Those at the meetings around the country were shown a videotape prepared by the House Democratic leadership that depicted a crisis in which 33 million people are without health insurance, small companies are forced to drop coverage or go out of business, and women are needlessly giving birth to deformed children because they cannot afford prenatal care.
 
Significant Missouri Meeting
 "We're the only industrialized nation in the world except South Africa that doesn't guarantee its citizens affordable health-care coverage," says the narrator of the tape. "And yet we spend more per person on health care than any other country." Complete with images of an American flag, an unemployment line, and an empty hospital bed, the tape had the appearance of a slick campaign commercial.
The town meeting presided over by Mr. Gephardt at Charles Lindbergh High School was seen as particularly significant. Mr. Gephardt has been trying to find a consensus among Democratic legislators backing three alternative methods of approaching the health-care issue. Mr. Gephardt's staff workers said he was eager to gauge the public reactions to each plan.
One proposal would provide Medicare benefits to all Americans. It would cover preventive care like standard physical examinations and limit the out-of-pocket expenses of families to $3,000 for an illness.
A second plan, backed by the Senate Democratic leadership and known as "pay or play," would require employers to become the primary providers of medical insurance, either by providing policies to their employees or by paying an extra tax to finance a supplementary public insurance program.
A third proposal would establish a national health insurance plan similar to Canada's. It would replace all private and public health insurance coverage with a nationalized program. But Senate and White House opposition significantly lowers the chances that such a proposal would be approved soon.
When Mr. Gephardt summed up the three plans, only the national health insurance plan was received with hearty applause by the more than 300 people who overflowed the high school auditorium.
"The applause meter is on," he said.
But other people jeered or laughed when Mr. Gephardt suggested that Government could efficiently administer health-care programs.
Ava O'Reilly, a middle-age woman from Fulton, Mo., stood up and asked the Congressman, "When is Congress going to get off its duff and pass a national health-care plan?"
"I don't know if there is a consensus on that," Mr. Gephardt answered. "But a lot of people think we need change."
At a news conference, Representative Vic Fazio, the California Democrat who helped organize the events, said their purpose was to determine what the people want and to pressure the President to support a comprehensive overhaul of health care. He said he doubted that Mr. Bush would sign any of the more sweeping proposals among the more than 30 health-care bills now before Congress, but he added that political expediency may force Mr. Bush to endorse one of the Democratic plans before Election Day.
Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, held his second town meeting today at Saint Joseph Hospital in Towson, north of Baltimore.
"We know we have a national problem. We know we have to do something about it," he told the packed lecture room.
Representative Cardin proposes a plan offering providing affordable health care to all Americans by building on existing insurance and health-care programs. He says his plan can be introduced without major tax increases by limiting the growth of health- care spendingexpenditures and and through malpractice reform.
Today's town meetings ended more than a week of public consultations among the 268 Democratic House members and their constituents. Several lawmakers said the meetings had demonstrated that constituents around the country supported divergent health plans, making Mr. Gephardt's attempt to find a consensus solution all the more difficult.
"The more you delve into the issue the more complicated it gets," said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against Mark On Strike Fears in Germany

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained yesterday against most leading currencies, especially the German mark, which has been depressed amid concerns about labor strife and a weak economy.
Currency traders said the dollar rose against the mark in heavy trading following reports of strained talks between the Bundesbank and a German metalworkers' union. Also hurting the mark was the prospect of a walkout by German bank employees, perhaps as early as tomorrow. 
 "That probably fueled some of the negative speculation against the mark," said Curtis Perkins, currency trader for the Chemical Banking Corporation.
The dollar was quoted at 1.5930 German marks in late New York trading, up from 1.5765 late Monday. In London, the dollar closed at 1.5905 German marks, up from 1.5720 late Monday.
Another factor behind the dollar's strength is that the Bush Administration and members of Congress are proposing a range of tax cuts, including investment tax cuts and tax credits for health insurance, all intended to put cash in consumers' pockets and stimulate the economy.
Andrew Hodge, vice president for Bank Brussels Lambert in New York, said such incentives would be positive for the dollar. "It not only creates expectations of stronger economic growth but also acts as a substitute for lower interest rates," he said.
He said the dollar followed in step with other markets after the release of a dismal retail sales report, which led investors to conclude the Government would take more action to stimulate the economy. The Commerce Department said retail sales in December totaled a seasonally adjusted $151.2 billion, down from $151.7 billion in November.
The British pound rose in London, to $1.8150, from $1.8030 late Monday. At closing in New York, the pound was worth $1.7840, down from $1.7990 late Monday.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.25 yen to finish at 126.05 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 126.35 yen. At closing in New York, the dollar was at 126.85 yen, down from 127.00 Monday.
Mr. Hodge said the dollar's slight fall was merely a technical correction following the yen's steep fall on Monday because of a continuing political scandal.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.4125 Swiss francs, up from 1.4040; 5.4330 French francs, up from 5.3790; 1,201 Italian lire, up from 1,190.25, and 1.15025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14925.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery was quoted at $354.60 an ounce, up 80 cents from Monday. A late bid from the Republic National Bank quoted gold up 85 cents an ounce to settle at $354.60.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Decline Once More

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the fourth straight session on heavy trading, despite further evidence that the economy remains weak.
Reports that retail sales fell for the third straight month in December and that auto sales for the first 10 days of January remained at low levels did not impress traders. 
 Analysts said a more immediate concern to dealers was the substantial amounts of corporate debt securities that remain in inventory.
To hedge the risk to their unsold corporate portfolios, "dealers appear to be selling Treasuries with similar durations to the corporate bonds they are underwriting," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research on the foreign-exchange and fixed-income markets.
 
Leftover Positions
 "Given the volume of new debt that has been priced recently," an investment banker said, "there are some pretty good positions that are still left over."
New corporate debt securities worth roughly $1.25 billion were priced yesterday, following $1.2 billion on Monday. Last week, corporate securities worth more than $13 billion were priced.
Mr. Stone and others said prices of Treasury securities could be expected to rise once the corporate bonds were distributed.
"As guys get lifted out of the corporate paper, they will buy back their hedge," a Government securities trader said. "What is going on now won't last forever."
Despite the recent rise in intermediate and long-term interest rates, Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities, said he remained optimistic. "What we are seeing is a correction," he said. "There is still room for a further fall in interest rates. This isn't the end of the recent bull market."
The selloff in the Treasury securities market continued to be concentrated among intermediate and long-term issues. Prices of short-term notes and bills were little changed.
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10514/32 , down 15/32 , to yield 7.53 percent, compared with 7.50 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 3/8, down 17/32 , to yield 7.01 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 97 7/8, down 17/32 , to yield 6.76 percent.
Over the course of the last week, yields on 7- and 10-year notes have risen by more than a quarter of a percentage point.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.80 percent late yesterday, down a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. But six-month bill rates rose by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 3.86 percent.
Among the companies pricing new debt securities was the Gulf State Utilities Company, which offered a total of $300 million worth of 30-year first mortgage bonds and 10-year notes through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 8.94 percent first mortgage bonds, worth $150 million, were priced at $100, or par, 1.40 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing. Gulf State's 8.21 percent 10-year notes were also priced at $100, 1.18 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes.
The securities are nonrefundable. The issue is rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB-by Standard & Poor's.
 
Morgan Stanley's Offering
 Meanwhile, the Morgan Stanley Group offered a total of $400 million worth of five-year and 15-year securities through underwriters led by its principal subsidiary, Morgan Stanley & Company.
The $300 million worth of 7.32 percent five-year notes was priced at $100, or par, one percentage point over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 1/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $100 million worth of 8.33 percent 15-year notes was also priced at $100, 1.30 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are noncallable for life. They are rated A-1 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was highlighted by the negotiated sale of $653 million of serial and term bonds for the California Department of Water Resources. Yields on the serial bonds range from 2.70 percent on securities maturing in 1992 to a maximum yield of 6.10 percent on bonds maturing in 2006. Yields on term bonds range from 6.32 percent on securities maturing in 2010 to a maximum yield of 6.37 percent on bonds maturing in 2020.

HEADLINE: Magic Johnson Urges Bush to Lead AIDS Battle

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Magic Johnson, the newest member of the National Commission on AIDS, met privately today with President Bush and said afterward that the President needed to exercise greater personal leadership in the battle against the disease.
"If he speaks out and says that it's out here and he cares and he cares about our nation in terms of this epidemic and then people will listen, whether it'll be old, young, black, white," said Mr. Johnson, who recently disclosed that he had tested positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. 
 Mr. Johnson told reporters shortly after a 25-minute meeting in the Oval Office, "I am going to try to do my part, but I think that the higher source -- and that's the President -- can have a better effect than I can."
Mr. Bush later said Mr. Johnson "had some good, constructive suggestions," but he did not elaborate. Mr. Johnson said he would return to the White House in about a month to offer detailed recommendations on the role the White House should play in educating the public about the disease.
Asked later whether Mr. Johnson had been critical of his AIDS policies in their meeting, the President responded: "If he was, well, he didn't tell me that." Mr. Bush interrupted a day of political fence-mending and Federal budget deliberations to meet with Mr. Johnson, the former basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers.
 
Budget Plan Largely in Place
 Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Bush had largely nailed down the framework of his proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, and had also decided on a proposal to revise the national health care benefits system. Both are to be announced when the President delivers his State of the Union Message to Congress on Jan. 28, he said.
Mr. Fitzwater also said that the White House had "fairly well" decided on a package of economic measures to rouse the nation from recession and that it would also be disclosed in the President's address.
The President may touch on some proposals on Wednesday in New Hampshire, where he will make the first overtly political trip of his still-unannounced 1992 campaign.
Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush would focus on his plans for economic recovery, including the need for changes in the Federal tax code.
The President is also expected to speak out once more on the economic benefits of free trade and the growth of American exports, messages he stressed during a 12-day tour of the western Pacific that ended last week.
Those messages are especially important to Mr. Bush in New Hampshire, where he faces potentially strong opposition in the primary from a Republican, Patrick J. Buchanan, who has sounded an "America first" theme that has proved attractive to some in the state's economically depressed population.
 
More Money Is Possible
 Before his meeting with Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bush said today that researchers had told him that the Government has provided a "good level" of funding for research into the prevention and cure of AIDS, but that he was ready to provide more if asked.
Although Mr. Johnson said at a news conference today that Mr. Bush "needs to do a lot" about AIDS that has not yet been done, he did not directly criticize Mr. Bush's performance on the issue. Rather, he said, both he and the President agreed that "he is going to do his homework, I am going to do mine," and that the two would meet again in a month to discuss how the public could be better informed about AIDS.
Mr. Johnson also chastised the national press for failing to explain the rapid spread of the AIDS epidemic adequately and how individuals could keep from contracting H.I.V.
"The young people, we haven't done a good job educating them. And that's where you people of the press have to come in," he told reporters. "You have to help with this fight because if we don't educate, first, society, which is the grown-ups, then the kids won't be educated. Because the parents are the key to this."

HEADLINE: China's Premier Plans Visit to United Nations

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Prime Minister Li Peng is scheduled to visit the United Nations in New York at the end of this month, Western diplomats and the official New China News Agency said today. The visit will mark the first time a top Chinese leader has been in the United States since the military crackdown against the Chinese democracy movement in 1989.
Mr. Li's one-day visit, to take part in a summit meeting of the 15 members of the Security Council, will coincide with a five-nation European trip that is seen as a sign that China is slowly restoring normal relations with much of Europe. 
 The New York meeting, which is a United Nations conference and does not involve an invitation from President Bush, will give Mr. Li an opportunity to sit down with the leaders of Western countries that for the last two-and-a-half years treated China as something of a pariah for using tanks and machine guns to crush the Tiananmen democracy movement in 1989.
China's Foreign Ministry refused to confirm Mr. Li's visit to either Europe or New York, but the New China News Agency said in a report from the United Nations that Mr. Li would attend the summit meeting on Jan. 31. Western diplomats said plans were now firm for Mr. Li to visit Italy, Switzerland, Malta, Portugal and Spain as well.
The trip is seen as a personal triumph for Mr. Li, a hard-liner who played a central role in the 1989 crackdown and who remains widely disliked at home. After the crackdown, some Chinese leaders were reported to want to move Mr. Li to another position partly because of the difficulty in finding foreign dignitaries who would be willing to shake his hand.
"For Li Peng, I think it's very important, that after all the speculation that he would have to go as a scapegoat for June 1989, then here he is sitting at the top table with world leaders," said a Western diplomat in Beijing. "For Li Peng's domestic political position, that's very good stuff."
This will be the first time that any top Chinese leader directly associated with the 1989 crackdown has traveled to a Western country since those events. Until now, Mr. Li and the Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin, have been restricted to visits to developing countries and the ever diminishing pool of Communist nations.
Japan, which has moved more rapidly than any other industrialized country to resume links with China, announced this month that Mr. Jiang would visit Tokyo in the first half of this year.
While Europe and Japan are rebuilding links with China, relations with the United States are strained and may worsen. Washington is prepared to establish retaliatory tariffs against Chinese exports unless a trade dispute is resolved by a Thursday deadline, and the result could be a small trade war.
There has been no outcry in Europe about Mr. Li's impending visit, but his hosts in several capitals are expected to raise human rights issues and the hospitality at times is likely to be more proper than friendly.
Mr. Li's trip is scheduled to begin with an official visit Jan. 27 and 28 to Italy, followed by a trip to Switzerland on Jan. 29 and 30. Chris Meuwly, a spokesman for the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs in Bern, said Mr. Li would meet with Rene Felber, the Swiss President and Foreign Minister, before going to Davos to attend a meeting of the World Economic Forum.
"For us it is considered a private visit to Switzerland, at the invitation of the private organizer of this symposium, and also an opportunity for private talks," Mr. Meuwly said in a telephone interview. He added that human rights issues would be raised, and that Switzerland was unlikely to lift its ban on arms sales to China.
From Switzerland, Mr. Li is expected to fly to New York for the Security Council summit meeting on Jan. 31. Then he is tentatively planning to fly back to Europe to spend Feb. 1 in Malta, and to fly to Portugal on Feb. 2. Diplomats said the main topic in Lisbon would be the Portuguese enclave of Macao, which is scheduled to be returned to China in 1999.
On Feb. 4 Mr. Li is scheduled to fly to Spain, and two days later he is due to return to Beijing.

HEADLINE: U.S.-North Korea Talks Planned On State of Nuclear Development

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The Bush Administration, concerned about North Korea's nuclear program but encouraged by Pyongyang's recent assertions that it would agree to international inspections and safeguards, is planning the first high-level official meeting to discuss the issue with North Koreans, the State Department indicated today.
The approach to North Korea comes at a time when American experts on nuclear proliferation are voicing doubts about Pyongyang's intentions in signing arms control agreements with South Korea, including a pledge of a nuclear-free peninsula. They are also skeptical of assurances by Kim Il Sung, an increasingly isolated leader in a vanishing Communist world, that he will open all nuclear plants to international inspection, nearly seven years after signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 It is widely believed that North Korea would be able to produce a bomb within the next year, and may be preparing to test a nuclear device in a matter of months. Several experts testifying today before the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, questioned whether the overstretched, underfinanced International Atomic Energy Agency could be counted on to detect a weapons program in one of the world's most secretive countries.
William A. Higinbotham, a consultant on nuclear materials management and former executive of the Federation of American Scientists, told the subcommittee that North Korea had at least one new 30-megawat nuclear reactor that could produce 30 grams of weapons-grade plutonium every day. The new reactor, unlike an older Soviet one, is not safeguarded by international agreement, he said. But he added that just signing the nonproliferation agreement should not be confused with putting it into effect.
 
Jan. 22 Talks Indicated
 "All the recent publicity about the ease with which Iraq was able to develop a nuclear weapon secretly could well have emboldened the North Koreans to believe that they can sign on the international proliferation safeguards and still proliferate," said Senator Alan Cranston, the hearing chairman.
Newspapers in Seoul, the South Korean capital, reported this morning that a meeting between United States and North Korean officials would occur in New York on Jan. 22. Quoting Korean and American officials, the papers said that the American Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Arnold Kanter, would meet Kim Yong Sun, director of international relations for North Korea's ruling party.
At a briefing for reporters later in the day, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, would say only that an announcement on talks was "very, very near." Until now, contacts between Washington and Pyongyang have been made at lower levels in Beijing between diplomats from the two nations.
President Bush said in Seoul last week that relations with North Korea could improve if Pyongyang committed itself to resolving outstanding nuclear issues.
 
Bases Called Nuclear Free
 Supporting efforts by North and South Korea to resolve differences and move closer to unity, the United States has agreed to an unusual public statement that all bases in South Korea are nuclear free and that they could be open to inspection. The United States traditionally does not confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons or nuclear material. President Bush also said the joint American-South Korean military exercises known as Team Spirit would be halted if progress is made on nuclear control.
Leonard Spector of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said in an interview Monday that "the concessions we made there we never made anywhere else."
If North Korea in return is willing to halt its plutonium reprocessing, and does not move some of its nuclear installations to secret sites, it will merely be stopping the clock, not setting it back, experts say.
"The North can freeze its plutonium program and claim it got something of value in return -- high-level dialogue with the United States and economic assistance from Japan," Mr. Spector said. "Kim Il Sung could decide the optimum outlook is to grab benefits while freezing the nuclear program. It can always be unfrozen later."

HEADLINE: Little Oversight for Big Tax Breaks, Albany Panel Is Told

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 14

 BODY:
New York State and its local governments grant as much as $500 million a year in tax breaks to businesses with strikingly little oversight to insure that such actions create jobs, the Republican State Comptroller and a Democratic State Senator charged today.
Their comments came at a hearing on the state's approximately 150 industrial development agencies, which under state law are granted broad authority to issue tax-free bonds and forgive state and local taxes to attract development. 
 While many of the projects these agencies finance may be beneficial to the communities involved, there are many others for which there is scant evidence that the taxpayer money helped either to create jobs or to attract or retain businesses that would not have come to the area otherwise, Comptroller Edward V. Regan, Senator Franz S. Leichter of Manhattan and several other witnesses said.
 
A Restaurant Relocation
 Among the questionable development agency-financed projects cited today was the relocation of an Italian restaurant from one Schenectady neighborhood to another and the construction of several large chain-owned supermarkets that, critics said, simply forced smaller local businesses to close and resulted in no net increase in jobs.
The agencies, which can be established with state lawmakers' approval in any community or county in the state, have been around for more than 20 years. But in a year in which New York's budget problems have led lawmakers to make unprecedented cuts, the system is expected to come under especially close scrutiny this year.
"This may turn out to be the biggest trough in the state, with hundreds of hogs feeding," said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.
 
A Raceway Project
 One industrial development agency in Hempstead, L.I., was criticized in a report on Monday by the State Commission of Investigation for the way in which it put together $52 million in public financing to help a group of private investors buy Roosevelt Raceway in 1984.
The investors had said they wanted to continue operating the track, but they eventually shut it down, and the commission said the Hempstead agency had been "remiss in its obligation" to investigate the raceway project before it granted the funds.
Although it found no criminal activity, the commission recommended a thorough state review of the industrial development agency system. The hearing today, held by the Assembly and Senate committees on local government, focused on that topic but was scheduled well before the commission report was released.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Fills 2 Top Administration Posts

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins has chosen Emily Lloyd, the chief business strategist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a longtime transportation and environmental expert, to be New York City's sanitation commissioner, making her the first woman to hold the post.
The Mayor has also filled another vacancy in his administration, naming Herman L. Jenkins, 51 years old, a former college administrator and civil rights worker, to be the city's personnel commissioner, in charge of hiring, job testing and affirmative action policies. Both appointments are to be announced at City Hall today. 
 At the Sanitation Department, Ms. Lloyd, 46, will immediately face a number of problems in the city's giant garbage disposal system, from how to bolster floundering recycling efforts to how to shepherd politically charged plans for building perhaps three new garbage-burning incinerators. Ms. Lloyd, a former Boston city transportation commissioner, will succeed Steven M. Polan, who has resigned.
"She has a terrific sense of humor and she's a very good manager," said Anthony E. Shorris, deputy executive director of the Port Authority, where Ms. Lloyd has led reviews of new business activities for the bi-state agency since 1988, overseeing market research, strategic planning and economic analysis. She also studied regional recycling programs.
From 1984 to 1988, Ms. Lloyd was general manager of the Port Authority's aviation customer and public services division, developing noise-abatement programs for the three local airports. Before that she was a consultant, working on transportation projects in cities around the country.
 
Led State King Commission
 Mr. Jenkins, a former organizer and staff member for the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference in the 1960's, helped organize tenants' unions in Chicago and Cleveland.
From 1978 to 1985, he was an official at Queens College, eventually serving as vice president for external affairs, overseeing a major capital campaign and alumni fund-raising efforts. He later worked as an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service, and in 1989 and 1990 was executive director of the New York State Martin Luther King Commission, recommending state policies to further the philosophies of Dr. King.
Since 1990, he has been technical operations director of the Districting Commission, overseeing the computer experts and demographers who drew new lines to expand the City Council to 51 seats. He will succeed Douglas H. White, who has resigned.
Mr. Jenkins said the city's fiscal problems meant he would have to "approach personnel functions with a good deal of prudence."
Ms. Lloyd and Mr. Jenkins will each be paid $110,000 a year. Ms. Lloyd could not be reached for comment last night.

HEADLINE: Florio Urges a New Fund for Economic Recovery

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
In a speech that focused largely on New Jersey's economic recovery and the plight of the middle class, Gov. Jim Florio asked the Legislature today to back a series of plans to create more than 100,000 new jobs and to make it easier for middle-income residents to buy homes and to send their children to college.
"People need help, and they need hope," Mr. Florio said in his annual State of the State message. "Not next year. Not somewhere down the road. They need it now."
 
7 Points by Florio
 He outlined these seven major initiatives that he said his administration would pursue during the remaining two years of his term: 
 *The creation of the New Jersey Economic Recovery Fund, which would spur job growth by investing $200 million in public and private economic development projects.
*The elimination of restrictions on the state Transportation Trust Fund, which would free hundreds of millions of dollars for transportation construction projects.
*The creation of a New Skills Partnership, involving business, labor and higher education, to train 100,000 workers.
*The expansion of the $250 million first-time home-buyers' program, and the development of a home-buyers' tax-credit program, to help the middle class.
*The revision of the health care system to protect people who lack insurance, reduce costs and insure a greater focus on prevention.
*The expansion of the state's college assistance program for low- and moderate-income families.
*The adoption of legislation that would protect the New Jersey shore from overdevelopment.
 
Term Limits on Agenda
 The Governor also supported a constitutional amendment to allow initiative and referendum, or a binding public vote on certain issues. And he urged the Legislature to consider term limits.
Mr. Florio, a Democrat, delivered his second annual message in the Assembly chambers before a joint session of the Legislature, which two hours earlier had passed from Democratic to Republican control.
In the Republican response to the Governor's speech, Assemblyman Robert D. Franks, chairman of the state Republican Committee, accused Mr. Florio of trying to shift the blame for much of New Jersey's economic troubles.
"Over the last several weeks, Governor Florio has suggested that New Jersey's economy and its people are largely helpless victims of some mysterious outside forces the Governor could neither foresee nor control," Mr. Franks said. "You and I know that New Jersey's dramatic economic decline over the past two years was not a random event, but the predictable, unavoidable product of flawed policies and a government out of touch with the people."
The Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, was less combative in his reaction. He said he agreed with Mr. Florio's goal of "getting New Jersey back on a sound economic course and getting people back to work," but added: "I have no doubt we will occasionally differ on ways to achieve these ends. I, for one, was disappointed that the Governor did not endorse our call for a rollback of the sales tax."
The Republicans, who campaigned against Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, have said they will roll the sales tax back to 6 percent from 7 percent by July 1.
"Lowering taxes is the best way I know to jump-start the economy," Mr. Haytaian said. "It will be the cornerstone of our economic revitalization program."
The centerpiece of Mr. Florio's speech and his economic revitalization plan was the New Jersey Economic Recovery Fund, which would help finance such projects as the expansion of the Atlantic City Airport and construction of a performing arts center in Newark.
"The fund will allow us to invest in public-service economic growth projects all over the state," he said. "Even more important, our $200 million Economic Recovery Fund will leverage $800 million in private investments."
 
Selling Twin Towers Share
 The Governor said the fund would be financed with money received from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's purchase of New Jersey's interest in the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. The first payment is due by March, and Mr. Florio said he would like to have the fund established by then. Mr. Florio said the fund would create 20,000 new jobs in construction and 75,000 permanent jobs in fields from manufacturing to the arts.
Removing the restrictions from the Transportation Trust Fund would create 13,000 more jobs, he said. The five-year trust fund is supported by gasoline taxes, but there is a $365 million annual limit on how much the state can spend, and surplus funds go into a reserve.
At Mr. Florio's urging two years ago, the Legislature lifted the fund limit, providing $565 million a year for transportation projects. Without further legislative action, the limit will revert to $365 million on July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year, and Mr. Florio said the state would be unable to finance about $200 million in projects.

HEADLINE: All Is Scarce in Trenton Except Republicans

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
A jubilant Republican majority took control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature today, bent on undoing much of what Gov. Jim Florio and the Democrats accomplished over the last two years, including cutting at least part of their $2.8-billion tax increase. But behind the Republican euphoria lies a sobering fiscal reality: The new Legislature will probably have to find about $2 billion in new money just to keep the budget at this year's level, and the problem could get much worse.
The bleak fiscal outlook emerges from three factors: The economy is stagnant or declining, and the prospects for an upturn are bleak; politically, the Republicans are locked into a tax cut of at least $590 million, and $550 million in "one-shot" revenues that were in this year's budget won't be available again next year. 
 Moreover, one Democratic fiscal expert, Laurence S. Weiss, who led the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee before being defeated in the Republican sweep, predicts that even this year's revenues will fall $700 million short of meeting the $14.7 billion budget.
If that shortfall comes to pass, it will mean that the Florio administration will have to make $700 million in spending cuts, which will not leave much for the Republicans to cut in meeting the budget next year.
 
Counting on Washington
 But the new Republican Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, said in an interview that he was counting on an upswing in the economy to bail the Republicans out. His optimism, he said, is based mainly on the belief that Washington will continue to prime the economic pump with initiatives like the recent 1 percentage point cut in the discount rate.
"We're talking about a budget that starts July 1 of 1992 and runs to June 30, 1993," Mr. Haytaian said. "I truly think we will have pump-priming by the Fed. I also believe we can cut the size of government."
Perhaps. But Governor Florio has already cut 5,000 state jobs, reducing the total to 65,000, and further cuts will be difficult.
Besides, administration budget makers also counted on an upswing this year, and that has not come, nor does it look as if it is going to any time soon. The state's unemployment rate reached 7.4 percent last month, the highest level since September 1983, when it was a little over 8 percent.
And Mr. Haytaian was considerably more somber in tone in his inaugural "State of the Assembly" address today, even going so far as to quote a Depression-era Republican Speaker who was sworn into office nearly six decades ago with a similar assault on "oppressive taxation."
 
G.O.P. Sales-Tax Cut Vowed
 Republicans, Mr. Haytaian has repeatedly vowed, will "absolutely" cut the sales tax by 1 percentage point, at a cost of $590 million. In his address today he also said the new majority would give tax credits to industry to spur research and development and would cut the capital gains tax to induce investment. Both programs would also cut revenues.
And he acknowledged in an interview that tax cuts would certainly mean a no-growth budget and very probably one that is smaller than the present $14.7 million. "We're going to have to do it," he said. "I don't see any alternative."
In addition to "downsizing" government, he said, the Republican majority will look at making some state functions private, like running jails and possibly automobile inspections. "Everything will be on the table," he said.
And he said that despite the ominous fiscal picture, the Republicans might even cut other taxes.
"I want to make something crystal clear," he said. "As far as I'm concerned the rollback of the sales tax is only a first step. During this term, we will look at many other ways to ease the tax burden."
 
Few Details of Repeal
 But while fiscal troubles are likely to dominate the agenda, Republicans also say they are going to attack and radically alter or repeal much of the legislative package Governor Florio and the Democrats pushed though the Legislature in the first half-year of his administration in 1990 -- the Quality Education Act, automobile insurance reform and the assault weapons ban, among other things.
Mr. Haytaian and other Republicans have been short on details of just how they will undertake these changes or repeals. The Quality Education Act, for example, was initially to have funneled some $1.1 billion in new aid to low- and moderate-income school districts, but revisions cut that figure to about $800 million, and caps on how much the schools could actually spend further reduced the total.
But the Republicans say they want to revise the distribution formula and also reconsider the caps. Just what such a revision would mean to individual districts is not clear, and is also clouded by the courts, which mandated additional state aid for poor urban districts in the first place.
 
Insurance Imponderables
 Until the new Republican majority unveils the specifics it has in mind, the same imponderables remain over such matters as Governor Florio's overhauling of the state's insurance system. It eliminated surcharges for many drivers but saddled others with added costs for bad driving records and kicked up a huge protest among the insurance companies, several of which announced that they were pulling out of the state altogether.
And while it is clear that the Republicans will push legislation that would at least water down the Governor's strong ban on assault weapons, it remains to be seen whether they will push for an outright repeal, or simply a bill that would ban certain weapons but allow those who already have them to keep them.

HEADLINE: P.L.O. Ties to Lebanon Are Formally Renewed

BYLINE: By IHSAN A. HIJAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The Palestine Liberation Organization is re-establishing formal links with the Lebanese Government, and has sent a representative to Beirut to reopen the organization's office, which has been closed since Israel invaded the country in 1982.
The P.L.O. representative, Chafik al-Hout, met with President Elias Hrawi on Monday, and said he delivered a message from Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman. The contents were not made public, but the P.L.O. representative said it stressed the need for Palestinian-Lebanese coordination at the Middle East peace talks. Both the Palestinians and Lebanon are taking part in face-to-face negotiations with the Israelis in Washington this week. 
 The P.L.O. official, who was elected to the organization's 18-member executive committee last September, returned here a week ago, apparently to take up his old post as chief of the organization's Beirut headquarters. The P.L.O. office here was closed after Mr. Arafat and his top aides were forced to leave Lebanon along with 12,000 Palestinian fighters after Israeli forces invaded Lebanon in 1982.
 
Low Profile Expected
 The P.L.O. is expected to keep a low profile in Lebanon since the defeat of its guerrillas in southern Lebanon at the hands of the Lebanese Army last July. P.L.O. officials have said the organization has dismantled its military machine in southern Lebanon, leaving refugee camps to be defended by lightly armed militiamen.
Lebanon's Defense Minister, Michel al-Murr, has announced that the authorities will soon collect light weapons from all residents, Lebanese and Palestinian alike.
"Now that it was has gained the upper hand over the P.L.O., the Lebanese Government can afford to be magnanimous about the Palestinians in Lebanon," said a Lebanese Government official who asked not to be identified.
 
Office to Help Palestinians
 P.L.O. officials said a reactivated office in Beirut will primarily try to help improve the living conditions of Palestinians in Lebanon. The Lebanese Government has yet to act on a P.L.O. memorandum demanding civil rights for Palestinian residents. The memorandum asked for easing of requirements for residence and work permits for thousands of Palestinians, many of whom are now facing economic hardship.
With the P.L.O.'s own financial resources dwindling, the organization's ability to assist needy families has dropped sharply, according to Palestinian officials. Oil-producing Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have discontinued subsidies to the P.L.O. because of the organization's support for Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.
Palestinian officials say they hope the Beirut office here will eventually be turned into an embassy, as P.L.O. offices are in other Arab states. P.L.O. bureaus in Arab capitals have been recognized as diplomatic missions for the Palestinian state that Mr. Arafat proclaimed two years ago.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: DEMOCRATS;
Clinton Seizes on Asia Trip To Depict Bush as Beatable

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who was helped by encouraging early polls in New Hampshire and a spate of good press notices, is seizing on President Bush's flawed Japan foreign trade mission as evidence that the Republicans are beatable this year and that he is the one to do it.
In recent days, the Presidential contender has begun attacking the Bush Administration with new vigor, casting himself as the change-oriented candidate and -- as the chief beneficiary of the early political handicapping -- sparing little attention for his Democratic opponents. 
 Although the voters who came here to see Mr. Clinton seemed more curious than committed for the moment, many seemed receptive to the notion he is promoting that electability should be the deciding factor in choosing a Democratic nominee.
And the President's trip to Japan gave Mr. Clinton a handy club with which to drive his point home.
 
Trip as 'an Embarrassment'
 "The President goes to Japan with the heads of our auto companies -- the evidence of our own failures -- to complain to them that Americans are buying Japanese cars instead of American cars," Mr. Clinton said. "The message seems to be: 'Please don't send these cars over here anymore; our people just can't help themselves.' "
The entire trip was "an embarrassment," the Governor said. "It was an opportunity lost."
Mr. Clinton draws appreciative laughter and applause when he makes these digs at Mr. Bush to the highly partisan audiences he addresses in New Hampshire, which will hold the nation's first Presidential primary next month. Many of those who come to hear him speak say they have been attracted by his television advertising and the assiduous advance work of his New Hampshire staff, which blankets targeted voters with mailings and leaflets.
There is little doubt that New Hampshire voters, sobered by a strained economy and unmoved by a campaign that was slow to start, have begun paying attention now that political commercials for Mr. Clinton, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts are being aired with regularity.
Staff members for Mr. Clinton, who broadcasts the telephone number of his Manchester headquarters in his advertising so voters can call for copies of his economic plan, said they had received 1,300 phone calls from interested viewers on the first two days the commercial was broadcast.
 
Issue of Electability
 There is little doubt that electability has become a deciding factor for many Democrats in New Hampshire and beyond.
"Basically, I want a winner," said Alan Lambert, a rare-books dealer from Hancock who came to see Mr. Clinton open his Keene headquarters on Sunday. Mr. Lambert said he supported Bruce Babbitt, the former Governor of Arizona in 1988.
But even those who are impressed enough with what they have heard about Mr. Clinton to attend his campaign events say they are not ready to commit themselves yet.
"I'm not terribly impressed," said Rick Levine, who runs a stereo business and lost a race for New Hampshire state representative last month. "From Day 1 they said Tsongas is unelectable, that we cannot even discuss another Greek liberal from the Northeast."
After hearing Mr. Clinton in Keene, Mr. Levine said the Governor did not seem serious enough to warrant all the favorable attention he had received. "I'm really aggravated that they're all treating him as though this is the de facto candidate and that after New Hampshire all of the other guys will fall by the wayside," he said "The media is spoon-feeding us a candidate."
The legendary political contrariness of New Hampshire voters is not the only potential problem awaiting Mr. Clinton. In a state where state-imposed taxes are considered anathema, he has stumbled on occasion when he begins talking about how to pay for improved education.
Arkansas uses state taxes to support local education, while New Hampshire relies on local property taxes. In his speeches, Mr. Clinton stops just short of criticizing New Hampshire's economic policies, but he points out the inequities he sees in a financing formula that allows people who live in more affluent areas to afford better schools.
Mr. Clinton's standing as the candidate to beat has been enhanced in recent days by attacks from his Democratic competitors. Mr. Kerrey, for example, has harshly criticized the Governor for offering only the broad-brush outlines of a health-care plan.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales, Weak in '91, Keep Falling

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks remained at recessionary levels in early January, declining 4.1 percent from a dismal period a year earlier, the auto makers reported today.
The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for the period was 5.3 million -- among the lowest figures reported in 1991 -- reinforcing a bleak outlook for the industry. 
 "It's hard to see anything positive in these numbers," said Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. He said sales to commercial fleets overstated the sales reports, suggesting even weaker retail demand. Reflecting the sluggish market, the Ford Motor Company added $1,500 cash rebates on Lincolns; it extended sales incentives for some other models.
In the Jan. 1-10 period, auto makers with North American assembly plants -- which are considered domestic plants -- sold a total of 171,944 cars and light trucks. Car sales dropped sharply in the period, to 99,227, a decline of 10.8 percent from last year's early-January sales. The periods had eight selling days both this year and last.
Truck sales in the latest period rose 6.7 percent, however, to 72,717. The gain surprised some analysts, who had wondered whether big sales incentives on trucks in December might have raised sales then at the expense of 1992. Chevrolet and Ford compete every year for bragging rights to the title of best-selling truck; Ford won the contest for 1991.
"We are encouraged by the light-truck sales numbers," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.
Analysts held out hope that several factors, including lower interest rates and the stock market's strong recent gains, might result in positive sales reports in coming months. "With higher net worth, it's just a matter of time before that spills into replacing cars and trucks," said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter in San Francisco.
 Several dealers around the country reported mixed results through early January. Ramsay Gillman, who owns 13 foreign and domestic dealerships in Texas, said that his sales were growing but that the gains were almost imperceptible. "We're experiencing a slow and somewhat erratic increase in our business," he said. "There's no boom, no mini-boom, no great road to recovery here."
Mr. Gillman added that some of the improvements had been interrupted by news events, such as G.M.'s announcement last month of plant closings and layoffs, which further dented the confidence of consumers. But he said the new year had also inspired many people with jobs to believe they would remain employed. "They feel like they've been through the worst times," he said.
Business in early January was down 25 percent compared with the period a year earlier at the three Continental Motors dealerships in Fairfield County, Conn., said Joseph W. Hernandez, the general sales manager. Mr. Hernandez said he had noticed that buyers in the wealthy county were comparing dealerships to save $200.
Weekday showroom traffic has also dropped off considerably. "In the last two weeks, people are not coming in the door," Mr. Hernandez said. Continental Motors sells Saabs, Jeeps and Eagles, BMW's and Volvos.
 
 
G.M. Car Sales Off 16%
 In early January, the General Motors Corporation sold 46,355 domestically produced cars, a decline of 16 percent from early 1991. Light-truck sales dropped seven-tenths of a percent, to 29,893.
Ford Motor's car sales rose slightly in the period, to 30,118, a gain of 1.5 percent. The company'struck sales rose 3.6 percent, to 23,886.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales dropped 27.3 percent, to 10,100, based on estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports. But Ward's estimated that Chrysler's light-truck sales, including mini-vans, rose 34 percent, to 16,800. Chrysler reports its sales on a monthly basis.
The Big Three posted an overall decline of 4.4 percent. Sales of Japanese cars made in North America declined only nine-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japan Exchanges Spurred by Bush Trip

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
While most people were counting the automobiles and auto parts to come from President Bush's talks in Tokyo last week, some Americans and Japanese welcomed promises of increased cultural exchanges and specifically the promotion of Japanese language studies in this country.
American interest in Japanese has soared in the last five years as Japanese investment in, and trade with the United States have increased. In 1991, though, the growth in Japanese studies leveled off, mainly because of a national shortage of good teachers and of funds, according to a Japanese official in New York. 
 The Tokyo agreements reached by Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa include pledges on both sides to foster greater Japanese-language training in America through exchanges and grass-roots efforts. Academic exchanges at all levels would be promoted through groups like the Japan Foundation's Center for Global Partnership, which was recently set up by the Tokyo Government.
The official, Seigi Hinata, director of the Japan Information Center, remarked: "People only talk about auto trade, but they should also consider the pledges for the enhancement of mutual understanding and exhanges. "The new exchange program will be very important for American business."
 
Difficult for Americans
 Teachers and other specialists point out that it is much more difficult for an American student to learn Japanese than the Romance languages -- the result of a different and complex alphabet, as well as sounds that have no equivalent in English. Some of these specialists say it takes an American student roughly twice as long to learn Japanese as these languages.
Still, American high schools have shown interest in beginning Japanese language and culture programs, but have been blocked by a lack of teachers and funds, Mr. Hinata said. Under the cultural agreements, he said, his Government would be sending teachers to the United States starting in April, "on a request basis."
The study of Japanese is the fastest-growing language program in American colleges, nearly doubling from 1986 through 1990, said John Cross, director of foreign language programs at the Modern Language Association. He said he expected this to continue, although he acknowledged there were problems in finding trained teachers.
Another specialist said that upward of 12,000 American junior and senior high school students studied Japanese in 1990. But in Japan, all junior and senior high school students are required to take a total of six years of English; 95 percent actually do.
Japanese ranks as the fifth most popular foreign language in American college curriculums -- after Spanish, French, German and Italian.
At Columbia University, which has one of the strongest Japanese studies programs in the country, enrollment in language courses leveled off last year at 300 graduate and undergraduate students, after five years of rapid growth. Keiko Chevray, director of Japanese language training at Columbia, said this was the maximum the university could handle with present resources.
 
Endowments at Columbia
 Hugh Patrick, director of Columbia's Center on Japanese Economy and Business, welcomed the Tokyo accord and noted that in the last five years, Japanese companies had endowed professorships of Japanese literature, religion, economics and business.
"The explosive growth of interest in learning Japanese has been driven by professionals, business people and lawyers, who see it as a plus to their careers," said John K. Wheeler, vice president of the Japan Society, a New York-based private group.
The society's language classes, stretched to the group's limits, found special help last year from one of its supporters, the Toyota Motor Corporation. The company agreed to provide a grant of $1.25 million for the construction of classrooms, a language laboratory and library in an underground wing of the society's Manhattan headquarters. These facilities are to be opened some time this year.
At Berlitz a sharp inrease in enrollment in Japanese from 1987 through 1990 was followed by a decline last year, said Patricia Sze, the director of marketing.

HEADLINE: A.T.&T. to Provide Ukraine's Phone Links

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
A.T.& T. announced today that it would team up with the Ukrainian Government and the Dutch telephone company to build and operate a new long-distance telephone service in the newly independent republic.
The deal marks one of the first big business agreements between an American company and a former Soviet republic since the official dismemberment of the Soviet Union last month. It is also the first time that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company will own part of a long-distance network in a foreign country. 
 As part of the deal, A.T.& T. will own 39 percent of a new long-distance telephone company that will link cities within Ukraine, as well as provide direct connections between Ukraine and outside countries. The Ukrainian State Committee of Communications will own 51 percent of the venture, and PTT Telecom of the Netherlands will own 10 percent.
A.T.& T. officials refused to say how much they were investing in the new venture. But under the agreement, A.T.& T. will supply 13 large electronic switches that it said were worth "in the tens of millions of dollars."
These switches, the bulk of its investment, will be used to route calls over a new nationwide network that will reach about 60 percent of Ukraine's population, company officials said. Once installed next month, the first switch will make it possible for the first time to dial telephone numbers directly in Ukraine, without having to first be connected through Moscow's antiquated and overloaded telephone system.
"We are looking at a market where there is a great deal of pent-up demand," said Randall Tobias, vice chairman of A.T.& T. With a population of 52 million in Ukraine, he said, "we are dealing with a market here, in terms of geography and population, that is just about the size of France."
Industry analysts said A.T.& T.'s gamble was small, relative to its size, and a good one on balance. "The significance of this lies not in its immediate financial impact, because neither the investment nor the possible profits are likely to shift earnings much in either direction," said Gregory Sawers, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "The significance is that this is the first concrete step by A.T.& T. outside the equipment business to globalize its business."
 
Looking for More Deals
 Mr. Tobias made it clear that A.T.& T. was eager to attract similar business with other parts of the former Soviet Union and said his company had been in discussions "for a long, long time" with other republics, and both the old and new central governments. Asked if other deals were possible, Mr. Tobias said, "I certainly wouldn't rule that out."
Although A.T.& T. is one of the world's biggest providers of international telephone service to and from the United States, it has thus far had little presence as a service provider within other countries. In large part, that is because most countries have until recently controlled their telephone industries through state-owned monopolies.
Increasingly, however, the regional telephone companies in this country and foreign telephone companies, like Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain and BT, formerly British Telecom P.L.C., have begun investing in cellular franchises, long-distance services and newly privatized telephone companies being sold in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America.
A.T.& T. has long been eager to move into those markets. Last October, it signed a deal with the Government of Armenia to supply a switch that will let people make international calls directly into and out of the republic. The company is also building a similar switch in Poland for the Polish telephone company.
In addition to providing long-distance service, A.T.& T. said it hoped to provide much of the equipment that the Ukrainian Government had said it wanted to buy to expand its local telephone network. The Government wants to double the number of telephone lines in the country over the next several years, from 7 million to 13 million.
The Ukranian venture does pose risks. For one thing, much of the venture's income will be in rubles, which have been weakened by the ailing economies in the republics. Although A.T.&T. officials said they will earn hard currency, they refused to explain how. "We have worked out arrangements that will meet our needs," Mr. Tobias said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
McDonald's Executive Named Vice Chairman

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
A number of McDonald's employees are fond of saying that Jack M. Greenberg spent the last 18 months "getting ketchup in his veins" -- flipping hamburgers, scooping french fries and serving up extra-thick milkshakes. Now, having learned firsthand what it is like to be a McDonald's operator and regional supervisor, Mr. Greenberg has been named to the second-biggest job in the company.
The McDonald's Corporation said yesterday that Mr. Greenberg, who was chief financial officer, had been promoted to the new position of vice chairman at the company, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill. 
 While the 49-year-old Mr. Greenberg, a tax accountant by training, will continue to run the company's finances, he will also begin overseeing the company's legal department, government relations, insurance, licensing, personnel, purchasing, real estate and construction. And his promotion puts him in line to succeed McDonald's chairman and chief executive, Michael R. Quinlan, although Mr. Quinlan is only 47.
For now, though, Mr. Greenberg must focus on reinvigorating McDonald's American business, which is growing more slowly than it has in the past. Part of the sluggishness is a result of the weak economy and intense competition from lower-cost drive-through-only burger chains like Rally's Inc. and mid-priced table-service restaurants like Baker's Square.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Greenberg said McDonald's decision to reduce some prices and sell combinations of menu offerings, like the $1.99 "Happy Meal" for children, at promotional prices had helped to bring in more customers.
"Things have improved," he said, "but I wouldn't change the message. It is a highly competitive business that we are in and we have an economic environment that has been difficult for retailers in general."
Mr. Greenberg said one of his chief priorities would be to improve McDonald's drive-through service. He said this would require the company and its franchisees to reduce the number of bungled orders, cut the waiting time and open more drive-through windows where customers could talk to a person face-to-face rather than through an intercom.
To make McDonald's employees inside restaurants focus more on customer service, Mr. Greenberg said the company would experiment more with things like paying bonuses to workers who go the extra mile to help customers.
Increasing the company's foreign business will be the other big focus, Mr. Greenberg said. He noted that not only could McDonald's restaurants abroad continue their double-digit sales growth, but their profitability could improve significantly as the company achieved economies of scale in purchasing and distribution outside the United States.
"The opportunities for us internationally are enormous," said Mr. Greenberg, who became chief financial officer in 1982 after being one of the partners in charge of McDonald's accounting at Arthur Young & Company.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Recession Is Foregoing Link Between Newspaper Groups

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
In the American newspaper industry, the right hand, at long last, is about to grasp the left.
The two largest associations in the industry, one representing its business and editorial interests, the other its advertising sales efforts, announced yesterday that they intended to combine forces after more than four decades of separate operations. 
 The decision, disclosed at a news conference at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan, would merge the American Newspaper Publishers Association, founded in 1887 and based in Reston, Va., with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, founded in 1913 and based in New York. The boards of both associations, meeting in New York yesterday and Monday, agreed in principle to the merger, subject to the approval of their members.
Cathleen Black, the former publisher of USA Today, who has been chairman and chief executive of the publishers' association since June, has been named chairman and chief executive of a joint management organization that will run the two associations until the merger is concluded.
If, as expected, the members approve the merger, which is planned to take effect on July 1, Ms. Black, 47 years old, would become president and chief executive of what would be called the American Newspaper Association (a set of initials already claimed in the world of advertising and media by the Association of National Advertisers). Leonard P. Forman, 47, who has been president of the ad bureau since February, would at that time become chief operating officer of the new association.
For many years, the two organizations, as well as others in the fractionated industry, whose members belong to more than a half-dozen other marketing, advertising and research associations, have discussed amalgamating. But it took the industry's worst financial results in 50 years, in large part because of a plunge in ad sales not seen since the 1930's, to hasten this merger.
"I've often said that if the newspaper industry were the Balkans, we'd be in World War III now," said John Morton, newspaper analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a brokerage, in Washington. "They've always had all these separate organizations," he added, "which is outdated in this day and age."
The industry's recession, and the cost savings the merger would bring members in expenses like dues, were not the only reasons behind the merger, J. Stewart Bryan 3d, chairman of the ad bureau, told the news conference.
"The newspaper business has determined that it wants to speak with a single voice," said Mr. Bryan, who is also chief executive of Media General Inc.
Among the issues to be addressed by the new organization, said Robert F. Erburu, chairman of the publishers association, and chairman and chief executive of the Times Mirror Company, will be marketing, First Amendment rights, public policy, technology and diversity in the newsroom.
"The idea that you could pursue advertising excellence apart from circulation excellence, editorial excellence or production excellence, is insane," Mr. Morton said. "These are all interlinked."
Still, the financial issues behind the merger cannot be ignored. The publishers' association now has 1,323 members, Ms. Black said, about 150 fewer than five years ago; Mr. Forman said that the ad bureau, with 633 members, had suffered a similar decline. Though about a third of the membership hemorrhage was attributable to newspapers merging or closing, the rest was because of resignations by members.
While new dues structures are still being determined, Ms. Black said, "for a newspaper that belongs to A.N.P.A. and N.A.B., dues will drop."
Ms. Black said it had not been determined where the new organization would be based. Mr. Morton, the analyst, predicted that it would be in Reston, with an ad sales office in New York. Ms. Black added that staffing decisions had also not been made; the publishers' association has about 150 employees, all in Reston, and the ad bureau about 100 -- 80 in New York and the rest in sales offices around the country.
The proposed combination pre-empts a decision announced last year to merge, effective in July, the ad bureau and six other marketing and research organizations, into an organization called Newspaper Marketing Inc. While details have not yet been worked out, Mr. Forman said, the intent is to have the activities now performed by the six, as well as the bureau, performed by the new association. Among the six are the Association of Newspaper Classified Advertising Managers, the International Newspaper Advertising and Marketing Executives and the Newspaper Research Council.
The merger is the latest significant change in a realm of industry associations and organizations that have been hit hard by the sour economy. The Television Bureau of Advertising, for example, which is that medium's equivalent of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, has spent the last year drastically reorganizing to narrow its focus and reduce costs.
When the newspaper ad bureau was founded in 1913, it was called the Bureau of Advertising and was part of the publishers' association. It became a separate organization in 1950 and was renamed in 1973.

The Experts Talk, But Who Listens?

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WEEK after week, many of America's best-known economists are being summoned before Congressional committees for expert advice on what to do about the economy. But while given respectful hearings, their counsel is almost certain to be rejected, to the continued frustration of a profession that has long suffered such indignities.
A tax cut for the middle class? A bad idea, say an overwhelming majority of economists of various political inclinations. A tax credit for capital investments? It distorts capital flows, they respond, particularly if the credit is temporary. 
 So, not surprisingly, these items are odds-on favorites to be important components of whatever "growth" bill -- the certainties are that it will sport a highfalutin name and voter-friendly provisions -- gets enacted this year.
For years, the economics fraternity has suffered from the perversity by which the Government both overpraises and ignores it and in doing so often creates policies that are wasteful and counterproductive.
In fact, there is a form of Murphy's Law that asserts, as propounded by Alan S. Blinder, professor of economics at Princeton University: "Economists have the least influence on policy where they know the most and are most agreed; they have the most influence on policy where they know the least and disagree most vehemently."
Amid the rhetoric, especially in election campaigns, when liberal and conservative economists gravitate to their respective camps, it is easy to think that these economists are professionally poles apart. But they are not. They generally agree on most matters, such as that free trade is better than protectionism, and that government price-setting, whether of air fares, wages or rents, lowers a society's standard of living.
"If you asked economists whether price controls are a good thing, about 90 percent of them would say no," Milton Friedman, the prominent conservative, once contended. Moreover, he said that much of what appeared to be disagreement really was not, because it involved others -- sometimes journalists -- talking like economists.
Even many politicians agree, at least intellectually, with economists on numerous issues. Their practical calculus, however, is different. The incentives for them are to respond to two groups: sloganeering opponents and well-financed and well-organized special interests.
The economists have won some victories, especially since the late 1970's, when deregulation of airlines and trucking -- Professor Blinder, an unabashed liberal, calls these "stunning triumphs of the public interest over entrenched vested interests" -- was initiated, along with decontrol of oil and natural gas prices. Then, seemingly against all odds, came the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the 1990 agreement to reduce the budget deficit over five years.
But this year Congress may well administer the ultimate humiliation, ignoring what the economists say about both macroeconomic policy -- the big picture on which they are in rare relative prescriptive agreement -- and the so-called micro issues, such as the wisdom of extending unemployment benefits, on which they usually agree. This reflects both past expediency and election-year politics.
"It's too late for sound economic policy," observes Lincoln F. Anderson, an economist for the Fidelity Management and Research Company who was a senior Reagan Administration official. "Now we're reaching for quick fixes."
Indeed, many Washingtonians believe, political maneuvering will overwhelm economic analysis in the legislative arena, resulting in more incentives for current consumption and little attention to raising investment in the future. It is an acknowledged problem that what will help the economy in the short run tends to be bad in the long run.
Why, folks ask, should a Democratic Congress be expected to help end what they can point to as George Bush's recession? Why should the Democrats not succumb to a strategy that calls for passing bad but plausible-sounding legislation that will resonate on the stump and force the President to choose between their plan and a veto?
And why should Republicans, already a diminishing minority in Congress, eschew their own election-year plan to cut taxes for the ubiquitous middle class, a category into which almost every solvent American believes he or she fits?
Amid the search for a panacea -- a policy that helps the economy in both short term and long term, maintains budgetary discipline and is seen as fair -- the Joint Tax Committee issues a warning: "One needs to be clear about the ills to be attacked because a package of actions cobbled together could end up with individual elements working at cross purposes to one another."
The committee is probably prescient. It's enough to make a grown economist cry.

Kitty Kelley Draws a Bead on the Royal Family

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
The House of Windsor is in for what the Queen herself might call a bit of bother. Kitty Kelley, who has written best-selling unauthorized exposes of the American royals Frank Sinatra, Nancy Reagan and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, has agreed to write a book about the British royal family, which Warner Books plans to publish in 1995.
Flush with money from the success of "Scarlett," the record-breaking best-selling sequel to "Gone With the Wind," Warner was looking for an equally dazzling book to bolster its nonfiction reputation. When Simon & Schuster, which published Ms. Kelley's most recent book, "Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography," did not come up with as much money as the author and her agents at International Creative Management thought she deserved, Warner did. 
 Simon & Schuster, which is about to publish the paperback edition of the Nancy Reagan book, had vigorously pursued Ms. Kelley. But what people with inside knowledge of the negotiations described as a multi-million-dollar offer was apparently not multi enough.
Warner is officially announcing today that it signed the Kelley book but would not confirm or deny that the royal family was in for the royal business and would not comment on how much Ms. Kelley is being paid.
"When negotiations broke down with S&S, I.C.M. came to us because they knew that we were the kind of house that would be very interested in Kitty Kelley," said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, the president of Warner Books. "Frankly, 'Scarlett' has given us a little momentum and also a little working capital that we can plow back into the business. Given the tough economic times, we saw it as an opportunity to land a blue-chip author."
 
A Cut at the Top
 Facing serious financial difficulties, Farrar, Straus & Giroux has laid off 15 employees, and among those leaving is Linda Healy, vice president, associate publisher and executive editor.
Ms. Healy and Roger Straus Jr., the president of the company, said Ms. Healy was leaving by mutual agreement because the publisher could no longer make a commitment to the journalistic nonfiction books it hired her to pursue and publish.
Farrar, Straus is just one of many publishing houses that have cut their staffs as they realized that publishing is not immune to dips in the economy, as it was once thought to be. Among others that have made cuts recently is Penguin U.S.A., which dismissed 29 people in a cost-cutting measure in November.
But people in publishing expressed concern that the departure of Ms. Healy was a sign the house of Tom Wolfe, Scott Turow, Joseph Brodsky and John McPhee was in more serious financial trouble than was thought.
"Farrar, Straus & Giroux is a fine publishing house, with which I have been pleased to be associated," Ms. Healy said. "I am confident that the house will weather this temporary economic setback. Unfortunately, circumstances make it impossible for me to continue the broad publishing program of nonfiction which I came here to build."
Mr. Straus said that Ms. Healy was hired as part of an expansion begun four years ago and that the company's growth collided head on with the recession. He said Ms. Healy's nonfiction list, which includes Thomas Geoghegan's "Which Side Are You On? Trying to Be for Labor When It's Flat on Its Back," which was nominated this week for a National Book Critics Circle Award, did not fit into the company's economic plans or its general literary character.
"This unfortunately is a cloth we have to cut from our coat to wear for next year," he said.
 
Curbing Book Returns
 Random House Inc. has decided to try a new carrot-and-stick approach to reduce the many books that stores and wholesalers buy, don't sell, then return to the publisher for what has traditionally been full credit.
This season, Random House Inc., which includes among its imprints Alfred A. Knopf, Random House, Crown and Pantheon, became the first publishing house to penalize wholesalers with high rates of return, saying that difficult economic times made it impossible to continue the blanket return-for-full-credit policy.
The publisher is calling it a wholesaler incentive program. Like a peppy grade-school teacher, Random House is encouraging wholesalers to plan better and earn bonus money. From now on, a wholesaler who keeps its overall return rate below 30 percent for the calendar year will receive credit for the returned books and a rebate of 1.25 percent on the full retail price of the order. Those who return more than 30 percent will get no rebate and will receive less than they paid for the books.
For example, a wholesaler who orders $10,000 worth of books at the retail price will be billed $5,100, given the company's 49 percent discount to wholesalers and stores. If during the year the wholesaler returns 25 percent of those orders, it will receive a credit of only $1,175 instead of the $1,275 it paid for them. But since the wholesaler's returns for the year are below 30 percent, the wholesaler will receive a rebate of $125, a $25 carrot from Random House Inc.
So far, Random House is confining the new policy to wholesalers because they have been the worst abusers of the liberal return policy, said Bruce Harris, the sales director for Random House Inc. The publishing house also does not want to penalize stores, which might then shy away from buying a risky book for fear they will lose money if it doesn't sell, said Alberto Vitale, the president of Random House Inc. Since wholesalers fill the needs of stores, their overordering is usually due to protective hoarding rather than eclectic buying.
"High returns are the enemy of productivity," said Mr. Harris, adding that some wholesalers had a return rate of over 80 percent.
Wholesalers are still evaluating the move, but at least one has voiced its support. Western Merchandisers, a Southwest wholesaler, sent a note of congratulations to Random House, saying, "Efficient wholesalers have been subsidizing the inefficient ones for a long time."
 
Filling a Hole
 Simon & Schuster is holding its breath, waiting to announce that Carolyn Reidy, the president and publisher of Avon Books, will join the company as president and publisher of its trade division.
The Hearst Corporation, the parent company of Avon, has apparently been slow to negotiate the terms for Ms. Reidy's departure, said people informed about the bargaining.
The position at Simon & Schuster has been vacant since last summer, when Charles E. Hayward left the company and took over as president and chief executive officer of Little, Brown & Company. Editors and executives at Simon & Schuster have been troubled by the hole at the helm of their flagship trade division and are eager for Ms. Reidy to conclude her talks with Hearst.

HEADLINE: New 'Lost Generation': The Cooking Illiterate

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
WITH an entrenched recession and a greater emphasis on simple, inexpensive pleasures, Americans say they would like to do more cooking at home.
But once they arrive in the kitchen, will they know what to do? 
 Food marketers and researchers say that despite the desire to cook, the cooking skills of Americans have declined precipitously. Even more striking, they say, Americans don't even know that they don't know how to cook.
In the last decade, cooking has evolved into an optional activity, like skiing or playing chess. Many young adults never learned how to cook, or they simply don't bother, because there are so many other choices, like fast food, takeout or frozen dishes that can be microwaved.
But if people want to eat healthfully, save money or entertain -- all desires being espoused in many public-opinion polls -- they may have trouble if they lack basic cooking techniques.
"For the first time in a long time, we're starting to see people concerned with the cost of food," said Marlene Johnson, the director of product communications at Pillsbury in Minneapolis. "If they can't cook, their choices are going to be extremely limited. They will turn to convenience products that may not be as nourishing."
When the National Pork Producers Council in Des Moines gave a cooking test last year to a nationally representative sample of 735 adults, nearly three-quarters of them flunked, missing 30 percent or more of the 20 questions. It found that 50 percent of the respondents didn't know how to thicken gravy correctly, 75 percent didn't know that broccoli should be cooked uncovered to maintain its color, and only 55 percent knew there are three teaspoons in a tablespoon. The test was contained in a mailed questionnaire sent out for the council by National Family Opinion Research Inc. in Toledo, Ohio.
Despite the vast gaps in cooking knowledge, 63 percent of the respondents described themselves as excellent or very good cooks. Men in general, and young adults 25 to 30 years old had the least cooking knowledge. These respondents said they would cook from scratch more often if they knew what to do in the kitchen.
Similar sentiments have been found by other researchers. "We hypothesize that young folks feel they do not have the appropriate skills," said Barbara Caplan, a vice president of Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, a market-research company in Westport, Conn.
When these young adults were growing up, she said, women were entering the work force in great numbers and did not have the time or energy to show their children how to cook. "In order to develop skills, they must be culturally desirable," she said, "and there must be adequate role models."
For years, going back to the 1920's, food companies have tried to persuade women that it was better to buy prepared food than to cook from scratch, said Joan Gussow, a professor of nutrition and education at Columbia University's Teachers College. Women allowed themselves to lose their cooking skills, she said, partly because no value was placed on cooking. "They were told that smart women don't cook," she added.
Cooking gained cachet in the late 1970's and early 80's as many Americans were discovering new and different cuisines, but the fad has passed. Irena Chalmers, the head of the International Association of Culinary Professionals in Louisville, Ky., said there were 800 cooking schools 11 years ago; now there are only 23 significant ones. "We are raising the first cooking-illiterate generation," she said. "They neither smell nor taste nor stir nor touch the food."
Whether or not they spend time in the kitchen, more Americans now consider cooking a worthwhile activity. In a 1990 Yankelovich poll of 2,500 people, conducted in person, only 34 percent said that cooking was creative and satisfying; in a survey of a different group in 1991, that number rose to 41 percent. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.
Mona Doyle, the president of the Consumer Network Inc., a consulting and research company in Philadelphia, has done two large studies on cooking in the last two years. Because of economic pressures and changing values, she said, people would like to do more cooking and baking, relying less on restaurants and prepared foods.
But they don't find cooking fun, and they especially don't like cleaning up. "The mess is the big reason propelling the decline of traditional cooking," Ms. Doyle said.
In one study of 1,450 consumers done in three stages last year, she found that more than two-thirds of the respondents, and almost 90 percent of those under 30, would enjoy cooking more if someone else cleaned up. Homemakers, rather than employed men or women, were more likely to express that feeling. What people do like about cooking is getting praise and having something succeed.
Lisa Kolrud, 27, who works for a public-relations company in Minneapolis, said she never spent much time in the kitchen with her mother, who held a job and ran the household. In college, she ate only processed foods, especially pizza. But now, partly because she is trying to save money because of the uncertain economy, she is learning how to cook.
On Jan. 5, she did the cooking for a dinner party. "I put lasagna on the table for nine people," she said. "It was the first time I'd ever done it. I got a standing ovation."
The route to the table, though, was traumatic. She put the uncooked noodles in the pan and topped them with sauce before she realized the noodles needed cooking. Fortunately, she had another box ready, in case of disaster. "I'm still at the stage where I buy two of everything," she said.
When children watch parents cook, they absorb technique by osmosis and gain confidence. Cheryl Camp, a 22-year-old actress who works at the New York Foundation for the Arts, said her mother cooked a great deal, and so does she. Roasted chicken, potato-dill soup, poppy-seed cake, apple pie, she's made them all. Describing a tortellini soup she and her roommates frequently make, she said, "you spice it with basil or rosemary or oregano, whatever you happen to have around."
Such comfort and flexibility in the kitchen are increasingly rare. Because Americans know less and less about technique, food companies and cookbook authors say they must make recipes extremely clear, explain every little step, and give no choices that could scare people. Many words commonly understood in the past can no longer be used.
Words like dredge, flute, braise, carmelize and butterfly are no longer understood by most people, said Katherine E. Smith, the vice president of consumer affairs for the Quaker Oats Company in Chicago, which recently commissioned a large study on cooking habits. All of those words are less likely to be understood by younger Americans.
On the other hand, cooking illiterates who only know how to steam vegetables may be healthier than their grandmothers, who knew how to flute a heavily larded pie crust and carmelize the top of a gooey dessert.
From observing consumers in its test kitchens, Quaker Oats has found that half the people don't even read the instructions on the package. "Some will have very thin oatmeal and think that's just fine," Ms. Smith said. "Our products have to be very tolerant. They have to taste good regardless of what you do to them."
Cindy Ayers, who oversees the test kitchen and recipe development for the Campbell Soup Company, said consumers want to be told the most basic things: when the food is done, for example. "They don't feel comfortable with their judgment," she said. "I think their confidence is down because their cooking skills are less."
These days, the company gives people few choices. In Campbell's 1978 cookbook, "The Creative Cook," a recipe for Easy Pot Roast said: "In large heavy pan, brown meat on all sides. Use shortening as necessary." The new edition of the cookbook, "Deliciously Easy Recipes," to be published by Campbell this month, is far more specific. Its recipe for Savory Pot Roast gives these directions: "In six-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat in hot oil, cook roast until browned on all sides." In the list of ingredients, the recipe specified two tablespoons of oil for the cooking. The new cookbook, unlike the old, has pictures with every recipe.
Susan Friedland, a senior editor at HarperCollins in New York, has commissioned two beginner cookbooks for the first time in her 10 years as a cookbook editor. The books, on Chinese and Italian cooking, will come out in the spring. "I think there are a lot of people who got used to good eating and can't afford those restaurants anymore," she said. "They want to cook this food at home."
Harry Balzer, a vice president of the NPD Group, a market-research company in Park Ridge, Ill., said that people are eating more meals at home than they did a few years ago, but often, they're not cooking dishes from scratch. Instead, they're assembling foods that have been already prepared. Meals that include a homemade ingredient declined from 48 percent in 1984 to 42 percent in 1991, Mr. Balzer said.
The percentage of meals made at home requiring use of the stove top continues to decline, from 54 percent in 1984 to 42 percent last year. But the use of the microwave oven, which is mainly used for heating prepared foods, went from 9 percent to 20 percent in that time, he said. The use of the ordinary oven has dipped slightly, from 17 percent of all meals in 1984 to 16 percent last year.
Still, researchers say people have strongly expressed the desire to spend time with their families doing simple activites like cooking. Nobody thinks, though, that a return to the kitchen will mean a revival of cooking from scratch.
"Maybe they're cutting up a few more vegetables with the kids," Ms. Ayers said. "It has to be simple and fun."

HEADLINE: In a Belt-Tightening Age, a $5.2 Million Restaurant Is Born

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While the rest of the United States has been battening down the hatches, Terry Peay and Mark Miller have been spending money like sailors on shore leave. In this age of austerity, their new $5.2 million restaurant, Red Sage, stands out.
Not since Warner LeRoy opened the $10 million Potomac in the heady mid-80's has Washington seen such a fantasy. The difference is that the LeRoy enterprise looked like fin de siecle bordello and served bordello quality food. The Red Sage has been done with panache, and Mark Miller, considered among the country's most imaginative chefs, knows how to cook. The restaurant opened on Monday, and it's already heavily booked. Dinner will be about $30. 
 Even the jaded Washington food establishment is agog. Earlier this month, they got their first glimpse of the silver-and-gold, teal-and-oxblood color scheme; the $18,000 hand-blown chandeliers; the $36,000 food smoker and the $375 custom-made chairs. And yes, they like the food, too.
"A wonderful combination of the whimsical and the stunning," Ellen Brown, a food and restaurant consultant, said of the space. "Lavishness is the owner's prerogative as long as I don't have to pay for it."
Mr. Peay, the financial partner in the venture, is also in business with Mr. Miller at the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe. "You cannot get this kind of environment without spending money," he said. But he added that he never would have made the gamble with any other chef.
Mr. Miller, 42 years old, is an anthropologist and art historian by training; you might say he became a cook by accident when Alice Waters asked him to fill in temporarily at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif. He ending up staying there three and a half years, and in 1979 went out on his own to open the Fourth Street Grill and Santa Fe Bar and Grill in Berkeley. He sold them to open the Coyote Cafe in 1987.
His training still informs his cooking. "Most of my life I have been involved in primitive art," he said. "I am not looking for symphonics, as in French; I'm looking for expressiveness. It's the difference between Louis XIV furniture and African primitive art. The flavors are immediate, expressive, intense. People's thinking dominates the way they cook."
Like the Red Sage's decor, there is nothing retiring about Mr. Miller's food, which he said has some basis in Native American cooking. There is a lot going on in each dish, but because Mr. Miller knows his ingredients, the subtle combinations explode with flavor. He is a master of chilies -- he understands their complex nature and their synergy.
His oyster corn chowder, for example, pairs the smokiness and sweetness of roasted poblano chilies with the freshness of anaheims. These enliven the sweetness of the corn, the saltiness and freshness of the oysters. Or, to put it in Mr. Miller's words, "The combination creates movement in the mouth, gives you a rhythm in the dish." That's the art historian talking.
"When people look at Native American food," Mr. Miller said, "they are looking at the remnants of Indian civilization." That's the anthropologist talking.
But what he is cooking at Red Sage is much broader than Native American. It is, according to him, the West of the Great Plains, and its boundaries are the Rio Grande, the Grand Tetons, the Rockies and the Mississippi. "It's meant to be ambiguous," Mr. Miller said. "It's inspired by the Pueblo, Iroquois and Plains Indians, by the Mexican and Spanish, by the European immigration: the German, the English, the Scandinavian.
"It's an area that would have had a ranch, that would have had cultivated food and wild food. I have combined these influences with my techniques, which are European."
Ms. Brown, for one, is not convinced. "The idea of Western cuisine versus Southwestern -- I think we are splitting hairs, be they horse hairs or calf hairs," she said.
All these elements are at play in the restaurant's design. "This is a mythical Western theme," said the designer, Stephen Samuelson of Studio Arquitectura, a Santa Fe concern. "It's not Spanish, Mexican, cowboy, Southwest. It is turn of the century. We tried to evoke what it was like when settlers went West, the grand ranches, the architecture brought in on trains, the Victorian design brought out to the Southwest."
Whatever its design period, Red Sage has been done within an inch of its life. Most of the more than 100 craftsmen who worked on the 18,000-square-foot, 350-seat restaurant were imported from Santa Fe.
Were they worried about such an extravaganza in a shrinking economy? "To do something less than the full creative range is not something we wanted to get involved with," Mr. Peay said. "You cannot get this kind of environment without spending money."
And besides, he added, the Swedish and Dutch investors in the building in which the restaurant is located, "have hundreds of billions of dollars." Who cares if only four floors in the $80 million, 11-story building are rented?
Actually, the owners did consider costs. "We curtailed it quite a bit," Mr. Peay said. "In one day we cut out $700,000." It's hard to see where they would have put the trout lakes with weeds and grass, or the holograms.
Despite the cutbacks, the multilevel restaurant kept the custom-made 3-D clouds; hand-etched glass; nickel and silver medallions imbedded in the tile; the 12- by-16-foot mural; hand-rubbed, beeswax-finished frescoed walls; the hammered wrought-iron stair rail; the water channel (known in New Mexico as an acequia); bandana-shaped hand-woven rug; hand-painted tile mural of chickens and cactus; bullseye wall sconces held in place by Indian-head nickels; wrought-iron lizard door handles, and so on.
But the $5.2 million was spent on more than a restaurant and a chili bar. Red Sage is a small food company that also expects a return on its investment from the private dining rooms, the carry-out, bakery and dry goods shop, and catering facilities.
To earn back the money, the company will need to net about $1 million a year in what Ms. Brown accurately described as a "fairly dead part of downtown Washington."
Raise the specter of poor location -- 14th and F Streets Northwest -- in a city in which hardly anyone comes downtown at night anyway and the partners pull out their extensive demographic studies and snow you with statistics. "Another 8,000 high-end residential units within four or five blocks . . . the opening of 10 new movie theaters . . . 10,000 hotel rooms within a seven-block radius . . . 12,000 lawyers in a 10-block radius. . . ."
Assuming that the demographics are correct, how will this European-oriented city, where gray is the color of choice, react to a vibrant recreation of a mythic American West?
"You know, half the people in this town won't get it," said Bill Plante, the State Department correspondent for CBS News, who attended one of the recent preview dinners. "The other half will go crazy for it."

HEADLINE: Albany's Leadership Void

 BODY:
The experts had predicted it. But somehow this week's downgrading of New York State's safest bonds hit like a punch in the stomach. The downgrading will not only cost the taxpayers millions of dollars in added interest costs. It is the loudest signal yet that New York's political leaders are intolerably ineffective in resolving the state's worsening fiscal crisis.
There is a desperate need for leadership on all sides in Albany. Not the same old partisan politics -- not Republicans versus Democrats, or upstate versus downstate, or the cities versus the suburbs -- but broad and unselfish leadership that puts the public's well-being ahead of narrow political gain. 
 For nearly two decades a Democratic-controlled Assembly, Republican-dominated Senate and Democratic Governor have managed to make budget decisions -- but only because the economy cooperated. In good or normal times, the two sides could compromise because there was enough money to spread around to satisfy everybody. But when the national recession hit and resources shrank, partisanship intensified.
Now Gov. Mario Cuomo urges the Senate Republicans to consider his solutions while the Senate majority leader, Ralph Marino, irresponsibly refuses to budge. For two months they have been unable to close a gap of $875 million in this year's budget, and the anticipated gap next year is at least $4 billion.
The stalemate has already caused serious damage. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the state's appropriation-backed bonds last week, and this week Standard & Poor's took the more drastic step of dropping the rating on New York's general obligation bonds, those backed by the state's full faith and credit, to A-, the lowest level in the state's history and the second-lowest general obligation bond rating in the country.
The downgrading does not imply that New York State is likely to default on its most secure obligations. But it does mean that New York will be paying out millions of additional dollars in higher interest rates on the sale of new bonds, and that scores of local school districts will no doubt be forced to pay higher interest rates on their bonds, eating into educational programs or driving up property taxes.
The rating agencies acted because the state's finances are in bad shape and show no immediate prospect of improvement. Citing a fifth consecutive operating deficit, Standard & Poor's complained about "continued economic deterioration," "chronic operating deficits" and "the legislative stalemate in seeking permanent and structurally sound fiscal operations."
Mr. Marino and the Senate Republicans on one side, Mr. Cuomo and the Assembly Democrats on the other, have fundamental differences on how to resolve the crisis. Mr. Marino wants to take most of the necessary budget cuts out of welfare and Medicaid and leave school aid -- bread and butter to his suburban constituents -- largely intact. The Governor acknowledges the need for cuts in social welfare spending but would spread the pain more evenly. The details should be in Mr. Cuomo's budget for the next fiscal year, due later this month.
Albany's players can no longer wait for an economic recovery to bail them out. The state needs fundamental fiscal reforms -- and leaders willing finally to rise above partisanship and confront a crisis that they collaborated in causing.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: Should Congress Investigate the 'October Surprise'?;
Don't Waste Time On This Wild Tale

BYLINE: By Mitch McConnell; Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For 10 years, arms smugglers, convicted felons, frauds and fugitives from justice have unsuccessfully peddled allegations of a so-called October surprise to the Iran-contra independent counsel, Iran-contra Congressional investigating committees, Senate Intelligence Committee and the public.
After hearing detailed testimony from Gary Sick, the Senate properly rejected a bill to spend $600,000 to pursue charges that he is now selling in a book. Some will argue an investigation should be conducted just to lay the issue to rest. But what would a new investigation do, on top of the ones already undertaken? There will always be one more conspiracy-minded partisan who will come up with another titillating date, detail or account of events, particularly in an election year. 
 What apparently troubled Mr. Sick into spinning his web was the breakdown of negotiations between the Carter Administration and Iranian leaders on the release of the hostages. After a series of high-level secret meetings, Mr. Sick argues, the Iranians abruptly and inexplicably suspended contact in September 1980. To him, the timing suggests a secret deal must have been struck between aides of Ronald Reagan and Iranians.
But two senior officials in the hostage talks -- President Jimmy Carter's counsel, Lloyd Cutler, and Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher -- have suggested that the Sept. 22, 1980 Iraqi attack against 10 military bases and invasions by six divisions on three fronts distracted Iranian leaders. In retrospective analyses, Mr. Cutler and Mr. Christopher have said they were convinced that the life-and-death decisions those leaders faced together with the intense rivalry for control after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's return to Teheran made Iran unwilling to resolve, or incapable of resolving, the hostage crisis in 1980.
The frenzied anti-American demonstrations, especially after the failure of the U.S. helicopter rescue attempt in 1980, suggested little interest from Iran in helping Jimmy Carter. He learned the hostages were to be freed only within hours of Jan. 20, 1981, Ronald Reagan's Inauguration Day.
Dismissing Mr. Cutler's and Mr. Christopher's views, Mr. Sick turns to stories told by figures from the world of black-market arms sales. If he did not enjoy some professional credibility from his days as a National Security Council staff member in the Carter Administration, these people would have remained where they belong -- in the shadows.
Mr. Sick has written and testified that he relied on six sources to confirm his central and most disturbing charge: William Casey, Mr. Reagan's campaign manager, negotiated with Hojatolislam Mehdi Karrubi, an Iranian cleric, in two meetings in Madrid in July 1980 to extend the hostages' suffering deliberately and ruthlessly. Mr. Sick says Mr. Casey held later meetings in Paris in October. Of the six, Mr. Sick says, Jamshid Hashemi, an Iranian arms trafficker, was the only eyewitness at the meetings. Mr. Sick, who knew Mr. Hashemi from his N.S.C. days, claims confidence in Mr. Hashemi's credibility even though he confessed willing involvement in a deal that would betray Mr. Carter.
For confirmation that these meetings took place, Mr. Sick also depended on Ari Ben-Menashe, an Israeli arms dealer whose story was dismissed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Although not at any meetings, he told Mr. Sick he had read about them in Israeli cables. Mr. Sick admitted not asking to see those cables, nor seeking any other supporting documents: he just trusted Mr. Ben-Menashe. The credibility of the remaining sources is even weaker. Ahmad Madani, a former Defense Minister whom Mr. Hashemi had promoted for president of Iran in the late 1970's, said he was not at the Madrid meetings but that if his friend Mr. Hashemi said they had taken place, they must have. Of the other so-called sources cited, not one actually attended any meetings nor produced any supporting evidence of any sort proving they had occurred. These dubious sources included Arif Durrani, a Pakistani arms smuggler; Richard Babayan, an American arms dealer, and Heinrich Rupp, an associate of the discredited Richard J. Brenneke, who claimed to have been a C.I.A. agent -- a claim the C.I.A. has denied.
Mr. Sick testified he had relied on the hearsay of unidentified journalists for the stories of Mr. Durrani, Mr. Babayan and Mr. Rupp -- that he had never spoken directly with them. In peddling his conspiracy story, Mr. Sick is joined by the former President of Iran, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, who has changed the important details of his story at least five times, as well as by Mr. Brenneke.
The conspiracy theory is as credible as its promoters, who claim Mr. Casey was not at the Anglo-American conference on the history of World War II in London on July 28 and July 29, 1980; they allege that he was in Madrid instead. What is truly credible are the recorded notes possessed by the British Imperial War Museum detailing his participation in the conference. Each time that records unequivocally establish the whereabouts of a U.S. official whose name comes up in Mr. Sick's theory, his sources revise their stories and alter the dates and places.
During the Congressional Iran-contra investigations, allegations of the October surprise came up, but the committee's report dismissed them. The taxpayers have already spent more than $50 million on committees and counsels investigating plots relating to Iran. America cannot afford another expensive investigation without a credible basis for proceeding.
We lack the facts. We should forgo the fantasy.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Real Competitors Are Ohio, Illinois . . .

BYLINE: By Robert W. Crandall; Robert W. Crandall is senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Ford, G.M. and Chrysler would have us believe that their main problem is lack of access to the Japanese market. As last week's debacle in Japan helped demonstrate, no one seriously believes that the Big Three can sell more than a handful of cars there under any rules. Even Honda has to scramble to hold on to a 10 percent market share in Japan.
The real problem is that the Big Three can't compete in the U.S. against cars produced by Japanese-owned plants in Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. These plants sprang up in part because of quotas on Japanese imports that the Big Three requested in the early 1980's. 
In effect, the Japanese are being told to slow the growth of the auto industry in those four states in order to preserve producers in and around Detroit who offer cars that many Americans view as inferior to those made further south.
Using U.S. labor, steel and myriad U.S. parts, these factories turn out the Camry, Accord and Sentra, which are so much better than G.M., Ford and Chrysler cars that they cost about 15 percent more than Detroit models with similar attributes. Moreover, they depreciate much more slowly in the used car market than American models do.
The Honda Accord, produced in Ohio, has been the hottest-selling American car for two years. Honda can produce about 500,000 cars a year in Ohio, and has been rapidly expanding its Ohio assembly, stamping and engine production operations. Toyota is doubling the size of its Kentucky plant and could expand even further. Mitsubishi bought out its partner, Chrysler, and is thus the sole owner of a plant in Illinois that produces high-quality sporty sedans.
Japanese plants in America account for about 14 percent of total passenger car sales in the U.S. Adding the imports, Japan's share of those sales is more than 30 percent. Detroit can expect that Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi and others will increase their share of the U.S. market to some 36 percent by the mid-90's.
With the Japanese now expanding into bigger cars, it is possible that American consumers will be buying 40 percent or more of their new cars from Japanese companies by 1995 or 1996. One reason is that the big Japanese cars -- the luxury Infiniti, Lexus and Acura models -- may well increase the gap in quality with their U.S. counterparts.
This loss of market share would force the Big Three to close yet more plants. Nonetheless, there is no sound reason why Japanese producers should slow their investment in the U.S. because Detroit cannot compete with them. If our Government does nothing -- it should do nothing -- the Big Three will continue to lose its market share to the Japanese simply because U.S. consumers had unhappy experiences with U.S. cars in the 1980's and were much more satisfied with Japanese models.
Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, himself admitted in the Jan. 6 issue of Automotive News, a trade newspaper, that Chrysler may have brought its plight on itself by selling "some crap" that customers will now replace with better Japanese cars.
Chrysler now makes about as many passenger cars as Honda, North America. G.M. has lost one-fourth of its U.S. passenger car market in the past decade, mostly to Japanese plants in America. Only Ford, with its Taurus and big-car lines, appears to be holding its market share, but even its stability is at risk from the new Japanese products.
For the U.S. economy to grow, efficient, high-quality producers must replace less-efficient, low-quality producers. This process has been under way for two decades in the auto industry. The Big Three have not been able to adopt a long-term strategy that would make them efficient producers of high-quality cars. Because of that failure, they will probably never recapture the market share they have lost to Japan.
The only question is how much further they must pare production in the next decade. They have only themselves to blame. Consumers are entitled to buy the best cars they can get for their money.

HEADLINE: Importing Immigrants, Exporting Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Accepting the Harsh Truth of a Blue-Collar Recession" (front page, Dec. 25), on the loss of more than one million blue-collar jobs in the current recession, correctly points out that not all of those jobs will return after the recession is over. While some have been lost because of increased efficiency, many are non- and low-skill manufacturing jobs. Where have those jobs gone? 
 They, like hundreds of thousands of such jobs during the 1980's, have been exported to the third world because the work can be done there at less cost. While this is just good economics, it does raise a question about our immigration policy.
Most of the 800,000 legal immigrants entering the United States each year would normally take non- and low-skilled manufacturing jobs. But the very jobs the new immigrants need are the ones that have been leaving the U.S. and going to the countries from which the immigrants come. How then are the new immigrants to find work, and what do they do if they cannot?
The answer to that question is to be found in your Dec. 3 report that in California 40 percent of newly arriving immigrants end up on welfare. Obviously, under current immigration policy, there is a mismatch between the skills needed to find work in the United States today and the skills of new immigrants. We need an immigration policy that recognizes that fact.

HEADLINE: Boston's New Mayor Faces Painful Task on Police Chief

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Raymond L. Flynn, one of the most popular mayors in the city's history, was placed in an agonizing position today when a special panel advised him against retaining the police commissioner, who is a boyhood friend of the Mayor and one of his closest associates.
The special commission, which was appointed by the Mayor himself to look into Police Department procedures, recommended that the commissioner, Francis M. Roache, be replaced when his term expires in April. The panel also sharply criticized the handling of civilian complaints by the police. 
 Compounding Mr. Flynn's difficulty, the panel's report came on the day that the Mayor delivered his state of the city address, in which he announced a major program to combat the effects of the recession in Boston. But his plan, to borrow $70 million to create jobs by building parks, schools, roads and sidewalks, was almost overshadowed by the attention given to the commission's report.
 
Complaints on Management
 Mr. Flynn appointed the commission, headed by James D. St. Clair, a nationally prominent lawyer, last May after several incidents raised concern that the police department was out of control. Some of the complaints involved the bungled investigation of the 1989 death of Carol Stuart, a white pregnant woman whose husband was later implicated in her slaying, but for which a black man was initially blamed. Other complaints had to do with the killings of five people by police officers in 1991. And in a drug investigation in which a police officer was killed, it came out in testimony in court that the police had manufactured an informant's evidence, and the suspect was acquitted.
At a crowded news conference in City Hall today, Mr. Flynn said he would act on several of the commission's recommendations. But he declined to discuss the proposal involving Mr. Roache, a position he repeated in his speech tonight.
Responding to accusations in the report that Mr. Roache had poorly managed the Police Department, Mr. Flynn recalled that when he appointed Mr. Roache in 1985, the major problems in Boston involved racial tensions and police corruption, not management techniques in the Police Department.
"If I'm giving a grade today in the area of management, maybe both Mickey Roache and I don't do very well," said Mr. Flynn, who was recently elected to a third term with a record 75 percent of the vote.. "But let me tell you, I give Mickey Roache an A-plus in the area of integrity and bringing together the people of the city of Boston racially."
Today's report found that "Commissioner Roache's personal integrity and honesty are exemplary." The commission also praised him for cooperating fully with a Federal investigation into corruption in the Boston police department in the mid-1980's. But the report said, "We found poor morale among the police force and a growing impatience in the community with business as usual."
It continued, "Commissioner Roache has failed to develop and articulate a shared vision or strategic plan to guide the department's operation. Instead, the department has adopted a purely reactive posture, and drifts from crisis to crisis."
 
'Turf Wars'
 The result has been several "divisive turf wars between different segments of the department," the report said.
The panel said the police department's handling of complaints from civilians was "particularly troubling." A study of 250 complaints made in 1989 and 1990 found that the Internal Affairs Department had upheld less than 6 percent of the charges, the commission found.
"Our study revealed an investigative and hearing process characterized by shoddy, halfhearted investigations, lengthy delays and inadequate documentation and record keeping," the report said, with the result that the process is "unfairly skewed against those bringing a complaint."
As a consequence of these policies, the report said, "there is a small group of problem officers," some with records of alleged physical abuse of citizens, who are responsible for many of the complaints.
The seven-member commission recommended the creation of a Community Appeals Board, with a majority of civilian members, to review police investigations of complaints. The Boston police and Mayor Flynn have long opposed such a board.
The panel also recommended that the Boston police immediately shift to a community-based policing strategy, in which officers get out of their patrol cars and become actively involved in neighborhoods to try to prevent young people from becoming criminals. Mr. Roache has said he has launched such an approach, but Mr. St. Clair today derided Mr. Roache's effort, saying, "There was no plan."
Today's report comes at a time when violent crime in Boston has dropped to its lowest level in six years, or roughly the period before the spread of crack cocaine. The city's murder rate fell 22.6 percent in 1991 and there was an ll percent decrease in rape and attempted rape. Overall, Boston has long had one of the lowest crime rates of any major city.

 BODY:

Job: A Circus
One Dream Theater
232 West Broadway
Manhattan
Through Feb. 2
 
 Conceived and directed by Elizabeth Swados; producing director, Wickham Boyle; clown routines created by Gabriel Barre, Mary Dino, Michael Gunst, Jeff Hess, Alan Mintz and Stephen Ringold; music by Ms. Swados; vocal arrangements by Ann Marie Milazzo, Cathy Porter and Michael Sottile; production stage manager, Tori Evans; set and costumes designed by Nephelie Andonyadis; lighting by Kristabelle Munson. Presented by Under One Roof.
WITH: Ms. Dino, Ms. Evans, Mr. Gunst, Mr. Hess, Ms. Milazzo, Mr. Mintz, Mr. Neiden, Paul O'Keefe, Mr. Ringold and Mr. Sottile.
 
Stories from the Old Testament have provided Elizabeth Swados with a mosaic of musical material, as in her "Haggadah" and "Jerusalem." For her new chamber musical, she has turned to the Book of Job, but instead of writing a dramatic oratorio she has created an informal clown show, with moments of audience participation. The result, "Job: A Circus," is a freewheeling cavalcade of songs and sight gags.
The idea is to approach Job as a Chaplinesque soul who endures a diversity of woes and never knows where the next slapstick or custard pie will come from. As the show stands, and as Job pratfalls, this is an up and down, fragmented affair. But it is light enough in spirit to justify its role as a family show, a brief entertainment with a moral but not too heavy a message.
As director, Ms. Swados has de-emphasized scenic design and given her company of energetic young actors free rein to improvise routines and to mime, juggle and tumble. Along with the music, the clowning is the most enjoyable aspect of the show.
With a ringlet of hair sprouting from his head, the show's Job, Stephen Ringold, looks like a tall Tintin. He is downcast, deadpan and undiscouraged. Wherever he turns, someone takes advantage of him, but, in keeping with his biblical origins, he remains a righteous man.
As the engaging ringmaster, Jeff Hess is a quick-thinking skirmisher who is unabashed about the more awkward episodes in the show. Alan Mintz is wry as a mock-sinister Satan who in this pompadoured version looks and sings like the ghost of Elvis. In keeping with the circus setting, God is the unseen Great Magician and the world is an improvisational vaudeville. In characteristic Swados fashion, the music is an eclectic blending of calypso, ballads, country and rap. Occasional liturgical strains are sung in Hebrew, with lively accompaniment on piano and guitar.
To expand the repertory of afflictions, Mr. Hess asks for the audience's assistance in bedeviling the put-upon protagonist. At Sunday's matinee, volunteers shunned the thought of fire and flood and suggested that Job be hit with a recession and be made to ride the New York subway. Both punishments were meted out by the actors with a fierceness that can only come from experience on the urban firing line.

HEADLINE: Push for Better Schools In Memphis Takes On Importance for Nation

SERIES: Memphis 2000: An occasional visit to a city working to change its public schools.

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Jan. 8

 BODY:
If President Bush's vision of the future of American schools has a shape, it is beginning to emerge in Memphis.
Memphis was the first major city to answer President Bush's call to become an "America 2000" community by drawing up a plan to fix its schools. Slowly and laboriously, parents, educators, business leaders and civil rights advocates are working to build sturdy coalitions for change. To win agreement, they have already had to jettison one of Mr. Bush's key planks -- public money for private schools -- and add several different goals to make Mr. Bush's plan their own. 
 How Memphis and the thousand or so other communities that so far have embraced the America 2000 challenge fare may help gauge whether the President's education strategy will inspire other Americans to improve their schools or will end as a futile public relations exercise.
With its high poverty and welfare-dependency rates and students who fall below national averages on test scores, Memphis mirrors the problems of urban school districts across the country.
"The reason Memphis is important is the possibility of teaching the nation just how this might work," said Ron Register, an urban anthropologist who heads a task force on parental involvement, one of eight task forces examining different educational problems with the aim of producing an education plan for Memphis schools by next fall.
 
Problems at the Start
 Although the campaign, dubbed "Memphis 2000," was only begun in July, its organizers have already had to confront several sensitive issues: how to involve both blacks and whites in a city with its share of racial tensions, how to counter the perception that this is a white Republican effort that offers high-sounding ideals but no money, and how to win agreement from people with different ideas of what is wrong with schools and how to change them.
The problems facing Memphis are stark -- and like many cities, social and economic ills are enmeshed with educational ones. Memphis has the highest percentage of people living in poverty and on welfare among cities with populations of more than 500,000, according to the Mayors of Memphis and neighboring Shelby County. Last year, Memphis 10th graders scored in the 36th percentile in reading and the 40th percentile in mathematics nationwide. Spending per pupil is $3,568, well below the national average of $5,237.
White parents have largely fled the public schools, leaving them 80 percent black, and, Memphis civil rights leaders say, even more vulnerable to budget cuts as a result. A growing number of taxpayers are elderly people on fixed incomes who regularly vote against more money for schools.
"Their sense is kids over there are drinking, smoking, sniffing and having sex, and are not interested in learning," said William N. Morris Jr., Mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis and provides much of the financing for the city's schools.
 
Met His Old Boss
 Memphis's latest attempt to tackle these problems began last April when Bill Gibbons, a prominent local lawyer, ran into his former boss, Lamar Alexander, now the United States Secretary of Education. When Mr. Alexander was Governor of Tennessee in the late 1970's and early 1980's, he placed Mr. Gibbons in charge of a huge Memphis jobs conference that helped revitalize the city economically, the way Mr. Alexander hopes America 2000 communities will revive American education. President Bush had just unveiled an education strategy that relied largely on local efforts, and Mr. Alexander suggested that Memphis join in.
Drawing on past experience with community organizing, Mr. Gibbons and other Memphis leaders set out to defuse possible political and racial tensions by seeking wide participation and adapting the goals of America 2000 to Memphis's needs and politics.
Mr. Gibbons, a Republican, recruited as co-leaders of Memphis 2000 a white businesswoman, Nancy E. Bogatin, an outspoken Democrat, and a black lawyer, Allan Wade, who is a political independent. They persuaded six Memphis businesses to donate $25,000 each and established a timetable. On July 23, Mr. Alexander flew to Memphis for an elaborate press conference on Memphis 2000.
But many remained skeptical, even hostile. "I think it was politically motivated that Memphis was the first site," said Willie Herenton, who is Memphis's first black Mayor and was Superintendent of Schools for 12 years. "I was then running for Mayor against a Republican incumbent. Everyone on that podium was all white, all male, and here Memphis is an 80 percent black school system. I saw it as a political farce which I was not going to endorse."
 
Local Goals Added
 Continuing suspicion among educators as well as local politicians prodded Memphis 2000's organizers to try to differentiate their effort from America 2000. Memphis added two local goals -- eliminating gaps in educational opportunities among children and fostering parental involvement -- to the six national education goals America 2000 communities are supposed to adopt.
These six goals include insuring that all students are healthy and intellectually stimulated enough to start school and that they leave school competent in five basic subjects, raising the high school graduation rate to 90 percent, making American students lead the world in mathematics and science, erasing adult illiteracy and making schools safe and drug-free.
To win over educators like Elsie Lewis Bailey, principal of Booker T. Washington High School, Mr. Gibbons pledged that Memphis 2000 would not endorse a crucial plank of the Bush platform -- school "choice" for private schools, a voucher-like program in which money could follow students to whatever school they chose, public or private.
These efforts mollified several people, including Mayor Herenton. "I'm willing to work with them as long as I can be convinced it is not business as usual, a public relations approach to addressing education reform where nothing happens," the Mayor said.
On Oct. 23, Memphis 2000's leaders convened a citywide educational symposium that drew more than 750 people. Now, in school-district office basements and public libraries, the task forces are embarking on the sometimes frustrating, sometimes electric process of defining what is wrong in Memphis and what to do about it.
The other night, three task forces with about 40 people each met and filled the walls of their meeting rooms with lists of problems. "Lack of real (proper) role models" and "too many students per teacher" were on one list at the task force on equalizing educational opportunities.
 
Trying to Be Honest
 Amid the unavoidable tedium, however, flashes of emotion broke through, as members of the racially mixed panels struggled to talk honestly about sensitive issues.
"We are so diverse, and people are shy about saying what they really feel about children of another race," said Carole Hall Hardeman, dean of the faculty at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis.
The participants in Mr. Register's task force on parental involvement spent much of the evening talking about the parents who were not there -- poor black parents -- and how to reach them. They plan to move the meetings to churches or housing projects, away from what Mr. Register called "white middle-class settings" where many parents may not feel comfortable.
Indeed, many blacks remain wary. "I talk to black kids and they say, that's some white honky middle-class deal," said Mr. Wade, the black lawyer who is a co-chairman of Memphis 2000. "You've got to get beyond that and say, 'You've got to do something.' "
The challenge for Memphis 2000 is to synthesize these diverse views into a coherent plan. Ask different people in Memphis and they give different reasons why the schools are struggling and offer different wish lists.
Johnnie B. Watson, Deputy Superintendent of Schools, wants better early childhood education, and more money for smaller classes and alternative schools for disruptive children. Stephanie Rodda, one of the few white parents who chose to enroll her children in public schools, believes the word has not gotten out that some of Memphis's 158 schools are good.
Janet Robbins, a fourth-grade teacher at Mrs. Rodda's children's school who is sharing a classroom with another teacher and 50 children while new classrooms are being built, says she needs parental involvement and community support even more than new buildings.
Mrs. Bailey, the high school principal, talks of students who stay home to take care of baby siblings because their mothers are on drugs, of poor academic skills and low motivation, and of teen-agers from housing projects with nowhere to go after school.
 
Is Racism the Problem?
 For Maxine Smith, the new president of the Memphis school board and the executive director of the Memphis branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the same sickness afflicts both Memphis and its schools. "Memphis is a very racist city," she said. "This is a neglected, underfunded system.
"We need early childhood and prenatal programs," she continued. "We've got to get parents involved. Over 70 of all black babies here are born to single parents. We have to address the needs of a deprived -- which has become a depraved -- population. I won't shy away from that. I think Memphis 2000 has the will to get it done."
But many of these efforts will cost money, another potentially divisive issue for Memphis 2000. Gov. Ned McWherter, a Democrat, has just proposed an income tax to finance education, and state legislators have fallen all over themselves repudiating the idea. Some members of Memphis 2000 strongly endorse it; others do not.
"The initial reaction to us was, 'A lot of talk and not much money,' " Mr. Gibbons said. "But we're never going to get any more money until we have an understandable plan in place that the public supports."
That task lies ahead, but Mr. Register believes Memphis 2000 has more chance of success than any previous effort, partly because the process crafted to develop the plan includes so many diverse voices, and partly because Memphis itself is changing. The city now has its first black Mayor, a new school board, a largely new City Council, and a new superintendent of schools starting this summer.
"If it does not happen now, when does it happen?" Mr. Register said.

Chevron to Cut Back At Big Texas Refinery

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Hurt by weak demand and low prices for natural gas and gasoline and rising costs for environmental regulations, the Chevron Corporation today announced a program to cut costs, including a plan to reduce or possibly end output at the Chevron refinery in Port Arthur, Tex. -- the company's biggest.
The decision follows moves last year by other large refiners like Shell and Amoco to sell or close refineries and suggests that the nation's gasoline refining capacity will fall by approximately 100,000 barrels a day, or about 4 percent, in coming years. 
 Michael Mayer, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company, said the cutbacks should bolster the poor profit margins of refiners even if the economy and gasoline demand do not improve.
Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron's chairman and chief executive, said: "Nobody is projecting any major, volumetric changes in refined products for this country in the next few years. Cost is one thing you have more control over than what the price of crude oil will be."
Chevron, based in San Francisco, said it would take an after-tax charge of $270 million in the fourth quarter of 1991 because of the cutbacks. Of that total, about $180 million is related to shedding a third of the refining capacity at the Port Arthur plant, or 100,000 barrels of crude oil a day. At least 500 people at the plant will be cut from the payroll.
The company said it would decide later this year whether to operate the refinery at lower capacity, seek a buyer or joint-venture partner or close the operation.
Another 2,000 jobs will be eliminated through a combination of sales of oil-and-gas reserves and other assets, and changes in operations and organization structure, the company said. Salaries of all nonunion employees will be frozen for at least three months, and fewer new employees will be added.
Most of the actions hasten a restructuring that Mr. Derr set in motion two years ago. In an interview, Mr. Derr said that nearly $1 billion in improvements necessary at the Port Arthur plant to meet new standards set by the amended Clean Air Act was "not a very appealing prospect."
Over all, the company faces more than $2 billion in costs to meet new environmental regulations over the next five years.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Chevron shares lost 50 cents today, closing at $68.375.

HEADLINE: Bad Loans Easing Grip On Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
It is too early to dance on banks' doorsteps, but recent earnings reports by several large banks suggest that the recession is loosening its grip on the Northeast.
While many banks in the region have been able to recover more quickly than the economy by sharply reducing interest rates paid on deposits and squeezing out other costs, they are also reporting fewer troubled loans, or at least a sharp slowdown in the growth of them. Troubled loans, those that are far behind in payments or are not expected to be repaid in full, doubled and tripled at many banks as the economy turned downward in 1990 and 1991. 
 The decline in such loans, in fact, was seen as one factor as one New England banking company, Shawmut National, ended merger talks with the Bank of Boston. [Page D14.]
 
More Lending Seen
 Gary Ciminero, the chief economist for the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, said yesterday that declines in banks' problems with bad loans would make them more willing to lend "and alleviate the credit crunch that exacerbated the region's economic downturn."
But he warned that it was too early to say that the recession was over.
Joel B. Alvord, the chairman of the Shawmut National Corporation, which owns the Connecticut National Bank, the largest in the state as well as a leading bank in Massachusetts, said he was "guardedly optimistic" that the region's economy would hit bottom in the first or second quarter of the year.
He said recent declines in interest rates and the anticipation of some tax cuts should "help turn consumer confidence upward."
Mr. Alvord noted that the deterioration in the region's economy had slowed to the extent that Shawmut would soon announce a significant decline in its most severely troubled loans and would earn more in the fourth quarter than the paltry $2.3 million earned in the third quarter.
The improvement is an important reason, he said, why Shawmut ended the talks with the Bank of Boston Corporation, which also said yesterday that it expected to annouce improved earnings and a decline in its troubled loans.
At Fleet/Norstar, the largest New England-based banking company, badly troubled loans and real estate held because of foreclosures rose only about $89 million, the smallest increase since the first quarter of 1989. Fleet's bad loans and foreclosed real estate are now four times as high as the end of 1989.
 
Bond Investments Pay Off
 Because of $222 million in profits from its bond investments, Fleet earned a profit of $35.2 million, or 22 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $58.8 million in the comparable quarter of 1990 and a profit of only $9 million in last year's third quarter.
Despite the $73 million after-tax cost of combining the failed Bank of New England with its other banks, Fleet earned $97.6 million, or 67 cents a share, in 1991, compared with a loss of $73.6 million in 1990.
Fleet's results were positive enough to cause its stock price to rise $3.375 a share, to $29.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Things appear to be bottoming, and in some areas, like Rhode Island, appear to be improving," said John W. Flynn, the chief financial officer.
At the Bank of New York Company, its fourth-quarter profits rose slightly, to $65.9 million, or 82 cents a share, compared with $65 million, also 82 cents a share. Badly delinquent loans and holdings of foreclosed real estate fell by $214 million from the third quarter, to $1.35 billion, as some loans improved and others were sold.
For the year, the Bank of New York earned only $122 million, or $1.28 a share, because of heavy loan losses earlier in the year, down from $308 million, or $3.98 a share, in 1990. Its stock rose $3 yesterday, to $36.625, on the Big Board.
 
First Fidelity Up
 In New Jersey, another state where the economic slump has caused heavy losses for many banks, the First Fidelity Bancorporation in Newark said its nonperforming assets fell by $42.9 million, to $928.9 million. The decline helped the company report a fourth-quarter profit of $57.8 million, or 85 cents a share, up 9 percent from $53 million, or 84 cents a share, a year ago.
For all of 1991, First Fidelity, the state's largest bank, earned $221.2 million, compared with a loss of $6.1 million in 1990.
"The economic recovery will obviously take longer and follow a more shallow curve than had been generally predicted," said Anthony P. Terracciano, the chairman. "But we also believe there will be increasing opportunities for good business as we progress through 1992."

HEADLINE: Robert B. McNee, Instrumental In Geography Theory, Dies at 69

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Robert B. McNee, a prominent geography professor who once headed the American Geographical Society, died Jan. 8 at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center. He was 69 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
He died of complications of lung cancer, his family said. 
 Dr. McNee helped expand the location theory of geography, which holds that things are where they are because of natural and manmade factors alike, including climate, topography, natural resources, transportation services and population. His research focused on international corporations' economic influence on the development of third-world nations.
He also studied urban development and in that role was a consultant to the Ford Foundation. He wrote numerous articles and several books, including "A Primer on Economic Geography" (Random House, 1971).
Born in Big Timber, Mont., he grew up there and in Spring Valley, Minn. He earned a bachelor's degree at Wayne State University and master's and doctoral degrees in geography at Syracuse University. He won a Fulbright fellowship.
He taught geography at City College in Manhattan from 1952 to 1963 and then went to the University of Cincinnati, where he was chairman of the geography department from 1963 to 1973, chairman of the faculty senate and faculty representative on the board of trustees.
He returned to Manhattan as director of the American Geographical Society from 1973 to 1976, a period of financial stress for the organization. Under a restructuring that he helped to plan, the society sold its headquarters on Audubon Terrace, closed its map department and transferred its library, considered one of the most important of its kind, to the University of Wisconsin.
After leaving the society, he went back to the University of Cincinnati where he taught until retiring in 1987.
He volunteered for years as a civil rights advocate for blacks, the homeless, women, the people of Appalachia and homosexuals. Late in his career he publicly acknowledged his own bisexuality, and some called him the honorary mayor of Cincinnati's gay and lesbian community.
Surviving are his wife, the former Doris Smithers, of Worthington, Ohio, from whom he was separated; two sons, Robert McNee of Westport, Conn., and William McNee of Old Greenwich, Conn.; a daughter, Margaret McNee Trikoupis of Worthington, Ohio; two stepsons, Douglas Outterson of Bettendorf, Iowa, and George Outterson of Chapel Hill, N.C., and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Southwestern Bell's Moves Pay Off

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
When the "Baby Bells" were created by the breakup of A.T.& T., Southwestern Bell won few friends on Wall Street by saying that it planned to stick to its knitting. Analysts favored the glowing talk of the other Baby Bells about opportunities in unregulated businesses.
In the following years, several of the seven Baby Bells stumbled badly in ventures ranging from real estate to computer retailing. Southwestern, meanwhile, demonstrated a knack for moving occasionally but boldly into more closely related businesses, like cellular telephones, paging and investments in overseas phone companies. Now, even though Baby Bell shares have risen handsomely, the former wallflower, Southwestern Bell, trades at an earnings multiple several points above the average for the group. 
 "They've taken some very good calculated risks," said Joel Gross, who follows the phone companies for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They do a good job of thinking things through and using their money judiciously."
 
A Prosperous Look
 Recently, the recession has dented profits, and the company is still burdened by the weight of its inherited bureaucracy. But a new 11-story computer center under construction next to the company's headquarters here in Missouri's tallest building is a prominent sign that the company is looking forward to continued growth.
Edward E. Whitacre Jr., Southwestern's chief executive, takes obvious delight in showing a visitor a more compact token of things to come: a prototype of a new pocket phone Southwestern is developing with Matsushita of Japan that will allow business executives to be reached at the same personal phone number whether they are wandering around their offices or driving in their cars.
"The time is coming when you won't be able to tell land lines from cellular service," said Mr. Whitacre, a lanky 50-year-old Texan who joined Southwestern in 1963, a year before completing his industrial engineering studies at Texas Tech. "I think it will happen fast."
Southwestern's most adventurous move came in 1986 when Mr. Whitacre's predecessor, Zane Barnes, stunned Wall Street by offering $1.4 billion to acquire the cellular and paging operations of the Metromedia Company. Analysts carped that Southwestern had overpaid by spending nearly $50 for each potential cellular customer. Southwestern proved the analysts wrong as prices for prime territories soared. Although the market has recently weakened, analysts say that Southwestern's properties would fetch more than $300 per potential customer today. Moreover, Southwestern proved more adept than others at turning the growth of cellular services into profits.
Analysts now recognize that Southwestern saw the cellular market as a series of niches requiring a wide variety of marketing plans, products and distribution channels. By the third quarter of last year, it had signed up about 2.5 percent of its potential customers, compared with an average of less than 1.8 percent for the other Baby Bells. More recently, the company has been praised for acquiring rights to rural areas adjacent to its cellular service zones so that cellular phone customers traveling from Chicago to St. Louis, for example, will be customers of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems Inc. for most of the trip.
 
Invests in Mexico
 In 1990, Mr. Whitacre engineered Southwestern's second diversification coup. The company joined forces with a consortium of Mexican businesses and France Telecom to purchase a controlling interest in Mexico's national phone company. Southwestern emerged with a 5 percent stake for $486 million. It recently exercised an option to double that stake for $467 million.
Once again, analysts initially felt that Southwestern had overpaid. But the stock price of Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, has soared since the initial investment, giving Southwestern a paper profit of about $1.67 billion. Better still, Telmex started contributing to actual profits sooner than expected because Southwestern's share of its earnings exceeded the costs of financing the deal within the first year. Now Southwestern is looking to participate in the privatization of other national phone companies.
"The challenge is to find good partners," said Thomas M. Barry, senior vice president in charge of strategic planning. "It's a management issue rather than a technology issue."
Southwestern's business is still concentrated in regulated local and interstate phone services for 9.3 million customers in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri. But it is also pulling in growing profits from cellular operations in distant cities, including Chicago, Washington and Boston; paging services in most of the nation's largest cities, and its investment in Telmex. Other subsidiaries market residential and business phone equipment, publish directories, print products ranging from directories to greeting cards and operate cable television in Britain.
 
A Cautious Approach
 The company expects 30 percent of earnings to be from unregulated businesses by 1993, and possibly more than 50 percent by 1997, Mr. Barry said. "We have lots of opportunities outside the five-state area," he said.
It would be unlike Southwestern, though, to be impetuous in pursuing such opportunities. Southwestern executives say they have broadened the company's definition of its core business but they still favor a cautious approach to diversification. And the company has been quick to pull the plug on unsuccessful new ventures, like its ill-fated effort to compete with other Baby Bells by publishing Yellow Page directories nationwide and its unprofitable attempt to develop a special "Silver Page" directory with advertising for the elderly.
The most important reason to move cautiously, Mr. Whitacre said, is that the weak economy is pinching profits. So are new rate structures in states that account for 85 percent of the company's phone business. Under these "incentive" plans, Southwestern has agreed to reduce charges for the right to higher profits in the future if it can generate savings from new technology and cost-cutting measures. Like the other Baby Bells, Southwestern also worries that regulators will not allow it to adjust pricing and other services to respond to a host of new competitors, ranging from national start-up companies like Metropolitan Fiber Systems to local power companies. The Baby Bells say that the new entrants skim off the most lucrative local phone business without extending their state-of-the-art systems to residences.
 
Complaint on Regulators
 "Regulators want to keep subsidies for residential users but they want competition, too," Mr. Barry said. "It's not economically and technologically possible to do both, but the regulators won't accept that."
Operating profits will be up when Southwestern reports 1991 results next month, but the company might report its first decline in net income. The meager operating gains may not be enough to compensate for an $80.7 million special charge to cover the costs last spring of substituting new lower-interest debt for older borrowings, and the yet-to-be-announced costs of an early retirement program that will eliminate more than 3,000 of 16,000 management positions.
Still, Southwestern executives are upbeat. Many of this year's costs are laying the groundwork for bigger profits in the future, and the recession has yet to come close to the severity of the oil bust they rode out in Oklahoma and Texas in the mid-1980's, at the same time that
a grain glut hurt the economies of Kansas and Missouri. Mr. Whitacre says that the worst of the employee cutbacks are done, but that he still needs to chop away at "the level of bureaucracy."

HEADLINE: Food Stamp Enrollment Continues Sharp Rise, U.S. Agency Reports

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The number of Americans receiving food stamps continues to grow sharply, Federal figures show, and more than half the children who eat school lunches receive them free or at reduced prices.
According to the Agriculture Department's latest figures, enrollment in the food stamp program totaled 24.16 million people in October, up 400,000 from a month earlier and up 3.23 million from a year earlier. 
 It was the seventh time in eight months that an enrollment record was set for the program, which reaches nearly 1 in 10 Americans.
The number of children eating a free or reduced-price school lunch at Government expense also continued to rise in October. There were 12.7 million children from impoverished or low-income families receiving the lunches, as against 12.2 million in October 1990.
The department said that 44.1 percent of the 24.9 million school lunches served in October were free and that 7.1 percent were sold at a reduced price. A year earlier, 42 percent of the lunches were free and 7.4 percent were at reduced price.
About 75 percent of elementary school pupils, 64 percent of junior high students and 50 percent of high school students participate in the school lunch program. To qualify for a free lunch, annual income for a family of four cannot exceed $16,510; to qualify for a reduced-price meal, a family's income cannot exceed $23,495.
Annual net income cannot exceed $13,404 for a family of four to qualify for food stamps.
Representative Tony P. Hall, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, said Tuesday that the surging enrollment in the Federally financed programs was "the monthly body count of the recession."
A spokesman for the Food and Nutrition Service, the Agriculture Department agency that administers the programs, said the increase in people in the food stamp program could be attributed to changes that make it more accessible to immigrants and others as well as to the slumping economy.
Total Federal spending on the program in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was $18.8 billion, while this year's budget is $22.3 billion. The total excludes state costs. The cost of the school lunch program rose to $526 million in October 1991 from $491 million in October 1990.

HEADLINE: For Arizonans, the Political Circus Is Back in Town

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Jan. 10

 BODY:
In this state where politics has become theater, the latest act stars the new Governor, J. Fife Symington 3d, who faces a Federal lawsuit for his role in a failed savings and loan.
After a four-year run of political embarrassments, said a prominent poll taker, Earl de Berge, "I think people have reached the point where they are not surprised by anything, and the anti-incumbency mood is as deep as I've seen it in 25 years." 
 Mr. Symington was among 12 former directors of a Phoenix savings and loan accused of negligence and self-dealing in a $140 million lawsuit filed last month by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency in charge of the savings and loan bailout.
The Republican Governor, a successful 46-year-old developer who has been in office less than a year, is fighting back, asserting his innocence, accusing the Government of "Gestapo-like tactics" and threatening to investigate the Federal agency right back.
 
Attacking the Government
 "Besides setting the record straight, we are going to call to account the leakers and liars who abused the process," Mr. Symington said at a news conference after the suit was filed. "The Government bureaucrats responsible for this injustice must pay a price for their recklessness."
Many Arizonans sat back to watch the show. "We don't need soap operas," Louis Rhodes, executive director of the Arizona chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said recently. "We just read the morning papers and turn on the talk shows."
Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, whose term of office in the early 1980's preceded the state's run of bad luck, said this attitude was part of a vicious cycle of cause and effect that had degraded the quality of government.
"When people don't take government seriously, when society has a sort of caricaturist view of government, it tends to be self fulfilling," he said. "There is a sense that government is always bad and politicians are always bad, and maybe the best way to get rid of government is to elect a bunch of people who are circus performers."
 
Years of Entertainment
 Arizonans have had more than their share of eye-opening political entertainment in recent years, beginning with the impeachment of Mr. Babbitt's successor, Evan Mecham, in 1988 for financial irregularities. Mr. Mecham became the first American governor in 59 years to be impeached and removed from office.
A series of political embarrassments followed.
Both the state's United States Senators, Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican, were criticized by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics last year after a long and highly publicized investigation into their intervention with regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr. and his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
Early last year, eight state legislators were indicted for receiving bribes in a sting operation in which they were shown in a videotape joking cynically about government and catching wads of cash that were tossed to them.
And Arizona continues to suffer embarrassment and loss of sports and convention revenue for remaining the only state not to have enacted a paid holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Mr. Symington is not generally viewed as one of the "circus performers" described by Mr. Babbitt. But some analysts say his situation has simply confirmed to many Arizonans that if something can go wrong in politics, sooner or later it will.
"I've looked around the country and I've seen bizarre politics everywhere," said Rob Melnick, director of the Morrison Institute for Public Policy, an independent policy research group associated with Arizona State University.
"But we had one individual here who was so extraordinary, a truly remarkably crazy individual," Mr. Melnick said of Mr. Mecham, "and his legacy has left a spotlight on what would otherwise be normally weird political behavior and made it seem abnormally weird."
Mr. Melnick noted that with a new session of the Legislature opening this week and with a budget debate and legislative reapportionment on the menu the public was likely to be treated once again to the less pretty side of government.
Although Mr. Symington has met with difficulties in his attempt to run government like a business, he is generally described as a bright leader whose political success may ultimately hinge less on his legal problems than on his navigation of the hardship's of the recession.
In the lawsuit against former officers and directors of the Southwest Savings and Loan Association, Federal regulators accuse Mr. Symington of improperly investing $8 million in development fees from a real estate deal.
"If Fife Symington does a good job as Governor of the State of Arizona and can put some of this personal stuff off to the side and let it take care of itself, the people will know that and appreciate that," said Burton Barr, a former majority leader in the state House of Representatives who is now a political consultant.
Mr. Symington has also taken a strong position in favor of instituting a holiday to honor Dr. King, which some analysts say is likely to help his political standing. Creation of a holiday was defeated by voters last fall, but will be on the ballot again this November.
"I think it's premature to write his obituary," Mr. Babbitt said of the Governor, who took office last March and does not face re-election until 1994.
 
Bribery Case in Limelight
 For one thing, a year-old legislative sting scandal, known as Azscam, is set to recapture some of the limelight with the upcoming trial of Senator Carolyn Walker, a Phoenix Democrat. She is one of the legislators who was displayed on videotape in what the authorities say was accepting a bribe from a con man working as an agent for the police. The agent said he was seeking legislation to allow him to open a casino.
While the other seven legislators pleaded guilty and were removed from the Legislature, Ms. Walker has fought the charges, saying she would have voted to legalize casino gambling with or without a bribe.
Nevertheless, she offered one of the highlights of the videotaped civics lesson when she was shown leaning forward to pocket some cash and saying, "We all have our prices." She is accused of taking $25,880 in bribes.
After the Azscam embarrassment, a number of political analysts here voiced their admiration for the group of new legislators who have replaced those removed from office.
All of these new legislators will be up for election this year. But Mr. Babbitt noted that they were not the product of an election but were appointed by county commissioners.
"From the left to the right, political observers see the new crop as an outstanding bunch," Mr. Babbitt said. "It's almost as if it's the final proof of the failure of elected politics."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Down in Hectic Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell still lower in hectic, volatile trading yesterday.
According to market participants, money managers who chose not to realize profits at the end of last year are now selling securities. Some of those accounts are moving a percentage of their fixed-income portfolio into German assets, they said. German interest rates are high relative to American rates, and with Germany appearing to be heading toward recession, money managers are expecting a rally in the German bond market. 
 In addition to profit taking, traders said that talk about a budding economic recovery and what policy makers in Washington might do to spur growth continued to circulate through the debt market. That sort of speculation provided an additional incentive to sell Treasury securities, they said.
 
'Taking Profits, Not Chances'
 "People are taking profits and not taking chances," said Jay Goldinger, a principal at Capital Insight, a bond brokerage firm based in Beverly Hills, Calif. "Right now, the market is a little bit panicked."
The continued rise in the stock market, and particularly in the share prices of major money-center banks, is being seen by some traders as indicating that recovery may not be far off and that the worst of the "credit crunch" may be over.
"Citibank has really been trampled, and now its stock is up about 80 percent from the lows," the trader said. "That tells me the stock market seems to believe the pressure on the financial system is off."
The flow of new corporate debt issues remained strong yesterday, and market participants said the need remained to cover corporate positions by selling Treasury issues.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 1051/32 late yesterday, down 13/32 , to yield 7.57 percent, compared with 7.53 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 1/8, down 1/4 point, to yield 7.05 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 9723/32 , down 5/32 , to yield 6.79 percent.
Late in the session the Treasury announced it would sell $13.75 billion worth of new two-year notes on Jan. 22 and $9.25 billion worth of new five-year securities on Jan. 23.
In when-issued trading following the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.09 percent. The five-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.39 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to up slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.80 percent in late trading, unchanged from late Tuesday. Six-month bill rates rose by 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to a late rate of 3.89 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.00 percent.
 
Rhone-Poulenc Offering
 Among the corporate debt securities priced yesterday was the first offering in American financial markets for Rhone-Poulenc S.A..

HEADLINE: Dow Up 12.30 as Records Keep Tumbling

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Records kept coming yesterday in the stock market in a rush of trading that made the session one of Wall Street's busiest ever. A day after a 60-point surge, the Dow Jones industrial average plowed ahead, gaining 12.30 points more, to 3,258.50, its ninth record in 13 days. And other indexes kept rewriting their records as well.
The engine driving this heady advance apparently remains the same, and remains potent: a combination of low interest rates and a strong belief that the economy is recovering. 
 "The real nut came when depositors at the banks had to start accepting less than 4 percent," said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president and head of stock index futures trading for Shearson Lehman Brothers.
 
Early Drop Erased
 Prices fell earlier, but those losses were quickly erased, with some analysts saying the early decline may have pulled the market back enough to attract investors for yet another advance.
He called the market's performance "unbelievable," as the money continued to pour into equity mutual funds from banks and certificates of deposit rolling over.
Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was a bustling 312.8 million shares, the 13th-busiest day ever. No. 12 was Dec. 20, when 313.8 million shares changed hands the day after the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate one full percentage point. Tuesday's volume was 265.9 million shares. Gainers held a wide lead over losing issues, 1,153 to 652.
Analysts said volatile trading was characterized by a shift of cash into cyclical stocks from defensive stocks as investors continued to bet on an economic recovery.
"There is a tremendous amount of portfolio realignment being done by institutions who are positioning themselves to take advantage of an economic recovery," Mr. Grennan said.
One group of stocks hit particularly hard yesterday were the pharmaceuticals. "Selling was so frenzied in the pharmaceuticals that it smacked of speculation that the economy will turn the corner," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research for Janney, Montgomery Scott. A strong dollar has also hurt these stocks since it has a negative impact on foreign currency translation of revenue from overseas.
Merck fell 4, to 156 1/8; Johnson & Johnson was down 5 1/4, to 108 3/8; Pfizer fell 4 1/8, to 79 3/8; Syntex was down 2 7/8, to 51 1/4, and Glaxo Holdings was down 1 1/8, to 32 3/4.
Some of the key cyclicals benefiting from the shift included the Aluminum Company of America, whose shares jumped in spite of lower earnings. Traders said investors took the company's performance during the sharp recession as a harbinger of strong improvement in case of an economic upturn. The stock rose 4 5/8, to 67 1/8. Others included I.B.M., up 3, to 95 3/8; International Paper, up 2 1/2, to 72 1/8; Caterpillar, up 2 1/2, to 45 1/8, and Walt Disney, up 2 1/2, to 133 1/4.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.33 point to make its new high of 420.77. The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.67 points to finish at 414.30, also a high.
Strength in secondary stocks pushed the Nasdaq index up 5.07 points, to a new high of 630.82, as the Russell 2,000 rose 0.96 to a new high of its own, 204.29. The Big Board composite, not to be outdone, rose 0.28 point, to a record 231.85.
"The market's inability to immediately follow up Tuesday's strong advance with a strong opening should not be surprising," said Ricky Harrington, director of equity investments for Marion Bass Securities. "During the last few years a gradual change has taken place in the market. Rallies that were once fueled by small investors are now dominated by large institutions and they can accomplish what they have to do in one session."

HEADLINE: Iraqis Could Pose a Threat Soon, C.I.A. Chief Says

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein could rebuild Iraq's ability to make nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and its ballistic missile program within a few years, Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, said today.
The timing of Mr. Gates's testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, on the eve of the first anniversary of the start of the Persian Gulf war, may have been coincidental. But the message was clear: Despite allied success in damaging Iraq's special weapons programs, the country, he said, "is still a great challenge" to nations and organizations that have attempted to disarm it. 
 "In our opinion Iraq will remain a primary proliferation threat at least as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power," Mr. Gates said. He added that "the cadre of scientists and engineers trained for these programs will be able to reconstitute any dormant program rapidly."
Mr. Gates's bleak assessment provided a rationale for continuing stringent economic sanctions against Iraq and intrusive inspections by the United Nations, which, he said, will severely hamper the country's efforts to rebuild its weapons programs. But it also implicitly gave weight to criticism of the Bush Administration for failing to achieve a number of American goals of the Persian Gulf War, including the total destruction of Mr. Hussein's ability to rebuild his weapons arsenal.
Almost a year ago, President Bush proudly told the American people that allied bombers had "put Saddam out of the nuclear-bomb-building business for a long time to come." Since then, teams of United Nations inspectors uncovered secret nuclear installations, programs and equipment.
By expressing his views so openly, Mr. Gates may have been seeking in part to address and rebut criticism raised in his stormy confirmation hearings that he had slanted intelligence to please his bosses.
His testimony also tended to support the creation a few months ago of the Central Intelligence Agency's Non-Proliferation Center, which is charged with tracking the sale, export and production of weapons of mass destruction.
In a wide-ranging overview of weapons proliferation problems, Mr. Gates said Iraq is believed to possess "several hundred" Scud missiles and a substantial quantity of production equipment to make both Scud and Condor missiles. During questioning by Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the committee, he said, "We're having some difficulty finding them."
Mr. Gates also told Senator Glenn, the only member of the committee present during the hearing, that because Iraq had hidden critical equipment for making biological weapons, it could begin new production in a matter of weeks once sanctions were lifted. Iraq could produce "modest quantities of chemical agents" almost immediately and could recover its pre-war capability in a year or more, he said.
As for Iraq's nuclear weapons program, Mr. Gates said much of the infrastructure for the production of weapons-grade materials must be rebuilt before Iraq can produce nuclear weapons. But he added, "We measure the time required in a few, rather than many, years."
In other testimony, Mr. Gates told Senator Glenn that the intelligence community could not corroborate reports that nuclear, chemical and biological weapons experts and military officials from the former Soviet Union had begun to sell their services abroad. But he added that the possibility of a nuclear "brain drain" was more serious than the possibility of seepage of nuclear-related materials.
Reflecting the conclusions of a recent classified report prepared by the C.I.A. and other intelligence bureaus and agencies, he predicted that countries like Cuba, India, Syria, Egypt and Algeria, which collaborated extensively with Soviet science in the 1980's, were "most likely to have the contacts and resident scientists to assist emigrating Soviets.
Mr. Gates also described what he called Iran's "across-the-board effort" to develop its military and defense industries.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Both Kerreys Searching For Campaign Strategy

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 15

 BODY:
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska strides out onto an empty ice rink, drapes his elbow over a hockey net and gazes earnestly at the camera.
"What's happening in the world economy is like a hockey game," he says, "where others guard their goal to keep our products out, while we leave our net open. 
 "We're becoming a low-wage nation, and all George Bush does is go to Japan and beg for a few concessions," Mr. Kerrey continues. "I'm Bob Kerrey, and if I'm President, the time for begging is through."
This is the new Bob Kerrey: direct, plain speaking, politely pugnacious. New Hampshire voters are meeting this Bob Kerrey through a television advertising campaign that started on Friday and has already, even advisers to other candidates say, perceptibly lifted the Senator's standing.
This is not, however, the same Bob Kerrey whom New Hampshire voters are meeting when they go to hear the candidate at a local high school. That Bob Kerrey is still the old Bob Kerrey: quirky, indirect and diffident.
Earlier this month, Mr. Kerrey hired a new campaign director and a new media team to impose a sense of direction on a campaign that seemed to be wandering. Since then the campaign, as evidenced by the television spots, has indeed begun to plot a new course. But the candidate, it seems, does not necessarily intend to follow it. And with just five weeks to go before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Kerrey and his advisers still seem to be struggling to find a strategy they all can live with.
"I like the fact that he's not some programmed Ken doll that you can just wind up and send out there," one adviser to Mr. Kerrey said. "But living with the consequences of that is tough."
The difficulty of reconciling who Mr. Kerrey is with the candidate his advisers would like to project is a reflection of the same idiosyncrasies that have made the Senator alternately the darling and the disappointment of the Democratic primary season.
Mr. Kerrey did not set out to be a career politician; he was a businessman who was elected Governor of Nebraska and then Senator without having served any of the apprenticeships usually required for such posts. His biography, including his heroic service in Vietnam, made him seem the perfect candidate for a country openly disgusted with professional politics.
 
Not Afraid of Unpopular Stands
 In the campaign, Mr. Kerrey has put his apparent ambivalence toward politics to good use as a sign that he is not afraid to take unpopular stands for the good of the country.
"I'm not concerned about Bob Kerrey's political career," he said in response to questions about a recent poll. "I'm concerned about the economic status of the United States of America. We're going to have to be bold and we're going to have to be courageous. We're going to have to come politically prepared to risk having polling data show that we're flat."
But political analysts and even associates of Mr. Kerrey say that his unconventional career has prompted him to place too much confidence in the appeal of an independent personality. "That personal appeal has obviously been at the core of his success so far," said Ann Lewis, a political consultant based in Boston. "But it doesn't translate to the Presidential campaign."
At first, Ms. Lewis said, Mr. Kerrey was plagued by the perception that he had not lived up to his resume. Now, she said, he faced the problem of being measured against his television spots. "The question still is, can he in person live up to what people know and hear about him?" she said.
Before arriving at the advertisements Mr. Kerrey now has on television, the campaign's original media consultant, Joe Rothstein, shot almost a dozen commercials, most of them showing the candidate talking with New Hampshire voters. Several advisers saw the spots as too fuzzy for a campaign that was already being criticized for a lack of focus, and they successfully urged Mr. Kerrey to reject them.
 
Quoting From Ads
 The new commercials were shot by Doak, Shrum, Harris, Sherman & Donilon, a media consulting firm that Mr. Kerrey, after much agonizing, hired to replace Mr. Rothstein. The new advertisements -- in addition to the hockey spot, there is one on national health insurance -- were shot after Mr. Kerrey had met with his new consultants for just a few hours. They were on the air within two days.
Mr. Kerrey seems genuinely enamored of his advertisements, so much so, in fact, that he began to quote from them in a recent interview. "We've got to look Japan in the eye and say what's going on in the world economy is like a hockey game," he told an interviewer on WMUR-TV, a Manchester station. "They're blocking their markets while we've got ours wide open."
But in person, the Senator remains much more complicated and more distant than the straightforward, aggressive politician who appears on television. Talking to a group of workers here on Tuesday, Mr. Kerrey spoke not about getting tough with Japan, but about "the urgent need in America to develop an industrial policy that expresses a preference for high value-added jobs." His prescription for the economy includes several new agencies with bureaucratic-sounding names, like the Industrial Extension Service, and a five-year plan to support what he calls "generic technologies."
At this point it is unclear how much Mr. Kerrey's new campaign team, including his new manager, Tad Devine, will try to change the candidate's style on the stump. So far, most of the candidate's top advisers have remained in Washington while he has been traveling around New Hampshire. And those who have known Mr. Kerrey for many years warn that he is not likely to submit to handlers who want to tinker with his persona.
"What has worked for him politically is spontaneous combustion," one adviser said. "He doesn't want to be slick."

HEADLINE: Boy Is Raped and Neighbors Ponder the Horror

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
In all the fear and confusion felt by parents and neighbors who learned that an 11-year-old boy was abducted and raped at 8 A.M. on Tuesday on West 77th Street and that a man with H.I.V. had been charged, there were really only two gut reactions. Some people tried to reassure themselves that so horrible a crime in their quiet gentrified neighborhood was aberrational. Others talked of moving out of town. All agreed that the incident was any parent's worst nightmare.
"What is the magic age at which you can envision letting your child go to school by himself?" said Allan Ripp, whose 6-year-old attends Public School 87, next to Intermediate School 44, the victim's school on West 77th Street. "God, this isn't about our schools, this is about what is happening in this city." 
 What happened in Mr. Ripp's neighborhood was a crime that combined some of the most horrifying elements of city life. It occurred while New York City was already at fever pitch over a series of race-baiting attacks on children, including an incident in which the faces of black and Hispanic children were smeared with white liquids and a 15-year-old was raped by two black men, who, she said, told her that they attacked her because she was "white and perfect."
While parents and children on a genteel block of the Upper West Side grappled with the 11-year-old's kidnapping and his exposure to the AIDS virus, gay groups in the city expressed concern that the suspect's right to confidentiality about his infection had been violated by the police.
The police said the boy was walking by himself to I.S. 44 between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues, when an unemployed 27-year-old, Troy A. Rivera, grabbed and forced him into Mr. Rivera's apartment at 172 West 77th Street, a brick apartment building a few doors west of the school.
The District Attorney's complaint laid out the child's ordeal in chillingly plain words. "The defendant told the informant to take off his clothes and threatened to beat him if he did not," the statement said. "Informant refused and defendant forcibly removed the informant's clothes and his own clothes."
The complaint says that Mr. Rivera ordered the child to perform oral sex on him and that when the child refused, Mr. Rivera threw him on the bed and raped him. Afterward, when Mr. Rivera went to the bathroom, the victim gathered his clothes and ran to his school. Officials there sent him to the Roosevelt Hospital emergency room and contacted the police.
District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau charged Mr. Rivera with second-degree kidnapping and first- and second-degree sodomy. A spokesman for the Mr. Morgenthau, Gerald McKelvey, said the prosecutor was still investigating whether to file additional charges "relating to his knowingly exposing the child to the H.I.V. virus."
Several states have enacted laws making such an act a crime. New York has not.
 
Risk of Infection Low
 The risk of contracting the virus that causes AIDS after one exposure is low, but is impossible to calculate accurately, experts said yesterday. A spokesman for the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, John Taylor, said that in cases of a one-time contact during anal intercourse between men "the risk of transmission ranges from 1 in 19 to 1 in 50."
A seventh grader at I.S. 44, Meghan Andrews, 12, said she used to complain to her father that she was too old to be walked to her bus stop, but not any more. "I'm scared," she said outside the school building. "I feel a lot different. I'm never going to walk alone again."
Parents felt just as helpless. "We have been talking about moving out of the city for quite a while," said Keiko Narahashi, a mother of two whose eldest child attends P.S. 87. "When they're young you can be on top of them all the time, but not when they are older."
After his arrest, the police revealed that Mr. Rivera had told them that he had AIDS. The police did not test him, but said they would most likely subpoena his medical records.
"How did the police learn he was H.I.V. positive, and why did they release it?" asked William K. Dobbs, a lawyer and member of Act Up, a group that lobbies for AIDS patients' rights. "I am concerned about sensationalism and homophobia in the press coverage and the prosecution."
Capt. William K. Rowe of the Manhattan detective bureau said a friend of the suspect who had been present at the arrest told the police that Mr. Rivera was H.I.V. positive. Based on that information and officers' observations of "an awful lot of prescription drugs in his apartment, literally 30 to 40 bottles, all made out in his name," Captain Rowe asked Mr. Rivera whether he was H.I.V. positive.
Captain Rowe said Mr. Rivera had said yes and said that the disease was diagnosed in 1987, while he was in prison. Captain Rowe said Mr. Rivera had volunteered that he has full-blown AIDS. "I said, 'What is your condition now?' " Captain Rowe recounted. "He said, 'Not too good.' He said he had problems with his chest and had other ailments. He said he had herpes and things of that nature.
"He told me he had a lot of sexual encounters with male teen-agers. I inquired how old they were. He said 17 and above."
 
Paroled in November 1990

 Mr. Rivera has two convictions. He was arrested in Manhattan in 1980 and charged with attempted grand larceny. He pleaded to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct and served no prison time. In 1982, Mr. Rivera was arrested again. He was charged with sodomy and robbery with injury. He pleaded guilty to the robbery charge and was sentenced in 1984. He served six years of his 6-to-18-year sentence and was paroled in November 1990.
A neighbor in Mr. Rivera's building who insisted on anonymity said he helped Mr. Rivera find his apartment last summer. The neighbor said he saw a note from Mr. Rivera saying he was homeless and had AIDS on a bulletin board at the Gay Men's Health Crisis. The neighbor said he responded to the note and put Mr. Rivera in contact with the broker of the apartment. The neighbor said that Mr. Rivera's $850-a-month rent was being paid with the assistance of the City Human Resource Administration's division of AIDS services and that Mr. Rivera was in touch with a caseworker there.
Parole officials confirmed that the welfare agency was giving Mr. Rivera rental assistance.
The neighbor also said Mr. Rivera continually took young male children to his apartment and estimated their ages to be 14 and 15, but said they never appeared as young as 11.
 
'They Looked Embarrassed'
 "They didn't look like they were there forcibly," the neighbor said. "But they looked embarrassed. They wouldn't look at you."
The neighbor said he called the police four times in the summer with his concerns about the boys and gave the police Mr. Rivera's name. He declined, however, to give the police his own name and said he was told that an adult's being seen with young boys was, in and of itself, not a crime.
Asked about the neighbor's account, Captain Rowe said, "I don't have any knowledge of the calls coming in previously."
Mr. Rivera has seen his parole officer 13 times since the end of September, officials said, and there was no indication that he had violated his parole before Tuesday.
The morning after the rape, school officials ordered uniformed guards to patrol the block around the school and tried to deal with the rape.
"They were asking if the boy was now H.I.V. positive," Meghan Andrews, said of her classmates in a sex-education class yesterday morning. They did not receive an answer.
"We are sort of pleading ignorance on the H.I.V. questions," said Steven Siegelbaum, director of the Computer School, a magnet school in the I.S. 44 building. "We don't want to fan the flames."

HEADLINE: METRO-NORTH JOURNAL;
Suddenly, Travelers at Grand Central Miss a Funky Old Friend

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
It wasn't B. Altman or the Horn & Hardart Automat, both major landmarks recently vanished from the New York retail firmament.
But for thousands of commuters who passed the Commuter Book Centre in Grand Central Terminal day after day, its sudden disappearance has left perhaps as great a void. 
 The oldest retail establishment in the terminal -- there since 1961 -- the bookshop had nothing in common with antiseptic chain bookstores. For one thing, the staff seemed to know a lot about books. The selection was eclectic and broad, straying far from the trashy novel and best seller. And the volumes were often in the wrong place on the shelves, and that made for good browsing.
Over the years many commuters had worked the store into their daily routines. Metro-North riders not only went there to pick up a good read for the trip home to Westchester County or Connecticut; they depended on the cluttered aisles as an oasis amid the sometimes menacing atmosphere of the terminal.
"In Grand Central, there were two things you could do if you missed your train and were waiting for another," said Harold Holzer, a commuter from Rye. "You could go to the Commuter bookstore and browse or you could dodge the people at Grand Central who weren't waiting for a train.
"It was a haven, a literary haven," added Mr. Holzer, executive vice president of the state's Urban Development Corporation.
City residents who use the subways were also hooked on the store's raffish charm -- and equally dismayed when it closed without warning on New Year's Eve.
"I am absolutely stunned," said Marge Baxter, a Chelsea resident who works for a midtown outplacement firm. She paused in front of the store's papered-over windows, her face broadcasting bewilderment.
"I spent 20 bucks a week there for three years," she said. "I knew where all the books were. I got a Latin dictionary for my son there, for God's sake."
Perhaps most stunned of all were officials of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. The owner of the bookstore, Marvin Weiss, owed Metro-North a year's worth of rent, or $182,000. Most of that applied to the bookstore, but some was for two other stores at the terminal, a card shop and a sporting goods store.
The lease for all three stores, on the upper level near the corner of 42d Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, had been in Mr. Weiss's name for 30 years. All closed for good on New Year's Eve without any notice to customers or to Metro-North.
A Metro-North spokeswoman, Marjorie Anders, said the railroad did not know where Mr. Weiss is. A collection agency is trying to find him so Metro-North can sue for the unpaid rent.
"They took all the stock of value -- all the hardcovers," Ms. Anders said. Still in the store are some greeting cards and paperbacks whose covers were ripped off, apparently so they could be sent to wholesalers for refunds. Some empty champagne bottles were left behind, too: vestiges, perhaps, of a very private going-out-of-business celebration.
Oddly, the store appeared to be doing a handsome business. Richard Hollender, a 46-year-old Scarsdale resident who had bought the poetry of Frost and Coleridge there, never imagined it to be in financial straits. "With the economy the way it is, however, I shouldn't be surprised," he said. Metro-North is seeking a new tenant for the store.
Patrons say they will most remember the store's character and convenience, two traits that seldom intersect these days.
Al Sulenski liked the convenience. "Sometimes you'd need a card to take home for an occasion you forgot about, like an anniversary or birthday," Mr. Sulenski said.
Gerald Paul, a partner in the law firm of Flemming, Zulack & Williamson and a Rye resident, liked the character.
"The place had a certain homeyness," he said. "The aisles were impossibly narrow. The signs for fiction and biography looked like a fourth-grade class project. There weren't a lot of staff people walking around wearing badges with their names on them."
Many commuters now wonder where they'll bide the minutes till the next train. "I don't know what I'll do," said Max Friedman, a pharmaceutical company executive who commutes from Larchmont. "I guess I'll wait in Zaro's and eat bagels and just get fat instead of getting smart."

The Commuter Book Centre in Grand Central Terminal closed on New Year's Eve. (Ed Quinn for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: New Sanitation Chief Hopes To Push Recycling Business

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Emily Lloyd, who will become New York City's Sanitation Commissioner next month, said yesterday that she hoped to develop new recycling markets that would attract new businesses and jobs to New York City and to encourage communities and businesses to share in keeping the city's streets and sidewalks clean.
Ms. Lloyd, the chief business strategist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, will be inheriting an agency racked by budget cuts that have savaged the city's recycling, street cleaning and dumping enforcement programs. But Ms. Lloyd, 46 years old, who is also an expert on transportation and environmental issues, expressed optimism yesterday that the sanitation agency would find new ways to manage the city's mounting waste problems in the wake of growing fiscal restraints. 
 "It's obviously more fun to do this type of work when you can throw a lot of money at the problem," Ms. Lloyd said, but the Sanitation Department staff has hard-working people who can make a difference.
At a City Hall news conference in which Mayor David N. Dinkins announced her appointment yesterday , Ms. Lloyd said the city, a large supplier and user of recyclable materials like newsprint, office paper, tires and corrugated boxes, could work to get more businesses to participate in the recycling program.
In addition, she said, neighborhood clean-up programs sponsored by businesses and community groups have been very successful and that she planned to encourage more of them. "We tend to be a little cynical in New York about people pitching in," Ms. Lloyd said. "But it really does work."
Ms. Lloyd said she was still studying the the city's decision to build huge garbage-burning incinerators to dispose of trash as remaining landfills reach capacity.
Ms. Lloyd, a former Boston Transportation Commissioner, currently heads the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Office of Business Development.
Environmental advocacy groups praised Ms. Lloyd's appointment yesterday. James T. B. Tripp, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund and chairman of the Citywide Recycling Board, said: "To have someone at the Sanitation Department who is both familiar with waste management and economic development is very exciting." Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Ms. Lloyd has "an interesting mix of talents and we are keeping our fingers crossed that she will be able to make a breakthrough on recycling."
When not working, Ms. Lloyd, who lives in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, said that she enjoys playing tennis and skating with her two children.

HEADLINE: Sea Bright Is Still Reeling from Halloween Storm

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEA BRIGHT, N.J.

 BODY:
It's a sight that Sgt. Steve Spahr says he'll never forget: A steel dumpster floating down Ocean Avenue, the main thoroughfare here, as floodwaters and flotsam from the normally benign Shrewsbury River crept toward the steps of police headquarters.
"That was a long night," he said, recalling Halloween, when local volunteers and National Guardsmen in 2 1/2-ton trucks helped evacuate nearly a dozen families from this Monmouth County shore community after a storm that caused some $72 million in damage along the New Jersey coastline. "And the worst of it," said Sergeant Spahr, the borough's emergency management coordinator, "is that I think we're in for a few more long nights."
 
U.S. Decision Attacked
 Traditionally, Atlantic Coastal storms with high-velocity winds and tides that surge two to three feet above normal besiege this region from late January through early March. The October storm and a similar but milder one that passed through here on Jan. 4 were unexpected, and many longtime residents view them as a preview of what's to come. 
 But beyond such fears, say residents and borough officials, they are increasingly bitter about the Federal Government's decision to deny the community disaster relief, though damage from the October storm has been estimated here at nearly $2 million.
"You have to be blind not to see the damage all through here," said Mayor Charles Rooney Jr., a retired factory worker. "With all the erosion we've had here, we're literally standing naked against the next storm." He added: "When you have storms of the intensity like we've seen, tons and tons of sand get washed out to sea, and that can't be replaced. We've got pilings on buildings exposed here and boulders jutting out of the shoreline."
Mr. Rooney said that his efforts to obtain Federal relief funds have caused him exasperation beyond words. "We were told that the damage here and along the rest of the Jersey Shore wasn't severe enough," he said. "But I tell you one thing, if this were the Japanese coast being pounded away, you wouldn't be able to count the amount of money flooding in."
Frank Pallone Jr. of Long Branch, the Democratic Congressman who represents Sea Bright, said he shares the Mayor's frustration. The Federal Emergency Management Agency turned down the aid request in part, he said, because beach replenishment does not qualify for such funding. The state, said Mr. Pallone, has appealed the denial, and Federal inspectors are touring shore points to re-evaluate claims from many hard-hit towns. The inspectors are expected in Monmouth County next week.
"I tell people that the Jersey Shore is just like a car," said Mr. Rooney. "If you don't maintain it, look after it, give it the care and attention it deserves, you won't have it around, for business or for pleasure."
 
'No Beaches, No Tourists'
 Sea Bright, like many shore towns from Sandy Hook to Cape May, is dependent on tourist dollars. Its population swells during the summer from about 1,800 to just over 5,000. Nearly four million tourists enjoy its beaches annually, officials say. For many business owners, beach erosion means a loss of revenue, and loss of revenue, they say, means business closings.
"No beaches, no tourists," said Mr. Rooney. "You don't have to be a genius or a Trenton legislator to draw your own conclusions."
At Steve's Luncheonette on Ocean Avenue, the talk over steaming cups of coffee these days is of recovery, both from the storms and from the economic doldrums.
"I've seen it worse," said Stephen A. Garelli, the luncheonette's owner, as he turned a mound of hash browns on a sizzling grill. "Back in '84, when a nor'easter came through, there was three feet of water in here and the windows and the roof blew out. But we came back, just like a lot of people around here, and we expect to stay."
 
Goods Raised Above Ground
 Michael E. Clayton of Fair Haven, who owns a restaurant supply business on River Street, agrees. "Over the years, we've learned to stack merchandise off the ground, way off the ground," he said. But, he admitted, "back on Halloween, I got hit bad, about $24,000 in damage."
Mr. Clayton's losses were covered by insurance, but borough officials say that many of Sea Bright's senior citizens were not so fortunate. Because they subsist on meager pensions or Social Security, they often do without flood insurance, the officials said. Though such insurance is now mandatory for new construction, longtime residents say that high premiums preclude it.
Dorothy L. Nelson, who is 68 years old and a lifelong resident of Sea Bright, says she is well aware of the risks of living at the shore without flood insurance. The Halloween storm was "the second worst I have had to endure," she said, but her Center Street home narrowly escaped damage because 14 years ago, when she bought it, she had it raised four feet onto concrete blocks. "It was an expensive thing to do back then," she said, "but I've gotten my money's worth."
"Many of us around here gamble with the weather," Mrs. Nelson mused. "Most times you win; sometimes you lose." Despite the risks, she finds Sea Bright's lure inescapable: "When the weather is calm, such as the spring and summer, there's no place I'd rather be, even if there is a price to be paid."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Campbell Soup Taps P.& G. for Executive

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
When Frank E. Weise 3d leaves the $27 billion Procter & Gamble Company for the $6.2 billion Campbell Soup Company, he will actually be departing for a company that is nearly twice as big as his present employer.
Now the chief financial officer at P.& G.'s food and beverage products division, a $3.5 billion business, Mr. Weise will become, effective Feb. 3, the senior vice president and chief financial officer for all of Campbell Soup. 
 Now 47 years old, he will also presumably have a fair shot at becoming chief executive, when David W. Johnson, 59, the president and chief executive officer -- and the man who recruited him -- retires or moves on.
Mr. Weise's hiring comes at a significant time for Campbell Soup, which possesses one of the world's most recognized brand names. In 1989, the company was the object of intense takeover speculation on Wall Street because the once-restive Dorrance family, which owns about 57 percent of the company, had been unhappy with Campbell's pallid earnings and faltering revenues.
But Mr. Johnson, a turnaround specialist hired away from the Gerber Products Company, has since made peace with the dissident Dorrance family members, while paring down costs and seeking to eliminate unprofitable operations. In the year that ended on last July 28, Campbell earned $3.16 a share, up from 3 cents a year earlier.
Campbell's stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $39.25, down $1.375 a share, compared with $43.875, its 52-week high.
Mr. Weise replaces Edwin L. Harper, who resigned last July to pursue other interests.
He brings a rich background from Procter & Gamble, one of the world's premier consumer-products companies. In 1967, he joined P.& G. right after a five-year program in business and economics at Lehigh University.
He was good at mathematics and was originally intent on becoming an engineer, but moved away from the field because it seemed too narrow and solitary. Finance fascinated him.
"Data itself is not boring; it's what you do with it that's important," Mr. Weise said in an interview yesterday. "I get my kicks out of data."
His first P.& G. job was analyzing the advertising spending for such products as Scope mouthwash, Crest toothpaste and Head and Shoulders shampoo. Later, he worked for the company in England and Belgium, before returning to the United States in 1983.
He was the top officer overseeing Olestra, the company's long-awaited fat substitute that it hopes can revolutionize cooking the way Nutrasweet has revolutionized sweeteners. In 1987, he took over as the chief financial officer for the food and beverage division, which produces Crisco oil, Folgers' coffee and Hawaiian Punch fruit drink, among others.
When a headhunter spoke to Mr. Weise in September about the Campbell job, he agreed, somewhat reluctantly, to meet Mr. Johnson for dinner at a hotel. They wound up talking for four hours. "We never did get around to eating; I had to catch a plane," Mr. Weise recalled.
At Campbell, Mr. Weise plans first to study the company intensively and identify growth areas. "I learned a lot, and I owe a lot to Procter & Gamble," he said, "but this place is just seething with opportunity."

Yields Are Down Sharply for Money Funds

 BODY:
The money funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report continued to show lower yields yesterday for both tax-exempt and taxable funds.
"Now we are seeing the full effect of the Federal Reserve's recent easing of interest rates showing up in money fund yields," said Walter Frank, economist for the organization. "Earlier this year, the effects were masked somewhat by year-end influences. We will see some further decline in money fund yields. But until we get some further action from the Federal Reserve, the bulk of the decline in short-term yields is behind us." 
 For the tax-exempt funds, the seven-day compounded average yield dropped to 3.04 percent from 3.89 percent, while the seven-day simple yield dropped to 3.00 percent from 3.82 percent, continuing the recent sharp decline in yields. During the same period, the 30-day compounded yield also fell, declining to 3.84 percent from 4.01 percent, and the 30-day simple yield dropped to 3.77 percent from 3.93 percent.
The top Connecticut fund was Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, which reported a seven-day compounded yield of 3.54 percent, compared with the 4.50 percent yield of the previous week's leader.
In New Jersey, the top fund was Prudential N.J. Muni Money Market Fund, with a yield of 3.58 percent, compared with a 4.40 percent yield reported by last week's leader.
In New York, the top fund was once again Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market fund. It had a seven-day compounded yield of 3.83 percent, compared with 4.47 percent a week ago.
 
Increase in Assets
 Assets of the tax-exempt funds rose this week by $2.3 billion, to $97.4 billion.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios dropped by two days, to 53 days.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/ Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund of Milwaukee continued to lead the way once again with a seven-day compounded yield of 4.29 percent, down from 4.91 percent the previous week.
Meanwhile, assets of the taxable funds rose by $11.8 billion, to a new record total of $495 billion, up from the previous record of $483.2 billion set last week. The average number of days to maturity of holdings in the taxable funds rose by one day, to 57 days.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield dropped 21 basis points, to 4.28 percent, from 4.49 percent the previous week, while the seven-day simple yield fell by the same number of basis points, to 4.19 percent from 4.40 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
At the same time, the 30-day compounded yield declined to 4.51 percent from 4.62 percent, and the simple yield went down to 4.41 percent from 4.52 percent.
The taxable fund with the best seven-day compounded return for the week was Fidelity Spartan Money Market Fund, with a yield of 5.28 percent.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.99 percent, compared with 4.06 percent a week ago, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: A Republican Speaker Takes Politics to Heart

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, who took over the gavel this week as the new Speaker of the Assembly and the undisputed leader of an ironclad Republican majority, is a man for whom taking politics to heart is a family tradition.
Mr. Haytaian, the son of Armenian immigrants, grew up in the Bronx and remembers his father as an uncompromising Democrat. 
 "My dad was not actively involved in politics," Mr. Haytaian recalled recently during a break from the Assembly floor, where, as usual, he was harrying the Democrats for what he saw as something akin to an assault on the future of the state in the waning hours of the lame-duck session.
 
Father 'Lost Everything'
 "But he was a very staunch Democrat," Mr. Haytaian said. "He had lost everything in the Depression; he had owned a restaurant, owned some land in Bergen County, but he lost everything.
"I was 14 or 15, and my mother bought a Hoover vacuum cleaner and put it in the closet. My dad saw the box, Hoover, and said, 'What's this?' and she said, 'It's a Hoover vacuum cleaner,' and he said, 'Get it out of the house.'
"She said, 'David, you're crazy, it's a vacuum cleaner!' and he said, 'I don't care what it is, it's got Hoover's name on it. Get it out of the house.' "
His mother dutifully returned the offending appliance to the store.
 
A Fiscal Demon
 Mr. Haytaian (pronounced high-TIE-yan) brought something of the same single-mindedness to his eight years as a minority and majority leader for his party, the Republicans. He began shifting toward Republicanism in his teens, and by the time he graduated from the University of Alabama with a degree in electrical engineering in 1961 -- he was leaving just as a fellow named Joe Namath was entering -- he was convinced that what the Democrats mostly did was, as he loves to say today, "tax and spend, tax and spend, tax and spend," as if by repetition he can exorcise the fiscal demon.
Demon or not, he is doing very well at exorcising Democrats. Along with Assemblyman Robert Franks, who is also the Republican state chairman, Mr. Haytaian was a leading architect of the Republican campaign assault in the Nov. 5 legislative elections in which every Republican candidate in the state, courthouse to statehouse, ran on a single theme: opposition to what they relentlessly labeled "the Florio-Democrat $2.8 billion tax increase."
It was Mr. Haytaian who set the theme in motion 19 months ago by instructing every single Republican in the Assembly to vote against the tax increase, which was rammed through the Legislature in the wee hours of the morning by the Democratic majority.
 
Symbolic Bandannas
 It was also Mr. Haytaian, acting gleefully on the suggestion of a fellow Republican Assemblyman, Richard Kamin, who was the principal stage director for a piece of legislative theater that got good photo play across the state during the tax debate in 1990. Mr. Haytaian and his Republican colleagues showed up on the Assembly floor wearing bright red bandannas across their mouths, symbolizing what they said was the "gagging" of debate by the Democratic majority.
Mr. Haytaian, who chuckles often, still chuckles about that.
The aggressive Republican assault on the tax increase, with Mr. Haytaian as often as not leading the charge, devastated the Democrats.
After the dust cleared, the Republicans had won control of both houses of the Legislature for the first time in two decades, and they had done it by winning veto-proof, two-thirds majorities in both houses, 27 to 13 in the Senate and 58 to 22 in Mr. Haytaian's Assembly. He was elected Speaker by acclamation.
But the political gamesmanship did not end there. Disgruntled Democrats, still in the majority, promptly came up with a put-up-or-shut-up strategy, introducing legislation to pull back all $2.8 billion of the tax increase, which was what the Republicans, including Mr. Haytaian, had been calling for before the election.
 
Sidestepping Disaster
 The Democratic strategy was confusing to some voters but quite clear to politicians on both sides of the aisle. Although the Republicans had been screaming about the huge tax increase, it was obvious to anyone who looked at the numbers that a blanket repeal would create a governmental disaster. By one measure, for example, it would mean eliminating every one of the 65,000 employees in state government.
That meant that if the taxes were rolled back, the incoming Republican majority would have to reinstate all or most of them, or let government collapse.
The repeal legislation zipped through the Senate and was dumped in Mr. Haytaian's lap in the Assembly. He instructed the Republicans to boycott Assembly sessions and to caucus instead in a diner. The Democrats, troubled by illnesses and vacancies, could not achieve a quorum, so no business could be conducted.
Although Mr. Haytaian had called for total repeal and in fact told the Democrats proposing it, "Go ahead, make my day," he said he saw no hypocrisy in the about-face.
With the failure of the Democratic rollback proposal, all $2.8 billion in tax increases remain on the books as Mr. Haytaian takes office, and whatever cutting is done will be done by Republicans.
Now, he said, he will push ahead with a Republican plan to roll back about a quarter of the tax package, reducing the sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent. He insists that he is not ruling out other cuts, even in the face of declining revenues amid a recession.
 
Clouding the Issue
 "We will absolutely cut the sales tax, and I feel strongly about the other taxes being on the table," Mr. Haytaian said. "But all this discussion about a total repeal has clouded the issue, people calling me a hypocrite because I'm not for repeal. That's wrong. I am. But I don't believe for a minute that you can repeal revenues without repealing the programs."
Now that he holds the third-highest position in state government, behind the Governor and the Senate President, Mr. Haytaian insists that his days as a political bomb thrower are over.
"I threw bombs politically because I had a bomb thrower's positions; my positions as minority leader and majority leader were very partisan," he said. "As Speaker, I won't be as partisan."
Indeed, he says he and the incoming Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican, will work closely with the Democratic Governor, Jim Florio, whom they have previously battered zealously.
"It's Machiavellian," Mr. Haytaian acknowledged. "If Governor Florio succeeds, we succeed. If he fails, we fail. If we fail, he fails. So it is important that we work with the executive, and people will be surprised that we agree more than we disagree."
At the same time, Mr. Haytaian concedes that he is taking aim at some of the Governor's keystone programs. He plans to rearrange the aid formulas under the Governor's Quality Education Act, which funnels state aid to 30 poor "special needs" urban school districts and a number of moderate-income districts at the expense of the wealthy ones. He also wants to revise the automobile insurance program set in place amid enormous difficulty and to further "downsize" government.
But in doing so, Mr. Haytaian, who is generally well liked personally on both sides of the aisle -- even his Democratic predecessor as Speaker, Joseph V. Doria Jr., with whom he squabbles endlessly, describes him as "a genuinely nice person" -- insists that he will not use the bulletproof Republican majority to hammer the Governor.
"People want an executive branch and a legislative branch, and with override, we can be both of them," he observed. "But people don't want that. I hope we never get into a situation where we have to override the Governor."
So has he turned aside politics to become totally a statesman?
"Good government is good politics, and good politics is good government," he said. "I don't think anyone is ever going to say Haytaian is a statesman."

Oil Up on OPEC Reports; Copper and Silver Advance

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices jumped yesterday on reports that a third OPEC member will reduce the amount of oil it pumps to bolster the sagging market.
Nigeria was reported to be the latest member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries planning to cut its oil production, although executives at Nigerian oil companies could not confirm any reduction. They said, however, that a cut would not surprise them. 
 Venezuela and Libya had said they would make small cuts, and the Venezuelan Energy Minister, Celestino Armas, expressed confidence that the other OPEC members would agree to siphon off production to ease the world oil glut.
February crude oil rose 38 cents, to $18.85 a barrel, and February unleaded gasoline gained 0.81 cent, to 53.34 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. February heating oil, supported by a sudden fall in temperatures in the Northeast that will likely increase demand, added 0.98 cent, to 54.05 cents a gallon.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper and silver prices posted strong advances.
Traders cited pent-up speculative demand for the precious metals, particularly with optimistic investors foreseeing a turnaround in the world economy that would increase demand from industry.
"All the base metals have been firm," led by the London aluminum market, which was up $50 a metric ton at one point, said Fred Demler, an analyst for Paine Webber Inc.
March copper rose 1.15 cents a pound, to 95.85 cents, while March silver gained 6 cents, to $4.16 an ounce.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean prices rebounded in what analysts termed a technical rally, as wheat prices extended their gains.
Heavy buying from commodity funds brought the 10.75-cent rise in March soybeans, to $5.71 1/4 a bushel.
A request for 340,000 metric tons of wheat by Egypt under a United States subsidy program kept the rally in wheat going, and the March contract closed 3.75 cents higher at $4.16 3/4 a bushel. Harsh winter weather in the Great Plains states added to concerns about wheat supplies later this summer, and the July contract rose 7.25 cents, to $3.78 1/2 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Business Sales Increased By Only 0.1% in November

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Business sales crept up just a tenth of 1 percent in November, providing little spark for greater production and new jobs, a Government report showed today.
Businesses increased their inventories by two-tenths of 1 percent in November, but that pace was slower than the gains of four-tenths of 1 percent in each of the previous two months, according to the Commerce Department's figures. 
 "The critical question is whether the inventory buildup is voluntary or involuntary," said Samuel D. Kahan, an economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago.
 
'Picking Up From Lean Levels'
 If it is voluntary, he said, inventories should remain relatively lean until demand picks up. But if it is involuntary -- caused by a lack of demand -- factories and stores will cut back on orders and further depress the economy.
Mr. Kahan said much of the recent inventory rebuilding was "just a normal picking up from lean levels." Inventories had fallen for seven straight months through August.
But both Mr. Kahan and Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, expressed concern over whether companies would continue to rebuild their inventories.
"There's no indication of businesses picking up the pace of inventories, which we need to see the recovery continue," Mr. Niemira said. But he suggested that there would be "a little better activity on the demand side" by spring and that inventory rebuilding would resume then.
 
The Recession's Effect
 The Commerce Department said inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted $814.3 billion, up from $813 billion a month earlier. Before increasing in September, inventories had fallen for seven months as the recession dampened demand.
Sales totaled $543.6 billion after seasonal adjustment, up from $543 billion in October, when they rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Sales had inched up two-tenths of 1 percent in September after a three-tenths of 1 percent decline a month earlier.
Still, the ratio between inventories and sales remained at 1.50 for the third straight month. That meant it would take 1.5 months to exhaust the backlog at the November sales pace.
Mr. Niemira said that the ratio was not worrisome, but that it provided no incentive for businesses to pick up the pace of inventory rebuilding.
The ratio, which jumped to 1.74 during the last recession in 1981-82, averaged 1.49 in 1990, economists at Fuji Securities said.
The report said retail inventories edged up a tenth of 1 percent in November following a nine-tenths of 1 percent gain a month earlier. At the same time, retail sales fell half a percent after a tenth of 1 percent drop in October.
The department reported on Tuesday that retailers posted a four-tenths of 1 percent decline in December.
On the other hand, manufacturing sales rose half a percent in November after a 1.2 percent advance a month earlier. Inventories were unchanged following a two-tenths of 1 percent decrease in October.
On the wholesale level, sales crept up a tenth of 1 percent after falling four-tenths of 1 percent the previous month. Inventories increased six-tenths of 1 percent in November on top of a nine-tenths of 1 percent gain in October.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Jumps Against Mark; Peak for German Rates Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar staged a strong advance yesterday, posting particularly sharp gains against the German mark amid a perception in the market that German interest rates have peaked.
Gold prices slipped in domestic trading after rising overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $354.10 an ounce, off 50 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold had fallen 60 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $354. 
 Dollar-buying has been encouraged all week, traders said, by a growing sense that European interest rates have peaked, coupled with the contention that interest rates at home are not likely to fall further.
These so-called interest-rate differentials are turning in favor of the dollar. High interest rates have made fixed-income securities like German Government bonds attractive to investors, thereby increasing their need for marks.
But it appears that "the German economy is headed for a bit of a downfall, and there's talk of a possible ease in their rates in the next month or so," said Kevin Lawrie, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston. Bonn reported yesterday that Western Germany's economy cooled markedly in 1991, posting little or no growth in the last three quarters.
The dollar jumped more than two pfennigs against the mark, even though any rate changes remain a matter of speculation and many economists believe that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, will hold steady on rates to fight inflation. In New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.6250 German marks, from 1.5930 on Tuesday.
Curtis Perkins, a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said the dollar-buying stemmed more from an "I don't want to miss the boat" mentality than any serious fundamental reason.
In Tokyo, markets were closed for Coming of Age Day, a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 128.40 yen, up from Tuesday's close in Tokyo of 126.05 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 128.66 yen, up from 126.85 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7560, from $1.8150 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.7520 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.7840.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.4455 Swiss francs, up from 1.4125; 5.5435 French francs, up from 5.4330; 1,224.25 Italian lire, up from 1,201.00, and 1.1536 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1503.

Strategies for Selling More When Shoppers Want Less

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
"THE 'less' decade" is here, according to Carol Farmer, a retail consultant. The "era of excess" of the 1980's is history, she insists, and marketers must catch on to that quickly.
She was speaking as part of a panel of advertising, marketing and media executives who urged the nation's retailers to revamp drastically how they communicate with customers or suffer the loss of their businesses. 
 "The marketing challenge of the 90's will be to sell more in an era of less," she told more than 400 people who attended the presentation, called "The New Normalcy: Marketing to Recession Reality." "This is where you guys are missing it, and it makes me so nuts. You better get with the program."
The panel, at the New York Hilton on Tuesday, was sponsored by the Newspaper Advertising Bureau in conjunction with the National Retail Federation's annual convention in New York this week.
Ms. Farmer, president of Carol Farmer Associates, a consulting firm in Boca Raton, Fla., warned the audience that shoppers' refocused attitudes meant they must end their obsession with evanescent fashion.
"It will be the downfall of retailing if you don't cut it out," she said, adding that the outfit she was wearing was five years old, "and if you don't like it, tough."
Both Ms. Farmer and a second panelist, Laurel Cutler, the vice chairman and worldwide director of marketing planning at FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York, likened the sharp shifts in consumer behavior during the recession to the emotional process by which people cope with loss. They invoked the stages of behavior in reacting to death, as described by the psychiatrist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, from denial to anger to depression to introspection to acceptance.
At the moment, Ms. Farmer said, consumers are angry, and they think "less equals loss." But "somewhere along the way," she added, because "the American personality is optimistic, we will convince ourselves that less is better."
As part of that process, Ms. Cutler said, "the consumer becomes an investor," prudently and cautiously guarding "what little is left of his or her disposable income." That is a key reason, she added, for the sharply rising popularity of "value brands," products that promise good quality at reasonable prices.
Ms. Cutler listed, as successful purveyors of such brands, the Gap; the designer Donna Karan, with her lower-priced DKNY apparel, and the designer Giorgio Armani, with his new A/X: Armani Exchange casual clothing. Even expensive goods can qualify as good values, she said, citing how Toyota marketed its Lexus line of luxury cars as a lower-priced alternative to Mercedes-Benz.
All of those marketers are shrewdly capitalizing, she said, on shoppers' decisions "not to make trade-downs, but to make trade-offs." The recession "is nature's way of telling us it's time to change," she added, "and giving us permission to change."
Ms. Farmer also cited the Gap, along with Smith & Hawken, the catalogue retailer; Patagonia, a retailer specializing in practical outdoor apparel, and the Costco Wholesale chain of warehouse stores.
Another panelist who stressed that retailers must shift their emphasis from sales to value -- "the V-word," as she termed it -- was Ann C. Hunt, vice president of retail market development for the ad bureau. She chastised companies that insist on advertising and marketing "as they always did, patiently waiting for a recovery."
Rather, Ms. Hunt advised boldness and experimentation, saying: "Take the risk. While many companies have hunkered down with the tight-fisted consumer, some took risks and got noticed." Examples she gave included Range Rover, which is running advertisements by Grace & Rothschild, chiding consumers to "Buy something," and the Target discount-store chain, which ran ads for shirts and ties that featured men wearing pants they already owned.
The media must also change their ways, said Ray Gaulke, the ad bureau's executive vice president and chief marketing officer. "Our mission must be to become more than vendors of blank pages," he said, and to assume a role as "a review board for your advertising."
"If we see things that we don't believe will work," he added, "we have to tell you."

Alcoa Loss Widens In Quarter

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Aluminum Company of America, the world's largest aluminum producer, yesterday reported a bigger fourth-quarter loss than a year earlier because of lower prices for virtually all of its products. But another aluminum producer, the Reynolds Metals Company, posted a 57 percent gain for the quarter.
 Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, said it lost $191.4 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $140.4 million, in the 1990 quarter. Sales for the quarter dropped to $2.45 billion from $2.75 billion. 
 But investors bought Alcoa shares anyway, sending the shares up $4.625 to $67.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said investors were buying many of the so-called cyclical stocks, betting the issues would benefit from an economic upturn.
A worldwide surplus has depressed the aluminum market, pushing ingot prices to 51 cents a pound, about half their high in 1990.
Alcoa said in its earnings report that profit margins had declined across its product line in 1991.
Aluminum shipments in 1991 rose 4 percent from a year earlier, the company said, because of strong demand for aluminum used in packaging. It shipped 2.84 million metric tons, up from 2.72 million tons in 1990.
For the year, Alcoa's earnings fell 78.8 percent, to $62.7 million, or 71 cents a share, from $295.2 million, or $3.40 a share, in 1990. Sales dropped 8.2 percent, to $9.98 billion, from $10.87 billion in 1990.
 
Reynolds Metals
 The Reynolds Metals Company reported a 57 percent gain in fourth-quarter earnings, but its profits for all of 1991 were down sharply.
The company, based in Richmond, said it earned $23.7 million in the final quarter of last year, or 40 cents a share, compared with a profit of $15.1 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 9.4 percent, to $1.45 billion, compared with $1.60 billion.
Reynolds said its full-year earnings slumped 48 percent, to $154.1 million, or $2.60 a share, from $296.6 million, or $5.01 a share, in 1990. Sales fell 4.9 percent, to $5.78 billion from $6.08 billion.
The results included an after-tax charge of $94 million for anticipated environmental costs.
The Reynolds chairman, William Bourke, attributed last year's disappointing results to the "obstinate recession." He said that the worldwide oversupply of aluminum had "pushed ingot prices, in real terms, to their lowest levels ever."
Reynolds said its 1991 aluminum shipments rose to 1.47 million tons from 1.42 million in 1990.
The Reynolds share price was up $4.25 yesterday, to $55, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Ralston Purina: Profitable but . . .

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder

 BODY:
THE Ralston Purina Company is solidly profitable, with a roster of famous product names like Purina dog food, Chex cereals, Wonder bread, Beech-Nut baby foods and Eveready batteries. Yet its stock was among the poorest performers in the food and consumer packaged-goods group last year. Ralston's shares rose by just 10 percent, compared with more than 40 percent for its main competitors and 26.3 percent for the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks.
Nor will William P. Stiritz, the publicity-shy chairman and chief executive of the St. Louis-based company, be able to report a rousing start to the new year at the annual meeting today. 
 "Ralston is totally out of favor," said Robert J. Cummins, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company. "Their earnings have left a lot to be desired for several years."
Ralston's pet-food business, cereals and huge baking operations are all under intense competitive pressure, leaving analysts doubtful that strong earnings growth can soon resume. Prospects would be even bleaker but for the double-digit earnings advances at Eveready, which now accounts for more than 25 percent of profits. But some analysts say Ralston is now so undervalued that it may be a good long-term investment.
"I hold my nose, close my eyes and rate them a 'buy' because they are so cheap relative to the others," said Roger W. Spencer, who follows food companies for Paine Webber Inc.
Perhaps the biggest attraction of the company, analysts say, is the cash its operations generate. Lawrence Adelman, who follows Ralston for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., estimates the company will have $1.4 billion to invest after capital spending and dividends over the next five years, a larger amount relative to its share price than any food company except CPC International Inc. "The bet on Ralston is how management will use that," Mr. Adelman said.
In the past, Mr. Stiritz has most notably used free cash to buy back Ralston stock. Since 1982, the company has repurchased about 126 million shares, adjusting for splits, reducing the number of shares outstanding to fewer than 111 million and raising earnings per share faster than net income has grown.
Some analysts, like John M. McMillin of Prudential Securities Inc., are predicting more sizable share repurchases, which should help to bolster the share price, which ended at $57.25 yesterday, down $1.25. At that price, the stock carries a price-earnings ratio of 17.52, compared with the higher ones of the Quaker Oats Company, General Mills Inc. or the Kellogg Company.
Despite the lagging performance in 1991, Ralston's share price is nearly 10 times higher than when Mr. Stiritz became chief executive in 1981.
Analysts say Ralston's pet-food business, which provides 40 percent of its earnings, has been hurt by several trends. The $8 billion industry is mature, with a number of big companies fighting desperately for market share. High-priced specialty products sold through veterinarians, like the Colgate-Pamolive Company's Science Diet, have chipped away at the high end of the market. After being slow to recognize the threat, Ralston has begun to respond with its own products.
But the weakening economy has led some pet owners to move to canned brands, where Ralston is weaker, from dried products, where it dominates the market. And a growing percentage of pet food is purchased at discount retailers like Wal-Mart instead of at supermarkets, the traditional focus of Ralston's marketing.
"The pet-food business is dog-eat-dog," Mr. Spencer said. "Ralston needs something with a fairly wild upside to balance it."
That something will not come from baking. Products like Wonder bread and Hostess snacks generate profits but have scant room to grow. Total sales of baked goods are flat, and the battle for market share is nearly as fierce as in dog food. Ralston and its rivals spend heavily on new products just to hold their market share or eke out modest gains.
Cereals do not seem to be the answer, either. The company's flagship Chex brands are also-rans in a market dominated by heavyweights with huge advertising budgets, like General Mills and Kellogg's. Ralston has been deft at developing branded cereals for children based on licensed characters, like Batman and the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, but such brands tend to decline after a short period of faddish appeal.
Ralston's biggest cereal success has been in manufacturing products for supermarkets and others to sell under private labels. Analysts estimate that Ralston has more than 60 percent of this growing business, but profit margins are substantially lower than for branded cereals. Meanwhile, the company's Beech-Nut baby foods group has been losing market share to the Gerber Products Company, the industry leader.
That leaves Eveready. Ronald Morrow, who follows Ralston for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, figures that Eveready's earnings may grow as much as 15 percent this year. The Eastman Kodak Company has slackened its efforts to wrest market share from Eveready and Duracell Inc., the two dominant players, and Eveready is expanding overseas.
But Mr. Morrow says it is hard to imagine much of an improvement on current growth rates without a breakthrough in technology. He and a number of other analysts say that even though the company may be undervalued, Energizer batteries alone cannot move Ralston onto their "buy" lists.

HEADLINE: Why Shops' Names Say 'Just:' Because.

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
IN Manhattan, a city where the range of specialty stores can be mind-boggling, there is something refreshingly direct about places that publicly proclaim their uniqueness.
In the 1991-1992 Manhattan Business directory, there are 70-plus listings for stores beginning with the word "just." Out of context, it is hard to know whether to take "just" as a compliment or a slam, though it is certainly a more melodic nomenclature than "Nothing but" or "Only." 
 Still, stores with "just" in their names seem, well, just right -- especially if the item in question happens to be just what one is looking for. "Just" shops, with their linguistic directness and tightly themed wares, make many other less specifically titled emporiums sound unnecessarily complicated.
There are lots of fashion justs ("Just Nice Fashion," "Just Silk," "Just Bottoms and Tops," "Just Because Sportswear") and lots of civilian Justs -- Just Mort and Just Abel, for example.
Just Cats, Fancy Felines-Feline Fancies, at 244 East 60th Street, is the daytime haunt of the disk jockey Alison Steele, a k a the Night Bird, on WXRK-FM from 2 to 6 A.M.
During the day, she is "Top Cat" -- her sister Joyce Loman is the "Marcating Director" -- of a sliver of a store that is, Ms. Steele said, "not a pet shop but a boutique." The sisters breed and sell pedigreed Persians and Himalayans and although they each live with seven cats and a poodle, they focus on cats in the store.
"We sell everything for the cat," Ms. Steele said. Everything like made-to-order cat pan "houses," toys, games, bowls, collars, T-shirts -- ("Have a Mice Day" is a big seller,) and a video.
"That's about birds and mice," Ms. Loman said. "Things cats like to look at."
What Ms. Steele described as "the next level" consists of items for "the people the cats own."
"You don't own the cat," Ms. Steele said. "He owns you. He runs the establishment."
The next level, then, includes stationery, books, clocks, lamps, picture frames, hangers, bookmarks, scarves, nightshirts, sweatshirts -- even a toilet bowl brush, $35. People who are attracted to cats, but cannot live with them -- an allergic visitor to the store can only stay for a short time before succumbing to itchy eyes and a twitchy nose -- might fall for a voice-activated stuffed cat. Scratch its neck and it purrs; talk to it and it talks back ($70).
And if you think that cat crazy people do not have a sense of humor, consider Just Cats' best seller over the holidays. It is a $12 bowl marked "cat from hell."
"Everyone thinks they've got just the cat for it," Ms. Steele said. (Just call 212-888-CATS.)
Forget about trying to talk to Just the Fax. What you hear when you telephone is, actually, just a fax -- that strident beep that makes you want to hang up in a hurry.
Just Toys, at 1107 Broadway, between 24th and 25th Streets, is also not for the buying public. It is a wholesale company that makes dolls. The Little Mermaid, 101 Dalmations and the Super Heroes, are featured heavily in their venue, though these characters appear in just one form: a six-inch bendable doll.
Just Counter Tops, no address, just a phone (212-734-5178) is just that. Nothing more. Well, maybe backsplashes. But that is it. "Counter tops are what I supply," said Offer Bok, who has been making house calls for the last three years.
Mr. Bok, who works out of his house, carries samples with him to houses and apartments. He gives free estimates, then has the counter tops custom-made. "Everyone is different," he said. "After me, all people need is a faucet."
Just Shades, at 21 Spring Street, at Elizabeth Street, claims it was the first to choose such an obsessive name. "Twenty-six years ago we opened on the Bowery," said Connie Rakower who runs the business with her husband Steve.
Mr. Rakower's mother, Anne is credited with the concept. For the Rakowers, "Just" really means more and more.
"Strictly shades, that's us," said Mrs. Rakower. "We're the largest discount shop of its kind on the Eastern Seaboard."
With prices that range from $6.50 to $200 for in-stock shades -- dozens are displayed on functionally plain metal shelving, including the recent best sellers: heavily fringed, trimmed and braided Victorian shades ($90 and up, depending on the amount of frillinesss required).
"Just bring in the lamp or the old shade," Mr. Rakower advised, because, he added: "There's only one decorator we know who can walk in without the lamp and walk out with a shade that fits."
Three years ago, when he was 9, Jesse Owen thought up the name for his mother's store, Just Kidding. The shop, at 22 Harrison Street, between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, sells children's clothes, books and toys.
Margaret Owen, Jesse's mother, has put together a shop filled with playful clothes for small children. Her illustrated T-shirts are $20, and sweatshirts are $22. Swing skirts, the short, twirly kind that little girls go for, are also about $20.
Even the stuffed animals are dressed. A cuddly cat is $12, his hand-knit sweater is $8.
And there is a play area with a puppet theater, small chairs and books that looks as if it belongs in a nursery school. That is to keep the little guys busy while the grown-ups shop.
Just Bulbs is a misleadingly small operation that has staked out the corner of 22d Street and Broadway since 1980. It is decorated with strings of Primal Lites -- bacon and egg and such-shaped lights on a string.
Behind the scenes is a 24,000-square-foot, three-level stockroom, crammed with bulbs, bulbs and more bulbs.
Just Bulbs is owned by Shirley Brooks and her daughter Judi, who also manages the store. Her grandmother came up with the name. "It's a fun store," said Ms. Brooks, who enjoys putting her hand on just what the customer happens to ask for. "There's a language to be learned here," she said. "It looks confusing, but it's actually very logical."
"Lights are everywhere you ever thought of and lots of places you didn't," added Ms. Brooks, and then rattled off a random list of some of the bulbs the store has on hand: "fun stuff and serious energy-efficiency stuff, car headlights and elevator lights, a light for your refrigerator, lights for microscopes, lights for looking at skin conditions, lights for your vacuum cleaner and oven, and 58 colors of white in fluorescents."
Bulbs seem to be a recession-proof item. "People are not going to sit in the dark," Ms. Brooks said.
O.K., but what about plugs -- sometimes as necessary as bulbs? "Absolutely NO plugs. As I said before it's just bulbs."
Sorry we asked.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Real-World Issues Reach the Bronx

BYLINE: By Claire Smith

 BODY:
Like the dark before the dawn, the business-of-baseball season is here. And as it has been in past so-called off seasons, baseball has found a way to push into the territory once reserved almost exclusively for winter sports.
But the big news during baseball's second season is no longer dominated by such feel-good stories about M.V.P. and Cy Young winners and the coronation of the latest inductees into the Hall of Fame. 
 No, it's the financial rumblings and legal ramblings, the encroachment of real-world issues on what once was perceived as an innocent and immune world that concentrated soley on the sport.
Nowhere is that case driven home than in New York, where contracts, episodic power shifts and intrigue continue to haunt the team in the Bronx.
So what if Daniel McCarthy, the man nervously approaching baseball to see if he can gain approval as the Yankees' general partner, yesterday met with Commissioner Fay Vincent, his most imposing hurdle?
The real news was who has the Yankees' money and, more important, just how much is left in the coffers. For the Yankees, who once seemed to be baseball's equivalent of the House of Morgan, are more and more being painted as house of cards, financially speaking.
So the questions abound.
Why did the Yankee partners, after signing a 12-year, $485 million contract with Madison Square Garden Cable Network in the winter of 1988, turn around and use the contract as collateral on a loan worth $100 million, maybe more?
Would we ask why if such matters, including a personal windfall estimated at $55 million from the loan and $25 to $30 million on a signing bonus connected to the MSG deal, didn't involve someone named George Steinbrenner?
And would the Yankees' management members and well as owners now sit with their feet to the fire if they had not, for years, portrayed themselves to their dubious public as a team that would pour its profits back into the product if the profits were to be had?
There's no suggestion that partners, even ones named Steinbrenner, did anything illegal here. No alarms went off in the commissioner's office when the loan was secured; none went off after Newsday reported details of the loan yesterday.
The partners are the owners to the team. They are expected to bolster it in bad times, and they shouldn't be faulted if they expect to reap rewards during the good times.
As for more philosophic questions of right or wrong, well, at the risk of being jaded, business is business and morality is morality and one has nothing to do with the other in this case.
That doesn't mean that the timing of the disclosure won't foul the waters for the Yankees. It does not mean that fans won't feel an outrage, given that the partners profited during what are the worst back-to-back seasons in decades for the team.
Cynicism toward business and quasi-public enterprises is running rampant, anyway. Citizens look all about and see a country trying to recover from the 80's and memories of corporate desperados who first ransacked company coffers, then sheepishly pleaded poverty after being whacked by the double-edged sword of mounting debt and the recession.
Now, in wake of the $25 million contract they negotiated with Danny Tartabull, the Yankees are pleading a bit of poverty themselves.
The juxaposition of personal riches and hard times for the franchise just does not make George Steinbrenner or his partners look good. And given Steinbrenner's precarious position in baseball purgatory and his still unfulfilled goal to come back in from the cold, the timing of this jab to his solar plexis could not have been worse.
Steinbrenner has presented the argument of late that there is a hue and cry among the common folk that only he can lift the Yankees from their present morass. If there was a lot of making a hue and cry, the tune might have changed over night.
Fans might think that, heck, one general partner taking out instead of putting in is no better or worse than the next guy, if the next guy is apt to do the same.
In the end, the Yankees, their bank transactions, their loans may well have been legal, but they're not going to be at all popular. What the partners did in 1989 makes Bobby Bonilla's deal with the Mets and Tartabull's deal with the Yankees look like chump change.

HEADLINE: Faded Glory: Looking Back at the Gulf War -- A Special Report
Year After Gulf War, Joy Is a Ghost;
The Healing: Pain and Images For a Lifetime

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AURORA, Colo., Jan. 14

 BODY:
As other troops paraded last year through the confetti and basked in the thunderous roar of gratitude, Jon Price watched the triumphant scene on a television from his hospital bed.
Mr. Price, a 23-year-old Army specialist who stepped on a land mine one February afternoon in Iraq, now walks with a cane. 
 "I'll never run again," said the Iowa native, a burly one-time farm boy who starred in high school as a football player and wrestler. "It stinks."
He has lost the hearing in his left ear. Bits of shrapnel remain lodged from his hips to his feet. He has no feeling in his right foot, and he suffers from severe arthritis.
Mr. Price, the son of a Vietnam veteran, said he has "no regrets" about his wartime service, which he called "something that had to be done."
 
Hurt by Friendly Fire
 He sat in the lobby at the Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center here in suburban Denver, alongside Hilbert Potter, a 31-year-old Army sergeant who lost his right leg from the knee down. He was injured by shots mistakenly fired from an American tank.
"I don't think people have forgotten us," said Mr. Potter. "When people hear my name, they think, 'Hero.' "
The enduring injuries of these two young soldiers underscores the limits of a nation's good will. The applause and parades and bumper stickers of support cannot heal all wounds.
In the war's wake, many Americans vowed that these returning veterans, unlike those who served in Vietnam, would not be forgotten. And despite the recession, at least some of those promises have been kept.
As the troops headed home, Frank Capilla, a plumbing contractor in Pleasonton, Calif., rounded up pledges of more than two dozen jobs from business people in his region. The effort has indeed placed 12 returning veterans in jobs, and awarded $1,000 college scholarships to 12 others.
"I hired a returning marine as an apprentice last May," said Mr. Capilla, whose business has been hurt by the slumping construction industry. "But if I had to hire somebody today, I couldn't do it."
 
'Can You Help Me?'
 Mark Bishop, who served as a flight engineer in the Air Force, was one of the lucky ones. After a long job hunt, he heard about the pledges.
"I basically told Mr. Capilla: 'I'm an out-of-work vet from Desert Storm. Can you help me?' " Mr. Bishop, 30, recalled.
The plumbing contractor helped Mr. Bishop write a cover letter and a resume and land an interview with the Seaman's Corporation, in neighboring Concord. He got a job as a service engineer.
"A lot of guys I've talked to can't find anything," Mr. Bishop said. "It's the recession, you know."
Mr. Capilla said his business friends have done their best to honor their pledges of jobs. But he said he worries that the nation's support has waned a bit.
"As soon as the war went to the back pages of the newspapers, there just wasn't the enthusiasm anymore," he said. "But then, the war only lasted 100 hours. And the American people have a short attention span."
 
Bonds Forged in Terror
 But for Mr. Price and many others, the memories of the war will never fade. Along with the day the land mine exploded, he said, he will never forget the bonds cemented in the moments and hours of terror.
Before the accident, Mr. Price, who loves country music, often passed the time singing the Garth Brooks song, "I've Got Friends in Low Places."
The day before his accident, he said, he had gotten into an argument with another soldier, a young black man who chided Mr. Price about being a "redneck." But when the land mine exploded, and Mr. Price lay motionless, someone ran to his side, held his hand and implored him to stay alive. It was the young black soldier.
"Sing, Price, sing," the soldier pleaded, as tears streamed down his cheeks. "Sing 'Low Places.' "
Months later, as he lay in the Denver hospital, the telephone rang for Mr. Price. "My name is Garth Brooks," said the voice at the other end of the line. "I want you to come and have dinner with me."
Mr. Price spent the day with the country band. Mr. Brooks brought him on stage at a concert, and led the applause for him.
Mr. Price, who hopes to be released from the hospital in April, said he intends to go back to school. His disability pay will cover part of the tuition, but he said it will probably not be enough, and added, "I guess I'll get a job flipping burgers."

The Grief: Broken Hearts Left Behind

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONESSEN, Pa., Jan. 14

 BODY:
In the 10 months since he buried his son not far from here, Norman Madison has waged a personal war against depression, anger and disillusionment with flag and country. It is a war that the 54-year-old former marine fears he will have to fight until he goes to his own grave.
Mr. Madison's son, Anthony, 27, was one of 13 Army reservists from this proud, hard-luck region of Western Pennsylvania who was killed in a Scud missile attack in Saudi Arabia in the final days of the war.
"My son's death has changed my whole life," Mr. Madison said here the other day as he held his son's Purple Heart. "I'm altogether different than what I was. I don't know how to describe it."
"Emptiness?" his wife, Darla, suggested.
"Yeah," Mr. Madison agreed, "and I can't fill it up."
Twenty-eight reservists were killed that night in the desert but no other patch of America had to bury so many of its sons and daughters, so many of its dreams of grandchildren and fishing trips.
And nowhere else in America were so many broken hearts left behind, scattered across the hilly countryside of small cities and towns like the leafless trees that now sway in the winter wind.
For much of the last year, Diane Radocaj has tried to help ease the suffering as head of a family support group in Greensburg, where the reservists were based.
"From what I've seen there is a variety of emotions," she said. "Some are bitter and they always will be. Others have accepted it. But the emotion that dominates is just a sense of loss."
In Rochester Mills, a town with one street, where Specialist Christine L. Mayes grew up and was buried at age 22, her father said he and his family were "getting as close to normal as you can get."
"I could be bitter and cynical but I'm not," Franklin Mayes said. "You can dwell on this until it drives you crazy. You have to let it go. Enough is enough." Mr. Mayes's daughter was one of two women from the reserve unit, the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, to be killed in the attack. On the anniversary, Feb. 25, a stone monument will be dedicated to the reservists, both living and dead.
 
Fund for Children of Dead
 The $250,000 monument will sit near the entrance of the reserve center in Greensburg and will be surrounded by 13 newly planted trees. Most of the construction, labor and material have been donated. A $20,000 scholarship fund has been established for the 10 children of the dead.
But most people here have closed the door on the war, said the Roman Catholic Bishop of Greensburg, the Rev. Anthony Bosco.
"People are back to their own problems," he said. "The people who have the empty chair at the dinner table are the ones who feel it. That's not cruel. That's life."
Bishop Bosco said the recession had hit the area hard. Tomorrow, he said, is what most people here now worry about.
"I think the proof that Desert Storm is history is in George Bush's popularity polls," the Bishop said. "His popularity here is not good because of the economy."
 
'My Boy Died for Oil'
 In Mr. Madison's hilltop home, President Bush is an especially bitter subject.
"What really burns me up is that nothing has changed over there," Mr. Madison said. "Hussein is still in control. Our President sits around waving his flag like he did something. He didn't do anything. Nothing. My son is dead. What did he die for?"
Last February as he waited for his son's body, Mr. Madison said he believed the war was necessary. But today, after months of grief and reflection, he said he no longer had faith in the Government.
"They lie and lie and lie and it never ends," Mr. Madison said. "The war was about oil. My boy died for oil."
As he talked, tears welling in his eyes, his wife, who was Anthony Madison's stepmother, touched his shoulder and said, "It'll be a year ago next month that Tony died, but it seems like yesterday."

HEADLINE: Faded Glory: Looking Back at the Gulf War -- A Special Report
Year After Gulf War, Joy Is a Ghost;
The Warriors: Impending Cuts Causing Worries

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT HOOD, Tex., Jan. 14

 BODY:
Come the first anniversary of the start of the Persian Gulf war, it will be business as usual at this Army post that sent 26,000 soldiers to Saudi Arabia.
The lack of ceremonies seems somehow fitting: For the American soldier, the war is a rapidly fading memory, shoved aside by the stunning collapse of the Soviet Union and fears that looming budget cuts could push thousands out of the military. 
 "There are guys with 8, 10, 12 years in the service who don't know if their job is going to be around next year," said Sgt. Phillip Barnes, 27 years old, who spent four months in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as a chemical weapons decontamination expert.
 
Final Report Next Week
 The desert-tan trucks speeding around this sprawling base are among the few hints of the 43-day war and its 100-hour ground campaign. The First Cavalry Division next month will dedicate a Gulf war wing to its museum that will feature captured Iraqi tanks. In Washington next week, the Pentagon is expected to issue its final report on the war.
More than 541,000 Americans served in the Middle East, including 35,000 servicewomen, who performed so well that Congress last summer lifted a 43-year-old ban against their flying combat missions.
The war cost $61 billion -- $7 billion paid by the United States and the rest by allies around the world. One hundred forty-six Americans lost their lives in action, including 35 accidentally killed by fellow Americans. Of the 467 Americans wounded, 72 were inadvertently hit by United States forces. Perhaps 25,000 to 50,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and thousands more wounded, although the United States military says it has no firm numbers.
Mostly because of the diminishing Communist threat, the military is shrinking to 1.6 million in 1995 from about 2 million now. With the recession working in their favor, military recruiters say they can be more selective. More people want to re-enlist than there are spaces available. Pentagon officials estimate that about 85 percent of the 435,000 active-duty soldiers who served in the gulf are still in the military.
For morale's sake, the tell-tale desert-camouflage uniforms have been retired here in favor of the traditional dark-green fatigues. Only a small combat patch on the right shoulder sets apart the uniforms of those who served and those who waited.
Gulf war veterans here say they are sensitive to this and tend to share memories -- eating Thanksgiving dinner in a howling sandstorm, enduring swarms of desert flies, shivering through cold showers -- only when asked or with war buddies.
"We don't want to flaunt it and alienate those guys who didn't go," said Sgt. Peter Schumacher, 25, a military policeman. "All that would do is make enemies."
 
Couples Under Siege
 At home, some marriages, many strained before the war, snapped with the separation. Others were strengthened.
"This war really brought me closer to my family," said Sgt. 1st Class Ruben Cavazos, 42, an artillery specialist in the Second Armored Division. "When you don't know if you're going to come back alive or not, you think about them more."
For many Army veterans on the verge of retirement, like Sergeant Cavazos, the war crowned a 20-year career. For others, the experience was an invaluable mid-career boost. Many soldiers, though, have their minds on the possibility that an overzealous reduction will weaken the Army.
"I came in on my own," Sergeant Barnes said. "I'd like to leave on my own."

HEADLINE: New Jersey's New Political Order

 BODY:
With political power in New Jersey now split between a Democratic Governor and veto-proof Republican majorities in the legislature, both parties face a daunting challenge to make government work. And that won't happen unless they suppress their natural instinct to score points.
The opening day of the new legislative session was a standoff. Gov. Jim Florio, in his State of the State Message, focused on programs to create more jobs in public construction projects. The Republicans had something quite different in mind -- tax cuts, and spending cuts to match. 
 Like many governors, and even President Bush, Mr. Florio knows economic recovery is the big issue this year. Hence he properly stressed job creation. But he made no mention of the tax revolt that brought the Republicans to power in the legislature. Nor did he address the continuing uproar over his auto insurance reform and aid to education. He will have to address them soon.
Governor Florio did offer some concessions to voter discontent. Reversing his past position, he called for legislation to allow popular initiatives and referendums. That's acceptable only if there are safeguards -- which Mr. Florio urged -- to limit spending by the advocates of each proposal, along with full disclosure of who they are and what they're up to. He also ridiculed his Health Department's "runny egg" rule as "unenforceable, intrusive and, frankly, silly." Aimed at salmonella poisoning, the rule tells restaurants how much to cook the eggs they serve.
But for the Republicans, in complete control of the legislature for the first time in 18 years, cutting taxes comes first, starting with a one-point reduction in the state's 7 percent sales tax. While they haven't said what spending they would also cut, one presumed target is school aid, which raises the ugly possibility that they will take funds from the largely Democratic and destitute big cities.
Given the prospect that next year's budget deficit will top $1 billion even before any tax cut, what New Jersey needs is a brake on tax reduction combined with careful cuts in spending. It won't be easy. For the Republicans and Mr. Florio, it is a joint responsibility.

The Current Event

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The El Nino current is now getting a big media buildup. This long-ignored flow of warm seawater across the Pacific and down the coast of South America is being fingered as the cause of floods in Texas and one of the warmest winters on record in the East.
Don't believe it. Every 10 years I rise to write an essay about El Nino (pronounced El NEEN-yo, short for the Spanish El Nino de Navidad, or Christ Child) straightening out the climatologists and their credulous cohort who see the great, mysterious swoosh of warm water as a troublesome "southern oscillation." 
 The oscillationists (along with their voguish allies, the neo-oscillationists) are mistaken. El Nino is not a source of destruction, to be dreaded and ultimately tamed or refrigerated or re-directed; it is like a primal pulse, to be welcomed as a sign of life.
In 1973, when I first introduced El Nino to readers in this space, a horrified hue and cry was being raised by the world's fishermen: the nice and icy Humboldt current, in which the anchovies play and supply much of the world's fishmeal protein, was being pushed aside by El Nino.
Still new to the columnist dodge, I rushed out to the C.I.A.'s headquarters to see the agent monitoring the world's soybean and anchovy production; he confirmed the fear that the catch would be bad, commodity prices would rise and bad times would follow. (I protected his identity for the sake of his children; they thought he was an undercover operative and would have reviled his mundane expertise on anchovies.)
Sure enough, because of El Nino and the Shah of Iran, prices rose and a recession took hold.
Nine years later, in 1982, concurrent with a steep recession in the U.S., El Nino returned at Christmastime, as befitting its name. Weird storms raged, mud slid in Utah, fair-tradewinds blew the wrong way, the northern winter was oddly warm, the Peruvian anchovies went belly up.
By that time, as a seasoned columniator, I was able to observe the correlation of climatic and economic forces, and to assure readers that neither El Nino nor the worst postwar recession would last. The refreshingly icy waters of Humboldt (renamed La Nina by hypersexist weatherpersons) would bring the climate back to normal, as it did.
Nine years later, toward the end of 1991, El Nino returned again. As always, the jet-stream set of meteorologists blamed it for storms in the Southeast, unusual cold in Moscow and a temporary reversal of global warming. Pizza-eaters are doing without their anchovy toppings.
Again, with El Nino, we have a recession. Who can now argue that precipitation is unconnected to the world economy, trade winds to trade flows, ocean currents to financial currents? The Bard knew: "There is a tide in the affairs of men. . . ."
But now I am a veteran pundit, seeking -- in this third go-round with El Nino -- more than the satisfaction of cyclical certainty.
What is this warm current, so reverently named and so inexorable in its reappearance, telling us about our world? Clamber up Olympus and catch the view:
First: With all our satellites up and our sonars down, we really know little about the huge forces that determine which way the wind blows. A great deal of our confident prediction, based on such expensive intelligence, is so much guesswork.
Second, the big current event instructs us that there is no flow without an ebb, no trend without a counter-trend, though it may not be equal or opposite. The business cycle within each decade; the Schlesinger political cycles in each generation; the Kondratieff wave of history every half-century -- all this suggests that what goes around comes around.
Finally, El Nino's most puissant lesson: What seems terrible may just be necessary. Maybe Humboldt needs a breather, the winds need a shift, the tectonic plates need to ease their tension, and Earth needs a break from behavior expected by its inhabitants.
Therefore, fellow fixers, stop being so sure about the wisdom of flattening out the cycles, despite the occasional pain. Belay that redistributive urge; pause before fiddling with the planetary rhythms. A pulse is the feelable end of a heartbeat, and what seem to us to be the predations of El Nino may be the cadence of the cosmos.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
The Russian Challenge

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
Russian immigrants gather every day outside the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, on Hillel Street in downtown Jerusalem. They read the notices in Russian pasted on the wall of the building. They vent their frustrations to each other.
Most of them are highly educated people who had good jobs in the former Soviet Union: engineers, economists, scientists, doctors. Now most are unemployed, and anxious. 
 Galina Orman came to Israel last August from Gorky, where Andrei Sakharov was kept for years. A well-dressed woman with dark hair and high cheekbones, she is 47 but looks much younger.
"Yes, people tell me I look no more than 40," she said when we talked through an interpreter. "But that hasn't helped me find a job. I can't even find dirty work. I'll do anything, but I haven't tried washing floors yet." (Another woman, who was a piano teacher, does wash floors.)
In Gorky, Mrs. Orman was a journalist. She does not expect to do that here -- she is just beginning to learn Hebrew. She says she would like to take care of old people.
Mrs. Orman, who is divorced, came with her 16-year-old daughter. They live in the Hotel Diplomat in Jerusalem, where the Government has put many recent immigrants. They can stay there for a year and a half, and they get money for subsistence.
The worry, the desperation in her voice, is for her daughter. She is a ballet dancer, and the arts school she attends costs nearly $1,000 a year in tuition -- which is half-price for immigrants. There are books and private lessons to pay for, and no job.
"It's going to tell on our children," Mrs. Orman said, "and they are the reason we came. We are in the gutter. We are beggars."
Galina Orman's situation is special; every one of the Russians outside the ministry has his or her own story. But the job problem is general. More than half the recent immigrants are unemployed.
The challenge of providing jobs for the Soviet immigrants is colossal. Nearly 400,000 have come since 1989: to a country of only five million. It is as if the United States had admitted 20 million immigrants in two years, people speaking another language and using another alphabet.
But it is also a tremendous opportunity. The Zionist dream was to provide a country for all the world's Jews who wanted to come, and these people could add greatly to Israel's culture and industry and creativity.
The Jewish Agency, which brings immigrants here, says that by 1995 there could be a million from the former Soviet Union. Simcha Dinitz, who heads the agency and was for six years Israel's Ambassador in Washington, says that among them are 112,000 engineers and architects, 170,000 natural and social scientists, 10,000 artists and musicians.
Whether and how fast they come depends on two factors, Mr. Dinitz said in an interview: the situation there and employment prospects here. If there were jobs, the present Soviet immigration rate of about 10,000 a month could double.
"People need the hope that they will not stay at cleaning streets," Mr. Dinitz said -- "that in time they will find professional work."
Even given the difficulty of a small country absorbing mass immigration, the job performance has been weak. One reason is Israel's economic system, which remains heavily state-dominated and Socialist. Another is that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has paid little attention to economic development.
Mr. Shamir's number one priority has been expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. In the last two years the Government has spent about $2 billion on West Bank housing, roads and infrastructure. The new budget calls for 5,000 homes, on top of 21,000 already under way in a massive building program.
Few Russian immigrants want to live in the West Bank or Gaza. "They are moderate people," Mr. Dinitz said. "They want peace. They want their children to have piano lessons." For that matter, few established Israelis want to live in the occupied territories or even visit there. The settlement drive is an ideological one.
What is becoming increasingly plain is that Israel has a choice: to build a society within its pre-1967 borders that will absorb high immigration, or to spend its substance on the ideology of a Greater Israel.

HEADLINE: Protectionism Not Root of Wheat Loss

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On his recent trip President Bush told the Australians that a 30 percent loss in United States wheat production last year was related to trade barriers created by European farm subsidies. In fact, the sharp decline in our wheat production was due to drought and excessive temperatures in much of the country's grain belt. 
 Neither Mr. Bush nor Congress will bring this worrisome news to the American public. Along with six years of drought in California and broken records for high temperatures around the country, the consequences of weather changes in lost crops, dirt storms and hurricane-level wind damage point to the greenhouse effect's becoming a serious factor sooner than anticipated.
The President and Congress have failed to respond to scientists' urgings to stabilize our consumption of fossil fuel and begin to reduce it. The Energy Department has stymied significant progress on developing large-scale production of solar power, wind power, and so on. The promised huge tree-planting project to absorb carbon dioxide has been forgotten despite its potential for putting unemployed youth to work.
World food production fell 6 percent last year. Washington, by stalling world agreement on reducing fossil-fuel use, is playing Russian roulette with both our own and the rest of the world's food supply. To have our President misrepresent the facts on a foreign podium is a sign he has no plan to change this dangerous course.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: REPUBLICANS;
Immersing Himself in Nitty-Gritty, Bush Barnstorms New Hampshire

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTSMOUTH, N.H., Jan. 15

 BODY:
After roaming far and wide and enjoying many foreign adventures, President Bush came back to New Hampshire today. And like Ulysses and other famous travelers before him, he found the home front a mess.
Mr. Bush quickly surveyed the damage and did what any self-respecting politician would do: He begged. He boasted. He posed with -- and petted -- a cow. He tried to look on the bright side, or as he put it, to play the role of "Mrs. Rose Scenario" searching for "the rainbow out there." 
 The President conceded he had "problems out there," but reassured everyone that they did not need to worry about his political or physical health.
 
Argentina Moves North
 "Don't cry for me, Argentina," he told a group of insurance workers in Dover.
Necessity being the mother of political invention, the President put aside his statesman's mien and presented himself as down-home, domestic George Bush, a candidate who understands the pain of a state that has plunged from prosperity to austerity since 1988.
"Message: I care," he told an audience at the Exeter Town Hall.
Mr. Bush began his first day campaigning in New Hampshire, where for weeks Patrick J. Buchanan and the Democrats have been bashing him as insensitive and inept, with a group of 90 business executives and officials who told him horror stories of an ailing state economy.
 
'This Economy Is in Free Fall'
 "I probably have made mistakes in assessing the fact that the economy would recover," Mr. Bush conceded, meeting with the group in a drafty hangar at Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, which was shut down a year ago in a cost-saving effort by the Pentagon -- and remains closed except when Mr. Bush visits his home in nearby Kennebunkport, Me. "I think I've known, look, this economy is in free fall. I hope I've known it. Maybe I haven't conveyed it as well as I should have, but I do understand it.
"I don't know what I have to do to convince people here that I really care about this; I do."
Mr. Bush scampered back to the Tex-prep persona that worked for him in 1988. He suddenly began talking about "bidness" and quoting country music lyrics at every stop.
"I would remind you of another country-western song by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band: 'If you want to see a rainbow, you've got to stand a little rain,' " he told his audiences. At one point, the President seemed so giddy at resuming his fighting campaign demeanor that he called the band "the Nitty Ditty Nitty Gritty Great Bird."
The President's doctor, Burton Lee, hovered as Mr. Bush made his whirlwind round of eight stops in four cities near the New Hampshire coast. But Mr. Bush tried to dispel fears about his health by making a lot of jokes about being glad he did not have the Japanese Prime Minister's dry cleaning bills and being proud of his wife.
"Everyone's been saying, 'Where's Barbara?' " Mr. Bush said at a Rotary Club dinner in Portsmouth. "I told her I didn't need her; I was not going to throw up."
 
Swinging Wildly
 Mr. Bush started out apologetic but he ended up swinging wildly at opponents on the left and right, using his high-pitched campaign voice and what he has called his "red meat" vocabulary.
He lashed out at "mournful pundits," "egghead academicians," "smart-aleck columnists," "jacklegs jumping up demanding equal time with some screwy scheme" and "tired subcommittee chairmen in Washington, D.C., who haven't had a new thought in the 50 years they've been sitting there."
"I am sick and tired every night hearing one of these carping little liberal Democrats jumping all over my you-know-what," he told workers at Cabletron Systems, a computer parts factory in Rochester.
Although Mr. Bush has been back only twice on official visits to the state he credited with catapulting him into the Presidency, he made the most of the fact that he had gone to prep school across the border in Massachusetts and that he had a home across the border in Maine.
"Look, I have not just disovered New Hampshire," he told the business group. "When a storm hits the seacoast here it hits me," he said, in a mention of the storm damage at his house in Maine. Nonetheless, Mr. Bush, who has yet to announce his candidacy officially, plans only two more campaign trips to the state before the Feb. 18 primary.
Mr. Buchanan, the Republican challenger who is on his sixth visit to New Hampshire in five weeks, has been joking that "the President of the world" has visited the state so seldom that the only unemployed person he knows here is John H. Sununu, the chief of staff he fired last month.
Although Mr. Bush tried recently to force the Japanese to buy certain amounts of American goods, he claimed the free trade position today, denouncing opponents as being against free trade and saying he would resist "the siren's call of protectionism."
"It's a weird year here," he told workers at the Liberty Mutual Insurance office in Dover. "You've got crazy people running all over, thinking that the way to put this country back to work is to stop exports."
It was not an easy day for the President -- who in the 1988 campaign had promised not to raise taxes and then raised them -- campaigning in a rabidly anti-tax state. And it did not quite ring true when the President who struck a bipartisan budget deal claimed that the Democratic Congress had "stiffed" him on all his growth initiatives for the economy.
Mr. Bush tried to lean on his strengths: the Persian Gulf war and Mrs. Bush.
"If I'd have listened to the leader of the U.S. Senate, George Mitchell," he said at the Cabletron plant, "Saddam Hussein would be in Saudi Arabia and you'd be paying $20 a gallon for gas."
Mr. Bush, who had sought authorization from Congress to wage war, tried to sidestep that point so that he could swagger about what he could do domestically if Congress were not in the way.
"When I moved those forces I didn't have to ask Senator Kennedy or some liberal Democrat whether we were going to do it," he told audiences. "We just did it."
In fact, it was not that cut and dried. And before Congress voted to give Mr. Bush the authority to go to war with Iraq last January, the House adopted a resolution asserting the exclusive authority of Congress to declare war.
The President also tried to ride on the First Lady's Republican cloth coattails today -- her poll ratings are much higher than his right now -- and it was a far cry from the 1988 campaign when Bush strategists privately worried that the snowy haired Mrs. Bush was not glamorous enough.
"I think people understand when Barbara hugs an AIDS baby or reads to a child," he said, obeying his strategists' instructions to emphasize "family values" in conservative New Hampshire. "I think they understand what we're saying. And that is family is important."
Mr. Bush had some strange moments today with Bush-speak, the articulation problem that sometimes strikes him in high-tension situations.
When asked about the fate of the spotted owl, Mr. Bush said the most important thing was to keep 40,000 loggers at work, but that "Yes, we want to see that little furry-feathery guy protected and all of that."
When he was asked at Cabletron about a possible extension of unemployment benefits, the President replied, "If a frog had wings, he wouldn't hit his tail on the ground -- too hypothetical."
Mr. Bush may not have spent much time in New Hampshire recently, but he displayed a keen understanding today that he would need his listeners' help to remain in office.
"This ain't the easiest job in the world," he told them, finishing his pitch with: "Listen, here's the final word. Vote for me. Don't vote for them. Vote for me, O.K.?"

HEADLINE: U.S. Oil Output Drops; Consumption Also Falls

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Domestic oil production "has begun a precipitous decline," the American Petroleum Institute said yesterday. In a report summing up last year, it also found that consumption fell, so imports also declined, and that oil's slice of the national energy pie dropped to a 40-year low of 41 percent.
The institute, which is the industry's main trade group, said that producers kept up their output in the early part of 1991 because of the Persian Gulf war, but that fourth-quarter crude production was the lowest for that quarter in 30 years, and outside Alaska it was the lowest since 1950. The number of operational drilling rigs, fewer than 800 in the last five months, is the lowest in nearly 50 years. 
 Edward H. Murphy, the institute's director of finance, accounting and statistics, said, "It's quite possible that the age of major domestic production is coming to an end."
Dr. Murphy said that while the whole-year figure made production appear flat, it had been inflated early in the year, when the gulf war raised prices and fears, but lagged later. The recession made demand fall substantially for the year as a whole, so imports were down. Imports rose late in the year, however.
Another energy industry group, the American Gas Association, said sales were up last year and would rise further, inasmuch as gas substitutes directly for oil in factories and electricity-generating stations. More and more, the gas association said, natural gas will also be used directly for air-conditioning, displacing electricity made from oil.
With the Clean Air Act of 1990 forcing electric generators to seek cleaner fuels and promoting the use of natural-gas cars and light trucks, among other factors, the gas industry is expecting growth of 5 percent between 1990 and 1994, said Richard D. Farman, chairman of both the association and of the Southern California Gas Company.
But experts say oil consumption is likely to be flat over the same period. Total energy use will increase only about 1 percent in the period, Mr. Farman said. His association is trying to raise natural gas consumption by 14 percent over the next five years.
The contrast between the two fuels last year is instructive; in the face of a national economy that shrank by about 1 percent, delivery of oil products fell by about 2 percent while sales of natural gas rose by about 1.5 percent. Yet the natural gas industry -- which overlaps with the oil industry to a large extent -- is still weak, because of low prices.
At a luncheon for securities analysts on Wall Street yesterday, Michael Baly 3d, the president of the American Gas Association, said: "Warm weather, the economic recession and some industry financial problems have somewhat masked the strong fundamental outlook for the natural gas industry. But soon, our industry will be taking the mask off."
 
 
Industry Shifts Abroad
 The oil industry is not disappearing, it is only migrating. Daniel Yergin, the energy expert and oil historian, said: "In the newly industrializing countries, demand for oil is going to grow. Exploration and production is outside the U.S., too."
Mr. Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, of Cambridge, Mass., added, "You're seeing a historic shift of resources and of investment, from the U.S. to the rest of the world."
The prospect is for continuing declines in domestic production. Mr. Yergin said, "with the price, the volatility and uncertainty, with people not having the confidence to invest, we're seeing jobs being lost and skills being lost."
He continued, "When we come out of the recession, our oil imports will start growing again."
 
 
Clash With Environmentalists
 The American Petroleum Institute blamed the Government for the production decline, both because it changed the tax code to eliminate some breaks for drillers, and because it is keeping drilling rigs out of the Arctic and offshore areas where the goals and hopes of oil drillers and environmentalists collide.
A year ago, when the war in the oilfields of the Persian Gulf was just starting, many oil executives were hopeful of winning access to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as part of a National Energy Strategy. But opponents, most of whom favored new rules on cars instead, requiring better fuel economy, blocked the energy legislation in the Senate in November.
When the Senate takes up the legislative package again, perhaps this month, most energy experts expect it will be without the provisions on either gas mileage or Alaska drilling.
But the statistics released by the institute also point to a continuing shift in the nation's pattern of energy consumption. The amount of energy consumed per dollar of goods and services produced has been roughly flat for the last six years, the group noted, but the amount of oil has declined by more than 7 percent. Part of the difference was made up by natural gas, which substitutes for oil in home heating and in industrial use, and part comes from continuing decline in gasoline demand, as new cars replace old ones.
 
 
Drop in Prices
 Energy demand has also been depressed by mild weather and the recession. And imports have also been encouraged by the drop in prices since the war. Last week, oil dropped below $18 in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, although it bounced back this week, rising 38 cents yesterday to close at $18.85.
For all of last year, the institute said, petroleum demand averaged 16.648 million barrels a day, down 2 percent from 16.989 million barrels in 1990. Production was up a tenth of a percent, because of a rise at the beginning of the year when producers pushed as hard as possible because of the gulf war. But production in the fourth quarter, at 7.273 million barrels a day, was the lowest in 30 years, the institute said.
Imports were down 5.1 percent from the previous year and accounted for 45.5 percent of demand, the report found; in 1990, they were 47 percent.

HEADLINE: The Art of a Russian Deal: Ad-Libbing Contract Law

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Although there are not yet laws to govern the free market quickly emerging in the Commonwealth of Independent States, contracts are being signed for all sorts of deals as lawyers make up their own rules to cover what is not on the statute books.
The free market, in effect, is not waiting for a legal system. Deals march on, although the contracts that are bringing new ventures to life might be difficult to enforce. That is particularly true of provisions that assign to a new private company such things as machinery, aircraft or buildings still technically owned by the state.
 
'Goods Have to Move'
 "Russian businessmen have gone ahead of the law, but goods have to move," said Armen Kazaryan, a 38-year-old broker whose company trades such items as timber, cotton, oil and tires on Russia's not-yet-legal commodity exchanges. And in that spirit, Russians are signing thousands of contracts, from short-form agreements for the sale of Mr. Kazaryan's commodities to elaborate documents specifying the terms of joint ventures between Russians and Americans. 
 "What we do is write a statute book," said A. James Redway, head of the Moscow office of Coudert Brothers, one of the American law firms that has set up shop here to earn fees writing such agreements. "In New York, you don't have to say that much in a contract because the obligations are clear in laws and in precedent, but here you have to spell out everything."
Even then, two concepts -- mutual benefit and trust -- have come to play a major role in these early days of Russian capitalism. What these concepts come down to is this: If both parties to an agreement are benefiting from the deal, presumably they will not break the contract.
 
Calculating the Risk
 But that usually means both parties have to make money almost from day one. Without solid contract law, it is a rare business executive, Russian or foreign, who is willing to risk investing, say, $100 million to construct a modern appliance factory that will not generate revenue for a year. In the meantime, despite what the contract might say, the factory under construction could be seized or never allowed to open, and the $100 million could be lost.
"In theory, our courts recognize the enforcement of many contracts, as long as they don't contradict existing laws, but there are cases where contracts are simply not acknowledged," said Sergei S. Alekseyev, the chairman of the Inter-Republic Research Center on Private Law, which is drafting legislation intended to address this problem.
The boilerplate agreement that Mr. Kazaryan and his fellow traders sign by the hundreds each day is among those without standing in a Russian court. And that will remain the case until legislaton is enacted by the Russian Parliament formally legalizing the trade exchanges.
Nevertheless, the agreements underscore what Mr. Kazaryan describes as the system of trust on which commodity trading is based -- a trust that is nevertheless violated, with buyers often reneging on payment. They go unpunished, although "there is already a blacklist of people with whom we don't deal anymore," Mr. Kazaryan said.
Mr. Redway's clients face different pitfalls, and they rely heavily on mutual benefit to make a contract stick. He describes the sort of deal for which he writes a contracts: A Houston real estate developer, wanting a Moscow hotel that would cater to foreign travelers paying in dollars, selects a shoe factory as a site. The factory, a money loser, sits on city-owned land "allocated" to it by the Moscow government.
The developer establishes a joint venture with the factory's managers, who "cause the government to reallocate the land for hotel use," Mr. Redway says, perhaps offering bribes to city officials in the process. The city government, in return, gets a monthly lease payment, in dollars, which can be used to repair streets, pay salaries and the like.
The Houston developer, making an investment of under $10 million to convert the factory to a hotel, soon generates dollar revenue. And his Russian partners get their share, "which makes them ecstatic," Mr. Redway says. There is, in sum, mutual benefit.
Neither the defunct Soviet civil code nor those surviving in the new independent republics envisioned such deals, so Mr. Redway, a Princeton-educated American with Soviet lawyers on his staff, spells out everything in the contract: the obligations of all the partners in the joint venture, the right to lease the land, the city government's obligations and the designation of a court to enforce the agreement if something goes wrong. Disputes involving foreigners have usually been settled by an arbitration association in Stockholm.
Contracts existed in the old Soviet Union, but primarily to carry out central planning, Mr. Alekseyev said. A Government plan authorized an auto company, for example, to purchase steel from a mill, stipulating the price to be paid, the quantity and the delivery dates. Contracts ratified the deal, "but every provision was dictated from above," Mr. Alekseyev said. "The order from the center had as much authority as the contract."
The old Soviet Union also had enforcement procedures, primarily a network of arbitration boards at the national level and within the Soviet republics. Those within the old Soviet republics survive in the new independent republics. Mr. Kazaryan's commodity sales agreement cites such boards as the enforcing body once the exchanges themselves are legally recognized.
But such boards, whether in Russia or Stockholm, will most likely have difficulty ruling on the right to use equipment or property that comes into a private venture from the public sector. The cloudy status of such assets of the former Communist government is a major chapter in one joint venture contract put together by Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom, the New York law firm active in Wall Street merger deals in the 1980's and now assisting in deals in Moscow.
 
Until the Music Stops
 The joint venture, an 18-month-old air freight operation, brings together a British company, Heavylift Cargo Ltd., and a Russian group, Volga Dnepr Joint Stock Company. Volga Dnepr contributes three giant Antonov An-124 cargo jets, with pilots, and the British do the marketing, lining up hauling charters all over the world.
A state-owned aircraft manufacturing company that bought shares in Volga Dnepr contributes one of the An-124's, and the military leases two others to Volga Dnepr, which in turn leases them to the joint venture.
The contract details this ownership chain and, with supporting documents, makes the case for the joint venture's right to use the planes, although Bruce Buck, a Skadden, Arps partner, says no one can be sure that a transfer of property will hold up.
And if it does not? "Well, we've made money in the interim, and if the deal stops, O.K.," Mr. Buck said. "Or, to say it a little differently, we'll dance together until the music stops."

HEADLINE: Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Passes Times Publisher's Post to Son

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive officer of The New York Times Company and for 29 years publisher of The New York Times, relinquished the publisher's title yesterday to his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.
As publisher, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. will oversee all aspects of the newspaper, including its editorial-page policy. He will report to the elder Mr. Sulzberger, 65 years old, who intends to continue active participation in the overall company day to day as chairman and chief executive. 
 Mr. Sulzberger Jr., 40, has been deputy publisher since 1988. He represents the fourth generation of his family to head The New York Times, and he is the fifth member to serve as publisher in the 96 years since the family acquired the newspaper. Through several trusts, the family controls about 84 percent of the stock that elects 9 of the Times Company's 14 board members.
 
Forming Management Team
 In a statement yesterday after a meeting of the board, the elder Mr. Sulzberger said: "This promotion is another important step in forming the management team that will lead The New York Times in the years ahead. The appointment will allow me more time to work directly with our other lines of business and to concentrate on the further development of the company."
In an interview, Mr. Sulzberger said: "If you believe in the process of an orderly transition, then you have to 'tran-sit.' It gives me great fatherly pride to turn the publishership over to someone not only qualified, but a son."
Mr. Sulzberger Jr. has worked at The Times since 1978 in many departments, including news, advertising, production and strategic planning. His appointment has been expected throughout the industry as Mr. Sulzberger neared his 66th birthday, on Feb. 5.
 
Planning New Printing Plant
 In recent years, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. has taken a leading role in shaping the paper's future -- helping, for example, to plan the $450 million color printing and distribution plant in Edison, N.J., which is expected to open this year. Mr. Sulzberger Jr. took part in creating the paper's redesigned sports and metropolitan news sections, and has been one of the newspaper industry's most outspoken advocates of diversity in the workplace.
In a letter to the paper's staff, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said, "I pledge my devotion to the precepts that make this paper great: the fairness and honesty of its journalism, the integrity of its business practices, and the decency of its treatment of all individuals."
Reporting to Mr. Sulzberger Jr. will be Max Frankel, The Times's executive editor; Lance R. Primis, the paper's president and general manager, and Jack Rosenthal, editorial page editor.
Founded in 1851, The Times was on the verge of bankruptcy when it was acquired in 1896 by Adolph S. Ochs, a former printer in Tennessee who had become the successful proprietor of The Chattanooga Times. Mr. Ochs, at 38, became publisher of The New York Times and moved north, to live with his wife and daughter, Iphigene. Mr. Sulzberger Jr. is Mr. Ochs's great-grandson.
Upon Mr. Ochs's death in 1935, Iphigene's 43-year-old husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, was named publisher. He served until 1961, when the publisher's chair passed to Orvil E. Dryfoos, 48, whose wife, Marian, was the oldest child of Arthur Hays and Iphigene Sulzberger. The Sulzbergers had four children; the youngest, and the only son, was Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.
In 1963 Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger -- known all his life by the nickname Punch -- became the paper's president and, at age 37, its youngest publisher. He was elected chairman and chief executive of the paper's parent company in 1973.
In 1979, the company gave the title of president and chief operating officer to Walter E. Mattson. Mr. Mattson, 59, retains responsibility for the operating groups of the Times Company, which now includes numerous broadcast, magazine and newspaper properties, and will continue to report to Mr. Sulzberger.
 
Career Marked With Landmarks
 As publisher, Mr. Sulzberger has steered the paper through an era marked by some of the most significant journalistic achievements in the paper's history, including Times v. Sullivan, a landmark First Amendment decision by the United States Supreme Court shielding journalists against many libel suits by public officials. And it was Mr. Sulzberger who made the decision in 1971 to publish the secret Government history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers, and who led the company's successful Supreme Court defense of that decision. He said he took particular pride in the 31 Pulitzer Prizes -- out of the paper's 63 -- awarded during his tenure.
The Times has also expanded considerably as a business, with revenues of $1.7 billion in 1991, compared with $100 million in 1963. Weekday circulation is now 1.1 million, compared with 714,300 in 1963, and Sunday circulation grew to 1.7 million, from 1.4 million, making the Times the nation's largest Sunday paper.
Mr. Sulzberger has been a quiet but active force in the industry and served as chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association and on many other industry boards.
Yesterday, assessing Mr. Sulzberger's contribution to publishing, Katharine Graham, chairwoman of The Washington Post Company, said: "Above all, he took the quality of the product up to an entirely new level. I think he's been an outstanding publisher and a modest and wonderful man -- and he's really funny."
Both those who worked closely with Mr. Sulzberger and members of his family cited as perhaps his greatest overall achievement a refusal to abuse the power that went with being publisher of The Times. While taking his responsibility seriously, they said, he also bore it with a lightness, warmth and and self-deprecating wit that made him a beloved figure throughout the paper.
"It was like inheriting the White House," said A. M. Rosenthal, who served as The Times's executive editor during much of Mr. Sulzberger's tenure, "and he has never used the paper for personal, family, political or financial advantage, ever. That's his monument."
Susan W. Dryfoos, daughter of Mr. Sulzberger's predecessor Orvil Dryfoos, said: "He is so modest, so understated and so wise. It never went to his head." She described the Sulzberger family as "bursting with pride" at Mr. Sulzberger's performance as steward of the family's great jewel.
 
'Shellshocked' Upon Taking Job
 When Mr. Sulzberger became publisher in 1963, The Times and the city's other papers were still reeling from a prolonged strike. And though Mr. Sulzberger was working as an executive at The Times, he was regarded even by some within the family as unprepared for such demanding responsibilities.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Sulzberger recalled being "shellshocked" by having to assume the job.
"My sister Ruth called me after my first day as publisher and asked me how it had gone," he recalled, "and I said, 'I've made my first executive decision. I've decided not to throw up.' "
Gradually, Mr. Sulzberger negotiated critical agreements with unions that effectively opened the door to a new era of using high technology to make the paper's operations more efficient, a process that continues today in the form of the new Edison plant.
But in the early 1970's, The Times faced a financial crisis that the company viewed as a threat to the paper's very existence.
The Arab oil embargo had plunged the nation into recession, and New York City, after years of free spending, was on the verge of bankruptcy. Advertising at The Times plunged by 25 percent from 1969 to 1974.
Mr. Sulzberger's predecessors had fought their way out of similar fiscal emergencies by investing in improvements and by expanding the paper rather than slashing costs in ways that damaged journalistic quality. During World War II, for example, when newsprint was rationed, newspapers had had to choose between reducing space for news or advertising. The Times elected to reduce advertising, which hurt immediate profits but attracted news-hungry readers who remained with the paper when rationing was lifted. The New York Herald Tribune, then The Times's main competitor, reduced its news coverage and never recovered the resulting loss of readership, ceasing publication in 1967.
Taking his family's example, Mr. Sulzberger elected to solve The Times's financial problems by attracting new readers -- and thus advertisers -- by investing heavily in new sections, to broaden the paper's appeal.
The daily paper went from two parts -- a front section and a Metro section -- to four. Each weekday edition was given its own special section: SportsMonday, Science on Tuesday, Living on Wednesday, Home on Thursday and Weekend on Friday. In addition, a daily business section -- Business Day -- was begun. Each of the sections not only had audience appeal, but also offered a new environment for specialized advertising, like financial ads for the business section. Circulation and advertising -- and profits -- rose accordingly.
Mr. Sulzberger also accelerated the policy of acquiring compatible businesses to diversify the company's sources of income.
The Times Company, which he continues to direct, now includes 32 regional newspapers; a one-half interest in The International Herald Tribune, based in Paris; 17 consumer and trade magazines including Family Circle, McCall's and Golf Digest; five television stations; an AM and an FM radio station, WQXR in New York; a news service and other information services, and interests in three paper mills.
 
Finding Lesson In Paper's History
 Mr. Sulzberger Jr. assumes the paper's helm at a time when the New York region is in deep recession and advertising has declined steadily for several years. The company has projected earnings of 55 cents to 60 cents a share for 1991 compared with 85 cents a share in 1990.
But in an interview, he said the fundamental lesson in the paper's history was that "if you have quality information, profit will follow," and he pointed to the recent investments in expanded sports and metropolitan coverage as an indication of his approach.
While Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said the paper would continue to evolve, he said he planned to make no executive changes in the foreseeable future and predicted that The Times would look essentially the same a year from now, except for color in some Sunday sections after the Edison printing plant opens.
As publisher, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. plans to confer daily with Jack Rosenthal, the editorial page editor, as his father did. He said that he and his father were in virtually total agreement about the paper's editorial positions, and that he intended to consult with his father on editorial policy. Indeed, Mr. Sulzberger Sr. said he would continue to write occasional editorials.
 
Father and Son Grew Closer
 The new publisher was born in Mount Kisco, N.Y. While he was still a child, his parents divorced. He lived with his mother, the former Barbara Grant, and his stepfather.
At 14, with his mother's blessing, he elected to live with his father, who had since married Carol Fox Fuhrman. Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said he had made the change to come to know his father better, though their relationship was somewhat strained when the younger Sulzberger adopted the trappings of the 1960's, including wearing his father's old Marine Corps jacket on all occasions.
But he said his father's "civility of spirit" was such that he allowed his son to go his own way largely without criticism, and the two grew very close and remain so. For instance, in his statement on today's editorial page, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said of his father, "It gives me great comfort to know that his presence and counsel will continue for years to come."
In 1970, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. entered Tufts University, outside Boston, where he studied political science and spent several vacations working at various newspapers, including The Boston Globe and The Vineyard Gazette. He said he had already concluded that his essential life ambition was to follow his father's footsteps as publisher of The Times.
"I do not recall ever having that debate with myself, which I consider lucky," he said. "I was not pushed to do it either by myself or some strange sense of responsibility." He added, "It was something I wanted to do as long as I can recall."
Upon graduation in 1974, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. took a job as a general-assignment reporter at The Raleigh Times in North Carolina. The paper, which has since closed, was operated by the Daniels family, which continues to publish The News & Observer in Raleigh.
While in Raleigh, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. married Gail Gregg, whom he met on a visit to his mother in Topeka, Kan., Ms. Gregg's hometown. She was also a journalist, and worked for The Associated Press at the time. The couple have two children.
After two years, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. became a correspondent for The Associated Press in London.
In 1978, when Mr. Sulzberger Jr. finally joined The Times as a reporter in the Washington bureau, he said, he felt he knew what he was doing.
"I wasn't the greatest reporter in the world, but I wasn't starting at zero," he said.
In Washington, Mr. Sulzberger worked on a wide array of subjects ranging from the long-term impact of nuclear testing to the decisions of the Federal Trade Commission. He recalls with some pride an article he wrote about the Panama Canal treaty that "led the paper," meaning that it appeared in the upper-right corner of the front page, the position reserved for the day's most important news article.
In the early 1980's, the family moved to the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the neighborhood where they have lived since then.
As a member of the metropolitan staff, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. worked as a general assignment reporter and covered City Hall. He then became an assignment editor for a year, which he described as "the single most exhausting job I ever had." This was his first management experience.
"I was not a great manager, but I walked around a lot, often without shoes on, and that walking around will cover a multitude of sins," he said, adding that he concluded that the fundamental role of a good manager is motivation.
"It's no different from now," he said, and, indeed, he still walks around a lot, speaking to people in the newsroom, but wearing shoes.
In 1982, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. transferred to the advertising department, where he sold advertising and supervised an advertising sales team.
Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said it was during this period that he began to think carefully about his own management style, which he characterized as a belief in group decision-making that taps the energy and insight of a wide array of participants.
"I don't think leadership demands yes or no answers; I think leadership is providing the forum for making the right decision, which doesn't demand unanimity," he said.
 
Not Afraid Of Mistakes
 This month, in keeping with his management views, he oversaw changes in the paper's business management organization intended to streamline decision-making and encourage innovation and accountability.
After advertising, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. moved to corporate planning, where he learned more analytical skills, and there followed a period in production, including two nights each week as night production manager overseeing the presses at the paper's Times Square plant.
In time, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said, the threads of his multifaceted training began to come together and he was named deputy to his father.
While he said the paper would continue to have "the honesty of its journalism and the honesty of its business practises" as its guiding principle, he said he was not afraid of experimenting and making mistakes.
"If you don't occasionally make a mistake, you aren't trying hard enough," he said.
The appointment of Mr. Sulzberger Jr. as publisher was announced after a meeting of the company's board, which includes the elder Mr. Sulzberger's three sisters -- Marian S. Heiskell, Ruth S. Holmberg and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.
The chairman said that while his son's appointment was not subject to board approval, the members had expressed enthusiasm for the change.
The news also seemed well received by the industry. "Arthur is clearly a very worthy successor to Punch as publisher," said Robert F. Erburu, chairman of the Times Mirror Company.
Yesterday afternoon, at a gathering of hundreds of staff members in the newsroom, Max Frankel, the executive editor, toasted the Sulzberger family for its long commitment to the paper's independence and excellence.
 
A Generation Remains Close
 As a child, during weekend visits with his father, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. often went to Hillandale, the Connecticut estate of his paternal grandparents -- Arthur Hays and Iphigene Sulzberger, whom he and the other 13 Sulzberger grandchildren called Bumpy and Granny.
His generation of cousins remain close, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said, attributing the friendship in part to their time together as children at Hillandale, where the family's heritage was lightly but constantly present. That generation has created a charitable trust, the Hillandale Group, to which they all contribute.
Four of Mr. Sulzberger Jr.'s first cousins also work at the Times Company: Stephen Golden, Ruth Holmberg's son, is vice president for forest products; his brother Michael Golden is senior vice president and general manager of the women's publishing division; Daniel Cohen, Judith Sulzberger's son, is director of sales development in the circulation department of The Times, and Susan W. Dryfoos, Marian Heiskell's daughter, is director of the Times History Project, a continuing video documentary of the paper and the company.
Speaking of his family generally, Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said, "The New York Times is inherent in what we are, but not worn as 'what we are'; it's important and crucial to all of us, but not something that was drilled in, in any specific ways."

HEADLINE: BUSH WOULD TRIM TAX FOR FAMILIES OVER $50,000 LEVEL

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The income-tax cut President Bush plans to propose this month would make families with incomes of more than about $50,000 the biggest winners, drawing a new line in his election year battle with the Democrats over who can develop the more attractive tax breaks for the middle class.
The Democrats, in Congress and on the Presidential campaign trail, have not found a tax policy they can all support, but most of their proposals aim lower on the income ladder than the President's. 
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, assailed the President's policies in a speech today. But pressed by reporters afterward, he declined to say what specific tax policy he would support.
 
An Economic Stimulation
 On the heels of Mr. Bush's campaign trip to New Hampshire on Wednesday, the first of the election year and where he tried to find a firmer footing on domestic and economic issues, new details began to emerge about the budget package he will send to Congress Jan. 29. For example, he plans to propose increasing the personal exemption for a family of four by a total of about $2,000, which would amount to a tax cut of up to $620.
Mr. Bush is expected to argue that a tax cut, which would be immediately reflected in withholding tables, would generate additional spending and stimulate the flagging economy. Democratic politicians tend to accept that view.
But most economists, regardless of their politics, say a tax reduction of $1 or $2 a day would do little to help the economy and would be an especially bad idea if it worsened the budget deficit.
Within the Administration, moderates like Richard G. Darman, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady seem to have won out over conservatives like Vice President Dan Quayle and Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who want much deeper tax cuts and much more costly investment incentives.
"The pro-growth wing of the Administration is not very happy about the growth package," said an Administration official who considers himself part of the conservative wing. "It's anemic." The official said that bold proposals had been "rejected by the Treasury for green eyeshade reasons."
But another official said that Mr. Bush believed the conservatives had no real choice but to back him and that he was more concerned about losing the middle class to his Democratic challengers.
Budgets are always political documents, and that maxim is even more true in election years. For President Bush, the budget this year is crucial to the image he is trying to sell to the American people.
He clearly hopes to use the budget to make several points to voters: that he is sensitive to how squeezed middle-income Americans feel, that he has a well-formed policy in areas like health and education to which his Administration until now has paid relatively little attention and that he recognizes that the collapse of the Soviet Union will allow the United States to spend less on the military.
Democrats have harped on those issues on the campaign trail and in Washington, and the President feels the need to regain the offensive, his staff members say.
With that in mind, say Administration officials and their allies in Congress, the President will propose these new measures in his budget:
*A total increase of about $2,000 in the personal exemptions that a family of four could claim on their income tax return. That would mean a tax cut of $300 for families in the 15 percent tax bracket with a total income below about $50,000, a $560 reduction for those in the 28 percent bracket with an adjusted gross income between about $50,000 and about $100,000 and a $620 tax cut for families in the 31 percent bracket with incomes between about $100,000 and $158,000. Only families with incomes below about $15,000 and above about $280,000 would get no help at all.
*Refundable tax credits for poor people and deductions for the middle class to help offset the cost of medical insurance.
*A tax break of several thousand dollars for first-time homebuyers who buy any but the most expensive houses.
*An additional tax incentive for savings by middle-income taxpayers that would actually raise revenue for the Government in the first year but would cost money in the years ahead when today's budget rules would not apply.
*A change in depreciation rules to encourage businesses to invest in plants and equipment.
*Rules that would allow people actually in the real estate business to deduct their real estate losses from income earned from other businesses or investments.
*Cuts in military spending of about $30 billion beyond what was previously planned for the next five years.
The Democrats want much bigger reductions in military spending. But otherwise, except for their differences over tax policy, the Democrats differ with the President only in the details.
For example, Senator Mitchell, in his speech at the National Press Club today, advocated a tax credit for business investments, savings incentives and help for first-time home buyers.
 
Mitchell Targets Military
 But he called for a $100 billion cut in the military budget over the next five years, and he excoriated what he called the President's "trickle-down" tax policy.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said today that the President's budget proposals "have essentially been decided upon and completed."
But other officials said three issues still were not settled: how exactly to calculate the increased personal exemption, how much detail to include about medical insurance and how extensively to specify the nature of military spending reductions beyond the next fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
The officials said the personal exemption, now $2,300 per person, could be raised by about $500 a person, or it could be limited to children and raised by about $1,000 each. As a tax matter, personal exemptions are counted the same way as deductions. That means the higher one's tax bracket, the more the exemption is worth.
So an additional $2,000 worth of exemptions for a family of four would be worth less for a family in the 15 percent bracket (taxable incomes below $35,801, which means a total income before deductions of about $50,000) than it would for those in a 28 percent or 31 percent bracket.
Democrats tend to favor tax credits in the range of $300 to $450 for a family. A credit is subtracted directly from the taxes owed and is worth the same to all taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Manila Journal;
Wow, It's 'Eee-mel-da!' Now Shopping for Votes

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Jan. 14

 BODY:
To some people, her name may be synonymous with greed and plunder and excess, but Imelda Marcos -- the new candidate for President of the Philippines, who calls herself "mother of the nation" -- is being greeted on stretches of the Philippine campaign trail as a resurrected hero.
It seems as if no one remembers, or cares, about all those shoes. 
 At a campaign rally last weekend along the narrow streets of Onse, a working-class Manila neighborhood, Mrs. Marcos was nearly crushed as she tried to make her way past hundreds of jubilant supporters screaming "Eee-mel-da!"
An old woman in ragged clothes was in tears as she tried to touch the former Philippine First Lady, the widow of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, and to grab a few threads of the white lace handkerchief in Mrs. Marcos's right hand. "We love you, Imelda!" she cried out. "You must be our President."
 
'Sick and Misguided' Policies
 To a degree astonishing to Filipinos who remember the Marcos Government and its rampant corruption and record on human rights, Mrs. Marcos is being taken seriously as a candidate in the May presidential election, the first since the Marcoses were forced into exile in 1986.
Mrs. Marcos, who is 62 years old, waited in a Manila hotel room one day last week and powdered her unlined face, preparing for a live satellite interview for the ABC program "Good Morning America." (Her campaign has received more attention from foreign news organizations than from some of Manila's pro-Government newspapers and television stations.)
As technicians adjusted the camera angle and lights, Mrs. Marcos explained that she had joined the presidential race in part because of what she sees as the public's fury over the "sick and misguided" policies of her nemesis, President Corazon C. Aquino.
"I am so sorry for her and ultimately for the country," Mrs. Marcos said. "Everybody wanted to give her a chance, and she blew it."
With a political shrewdness that surprises many who know her reputation only as that of a world-class shopper, Mrs. Marcos says her attacks on the Government have struck a chord with disenchanted Philippine voters. And she may be right.
 
Fares Poorly in Polls
 "The Philippine people are looking for some kind of relief from this misery and suffering," Mrs. Marcos said, although many Filipinos say there was no shortage of misery and suffering during her husband's 20-year reign. "I had no political agenda when I came home. But when the people speak, Imelda follows."
None of which means that Mrs. Marcos will be the next President of the Philippines; she fared poorly in public opinion polls that were taken just before her entry into the race.
But even if her presidential attempt fizzles out, Mrs. Marcos may still emerge as the election's kingmaker, throwing money and her family's political machine behind one of half a dozen other politicians hoping to succeed Mrs. Aquino, who has said she will not seek a second term.
Although Mrs. Marcos now pleads poverty, she recently acknowledged that $350 million frozen in Swiss bank accounts was her family's. Prosecutors say Mrs. Marcos controls dozens of other, still-secret bank accounts around the world.
Campaign aides of Mrs. Marcos have yet to identify exactly who is paying for her $2,000-a-night hotel suite overlooking Manila Bay, or for the silver, six-door Mercedes-Benz limousine with the license plate IRM -- her maiden name is Romauldez -- that is used to ferry her around the capital.
 
Solicitor General 'Appalled'
 The Philippine Solicitor General, Francisco Chavez, said he was "appalled and disgusted" by the enthusiastic reception that Mrs. Marcos had received since she returned last November from exile.
"It's evidence of the short memory of Filipinos," he said, nodding toward a color-coded chart on his office wall that diagrams the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in the Swiss bank accounts. "She is a thief."
Mrs. Marcos was allowed to return from exile not out of any sense of charity by the Aquino Government, but to face scores of tax fraud and corruption charges brought by Mr. Chavez and his team of prosecutors.
Mrs. Marcos is now being received with open arms by many of the same Filipinos who poured into the streets of Manila six years ago and forced the Marcoses to flee the country.
A senior Western diplomat shook his head as he explained that Filipinos "had simply forgotten about the diamonds and the shoes" -- hundreds of pairs of imported, designer-label pumps found in Malacanang Palace after Mr. Marcos's ouster.
 
An Echo of Reagan
 Mrs. Marcos seems to be enticing voters with a campaign slogan that owes much to Ronald Reagan's famous 1980 dig at President Jimmy Carter. "Are you better off than you were six years ago?" Mrs. Marcos asks at her election rallies.
Six years after Mrs. Aquino took power, the Philippines remains one of the poorest nations in Southeast Asia -- per capital annual income is about $700, the economy posted zero growth last year, inflation is running at 18 percent a year.
"We had poverty and corruption under President Marcos," said Tessie Maglinao, a shopkeeper who attended the Onse rally. "Now what do we have? We have poverty and corruption."
Mrs. Marcos acknowledges that she is seeking the presidency "in small part" to put an end to the criminal charges against her family. She describes the prosecution as a waste of taxpayer money.
"The ultimate victims of this vendetta are the Filipino people, who are crying for help in their struggle for survival," said Mrs. Marcos, who was acquitted on more limited charges in a United States Federal court in New York in 1990, and who seems confident of vindication in the Philippines.

HEADLINE: Seeking Voter Reward, Bush Still Predicts Fall of Hussein

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Facing criticism of a Persian Gulf policy that President Bush hopes will help catapult him to re-election, the White House today offered new predictions of President Saddam Hussein's downfall and proclaimed the war a "tremendous victory."
"We can all take pride in the results of that effort," Mr. Bush said in a written statement marking the passage of one year since he ordered the bombing against Iraqi forces in Kuwait. 
 In the statement, which his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, also read before television cameras, Mr. Bush vowed "to keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein" and called again on the Iraqi people to overthrow their leader. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted that Mr. Hussein would be removed "in the not-too-distant future."
Administration officials have long said Mr. Hussein was crippled by the war and in danger of being overthrown, but there is no indication that the Administration is taking concrete steps to topple him, other than continuing economic sanctions.
 
On Defensive Despite Victory
 The Administration's attempts to cast the war in the most favorable light underscored a political problem Mr. Bush faces as the 1992 campaign unfolds. Instead of celebrating the anniversary as an example of strong leadership, Mr. Bush has found himself increasingly on the defensive not only about Iraq, but also about a broad range of his foreign policies, including the Middle East peace talks, which Mr. Bush declared a central achievement of the military victory over Iraq. And despite an intensive effort to portray his trip to Japan as a success, Mr. Bush has not been able to shake the impression that he went seeking trade concessions and returned with political and personal embarrassment.
Aware of polls showing that Americans are increasingly dubious about the extent of the American victory over Iraq and increasingly critical of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign as well as domestic policy, the White House hopes to keep such criticism from damaging the President's re-election campaign.
Today Mr. Bush focused on an effort to underscore the accomplishments of the American-led coalition that drove Baghdad's army out of Kuwait.
"Kuwait is liberated and the legitimate Government restored, the fires set by Saddam's retreating army are extinguished, the flow of oil from the gulf is secure from political and economic blackmail," the President said.
 
'Dividends' of the War
 Listing what he said were the "dividends" of the partnership he forged to fight Iraq, Mr. Bush said: "A critical region of the world vital to its economic well-being is secure. Thanks in large part to our efforts, direct peace talks between Arabs and Israelis are under way for the first time, multilateral negotiations on regional arms control have begun, and America's hostages in Lebanon are home."
The President added, "Much of Iraq's arsenal is destroyed and what remains is now under international supervision."
But his remarks contrasted with testimony a day earlier by Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, who warned Congress that Mr. Hussein could rebuild Iraq's nuclear, poison-gas, germ warfare and ballistic missile programs within a few years.
In the months between the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, and the onset of combat, critics of Mr. Bush, and some Administration officials, said the President erred by turning the showdown into a personal confrontation between himself and Mr. Hussein and by elevating the Iraqi leader into a larger-than-life figure whom Mr. Bush compared to Hitler.
 
Bush Still Focuses on Hussein
 But since the war, Mr. Bush has kept up his personal focus on Mr. Hussein, as he did today.
"The American people and I remain determined to keep the pressure on Saddam until a new leadership comes to power in Iraq," he said."

HEADLINE: A New Battle Is Ahead for Powell: The Budget

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
As Gen. Colin L. Powell revises American military policy to fit a world without the Soviet Union, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is running into strong Congressional pressure to cut deeper and faster into the Pentagon budget than he would like.
Democratic leaders in Congress have already made clear that reducing money for a few weapons systems while leaving the basic Pentagon budget intact in the 1993 fiscal year will not be acceptable. But so far that appears to be the kind of effort General Powell has in mind for the budget that Congress will start considering next month and that will become effective on Oct. 1. 
 In speeches and Congressional hearings over the last several months, General Powell has discussed his strategic vision for the military after the cold war. It includes a smaller force, tailored for rapid response to regional conflicts, like the war in the Persian Gulf, instead of global combat with the Soviet Union. It is a force with fewer troops serving abroad and fewer nuclear weapons, although still enough to maintain superpower status.
 
Big Troop Reduction
 General Powell's vision is reflected in a five-year plan for military spending that calls for a steady but slow decline of about 25 percent from the current budget of $291 billion by 1995 and a cut in the armed services from their current level of about 2 million troops to 1.6 million by 1995. General Powell contends that the plan remains reasonable, even though it was largely drafted in 1990, before the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
As a concession to Congress, he has found some immediate savings that could wring $6 billion to $8 billion from the $292 billion budget that the Administration will request later this month for the fiscal year 1993. That seems unlikely to satisfy Congress, where members have been talking of cuts in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion.
The savings General Powell has identified would primarily come from the cancellation or contraction of plans to buy several major new weapons systems.
In meetings shrouded with unusual secrecy, Pentagon officials say, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently told the military's uniformed chiefs and civilian bosses that the Navy's new Seawolf attack submarine would be canceled, saving several billion dollars. The Pentagon would also aim to build 20 to 25 B-2 Stealth bombers, not 75 as initially planned, with the plane's cost nearly doubling, to $2 billion. Congress has agreed to pay for only 15 planes.
The cuts recommended by General Powell and Mr. Cheney are expected to be announced in President Bush's State of the Union Message on Jan. 28. But General Powell's staff has been quietly preparing the new reductions since at least November as the opening gambit of a strategy to counter members of Congress who are seeking deeper, faster cuts.
 
Powell Ready for Battle
 "We'll be fighting a legislative war this year instead of one with people getting killed and injured," General Powell said last week, seeming to relish the prospect of a spirited debate with lawmakers over potential threats to the United States and military needs. "But we're not going to be ripping apart the military," he continued in a conversation at a reception given by the French Embassy for American officers who served in the gulf war.
For General Powell, the name of the game is keeping control over how fast the armed forces shrink and avoiding the mistakes he says were made in previous military reductions. Those errors, he says, left American forces woefully unprepared for early battles in World War II and the Korean War.
Until now, General Powell and Mr. Cheney have publicly refused to consider deeper reductions in what they call their "base force" for 1995. This is defined by General Powell as the "minimum force needed for our enduring needs." Under that plan, the Army would shrink to 12 active divisions from 18. The Navy would have 12 aircraft carriers instead of 14, and the Air Force would have 26 wings, down from 36, with 72 planes in a wing.
This smaller force would be concentrated in the United States, with fewer overseas bases. American forces would be designed to respond quickly to regional crises, often using equipment stored on ships or in depots around the world. This differs from the current strategy that relies heavily on deploying troops to hot spots from Europe or Asia.
Some Democrats have called for deeper cuts in troops, but so far no lawmaker has offered any detailed alternative to the Pentagon's plan. Some outside experts have suggested cutting the armed forces to about 50 percent of their current levels. These views are expected to help shape the debate on the size and strategic aims of the military.
 
Lag Seen in Powell Plan
 The General's critics argue that his plan took into account the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, but lags behind the momentous changes caused by the breakup of the archrival superpower.
"No program that was initiated with the specific purpose of deterring the former Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact has a sanctuary today," said Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, criticized General Powell last week for shaping his future force around the capabilities of potential foes instead of specific threats. Mr. Aspin said the notions were unjustifiably vague and out of touch with budget realities.
General Powell retorts that he recognizes the budget crunch, but argues that Mr. Aspin's approach of guessing at threats does not work in an emerging world of unpredictable regional conflicts.
Where past chairmen of the joint chiefs might have dug in their heels to protect military constituencies, General Powell is guided not only by the military's needs but by his own political antennae.
 
Politics in the Budget
 As the President's chief military adviser, General Powell tells Mr. Bush what he needs militarily. As a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, General Powell also knows when Mr. Bush needs some political breathing room on the budget, particularly in a Presidential election year.
Cutting expensive weaponry like the Stealth bomber saves little money immediately because the plane takes several years to build. But it scores quick political points. Senior Pentagon officials say that General Powell has also identified deeper cuts in Army divisions, Navy carriers and Air Force wings in case Congress demands more, but the Administration is trying to delay those reductions until after the fall election or later.
This approach avoids breaking faith with an all-volunteer force in a recession and buys time for Pentagon planners to scale back recruiting, encourage early retirements and take other steps to avoid forcing people out of the military.
"Colin Powell doesn't want to cut forces so dramatically that you put them out of work right after they won a war," said Representative John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on military spending.
General Powell has repeatedly criticized Congress for shielding National Guard forces and armories in their districts from cuts by the Pentagon.
"Sure, it's frustrating" to be choosing cuts in this political environment, General Powell said last week, refusing to confirm the B-2 and Seawolf reports and scoffing at suggestions that any reductions were politically driven. "But Washington is a political town and especially so in a Presidential election year."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Harkin Emphasizes Steadiness but Looks for Lift

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
In a calm aside from his regular verbal assaults on his Democratic rivals and President Bush, Senator Tom Harkin offers his own assessment of his quest for the Presidency: "Unlike the other campaigns, I haven't had any big highs, I haven't had any lows. Just steady as she goes."
This is Mr. Harkins's effort to get his audience to ignore early polls and some pundits' predictions by making a virtue of his own perserverance as Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have enjoyed more of the highs so far. 
 Although the first voting in the Presidential campaign is more than four weeks away, there are signs that Mr. Harkin could use a lift: His fund-raising has been sluggish; he has not kept pace in early polls, and he has been struggling to hang on to support from influential labor groups.
Even Mr. Harkin was at a loss for concrete examples that his campaign was winning over voters in the first primary state. "Patience," the Iowa Democrat said in an interview. "Patience. I'll catch up. My strategy is to peak on Election Day."
Tim Raftis, Mr. Harkin's campaign manager, acknowledged that the Senator had failed to make a convincing case thus far of why people should vote for him. He said the campaign's first two television advertisements, which were unveiled today for use in New Hampshire, were intended to help change that.
The two 30-second television commercials introduced Mr. Harkin as the candidate who would rebuild the nation with new investments. The advertising, created by Ken Swope, a Boston-based consultant, came later than that for Mr. Clinton or Mr. Kerrey. But Mr. Harkin's aides said they would make up for the later start by buying more time for their commercials.
One advertisement is of a shirt-sleeved Mr. Harkin at his announcement speech at an Iowa steak fry last September, promising to build new roads, bridges and schools and health care for everyone. "No more trickle down," he says, with American flags as his backdrop. "Let's have resource-based economics. Put it in at the bottom and let it percolate up for a while."
In the other commercial, Mr. Harkin sits calmly in a chair, a darkened room behind him, telling an unseen interviewer that the nation is wasting too much money on tax breaks for the rich and spending overseas. "I want to be known as the President that rebuilt America," he says.
Joseph Grandmaison, a former Democratic chairman in New Hampshire, said that while some polls had shown Mr. Harkin lagging in the state, he still had enough time to turn his fortunes around. "Voter support can turn on a dime in this state," he said. "My sense of Harkin is that he's very comfortable with what he has to say and delivers his message exceptionally well. There's an interest in seeing what the substance of his programs are as opposed to exclusively Bush bashing."
 
A Catchy New Slogan
 Yet in dozens of appearances over the past several days in Iowa, South Dakota, New Hampshire and Ohio, Mr. Harkin sought to distinguish himself from the other Democrats by presenting himself as the only candidate who could beat President Bush because he was a fiery campaigner whose devotion to traditional Democratic values made him the clearest alternative to the President.
In a catchy new slogan written by an aide that has brought Mr. Harkin laughs at every stop, he asserts: "I'm not a microwave Democrat."
He then compares his opponents to leftovers he heated up in the microwave: "Took it out. It was steamy and hot. I cut into it. It was hot on the outside and cold on the inside. I thought that's like a lot of those Democrats out there running. Boy, they sound like great Democrats. But you pull away the layers and it's still cold, hard-hearted Republicanism."
Mr. Harkin seems to be banking on the hope that his opponents will falter. Asked in an interview what he needed to gain momentum, he talked not about himself but about two opponents: Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton.
While the two rivals rarely mention Mr. Harkin as they campaign through New Hampshire, the Senator readily attacks them. In appearances in South Dakota last week, where he and Mr. Kerrey are both presenting themselves as practically native sons, Mr. Harkin derided the centerpiece of Mr. Kerrey's campaign, a national health care plan, saying "we don't need more taxes on small business."
In a subsequent interview, he criticized Mr. Kerrey as lacking experience. "I don't think that he's been seasoned enough in one term as Governor of Nebraska and three years as a Senator. It's almost becoming clear to many people that he is trying to position himself for 1996."
As for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Harkin asserted that the Governor's support would erode once people learned more about him. He contended that Mr. Clinton's strategy was "to be all things to all people -- conservative to conservatives and liberal to liberals," and that Mr. Clinton had benefited from favorable press coverage because "someone told me that for years he's been schmoozing with the press."
Pressed on why Democrats want another liberal after the defeats of Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Mondale, Mr. Harkin said they "weren't aggressive enough."
Explaining this philosophy to a small but enthusiastic group of union workers in Rapid City, S.D., the other day, Mr. Harkin said: "There are people saying, 'Harkin can't win,' I submit to you, there's a little bit of difference between me and Mike Dukakis. When they swing at me, they'd better duck."
But even many who came out to see Mr. Harkin, and would like to see him in the White House, question the depth of yearning for an old-fashioned Democrat.
"The guys are looking at Clinton and Kerrey," said Ritchie Nordstrom, a Harkin backer, said of his fellow A.F.S.C.M.E. union members in Rapid City. Despite Mr. Harkin's reputation as the closest to labor among the contenders, he said, "I guess they feel that Clinton is more electable nationally."
At another forum in Rapid City, Millie Payne, president of the Western South Dakota Alzheimers Association, came away wondering how Mr. Harkin would finance his sweeping health care program, a question the Senator said he has not resolved himself.
"I felt that he had some good ideas," Ms. Payne said, "But there is going to have to be some way to pay for everyone in the country having medical care. We'd all love it, but the money has to come from somewhere."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
Democrats Press TV Campaigns to Reach New Hampshire Voters

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The Democratic candidates are stepping up their campaigns to woo the voters of New Hampshire, battling it out on the airwaves with advertisements that hammer at the Republicans' management of the economy.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas continued his theme of help for the "forgotten middle class" with a second commercial that began appearing on television in New Hampshire today. 
 In the 30-second advertisement, newspapers bearing headlines about the pay increase for Senators and tax breaks for the wealthy are superimposed on a photograph of the White House at night. The image is a reminder of the vote by Congress for a $23,200-a-year pay raise for senators in the dead of night last July, and it sends a subtle message that the White House supported it.
 
Hitting Hard on Taxes
 Then comes Governor Clinton talking directly into the camera: "For 12 years the politicians in Washington have raised their pay, cut taxes on the rich and raised taxes on the middle class. That's wrong."
And he is not the only Democratic candidate with whom television viewers in New Hampshire are becoming acquainted.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa also began appearing in New Hamsphire today in one of two commercials his campaign has produced. The second is to be broadcast on Friday.
Mr. Harkin's commercials, produced by Ken Swope, a media consultant who worked on some of the advertisements for Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 primary campaign, blend patriotic images and a sharp partisan edge.
One features Mr. Harkin in shirt sleeves at a rally, American flags flapping behind him. "Let's put this country to work," he tells the audience. And in contrast to the Republican message of trickle-down economics, Mr. Harkin suggests: "Let's put it in at the bottom, let it percolate up for a while."
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska joined the advertising fray last Friday. He shifts from talking about his record in the Vietnam War to a discussion of health care and he assails President Bush for his recent trip to Japan to "beg for a few concessions."
Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, has appeared in two commercials. The first shows him swimming laps, with an announcer saying that Mr. Tsongas has confounded the naysayers throughout his political career.
In the second, Mr. Tsongas talks of his accomplishments as a Senator, including his role in winning Congressional approval for a bailout of the Chrysler Corporation.
No political commercials have appeared for Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California. He is relying on radio and on an "800" telephone number to carry his message and to raise money.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Quintessential Insiders Put on Airs of Outsiders

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Caveat New Hampshire.
There are two Republicans wandering around your state claiming that they disdain everything Washington stands for, that they are fed up with everyone who runs the city and that they would like to boot out all those colluding, golf-playing, inside-the-Beltway bums. 
 Do not believe George Bush and Patrick J. Buchanan when they claim to be outsiders. As the President himself might say, they are really wolf kind of guys out there in sheep's clothing.
The Republican rivals sparring over who is the true outsider are both quintessential Washington insiders, having spent, between them, more than 65 years in this town.
 
Live-in Bureaucrat
 Mr. Buchanan is a home-grown pundit and former aide to three Presidents who lives so close to the Central Intelligence Agency in suburban Virginia that his cat keeps setting off the security sensors buried in the woods around the agency headquarters. This would-be populist says he has never even ridden the Washington subway.
Mr. Bush has been a Government official, chauffeured around in Government cars, for so long that his main experience behind the wheel in the last couple of decades has been in a golf cart. He drives so seldom -- there was a picture-taking session once with a car fueled by ethanol -- that Barbara Bush said she was nervous about riding with him.
When Mr. Bush tried to get a tax break on the house he bought in Kennebunkport, Me., in 1981, the Internal Revenue Service refused and told him that his principal residence was the Vice President's mansion on a naval installation in Northwest Washington. It was reminiscent of the Postal Service's declaring Macy's Kris Kringle the real Santa Claus in the classic Christmas movie, "Miracle on 34th Street." When the revenue service declares you a live-in bureaucrat, the label sticks.
Consider this, New Hampshire: Mr. Buchanan, as a speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon, and Mr. Bush, as chairman of the Republican National Committee, were among the last officials in Washington to offer a defense of Mr. Nixon during Watergate, and that is about as far inside the Beltway as you can go.
 
Yearning for an Outsider
 Whether it was Dwight D. Eisenhower coming home from war, Jimmy Carter marching up from Georgia or Ronald Reagan galloping in from the West, Americans have long had a romantic yearning for a bold outsider who could tame the Jabba-the-Hut bureaucracy. Even though voters realize that politicians shamelessly exploit their desire for a political Robin Hood, this longing has intensified this year, with surveys showing that Americans are more disgusted than ever with the Federal Government.
Of course, except for Walter F. Mondale in 1984, the Democrats have usually presented themselves as outsiders in recent campaigns. They do not have much choice, having been shut out of the White House for a dozen years now.
But the Republican race has put an absurd twist on the insider-outsider debate, with an incumbent President with one of the longest Government resumes in history and a Washington native and member of the city's journalistic elite competing for outsider status.
When Mr. Buchanan appeared on Wednesday night as a guest on his former Cable News Network program, "Crossfire," his one-time partner, Michael Kinsley, asked him how he could portray himself as the anti-Washington candidate.
"You lived here all your life," Mr. Kinsley said. "You've either been in the media or the Government. You never had an honest job in your life and you've never run anything in your life. What makes you qualified to be President and run the whole country and makes you qualified to portray yourself as some sort of outsider populist?"
 
Shameless Flattery
 With the sort of shameless geographic flattery that passes for logic in a campaign, Mr. Buchanan replied, "Well, what qualifies me, if I am qualified, will be the people of New Hampshire."
Asked on a plane ride home from New Hampshire last week how he could present himself as an outsider, Mr. Buchanan replied: "I am in Washington, not of it. No insider challenges an incumbent President. That makes me, de facto, an outsider."
Politics, as the much-wooed voters of the first primary state know better than anyone, is a matter of perception. And these two old Washington hands believe that they can give the impression of being fiery populists through their rhetoric.
Mr. Buchanan argues that Mr. Bush has lost the right to be President because he has cozied up too much to the Democrats, cutting tax and budget deals with them and then "going off to play golf with Dan Rostenkowski."
Indeed, Mr. Bush, who is not only a bureaucrat but a bipartisan at heart, does like to play golf with the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
But at the Rotary Dinner in Portsmouth, N.H., on Wednesday night, Mr. Bush blasted "these tired subcommittee chairmen in Washington, D.C., that haven't had a new thought in the 50 years they've been sitting there" and accused the Democrats of offering "cheap promises coming out of deep left field, past the running track, up against the fence, in the left field" on the economy.
Even though Mr. Bush has made more official visits to Japan since he was elected President than to New Hampshire, he said that he felt so close to the state that he had "New Hampshire values," rather than bad old Washington values. Mr. Bush explained New Hampshire values this way: "Remember Lincoln, going to his knees in times of trial and the Civil War and all that stuff."
 
Good Ol' Boy Drawl
 Mr. Bush also says he believes it makes him more down-to-earth when he puts on a bit of a good ol' boy drawl, dropping the final consonant of words like fixin' and drillin'. At the Cabletron Systems computer parts plant in Rochester, he began a sentence concerning the Persian Gulf war with his usual manner of speaking, starting to say "about to begin," and then thought better of it and switched to a Southern synonym mid-phrase, "It was one year ago, one year ago that Desert Storm was about -- fixin' to begin, as they say in another of my home states, Texas."
Mr. Buchanan's vivid oratorical style, his manner of insulting highly placed Washington officials with Don Rickles-relish, is his main weapon in helping the Washington native project an outsider persona.
He mocked the budget director, Richard G. Darman, as the "Doctor Kevorkian of the American economy," referring to the doctor who invented a suicide machine, and suggested that Environmental Protection Agency officials were tree-huggers who were "walking around in sandals."
Mr. Buchanan said two Bush campaign strategists, Charles R. Black Jr. and James H. Lake, who have stirred controversy for having Japanese business clients, "should be wearing kimonos." And he said the Republican Party should change its moniker from "the big tent" to "the big pagoda."
But, whatever they say, New Hampshire, remember that these two men are not only insiders, but insiders who want to make you believe that they are outsiders so that they remain in Washington as insiders even longer.
Now you know.

HEADLINE: University of Bridgeport Plans Takeover by Sacred Heart

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Jan. 16

 BODY:
The University of Bridgeport said today that it has decided on a plan to have all its programs, including its law school, taken over by Sacred Heart University in Fairfield.
But the announcement set up a confrontation between the financially troubled University of Bridgeport and its law school that could undermine not only the agreement with Sacred Heart, but also the law school's own accreditation. 
 The law school's faculty has voted unanimously to affiliate with another private institution, Quinnipiac College in New Haven. Today's announcement, in effect, was notice that the university's trustees will fight that move.
Sacred Heart has said the 750-student law school must be part of any plan for it to take over Bridgeport's programs.
 
Issue of Viability
 The declaration of war between the university and its law school was evident this afternoon in the auditorium, where the decision to affiliate with Sacred Heart was announced. Hundreds of law students loudly heckled every speaker, from Edwin G. Eigel Jr., the university's interim president, to Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.
"The issue that is at stake here is the viability of an entire university, not just one school," said Senator Dodd, plainly angry at the shouts and taunts. "There are thousands of other students, and they deserve an education, too."
Officials from Bridgeport and Sacred Heart said the collaboration would preserve a college campus in Bridgeport's South End, where the University of Bridgeport owns 85 acres. Keeping the university's jobs and students in the city has been a prime goal of Senator Dodd and other local, state and Federal officials who have worked to keep the university from shutting down entirely.
 
Matter of Accreditation
 But the law school has vigorously pursued a move to another institution since October, when the University of Bridgeport's trustees appeared ready to consider an offer to affiliate with the Professors World Peace Academy, an institute financed by the Unification Church.
The issue, the law faculty and students say, is not the economic health of the city of Bridgeport, but the fact that the law school is in danger of losing its accreditation from the American Bar Association because of the university's troubles.
Sacred Heart, they say, is not strong enough financially and academically to satisfy the A.B.A.'s requirements; Quinnipiac is.
"They have apparently turned this into a political circus, saying affiliation with Sacred Heart will serve the local community, without acknowledging they'll just lose accreditation," said Terence H. Benbow, whom Mr. Eigel dismissed as law dean in November.
Mr. Benbow, a faculty member, is still considered dean by the law faculty and students. Mr. Eigel cut short today's news conference when Mr. Benbow, supported by chanting students, demanded to speak.
Mr. Dodd and other speakers suggested today that the law students were selfishly thinking only of themselves, rather than of the entire university. But as registration for the spring semester continues this week, it remains unclear just how many students are left at Bridgeport, which had an enrollment of 9,100 in 1969.
The university began this academic year with 3,900 students, about half of them part-time. After a fall semester filled with turmoil, sharp cutbacks in academic programs and the threat of closing, the university expected enrollment to drop by as much as a third, to 2,600.
Today Mr. Eigel said more than 2,600 students had registered, but there were no figures on how many full-time students were among them, beyond the law students and seniors hoping to graduate this spring.
Neither Mr. Eigel nor the president of Sacred Heart, Anthony J. Cernera, who issued a statement, offered details of their collaboration except to pledge that they would keep part of the University of Bridgeport's campus open.
The president of Quinnipiac, John L. Leahy, and Mr. Benbow will make a presentation on Feb. 1 to the American Bar Association's council on legal education, seeking provisional accreditation for the school at Quinnipiac. Bridgeport and Sacred Heart also plan to make a proposal to the council.
One danger now, Mr. Leahy said, is that each side in the dispute could thwart the other, leaving the law school without any accreditation.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
30-Year Bond Off More Than Point

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates rose for the sixth straight session yesterday, as credit market participants sold Treasury bonds and long-term notes despite additional evidence that inflationary pressures are very tame.
Prices were off sharply, with the benchmark 30-year bond down more than a point. That pushed its yield up to 7.66 percent, compared with 7.57 percent late on Wednesday. 
 Traders chose to focus on the prospect of an early end to the economy's current problems rather than look at the moderate inflation report from the Government.
Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in December and at a 3.1 percent rate for all of 1991, down from 6.1 percent in 1990.
 
Betting on Recovery
 Bond investors usually warm to indications that inflation pressures are easing, because lower inflation rates tend to increase the value of fixed-income securities. But the recent news, coupled with forecasts from most economists that inflation is not likely to become a threat through all or much of 1992, has been of scant solace lately.
"People are betting on an imminent recovery," one government securities trader said. "They have been doing that in this market, in the stock market and in the foreign exchange market.
The trader added: "It's a bit like what happened last April, after we got that surge in confidence at the end of the gulf war. Market participants have a tendency to re-create old trades, and they are putting on the post-gulf trade now."
The sense that the economy's fortunes may be about to improve began on Dec. 20, when the Federal Reserve Board sent a clear, bold signal to financial markets by cutting its discount rate a full point, to 3 1/2 percent, and lowering its target on the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to 4 percent.
To many credit market participants, the nature of the Fed's move implied that the central bank would follow up its actions with further reductions in short-term rates.
Economic reports since then have continued to show an economy in distress, but the Fed has been silent.
Fed officials have suggested publicly in recent days that the actions already taken will be sufficient to initiate a recovery. But the rise in interest rates over the last week has made that forecast a bit shakier, analysts said.
 
'A Return to Gradualism'
 "The spirit of Dec. 20 has evaporated," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "In December, the Fed moved boldly. Since then their language and actions suggest a return to gradualism. Those factors, in turn, have withdrawn the rally that had been in place."
Over the last week, long-term bond yields have risen by more than 25 basis points, or more than one-quarter of a percentage point.
That increase is forcing up home mortgage interest rates, a move that could jeopardize further improvement in housing activity.
The shift in sentiment that Mr. Soss identified as a big cause for the rise in rates has been augmented by a huge volume of new corporate bonds. To hedge positions against unsold corporate inventories, fixed-income traders have been selling Treasury securities over the last week.
"There is always some technical flow-of-funds aspect that intersects with demand for securities," Mr. Soss said. "But if spirits were bullish, the corporates would be sold, and the spirit would be there."
 
$1 Billion Offering
 Traders said a $1 billion offering of 30-year bonds from Hydro-Quebec, the Montreal-based electric utility, played a role in the sharp selloff in the Treasury bond market yesterday.
In late trading, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at 10327/32 , down nearly 1 1/4 points, or almost $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 7.66 percent.
On Jan. 8, the last day of the market's rally, long-term bond yields stood at 7.38 percent.
"There is no reason why long rates should be stuck above 7.50 percent, let alone move back toward 7.75 percent or 8 percent," said Victor Chang, president of VC Management Inc., a New York-based money management firm.
"It may be the economy is no longer going down," Mr. Chang added, "but we are still in what is likely to be a prolonged period of slow growth with inflation falling to under a 3 percent rate."
Prices of long-term Treasury notes continued to be hammered, but for the first time since the current selloff began, prices of short-term issues were little changed.
Among note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 10214/32 , down 3/4 point, to yield 7.14 percent. But the 5 percent two-year notes dipped by just 2/32 , to a price of 9929/32 , to yield 5.05 percent.
During the last week, yields on two-year securities have risen by more than 40 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.78 percent, down 2 basis points. And six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount to a late offered rate of 3.87 percent.
The Hydro-Quebec offering dominated activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
The $1 billion worth of 8.40 percent 30-year bonds were priced at $99.268 to yield 8.467 percent, 85 basis points more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
First Boston acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated Aa-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In addition to the Hydro-Quebec securities, investors had the opportunity yesterday to purchase the first publicly sold debt issued by Woolworth since May 31, 1974.
The retailing concern priced $200 million worth of 30-year securities through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 8.50 percent bonds were priced at $99.425 to yield 8.553 percent, 90 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's and A by S.& P.
The slide in Treasury prices continued to have an adverse effect on outstanding issues in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and in the tax-exempt municipal securities market.
Traders in the corporate market said that prices of most issues fell by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, prices of the most widely quoted bonds were down by a full 1/2 point, participants said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell sharply in the week ended Jan. 6.
Because of technical factors, most analysts had been anticipating large declines in the monetary aggregates. But the numbers reported yesterday far exceeded expectations, especially the $25.2 billion drop in M-3, the broadest money measure.
The surprising weakness in the numbers reported by the Fed had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index Up 3.1% in '91, 5-Year Low

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Consumer prices advanced a moderate three-tenths of a percent in December, the Labor Department said today, helping to hold inflation to a five-year low of 3.1 percent for the year. The rate was nearly half the 1990 rate of 6.1 percent.
Two-thirds of the moderation in inflation last year came from a big swing in oil prices, which soared after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and then fell after it became clear the Persian Gulf war would not permanently crimp the world's oil supply. 
 Energy inflation hit a 10-year high of 18.1 percent in 1990. In 1991, energy prices fell 7.4 percent.
Even after factoring out the volatile food and energy sectors, inflation was still down. The core rate was 4.4 percent last year, down from 5.2 percent in 1990 and from the same level as in 1989.
In December, the core inflation rate was three-tenths of a percent, the same as November.
Analysts attributed the long period of moderation in the price index to the economic decline and stagnation that began in July 1990. Consumers' reluctance to borrow and spend has forced retailers to hold prices steady or watch lackluster sales erode.
 
Lowest Since '86
 The inflation rate for last year was the lowest since 1986, when prices rose 1.1 percent. It was the second-lowest rate since 1967, when prices were up 3 percent.
The December rate compared with a November price gain of four-tenths of a percent.
"We have some problem areas, like health care and college tuition, but if you take that out, you're really talking about a minuscule amount of inflation," said Lawrence Chimerine, a senior adviser at DRI-McGraw Hill, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
With most analysts expecting only a weak economic recovery this year, the prospect is good for only moderate inflation, between 3 percent and 3.5 percent.
At the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said the Administration was "especially encouraged by the sharp deceleration in price increases." But, he said, "Obviously, the unfortunate side of it is a good deal of that is because of the economic slowdown."
 
Jobless Claims Down
 Separately, the Labor Department said today that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell to 403,000 for the week that ended on Jan. 4, down from 452,000 the previous week.
The decline, after an increase the week before, could be good news, but analysts cautioned against reading too much into weekly fluctuations in the volatile number. They also noted that the occurrence of New Year's Day in the middle of the week left laid-off workers with one less day than usual to file claims.
In a third report, the Labor Department said Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, increased by seven-tenths of 1 percent in December, after a rise of one-tenth of a percent in November. But, over the year, real weekly earnings were up just three-tenths of 1 percent.
Last year, inflation was marked by a 2.5 percent rise in food and beverage prices, the smallest gain since 1976, when they were up just five-tenths of a percent. The most significant factor was a 2.1 percent decline in 1991 meat prices, which had been up by 11.3 percent the year before.
 
Food Up 0.4%
 In December, food prices rose four-tenths of a percent, the same as in November. But vegetable prices moderated, rising only by eight-tenths of a percent after being driven 4.4 percent higher in November by the infestation of the whitefly in California. Lettuce prices, for instance, fell 15.7 percent in December, after soaring 44.5 percent in November.
Although energy was responsible for much of the inflation moderation in 1991, other sectors showed smaller cost increases.
Housing costs were up by 3.4 percent, compared with 4.5 percent a year earlier; clothing and upkeep costs, by 3.4 percent versus 5.1 percent in 1990, and medical care, by 7.9 percent, after a 9.6 percent gain.
The various changes in December put the index for all consumer items at 137.9. That means a hypothetical selection of goods that cost $100 in the 1982-84 base period cost $137.90 in December 1991 and $133.80 a year earlier.

HEADLINE: A New Loss At Security Pacific Seen

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The Security Pacific Corporation said today that it expected to lose about $400 million in the fourth quarter, its second consecutive hefty loss. Officials at the BankAmerica Corporation said the new loss would not deter it from going ahead with its acquisition of Security Pacific.
"That was all in line with our expectations," Frank N. Newman, BankAmerica's vice chairman and chief financial officer, said at a news briefing here today. BankAmerica reported its own earnings for the fourth quarter of $285 million, roughly equal to the $287 million reported a year earlier. 
 The expected loss at Security, which will report its full results on Tuesday, reflects the addition of $730 million to reserves for loan losses. The Los Angeles-based bank has been buffeted by loan problems stemming largely from the slump in the California economy, particularly in real estate. These problems helped make Security receptive to BankAmerica's takeover offer.
In the third quarter, Security had a net loss of $509 million after setting aside $1.2 billion for loan loss reserves. For the year, Security said today that it expects to lose about $765 million.
The possibility that BankAmerica, which suffered its own horrendous loan problems just a few years ago, might drag itself down by taking on Security Pacific's troubled portfolio has always been the big uncertainty surrounding the deal.
The transaction, a stock swap valued at more than $4 billion when it was announced in August, would create the largest bank in the West and second largest in the nation behind Citicorp. The acquisition has been accepted by shareholders of both companies but still needs regulatory approval.
Mr. Newman of BankAmerica declined to say whether he expected further problems in Security Pacific's performance. But he said that even with the new losses, the combined bank would have adequate capital and would "start out with a fully adequate reserve" for loan losses.
 
BankAmerica Satisified
 Thomas Brown, banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said actions taken by Security Pacific now to clean house would just mean less for BankAmerica to do after it completed the merger. Given the huge expected savings in expenses from the merger, "The problems have to become a lot worse before this doesn't make sense for BankAmerica," he said.
Mr. Newman termed BankAmerica's own earnings as pleasing in light of the weak economy. While net income was equal to that of a year ago, earnings per share of $1.20 were a bit less than the $1.29 a year ago because of an increase in shares outstanding.
For the year, BankAmerica reported record net income of $1.124 billion, compared with $1.115 billion in 1990, making it the third year in a row that the bank has exceeded $1 billion in earnings. On a per share basis, earnings were $4.81 in 1991, compared with $4.95 in 1990.
BankAmerica did not completely escape the loan problems that have afflicted its California rivals. Its net credit losses in the fourth quarter were $279 million, more than double the $132 million a year ago. The provision for credit losses in the quarter was $275 million, up from $210 million in the third quarter and $250 million a year ago.
Nonaccrual assets other than those related to countries that are restructuring their debt were up $202 million from one quarter ago and $873 million from a year ago.
But the San Francisco bank offset loan problems by increasing revenue, both from interest and fees, and controlling expenses. There were also gains from sale of investment securities and from the disposition of formerly leased aircraft.
On the New York Stock Exchange, BankAmerica's shares slipped 12.5 cents, to $41.375, while Security Pacific was unchanged at $34.75.
While the weakening of the California economy has caused problems for banks in that state, many banks elsewhere are reporting that the worst of their loan problems are past.
The Continental Bank Corporation, Chicago, for example, yesterday reported a $159 million decline in its troubled loans since Sept. 30 to $814 million. The drop in bad loans, plus reduced losses on its worst loans, helped the company earn $50 million in the fourth quarter, or 77 cents a share, up 42.9 percent from $35 million, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. Because of heavy loan losses earlier in 1991, Continental lost $76 million, compared with a 1990 profit of $75 million, or 70 cents a share.
Continental's shares gained 50 cents, to $12.625.

HEADLINE: Volunteers or Not, Tennessee Lawyers Help Poor

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 14

 BODY:
So many natives signed up for the War of 1812 and the Alamo that Tennessee became known as "The Volunteer State." But at the Knox County courthouse these days, the proud tradition of Tennessee voluntarism is being sorely tried. With the court docket clogged, the public defender's office swamped and the state's treasury depleted, every lawyer in the county has been ordered to represent the poor at no charge.
The notion of mandatory public service for lawyers has been bitterly debated by bar groups throughout the country and, some courts have ruled, is of dubious constitutionality. But in Tennessee, a state so strapped for cash that it has grounded fleets of school buses, the judges are assigning first and asking questions later. 
 A June 1991 study commissioned by the Tennessee District Public Defenders Conference found that each lawyer in a public defender's office in the state was handling an average of 430 cases -- more cases than their counterparts anywhere else.
 
A Role for Mayor
 So this month, the four judges of General Sessions Court, which handles misdemeanors, decreed that all of Knoxville's 1,200 licensed lawyers would be assigned to represent indigent clients. That includes Mayor Victor Ashe, who hasn't practiced law for years and has never handled a criminal case.
In a pincer movement on the local bar, the judges promptly began selecting lawyers from either end of the alphabet for appearances in sessions court. But with the public defender's office choking on felony cases, too, criminal-law novices like Mayor Ashe may soon be all that stands between poor defendants and years of incarceration. "This is a crisis situation," said Bob McGee, one of the four judges to sign the decree.
If Knoxville's remedy is unusual, its problems are typical of those facing beleaguered public defenders everywhere -- a result, defense lawyers say, of recession and particularly the war against drugs. In Seattle, according to the National Center for State Courts, criminal filings more than doubled between 1983 and 1989. Over roughly the same period, the number of defendants charged with drug-related felonies doubled in Chicago; between 1981 and 1988, they more than doubled in Los Angeles, too. Public defenders in Louisiana and Georgia have filed suits claiming they they cannot both handle their caseloads and meet their ethical obligations to individual clients.
 
One Place to Cut
 "At times like this, one of the first things governments do is look around and say, 'Why are we paying all this money to defend these criminals?' So they cut back on the already meager resources available to indigent defense programs," said Mary Broderick, director of the defender division of National Legal Aid and Defender Association.
On Feb. 4 Mayor Ashe will appear on behalf of a 19-year-old man charged with trespass. Dick Wirtz, acting dean of the University of Tennessee's law school and an authority on intellectual property and antitrust, is handling a shoplifting defense. The university's general counsel, Beauchamp Brogan, has also been assigned, as has Bruce Anderson, an insurance defense lawyer and president of the Knoxville Bar Association.
Both Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander and Howard Baker, the former White House chief of staff, are on the lawyers' list, but as nonresidents of Knox County they appear to be exempt from the requirement. Not so Jimmy Duncan, the local Congressman. Or James Clayton, whose mobile-homes company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Or hundreds of other lawyers who know chapter and verse about leases, alimony and medical malpractice but nothing about assault or battery.
 
A State With Problems
 Mark E. Stephens, the city's public defender, contends that legal services for the poor bore a disproportionate share of the cuts in the state judiciary's $37.7 million budget, and that the poor in Knoxville were suffering more than those in Memphis or Nashville, whose public defender programs are older and better financed. It is, local residents say, something of a state tradition.
Ever since the Civil War, when its poorer, non-slave-owning residents opposed secession, Tennessee east of the Cumberland plateau has considered itself the state's stepchild. This is particularly true of Knoxville, whose terrain, Republican politics and barbecue are more redolent of Asheville than of Nashville or Memphis.
In July, citing the state's budgetary problems, Chief Justice Lyle Reid of the Tennessee Supreme Court urged the state's trial court judges to appoint public defenders, rather than private counsel, wherever possible. Before Tennessee established a public defender system, courts appointed lawyers to represent the poor, and they continue to do so in many cases, particularly those involving more than one defendant, when conflicts of interest can arise. Most other states have one or the other system, or elements of both.
By November, the caseload of the Knoxville public defender's office had doubled, and Mr. Stephens persuaded the General Sessions Court to assign no more cases to his office until Jan. 25. He has now asked the courts for the same relief for felony cases, and said he may decline assignments regardless of what they decide.
"I'd be willing to go to jail, even though I'd be afraid of who they'd appoint to represent me," he said.
 
Not Many Excuses
 The judges' order, issued on Jan. 7, made clear that no malingering would be tolerated. "No lawyer will be excused for any of the following reasons: (a) does not accept appointed cases; (b) does not practice criminal law; (c) is too busy," the order stated. It went on to state the only three acceptable excuses: physical infirmity, retirement or death.
The program has created some schisms in the local bar. Large corporate law firms like Baker, Worthington, Crossley, Stansberry & Woolf -- the "Baker" is Howard -- plan to assign their collective criminal caseload to a dozen junior lawyers. They have been told that they can call criminal lawyers elsewhere in town, should they feel lost or incompetent. Other firms can bring in ringers. Mr. Ashe, for instance, has enlisted the help of a lawyer in the city's legal staff, though he maintains he will handle the case himself.
 
'Fish Out of Water'
 Sole practitioners do not enjoy such luxuries. "I'm very unhappy about it," said Douglas J. Toppenberg, a divorce lawyer. "The big firms aren't having to dirty their hands at all, and while I'm sure the Mayor will show up in court for all the publicity shots, he's delegating his case. It's leaving small practitioners like me to bear the brunt of it.
"Most defendants admit their guilt and want an attorney to negotiate a very minimal sentence," he continued. "But if someone says he's innocent and insists on a trial, I'm going to feel like a fish out of water."
Then there are those lawyers, like Patrick Leonard, who have long made their livings off court-appointed work. Even after Knoxville's public defender office opened last year, they continued receiving assignments, for which the state pays $20 to $30 an hour.
But when state funds began drying up, that range was reduced to $5 to $7.50 -- less, one lawyer for the indigent pointed out, than an employee at McDonald's gets. Now, the funds have run out altogether. On Tuesday, 40 of these lawyers met to discuss their options, including suing the state and withdrawing from the cases they are already handling.
 
Starting From Scratch
 The public service requirement has moved at least one lawyer, 69-year-old Charles Amburn, to retire. Dozens of other lawyers have been forced to recall ancient courses in criminal law or to seek the advice of experienced criminal defense lawyers.
Defense counsel report receiving a flurry of such phone calls in the last two weeks, asking them such questions as "What is a warrant?" "Where is the General Sessions Court" and "What is a 'quail'? " (a quail, they are told, is a $20 heat-sealed bag of cocaine).
Judge McGee, too, has received numerous calls from "panic-stricken" lawyers, including one from the University of Tennessee who needed directions to the local jail. "They don't understand why they have to be dragged into an arena they didn't ask for, aren't qualified for and aren't getting paid for," he said. "And they won't suffer the insecurity and fear of a criminal defendant who doesn't know what kind of lawyer he's going to get."
The Mayor's client, Scott Hurst, said that when he was first told that his lawyer's name was Victor Ashe, "I figured it was someone else, not him." Only when a court officer told him that Mr. Ashe's office was convenient -- five flights upstairs from the courtroom -- did he realize he had landed Knoxville's leading citizen.
Asked if he felt competent to handle Mr. Hurst's case, he replied, "At this stage." But Mr. Hurst seemed unconcerned that Mr. Ashe and the lawyer working with him lacked criminal law experience. "I think they'll help me," he said.
Mr. Leonard, who is representing a co-defendant in the case, was not so sure. "If this ended up a felony and it went to trial," he said, "and with the Mayor not having any practical criminal experience ever, I think I'd really be concerned.
"At the time, Scott kind of laughed along with everyone else. He may come to the realization that it's not a joke any more."

HEADLINE: Chief of Transit Officers Resigns After 21 Months

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
William J. Bratton, who as chief of the New York City Transit Police for the last 21 months had earned high marks as a manager and motivator, resigned yesterday to take the No. 2 position in the Boston Police Department.
New York police and transit officials said Chief Bratton had engineered a remarkable turnaround in the New York Transit Police during his brief tenure. They credited him with increasing the department's morale, reducing the level of serious crimes in the subway and providing officers with new equipment and new strategies for policing the city's vast transit system. 
 "The guy did a terrific job with a force that had always been a problem," said Thomas A. Repetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a group that monitors law enforcement. "He is a very able fellow. He knows how to motivate the troops. He's a good manager. He can communicate with street cops and business people and the media."
Chief Bratton's departure comes at a difficult time for the transit police, several officials said, because the possibility of a merger with the New York Police Department, which has been discussed intermittently for at least a decade, has gained momentum in the last month after it was endorsed by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
 
Flynn Faults Police
 The announcement of Chief Bratton's departure was made yesterday at a news conference in Boston by that city's Police Commissioner, Francis M. Roache, who has been under fire for serious management problems in the agency. In a report released on Tuesday, a special panel appointed by Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston sharply criticized the handling of civilian complaints by the police and recommended that Mr. Flynn replace the Police Commissioner when his term expires in April.
Mr. Flynn, who is a close boyhood friend of the Police Commissioner, has declined to discuss the recommendation.
Mr. Roache said at the news conference that he had been talking with Chief Bratton for three months about returning to Boston, which is the Chief's hometown and where he began his police career. Chief Bratton will have the title of superintendent and chief of the Boston Police Department, a new position in which he will serve in essence as the chief executive officer, Mr. Roache said.
On the surface, Chief Bratton's move may appear curious, he acknowledged in a telephone interview last night. He is going from the top position in the transit police, a force of 4,100 officers, to second in command of a smaller force. The Boston department has 2,100 officers.
 
A Pay Cut?
 Chief Bratton, who is 44 years old, is also taking a pay cut, from $110,000 to $90,000. But he contended in both the news conference and the interview that the job presented both intriguing professional challenges and important personal considerations.
The Chief's wife, Cheryl Fiandaca, is a lawyer who remained in Boston after he came to New York in April 1990. Ms. Fiandaca had tried to find a job in New York, but the recession made that impossible, several transit officials said. As a result, the couple have had to keep two residences and have commuted between New York and Boston on weekends.
"While it is a drop in pay, it really is not," Chief Bratton said last night, referring to the housing and commuting costs he will no longer have to pay. He phrased it somewhat differently at the Boston news conference: "With the cost of living in New York City, I'm getting a pay raise."
He said he thought he had accomplished most of his major goals in New York, including restoring morale and reducing the serious crime rate in the subways. Serious crime in the subway declined 15.1 percent during the first 11 months of 1991, compared with the same period in 1990, transit police officials said last night.
"What I've enjoyed doing as a police manager is going where there are challenges, going in and mixing it up," Chief Bratton said. "I like that. I don't like maintenance positions."
He also made it clear that he was attracted by the chance to return to his hometown. He said that there was no understanding that he would eventually replace the Boston Police Commissioner, a friend of 20 years.
"New York will not be easy to leave," he said. New York transit and police officials said he would not be easy to replace, either.
Alan F. Kiepper, president of the Transit Authority, said he had not yet decided how he would search for a replacement. Mr. Kiepper said that Chief Bratton had put in place some strong deputies.
"I think it's really important that we consolidate the gains that Bill has made," Mr. Kiepper said. "But I don't think you replace Bill in kind. He's unique."
Mr. Repetto of the Citizens Crime Commission said that he had been receiving two or three phone calls a week from officials around the country who were interested in Chief Bratton. The Chief acknowledged last night that he had been talking with officials in Los Angeles and Chicago about the top police jobs in those cities.
"The word was spreading all around the country about him," Mr. Repetto said. "If it wasn't Boston it would have been somewhere else sometime soon."

HEADLINE: The Squabbling Resumes Over Roosevelt Raceway

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTBURY, L.I., Jan. 16

 BODY:
Once the nation's premier harness racing track, Roosevelt Raceway stands vacant now, the paint on its bleachers cracking, its turf in disarray, a decaying symbol of a developer's ambition and what state investigators called government mismanagement.
But now that a state inquiry into the publicly financed sale of the raceway has ended, the same government officials and developers are at war over the future of the 172-acre site, the largest stretch of undeveloped land in Nassau County. 
 Where racing fans once wined and dined and placed their bets, just across the turf from the grassy field where Lindbergh took off for his trans-Atlantic flight in 1927, the developers hope to build more than two million square feet of office space, a conference center, a hotel, a 10-screen movie theater and 200 units of housing.
Republican officials in Hempstead would rather see more open space and housing for the elderly on the site. The town has adopted a plan that would reduce the amount of office space to 1.5 million square feet and increase the housing units to 350.
 
Stadium Proposed
 And the Nassau County Supervisor, Thomas S. Gulotta, has called for construction of an indoor-outdoor stadium on the property. In his State of the County address, Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, suggested that the site could continue to accommodate a harness racing track during the off season. He said this week that he would appoint a special sports authority within the next few weeks to pursue the project.
Given the current economic climate, however, it is far from certain that any of these competing proposals will be adopted. Mr. Gulotta, in the midst of a budget crisis that will force the layoffs of 3,000 Nassau County workers, has not offered a plan to pay for his proposed stadium.
And in part because the Town of Hempstead has blocked the owners from selling or developing the site, they are now faced with foreclosure for failing to make payments on $72 million in loans. Moreover, the developers are facing a depressed real-estate market, particularly for office space.
Still, there is enthusiasm about the potential of the site, which Roosevelt Raceway Associates purchased in 1984 for $52 million, and which the owners valued at $200 million in 1988.
"It has unlimited potential," said James L. Larocca, the president of the Long Island Association and a spokesman for the island's business community. "We would like to see a range of possibilities examined, including a sports facility that the New York Jets might consider coming home to. The fun of getting back to some real choices is welcome."
The land, now used for a flea market on weekends, is in the heart of Nassau County, just east of the Roosevelt Field Shopping Center and directly behind Fortunoff's, which plans to begin construction soon on a $194 million shopping mall that also awaits final zoning approval from the Town of Hempstead.
The raceway was purchased in 1984 by a group headed by Charles L. Evans, an investment banker and race-horse breeder, from Gulf and Western Industries with the help of $52 million in tax-free bonds provided by the Town of Hempstead Industrial Development Agency.
Mr. Evans and his partners, Barry B. Goldstein, a public accountant; David Stevenson, a former jockey, and William B. Hopkins, the former president of the raceway for Gulf and Western, decided in early 1987 to close the track and sell it or develop the property, despite charges that they were reneging on promises to keep the track in operation.
The state inquiry, conducted by the State Investigation Commission, cleared the developers of any wrongdoing, but it was critical of the way the Hempstead Industrial Development Agency administered the bonds issued to Mr. Evans and his partners. The owners redeemed the bonds in 1987 and pursued private financing. The results of the inquiry were announced on Monday.
In 1986, when Hempstead officials learned that the owners wanted to sell part of the raceway property, they imposed a moratorium on development of the site that remains in effect. But Justice Gabriel S. Kohn of State Supreme Court has recently ordered Hempstead to stop dragging its heels and to take action on zoning requests necessary for the development plans.
Jeffrey Forchelli, a specialist in zoning law who represents the raceway property owners, said he was "optimistic" that differences with the town would be resolved by Feb. 25, when the next town board hearing is scheduled on the matter.
"The hard times have helped in this situation," Mr. Forchelli said. "Government leaders are beginning to realize that helping to generate jobs to boost the economy helps all of us."
He said that Joseph N. Mondello, Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, had "recognized the need for a balance between retail and office space" and had been assured that the owners "could provide more affordable senior housing."
At least one real-estate expert, however, has doubts about extensive office construction on the site.
Paul Amoruso, a managing partner of Oxford and Simpson in Jericho, pointed out that real-estate values have dropped sharply in the last 18 months, noting that the office vacancy rate in the area was between 20 percent and 30 percent.
 Mr. Amoruso supports Mr. Gullotta's proposal. "At this time, a sports complex would make a lot of sense," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Carolco Reaches an Accord On Its Plan for Revamping

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Carolco Pictures Inc. said today that it had reached a tentative agreement with its biggest foreign shareholders and its banks on a plan that would give the struggling Hollywood production company some financial breathing room.
The plan would provide Carolco with $45 million in new money, delay the repayment of existing bank loans and other obligations, and possibly allow additional bank loans. Analysts said the package should permit Carolco to complete and release its next several movies, including "Basic Instinct," a thriller starring Michael Douglas. But they said that unless these movies performed well, Carolco would once again face a financial crisis. 
 Carolco has been struggling for months, despite having produced last year's biggest box-office hit, "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," because the rest of its movies have not earned enough to cover the company's heavy debt payments and the cost of making new films.
 
Historical Strength
 Carolco recently abandoned its efforts to diversify into lower-budget movies and other businesses to concentrate on its historical strength: making a handful of relatively expensive movies each year, usually action films that play as well abroad as in the United States.
The plan announced today calls for Carolco's three main foreign shareholders -- Pioneer Electronic of Japan; Canal Plus, the French pay-television company, and RCS Group, an Italian media company -- to lend the company a total of $32 million and buy $13 million in new preferred stock. In addition, those shareholders will allow Carolco to delay repayment of another $10 million owed to them.
Carolco's banks, led by Credit Lyonnais, Bankers Trust and Chemical Bank, also agreed to defer until Nov. 30 the repayment of a $14 million loan due this month and to loosen restrictions on the company's credit lines to allow Carolco to borrow additional money above the $171 million it already owes the banks.
Completion of the restructuring hinges on the resolution of other issues including the previously announced effort by Carolco to buy back $67.5 million of its bonds at 65 cents on the dollar.
 
Up to 'Basic Instinct'
 "The $45 million from the foreign partners should get them through the next few months, but then it's going to be up to 'Basic Instinct' to start generating some cash," said Lisbeth Barron, an analyst at S. G. Warburg & Company.
Ms. Barron said the $45 million should be enough to insure Carolco's release this year of "Basic Instinct" and "Universal Soldier," an action adventure film. But she said it was less clear whether Carolco was correct in assuming that the money would be sufficient to release the two other films on its slate for this year, "Charlie," about Charlie Chaplin, and "Cliffhanger," starring Sylvester Stallone.
Ms. Barron said the company was heading in the right direction with its recent decision to slash employment and focus on a few ambitious movies each year. But she said Carolco might have to sell such operations as its Orbis Communications television distribution subsidiary, a step the company recently said it was considering.
Carolco's stock jumped 50 cents today, a 25 percent gain, to close at $2.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.

Silver and Copper in Surge As Metals Rally Continues

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Silver and copper prices rose sharply in heavy trading yesterday as investors anticipated renewed interest in industrial metals.
Silver for delivery in March soared 17.8 cents, to $4.338 an ounce, and copper for March added 1.20 cents, to 97.05 cents a pound. Traders were active in both pits, and an estimated total of 47,000 silver contracts changed hands. 
 "Industrial metals as a group have made great strides in the last few days," one analyst said. The rally in stocks has been seen as a precursor of an economic recovery that would be a boon for silver, copper and platinum.
United States inventories of copper are also relatively low, spurring the market, said John Gross, president of J. E. Gross & Associates.
Gold for February advanced on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $357.40, up $2.30. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $353.00, up $2.30 over Wednesday's late bid.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, April platinum gained $6.10, to $343 an ounce, encouraged by remarks in South Africa by a mining executive at Impala Platinum Holdings that labor disputes with miners threatened the company's expansion plans.
 
Oil Gains Slip
 Crude oil for February closed only 6 cents higher at $18.91 a barrel, though the market rocketed up to $19.30 early yesterday on news that Algeria and Nigeria were cutting output.
The gains failed to hold, however, in light of doubts about whether other OPEC members, particularly Saudi Arabia, would agree to large-scale production cuts to bolster sagging prices.
"If Saudi Arabia doesn't cut, we are oversupplied, and that's the biggest concern right now," said John Bradberry, an analyst with the Continental Ozark Trading Company.
Libya and Venezuela have announced small cuts in output, hoping that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will agree to larger reductions when it meets on Feb. 12 in Geneva.
"I'd be very surprised if we see anything out of the Saudis until they meet next month," said James Ritterbusch of the Carson Petroleum Company.
Heating oil for February rose 0.82 cent, to 54.87 cents a gallon, and February unleaded gasoline gained 1.08 cents, to 54.42 cents a gallon.
March cocoa finally reached the plateau of $1,200 a metric ton, up $24 at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Volatile Day And Mark Is Hit by Selling

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower yesterday in a volatile session dominated by selling of the German mark.
Analysts said the dollar, which has rallied over the last week, fell victim to profit taking and fears that central banks might intervene to force the dollar lower. 
 But the currency found support during the session from some positive economic news. The Labor Department said first-time claims for state unemployment insurance fell to 403,000 for the week ended Jan. 4, down from 452,000 the previous week.
Traders theorized the drop might lessen pressure on the Federal Reserve to nudge interest rates down to stimulate the economy. The dollar, like all currencies, draws support from stable or higher yields.
 
Focused on Mark
 John McCarthy, chief foreign exchange dealer with ABN-AMRO Bank N.V. in New York, said that "there's some sense we've bottomed out" and that the economy might begin some modest growth that would keep rates stable.
He added, however, that the market yesterday was more focused on the German mark. Rising concerns about the German economy and fears that German rates will decline prompted many investors to sell the mark against most other foreign currencies.
Reports of unrest in Eastern Europe and the Georgian republic also raised speculation that refugees would flow into Germany and strain the country's economy.
The mark gained against the dollar, which fell to 1.6170 marks in New York, from 1.6250 late Wednesday. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6170 marks from 1.6215.
The British pound also rose against the dollar, closing at $1.7627 in New York, up from $1.7520 on Wednesday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7615 from $1.7560.
The dollar also weakened against the Japanese yen, closing at 128.22 yen in New York, down from 128.66. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 2.38 yen, to a closing 128.43 yen, and in London, it was quoted lower at 128.30 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4355 Swiss francs, down from 1.4455; 5.5120 French francs, down from 5.5430; 1.218.00 Italian lire, down from 1,224.25, and 1.15425 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15355.

A Time of Peril For World Trade

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH took a beating on his trade mission to Japan, and Japan got off lightly. Instead of conveying the picture of a determined leader fighting to safeguard an open world economy, Mr. Bush appeared to be pleading for Japanese mercy -- especially for the suffering American auto industry. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa responded by saying Japan would show "compassion."
Japan agreed to double imports of American auto parts from $7 billion last year to $15 billion in 1994, and to import 20,000 American cars, although it appeared that most of these cars would come from Japanese manufacturers in the United States. 
 For his pains, Mr. Bush was roundly attacked by Detroit's Big Three for not getting more. Detroit apparently wants nothing less than all-out managed trade -- a divvying up of the auto market in the United States and Japan.
In his role as car salesman in Japan, Mr. Bush appeared to have bought the managed-trade line -- to the dismay of American trade officials who have been desperately trying to get an agreement in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to open world markets to agricultural products, services and intellectual property, where America is strongest.
But on returning home, Mr. Bush reaffirmed the free-trade line, sowing confusion on what he really stands for. This confusion comes at a terrible time, with the GATT talks in deep trouble. A failure of the talks could lead to a breakup of GATT and a splitting of the world into hostile trade blocs.
While much criticism has been heaped on the President for his managed-trade mission, Japan again escaped with its thinly disguised mercantilist and protectionist policies intact. Those policies, aimed at maximizing exports over imports, have given it the largest trade surplus in the world -- a surplus that roughly equals everyone else's deficits. According to the estimate of C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, Japan's trade surplus soared to $100 billion last year and is likely to rise even higher this year.
The Japanese insist that the fault for imbalance in world trade is not theirs but lies elsewhere -- especially in the United States, with its huge budget deficits and poor-quality goods. They insist that Japan simply has a comparative advantage in manufactured goods but is short of resources and must export manufactured goods to pay for resource imports; this does not stop them from protecting agriculture. And they sometimes concede that Japan was closed in the past, but is liberalizing fast.
"These arguments either miss the point or run counter to the facts," says Prof. Rudiger Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "The mechanisms that close Japan to outsiders are not clear -- neither tariffs nor quotas play a role -- but by any definition Japan is closed." He contends that Japan's protectionism has "multiple layers, like an onion, and the innermost layers are cultural."
He focuses on manufactured goods, where foreign penetration of Japan was only 3.1 percent of its gross national product in 1989, compared with 7.1 percent in the United States, 15.6 percent in West Germany and 18.7 percent in South Korea. Whichever country offers the best basis for comparison with the Japanese, Japan's acceptance of foreign manufactured products is the lowest of any industrialized or newly industrializing country. Mr. Dornbusch sees no evidence of improvement: Japan's manufacturing imports have ranged between 1.5 and 3 percent of gross national product without much change for a quarter of a century. And Japan's total non-oil imports have declined from 9 percent 25 years ago to 6 percent now.
While agreeing with Mr. Dornbusch that Japan has pursued a protectionist trade policy, Robert Z. Lawrence of the Kennedy School of Harvard University asserts that restrictions by Japan on foreign investment in its own country have been even tighter than those on trade. Japan, according to his estimate, takes in only seven-tenths of 1 percent of total world foreign investment. Well-publicized exceptions, like I.B.M., Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble and some smaller companies, he says, do not change that basic fact about a country that has become the world's biggest foreign investor. Mr. Lawrence says Japan's keiretsu, the alliances of companies in many fields, should get particular blame for the exclusion of foreign goods, services and investment.
Japan has been an enormous beneficiary of the open world trading system. In its own long-term interests, as well as everyone else's, a far-sighted Japan should be out in front fighting to preserve it. Recession, unemployment and industrial shrinkage are weakening support for free trade in the United States. Europe, preoccupied with unification, is turning inward. A breakdown in the world trading system that has nourished economic development since World War II would be an incalculable economic and political tragedy. It happened once before -- 60 years ago.

HEADLINE: War of Hams Where the Stage Is All

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
HAM actors may be a horror, but fine actors playing ham actors are almost always a joy. Brian Bedford, cast as the 19th-century British tragedian William Charles Macready in Richard Nelson's new play, "Two Shakespearean Actors," is no exception. Very grand, often pickled and prone to forgetting the end of any sentence well before he has made it to the verb, Mr. Bedford's puffed-up Macready would be right at home in the hapless theatrical companies of "Nicholas Nickleby," "The Dresser" and "Noises Off." Even his version of the actor's nightmare is egomaniacal: when Macready dreams this dream, he does not forget his lines but instead plays all the parts at once.
Mr. Bedford, a British actor who has been a mainstay of Broadway and Stratford, Ontario, over a 30-odd-year stage career, pours a lifetime of both classical and boulevard-comedy experience into this role. In Mr. Nelson's play, Macready is a tired, fading figure who arrives to perform "Macbeth" in the New York City of 1849 only to find his supremacy challenged by a younger local upstart, the first great American Shakespearean, Edwin Forrest (Victor Garber), who is performing his own "Macbeth" elsewhere in town. It's an ugly situation. A symbolic target for enraged nationalistic forces beyond his comprehension, Macready suffers the indignity of less-than-full houses, a pelting with stones and, finally, a full-scale Anglophobic riot that leaves more than a score dead outside the Astor Place Opera House. 
 Yet in Mr. Nelson's fictionalized retelling of this actual history, and in Mr. Bedford's meticulous performance, Macready never ceases to be human and never becomes the butt of the piece. Though he is always patronizing to his New York hosts (his idea of a compliment is to call Americans "intelligent in an instinctive sort of way"), Mr. Bedford cloaks the snobbery in a rheumy laugh, merry eyes and a glinting smile. For all the outrageousness of Macready's Macbeth -- performed in a kilt with a Lady Macbeth firmly consigned to the upstage shadows -- this babbling ham actor is, finally and all too fleetingly, a tragic figure. When the mob boos and stones him, Mr. Bedford gives a stunned reading of the simple line "They have interrupted my performance!" that conveys the abject terror of another actor's nightmare, an audience's rejection. When the riots break out later, the spent, frightened Macready drifts into a passage from "King Lear" that Mr. Bedford plays for keeps, a fallen giant baring himself to an empty house as "a poor, infirm, weak and despised old man."
People who love the theater will dote on Mr. Bedford, and they will be nearly as fond of Mr. Garber, who is just as good in a much less juicy role. But even if one does cherish the backstage lore and actors' shoptalk that are the currency of "Two Shakespearean Actors," it's hard to shake the feeling that this evening, often diverting and sometimes more than that when Mr. Bedford is center stage, never lives up to its promise. And a lot is promised. The star turns, the fascinating premise, the huge cast that greets the audience in the play's opening moments and the elegant staging by Jack O'Brien all imply that this production, a Lincoln Center Theater presentation at the Cort Theater on Broadway, will have epic ambitions akin to "M. Butterfly" or "Amadeus," or, perhaps more aptly, to the revisionist cultural-historical fictions of E. L. Doctorow. But Mr. Nelson's writing, as epitomized by the prosaic title, rises only sporadically to the scale of everything else.
This disappointment is unexpected, because "Two Shakespearean Actors" is poised to pick up where the author's savage previous comedy, "Some Americans Abroad," left off. As in that play about American Anglophiles agog in present-day England, this one trades in Jamesian themes: the cultural clash between the Old World and the New, the declaration of an independent American artistic identity that is at once brave and vulgar, dynamic and insecure. Unfortunately, Mr. Nelson does not expand upon these points this time so much as reduce them to a simplistic, frequently reiterated duel of acting styles. Macready, representing England, stands for textual fidelity and outward sophistication while the rising American, anachronistically portrayed as an incipient Method Actor, stands for raw energy and the obsessive, inward study of subtext.
Even if this formulation were an accurate picture of the contrast between English and American actors of 1849 -- which it is not -- it still would not be a big enough conflict, or, if you will, metaphor, to explain the bloody Astor Place riots. But no other explanation, real or imagined, is forthcoming in "Two Shakespearean Actors," which consistently whets the audience's curiosity about its subject only to leave it unsatisfied. The political, economic and xenophobic forces that lead to the evening's anticolonial conflagration -- sentiments that have resurfaced, less violently, as recently as the Jonathan Pryce-"Miss Saigon" contretemps -- remain hinted at but unexamined. Eventually the riots are all but forgotten, except as explosive noises off, while Mr. Nelson brings Macready and Forrest together for a sentimental, historically dubious display of noble theatrical fraternity that seems to belong to another play.
Since the personal stories of the title characters, notably Forrest's sad offstage juggling of a wife (Frances Conroy) and mistress (Jennifer Van Dyck), are also sketchily told, "Two Shakespearean Actors" often lacks emotional as well as intellectual bite. Anecdotal in structure, it is almost always at its best when it is dealing simply, parochially and sometimes uproariously with the theater of missed cues, onstage mishaps and offstage egos. The one conspicuous exception is a wildly overlong Act I sequence in which the rehearsals of the Forrest and Macready productions of "Macbeth" are supposedly contrasted but, accents and costumes aside, prove to be more alike than not.
There and elsewhere, Mr. Garber offers evidence that he can act Shakespeare at the same high level at which he acts everything else. (Having done a mock Otello in "Lend Me a Tenor" and a mock Macbeth here, maybe it's time for him to try the real thing.) His Forrest, a creature of the stage tortured by private demons Mr. Nelson never illuminates, is a commanding matinee idol who can make even self-pity and arrogance charming. In a company full of outstanding actors in cameo roles that never quite pay off, the better assignments, all executed superbly, belong to Zeljko Ivanek as a perennial understudy torn between two companies and countries, Eric Stoltz in a lecherous and opportunistic portrait of the Irish playwright Dion Boucicault and Tom Lacy as a cynical supporting player nearing the farcical end of an unsung career.
Like Mr. Nelson's play, Mr. O'Brien's production evinces an overwhelming affection for the theater. As bathed in silken simulated gaslight by Jules Fisher, the simple, wood-beamed set by David Jenkins allows the action to swing gracefully from auditorium to backstage to dressing room to tavern; the sense of being taken into a hermetically sealed theatrical world of the Victorian age is completed by the Cort Theater itself, a gilded relic closer in origin and spirit to 1849 than 1992. Though Mr. Nelson is an American writer, "Two Shakespearean Actors" was first produced two years ago with a different cast and director by the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-on-Avon. Rather than risk another riot, I will assume that the English production was far inferior to our own.

HEADLINE: Prices Down, Optimism Up for Antiques Show

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
"Welcome to my fantasy garden," said Thomas K. Woodard, a folk-art dealer, standing by a weathered 10-foot-high doorway dominating his booth at the Winter Antiques Show in the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan. The archway, as intricately carved and pierced with scrolls and leaves as a giant paper doily, is a century-old frame for the front door of a New England house, he said.
On either side of this doorway, Mr. Woodard placed two English 19th-century garden urns of fired clay and filled them with freeze-dried strawberries, artichokes and gardenias. "I'm a hopeless romantic -- or a hopeful romantic when it comes to gardens," he said. 
 Such optimism reigned throughout the armory this week despite freezing temperatures on Wednesday, when two boilers broke down, and the recession as 66 dealers, many in down jackets and gloves, set up their elaborately appointed settings at the fair. The bazaar, now in its 38th year, opens today in preview and tomorrow to the public for a nine-day run.
Coinciding with the fair are two smaller Manhattan antiques shows, at the Convent of the Sacred Heart and at St. Vartan's Cathedral, and several exhibitions of decorative arts at the city's galleries and museums. In addition, there is "Celebrating Art and Antiques in New York: 11 Treasures Revealed," in which Manhattan dealers are exhibiting paintings or furnishings that are not known to have been shown in the city. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the Frick Collection.
At the Seventh Regiment Armory, Americana is as strong as ever at the Winter Antiques Show, with album quilts, paintings, weather vanes, Massachusetts highboys, Revolutionary War drums and mechanical banks.
 
Many Prices Are Lower
 Although some dealers are stocking costly objects, some at the million-dollar level, there is also evidence of an increased awareness of the economy. Compared with the 1980's shows, this one has fewer objects with six- or seven-figure price tags and many more of $5,000 or less.
At the Colwill-McGehee booth, for example, there are seven American 19th-century children's chairs: a Shaker, a Hitchcock, two painted Windsors, a Victorian pair and a painted Pennsylvania one. They range from $1,500 to $5,000. At the Woodard booth, English 19th-century colored-glass bulb vases, with blooming hyacinths, are $200 to $500.
Among several new types of offerings at the fair is an architectural house model at Marguerite Riordan's booth. The 1850 Italian-style Connecticut residence has polychromed walls, gold-foil dormers and a paper-tile roof and comes with a carrying case. The price is $16,500.
Photography, another first at this fair, is being shown by Gerald Korn blau, a former photographer. The 17 photographs are of Dakota farm scenes and the town of Groton in the Dakota Territory. They are dated 1885 and stamped with the photographer's name, Carli & Stienhauer of the Gallery Above the Drugstore, Groton. The price for the group is $8,500.
At this bazaar, which once forbade 20th-century items, 1930's objects are now commonplace. Mr. Kornblau is exhibiting a 19-inch-tall plaster head from Carl Milles's "Astronomer," a fragment from one of two full-length painted green figures completed in 1938. (The other "Astronomer" was part of the Trylon and Perisphere exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair.) The price is $30,000.
Sporting memorabilia, which are selling well despite the recession, are appearing at this fair for the first time. Alexander Acevedo brought a shelf full of loving cups and medals that range in price from a pair of gold and silver medals from 1898 for $6,000 to a 1920's James Fenimore Cooper silver trophy costing $100,000.
Antiques enthusiasts who like to buy other people's collections have several to inspect at this show. The most colorful and visible group of objects offered is Leigh Keno's 53 bandboxes, made of printed paper on pasteboard between 1820 and 1840. Assembled over 20 years "with the help of my parents," Mr. Keno said, the collection is being sold as a group for $125,000. "If the collection has not been sold by 7 on Friday night, we'll offer them singly," he said.
What may well be the rarest group of objects at the fair is a set of 12 English silver Apostle spoons from 1637 at S. J. Shrubsole. "To the best of our knowledge, this is the only such set of one date and maker for sale," said Eric Shrubsole, the owner. The price is $500,000.
Oriental wares, shown by 10 dealers, may soon outnumber Americana at this fair. Japanese screens are exhibited by at least three dealers. The rarest, a 12-panel pair of gold-leaf Momoyama screens from about 1600, depicting a snow-covered bridge and the low-lying hills near Mount Fuji, is at Leighton Longhi's booth. He is asking $850,000 for the pair. Among the other Oriental objects at the fair is a Japanese bronze unicorn from 1800 inlaid with silver and gold. It is $46,000 at Michael Goedhuis of London.
One of the show's largest and most expensive treasures is a 1745 marble-topped monumental sideboard, 10 feet long, at the booth of Carlton Hobbs. "We bought it last year in a barn in Shropshire," Mr. Hobbs said. "It had been dismantled and made into two tables. We've put it back together again, and this is the first showing." The price is $1.8 million.
 
The Vetting Dispute
 Once again, after a decadelong controversy over whether to authenticate, or vet, everything at the fair, the Winter Antiques Show is not doing it, although the procedure is used at most European fairs and at the International Antique Dealers Show, held in October in Manhattan. The dealers asked for the authentication, and a year ago the sponsor of the Winter Antiques Show, the East Side House Settlement, a 100-year-old charity operating in the South Bronx, promised to vet the 1992 show. The plan failed when the dealers and the sponsor agreed that the dealers should guarantee their objects without vetting.
Actually, the dealers' turnabout came just as Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen Inc., one of the oldest interior-decorating firms in the United States, replaced Mario Buatta as the show's chairman. Mr. Buatta opposed vetting but Mrs. Sherrill said this week she favors the practice.
"I originally wanted to have the show vetted," she said. "But it wasn't my decision. I can understand the problems and I know it's very difficult and expensive to vet a show. Nevertheless, I still think it would be wonderful if we had vetting at the show."
But the show's manager, N. Pendergast Jones, agrees with the sponsor and the dealers on the vetting issue. Mrs. Jones said the dealers will issue guarantee forms with each purchase, and a card in each booth will explain the guarantee.

A Move for 'Grand Hotel'
For weeks now, theater people have been waiting for the final showdown between Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, and the co-producers of "Grand Hotel: The Musical." The stakes are high. Jujamcyn owns the Martin Beck, where the long-running Tommy Tune show is playing. It wanted to book Jerry Zaks's much-anticipated revival of "Guys and Dolls" into the Beck for an April opening, but "Grand Hotel" just kept on running. It still will, moving to the Gershwin Theater on Feb. 3 after playing its final performance at the Beck on Jan. 27. Which means "Guys and Dolls," at long last, will have a home.
One reason "Grand Hotel" has lasted so long is that until recently "Grand Hotel" and Jujamcyn had never negotiated what is known as a stop clause, a standard practice on Broadway. It means that if a show makes less money than a mutually agreed-on figure for two weeks in a row, the theater owner has the right to evict the show. But in this economy, most theater owners are flexible.
Martin Richards, a co-producer of "Grand Hotel," says: "We never had a stop clause because Rocco Landesman offered us everything but the ownership of the theater to get our booking. He never wanted to discuss a stop clause until 'Guys and Dolls' wanted our house." Mr. Richards says the ensuing negotiations were heated, and he maintains that during the talks Jujamcyn stopped printing tickets for the show at the box office, violating an agreement that tickets remain on sale for 13 weeks in advance.
"Rocco said that 'Grand Hotel' might run another year but 'Guys and Dolls' could run three years," Mr. Richards recalls. "How does he know that? Does he have a crystal ball?"
Mr. Richards also says Mr. Landesman promised to contribute $100,000 toward the $300,000 cost of moving the show, "but now he seems to have amnesia." James Nederlander, the owner of the Gershwin, will pay $200,000 toward the move and Mr. Richards will pay the rest. Mr. Nederlander says he plans to mount a London production of "Grand Hotel" and tour it through Europe.
Mr. Landesman refused to address any of Mr. Richards's charges. "I've been at Jujamcyn for four and a half years, and my integrity will have to stand on its own," he says. "I wish them the best of luck at the Gershwin."
 
Economizing on Tony Tickets
When Tony Randall envisioned a National Actors Theater, it seems that nothing so crass and commercial as a Tony Award was part of the picture. His company is presenting its second show of the season, Georges Feydeau's "Little Hotel on the Side," at the Belasco Theater, a Broadway house, but, as with "The Crucible," the 700 Tony voters are not invited. That means that none of the company's productions can be nominated for best revival, although the actors and designers are still eligible, says Harvey Sabinson, the executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, which sets the Tony rules with the American Theater Wing. But what good are nominations in any category if no one has seen the performances to vote on them?
Any nonprofit company, especially a brand-new one, needs to raise money strenuously in these times. Even if it is not interested in the commercial benefits that a Tony Award brings to other Broadway shows, wouldn't a Tony go a long way toward impressing potential donors?
Manny Kladitis, the general manager of the National Actors Theater, says that because subscribers hold 51 percent of the tickets for each show's seven-week run, the company cannot afford to give each Tony voter the customary pair of free tickets. But Todd Haimes, the managing director of the Roundabout Theater, the other nonprofit company reviving classics in a Tony-eligible house, says his theater does invite voters. He has found room for them in his seven-week runs, which are 80 percent subscribed in a theater roughly half the size of the Belasco.
One producer who spoke on condition of anonymity says other Broadway managements resent Mr. Randall's brand of economizing. The perception is that he has used Broadway's cachet for all his publicity without extending to the Tony voters the basic courtesies that other shows do.
A spokesman for the National Actors Theater says Mr. Randall's comment was that the company cannot afford to make Tony seats available.
 
Just Two Sisters? No Performance
 The 1,100 people who showed up to see the star-studded cast of "The Three Sisters" at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., on Sunday had quite a surprise at 2 P.M., when the curtain was to go up. The show's director, Emily Mann, went onstage to announce that the performance was being canceled. Mary Stuart Masterson, the actress playing the third sister, Irina, had the flu. She does not have an understudy, and neither do her co-stars, Linda Hunt, Frances McDormand, Laura San Giacomo and Edward Herrmann. Since most of the other performances were already sold out, this audience was offered the chance to reschedule for 10:30 A.M. Thursday or the evening of Super Bowl Sunday. You can imagine the reaction.
"Most regional theaters don't have understudies," says David Mayhew, the director of marketing for the McCarter. "The expense involved for runs of only a few weeks is too high. Once a show opens here, we only have 15 performances left. Up until opening night, we only have time to rehearse the main cast, so even if we had had the understudies, they wouldn't have been rehearsed."
Mr. Mayhew says Ms. Masterson returned for the next scheduled show on Wednesday night.
 
Dedications to Papp
 With the opening last night of Richard Nelson's "Two Shakespearean Actors" at the Cort Theater, at least three dedications to the late producer Joseph Papp are now to be found in Playbills around town. " 'Two Shakespearean Actors' is dedicated to the memory of Joseph Papp, who, for 35 years, served Shakespeare, the theater and New York in full and generous measure," it reads.
At the New York Theater Workshop production of Caryl Churchill's "Mad Forest," the dedication is to "the memory of our friend Joseph Papp, who first introduced Caryl Churchill to New York audiences, and inspired and supported many of our lives." And at Second Stage, the season's dedication says: "Joseph Papp was a friend, mentor and constant inspiration to us. He taught us that with adversity comes opportunity and that with risk comes change. But most importantly, he taught us that no matter what, the show must go on."

Wendy Wasserstein, the Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, will become a regular contributor to "Channel 2 First News," which makes its debut on Jan. 27 at 4 P.M. "We want her observations on being a woman in New York," says Martin Blair, the program's spokesman. "Everyone used to pass her New York Woman columns around the newsroom. She's original."

HEADLINE: Luxe on the Menu: Softening Hard Times

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
LIFTON FADIMAN, the writer and editor, once remarked that when you have little money it is best to spend that little "on the unnecessary, the emotional dividends being higher." Certainly not the kind of advice your accountant would offer, but it carries a grain of logic. More to the point, if you are scrimping in other parts of your life -- foregoing a vacation, a new car, home improvement -- a dining splurge can be a potent spiritual anodyne. 
In these relentlessly stringent times, when every day seems to bring new woes about a national economy that is harder to revive than a rusty old lawn mower, it's easy to get a bit down at the mouth. What's more, the tribulations of New York City seem more intractable than ever. Yet people still queue up on Broadway for theater tickets; movie houses and concert halls are busy; museums are crowded, and restaurants, while scrambling for customers as never before, are holding their own surprisingly well, and with openings still outpacing closings.
New York City has always managed to put on a determined face in times of misfortune, like Scarlett at a smoldering Tara. Even in the grimmest situations, it has shown a spirit of glamour and romance. And what could be more uplifting than sitting at a window seat at the River Cafe in Brooklyn, sipping a glass of good chardonnay and watching tugs ply the East River to the towering backdrop of lower Manhattan.
Or how about the Rainbow Room, that glittering dance floor in the clouds? Occasionally, one might cavil about the uneven food, but not about the stunning views or the Fred-and-Ginger setting. While we are 65 floors up, we should mention Cellar in the Sky on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center, the classier cousin of Windows on the World. Cellar has the intimacy, the mood (including live classical guitar), the food and the wines to make for an enchanting evening. The seven-course menu at Cellar in the Sky changes regularly.
Those who feel more comfortable closer to sea level can hop a boat at the East 34th Street Pier in Manhattan and chug over to Water's Edge in Long Island City, Queens. The rather formal room, with its black-tie captains and pianist, looks back at midtown Manhattan: the United Nations, the Chrysler Building, the Citicorp tower and more. The staff is accommodating and the eclectic American fare by David Silver, the chef, can make the trip worthwhile: a monkfish-and-potato salad with turnip chips, scallions and a light vinaigrette; sauteed sweetbreads with crayfish, and sweet Chinese sausage dumplings in a delicious Oriental bouillon; perfectly cooked salmon with sun-dried tomatoes and pesto, and grilled sea scallops with Swiss chard and fried polenta.
Another striking harborside location that receives a sizable Wall Street clientele is the Hudson River Club in the World Financial Center on the Hudson River. The panoramic view from the handsome, contemporary dining room is exhilarating, as is the food by Waldy Malouf, the chef. An acquaintance proposed to his girlfriend at a window seat, then called both families on his ever-present portable phone. The chef's contribution to this type of occasion might be a terrific pumpkin-and-apple soup, braised veal shank with citrus and sage, and venison stew with wild mushrooms, cranberries and chestnuts.
The Upper East Side of Manhattan is rich in elegant and romantic dining. Foremost is the renascent Maxim's on Madison Avenue, a faithful reproduction of the original in Paris, which, sadly, has declined to a tourist trap. That is by no means the case in New York, where David Ruggerio, the chef, has whipped the kitchen into shape, offering a splendid blend of classical and contemporary French cuisine. The rest of the operation has followed in step. The dining rooms are a rococo delight, glistening with polished rosewood walls, vines of hammered brass, elaborate wall moldings, stained glass and pastoral murals. A sizable dance floor gets plenty of use when a combo picks up the tempo later in the evening.
Another famously romantic spot that I recommend often, and with flawless results, is the Sign of the Dove on Third Avenue, a brick and marble grotto with brick arches, wrought-iron filigree, explosions of flowers, skylights and suitably private tables. As for the food, it, too, can make one swoon. Andrew D'Amico, the chef, has a refined touch with game and seafood.
One of the most comfortable spots on the Upper East Side is Mark's, the dining room in the Mark Hotel with a polished English theme. The menu could be called sophisticated Continental, and there are plenty of winners: napoleon of asparagus with a ragout of chanterelles, red snapper on eggplant caviar, and dry-aged sirloin with a green-peppercorn sauce and garlic potato cake.
One does not ordinarily equate Chinese restaurants with romance, yet there are two settings in Manhattan that qualify. On the Upper West Side there is Shun Lee, the haunting black-and-white cavern with snarling dragons overhead, low lighting and cozy banquettes. On the Upper East Side, there is Chin Chin, with two dramatically different moods. The front room has warm pale peach walls and handsome woodwork with charming sepia-toned portraits of the Chin brothers family. The back room is like another restaurant, a snowstorm of white broken by colorful Oriental pottery perched on wall ledges. The food at both is captivating and elegantly presented. And each has unusually extensive wine selections for Chinese restaurants. Among other things, both offer a superior Peking duck.
Two of my favorite restaurants on the Upper West Side are Cafe des Artistes, the stylish salon on West 67th Street that serves brassy bistro fare, and the Terrace, uptown at Columbia University, an unabashedly romantic rooftop restaurant that offers a sweeping view of the Hudson River and much of Manhattan. The Terrace was my choice to take my wife-to-be on our first date, along with a buddy of mine. I no longer remember why I took a male chaperone; I do remember that we had such a great time, including some superlative wine, that he stayed with us right through the after-dinner drink downtown and the goodnight kiss.
Midtown Manhattan has the biggest crop of luxury restaurants, including two smashing new ones: Les Celebrite's, in the lavishly refurbished Essex House, and Lespinasse, in the deluxe St. Regis Hotel. The theme of Le Celebrites is the artwork of television and movie stars that adorns the walls. The inventive and generally light French food by Christian Delouvrier can be exquisite, and service is top-notch. Lespinasse has an aristocratic air, with its high ceiling, baronial tables and pretty murals. Gray Kunz, the chef, has French training and experience in Asia, which shows in his startling creations.
Midtown also has a bumper crop of old-line French restaurants that still offer indulgent pampering. Among them La Cote Basque on West 55th Street, one of my first big-city French restaurant experiences; La Grenouille, on East 52d Street, the opulent family business abloom with fresh flowers and turning out the same fare it has offered for years; La Caravelle on West 55th Street, a Gallic dowager that has been revitalized with a new decor and a new chef, and Le Perigord on East 52d Street, an endearing spot with a caring staff and wonderful Provencal food by Antoine Bouterin. It was on a deep red banquette in the mural-wrapped dining room of La Caravelle that, over lunch, I proposed to the woman who is now my wife. She sipped her Corton-Charlemagne, looked in the air, and said, "No." Then, she said, "Yes."
An Italian spot in midtown that ranks high on the mood meter is Palio on West 51st Street in the Equitable Tower. You can start off with an aperitif in one of the city's most spectacular bars while taking in the tumultuous mural by Sandro Chia, then hop an elevator to the second-floor dining room. Palio is a splendid color-drenched space with murals representing teams from the ancient Palio horse race overhead. Andrea Hellrigl, the chef and owner, combines refined Northern Italian fare with lusty winter specialties. Try the risottos and the roast goat when available.
In the same corporate complex is the city's finest seafood restaurant, Le Bernardin, a soothing teak-lined room adorned with a dramatic oil painting of fishermen and their catch. The glistening, fresh seafood is as stunning as ever, and desserts have taken a noteworthy step upward with the arrival of a new pastry chef, Francois Payard. Those with adventuresome tastes and a sense of whimsy could easily find bliss at the Quilted Giraffe on East 55th Street. Barry Wine, the owner, chef and culinary Japanophile, always has intriguing specials. On the winter menu are dishes like noodle-wrapped shrimp with ginger and soy, and prime sirloin cooked 60 seconds on one side with black and white sesame noodles. The high-tech stainless-steel and black granite room is delightful when the lights go down and the candles come up.
Two ethnic restaurants in midtown qualify as romantic for their artful use of color and architecture: Dawat, the unconventional Indian restaurant on East 58th Street that serves the vibrant creations of the cook and actress Madhur Jaffrey; and Eldorado Petit, the deserving Catalan restaurant with the glazed terra-cotta walls that are highlighted with artful projections of shellfish.
Also in midtown is Restaurant Raphael, a small, subterranean spot with a lovely outdoor garden for warm weather dining and considerably improved food on West 54th Street. For the moment the chef is Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, formerly of the late Le Cygne, who has turned the menu in the direction of refined bistro food.
A trend in the making is dining and dancing, and three atmospheric new clubs have opened in Manhattan in the past year. The Supper Club is a new restaurant in a former theater in the Edison Hotel on West 47th Street. This cavernous cobalt blue space is the brainchild of two Manhattan restaurateurs: Jean de Noyer, the owner of Le Comptoir, and Wayne Nish, the chef and owner of March. The menu is straightforward, moderately priced and well executed. Soft trio music early in the evening turns into a big-band dance sound later on.
Over on East 50th Street is a handsome former cabaret now called Tatou. The 30-foot ceiling, ornate wood moldings and giant chandelier hark back to the heyday of cabarets. The regional American food by Scott Cohen, the chef, is probably much better than patrons of the old Cafe Versailles were served.
One of the more elegant dining and dancing clubs is Laura Belle, the stylish spot in a former movie palace on West 43d Street. It is owned by Michael O'Keeffe of the River Cafe in Brooklyn and the Water Club in Manhattan. The amphitheater space has tables on several tiers facing a sizable dance floor. Music is soft in the early evening, cranking up about 11 P.M. The chef, Mitsu Kikuchi, who came from the River Cafe, serves an appealing menu largely free of saturated fats, substituting vegetable sauces and Oriental touches.
 
Downtown
 Greenwich Village is filled with romantic little nooks in the way of restaurants and bars. If forced to narrow the field, one might have to turn to Le Metairie, the rustic French bistro on West 10th Street, and Il Cantinori, the enchanting Tuscan restaurant on East 10th Street.
It's no wonder that so many couples flock to the banquettes of Le Metairie and its a barnlike setting of white walls and dark wood trim with farm tools, firewood stacked on overhead ledges, and dried flowers. The moderately priced menu is reliably appealing, too.
Il Cantinori is a Tuscan rendition of the same theme, with stucco walls, wood-beam ceiling, glazed tile floor and handsome country furniture. The best dishes are the pastas and homey specials.
On a smaller scale, but beguiling in its own way, is Le Pescadou, the seafood bistro on King Street. The main dining room has a wide-plank floors, pale yellow walls, brass sconces and a fireplace. The seafood is unassailably fresh and prepared with respect for the fish's flavor. In the little tavern room up front, a short seafood menu is offered for those who do not want a full dinner.
Far downtown, Manhattan boasts two of the most pampering restaurants in the city: Bouley, on Duane Street, and Chanterelle, on Harrison Street. David Bouley's Gallic dream is may well be the most alluring setting in the city; the food is right up at the top, too. The country French ambiance includes a graceful vaulted ceiling, gentle lighting, lace curtains, bucolic Impressionist paintings and splays of flowers. Chanterelle is a sparer environment -- soft yellow walls and decorative wood trim -- yet the tranquillity it offers plus the impressive French food can be rhapsodic in this shrill city.
Over the river in Brooklyn there is the century-old seafood house Gage & Tollner, which stands with dignity amid the urban mishmash of the Fulton Mall. The long, dark, mahogany dining room resembles a wide train parlor of another era. Overhead are gas-fueled chandeliers that waiters solemnly ignite every evening. The menu by Edna Lewis, the Southern-born chef and cookbook author, carries many of her native specialties along with Gage & Tollner shellfish favorites like the clam belly broil, clams casino and sundry oyster preparations.
Even if the oyster's putative role in spurring romance has not been substantiated, it's fun to ignore science while slurping down some iced bluepoints. In addition, it's hard to dwell on life's woes while savoring what Pliny called "the pleasure of the table." And if you are in a magical setting, all the better.

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

Paintings by Australians
Behind-the-scenes maneuvering for major works of art has always been a way of life for auction houses and dealers. But in this bleak season, when so few good collections are up for grabs, the competition is especially heated.
This week, three plum collections -- one of a celebrated collector, featuring works by Australian artists, another of Old Master paintings and decorative objects, and a third comprised of contemporary art -- have caused quite a scramble. By far the juiciest is the group of paintings and sculptures belonging to Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian industrialist who became a famous figure in the art world five years ago when he borrowed $27 million from Sotheby's to buy van Gogh's "Irises" for $53.9 million, at that point the largest amount ever paid for a painting. (The painting has since been bought by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.) 
 The decision about who will sell the rest of Mr. Bond's art collection, estimated to be worth up to $20 million, isto be made by Duesburys, an accounting firm in Perth, Australia, handling the assets of Dallhold Investments, Mr. Bond's private company. Right now, it seems, there is a fierce race between Sotheby's, Christie's, the London dealer Neville Keating and numerous Australian auction houses to obtain the 61 paintings by Australian artists and sculptors, 12 French sculptures and one Renoir painting.
"We'll evaluate the proposals from the various auction houses," said Tom Iceton, a manager at Duesburys. "We'll probably sell everything through one auction house. But we're not art experts and making the right choice is difficult: it's all a bit of a wing and a prayer."
Before a decision can be made, the Australian courts must settle a dispute over the ownership of several paintings. Both Mr. Bond's wife, Eileen, and his son, John, are claiming several of the artworks. "We're hoping this matter will be settled by the end of the month," Mr. Iceton said. "Then we'll arrange for the art to be sold as soon as possible."
The fact that Mr. Bond did a lot of business through Sotheby's will not have a bearing on the decision, Mr. Iceton said. "Mr. Bond's preferences have nothing to do with us," he said. "We're just trying to raise as much money as possible."
Both Christie's and Sotheby's admit they've thrown their hats in the ring. "We have been in discussion with the agents acting for Alan Bond's creditors," said a Christie's spokeswoman, who refused to go into any of the details. At Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks, president and chief executive officer of the auction house in North and South America, said that it, too, had submitted a proposal to Mr. Bond's creditors. "It's a fantastic collection," Mrs. Brooks said, "the best group of Australian pictures in private hands."
 
Old Masters on the Block
 Sotheby's announced one major victory this week: the collection of Old Master paintings, European silver and French furniture belonging to Jaime Ortiz-Patino, grandson of Simon I. Patino, the 19th-century Bolivian mine magnate known as the "Tin King." That the collection went to Sotheby's was no surprise. Mr. Ortiz-Patino and several members of his family have sold collections through the auction house many times before.
Three years ago, Sotheby's sold Mr. Ortiz-Patino's eight Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works for $67 million. The sale included Gauguin's "Mata Mua" ("In Olden Times"), which set a record for the artist when it was bought for $24.2 million by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. In 1986, Sotheby's was the seller of an extensive collection of French furniture that belonged to Mr. Ortiz-Patino's uncle, Antenor Patino. Three years later, Sotheby's also sold a collection of jewelry belonging to Mr. Ortiz-Patino's aunt, Luz Mila Patino. The auction fetched $31.2 million, making it a record for any jewelry sale in the United States.
The latest Ortiz-Patino offerings will go on the block May 21 and 22. They include eight paintings by Francesco Guardi, a group of Old Master drawings, an extraordinary collection of French silver commissioned by Catherine the Great for her lover Count Gregory Orloff and 17th-century English chinoiserie silver, as well as a collection of French furniture and decorative objects.
Mrs. Brooks said Mr. Ortiz-Patino had decided to sell these works because he had recently been appointed an adviser in Europe for the Bolivian Government and was moving from a large house in Geneva to considerably smaller quarters in London.
 
A Chicagoan's Collection
 One collection the auction houses have missed out on, at least for now, is the contemporary art, tribal art, ancient art and American Indian baskets from the estate of Claire Zeisler, a Chicago collector and fiber artist who died in October. Ms. Zeisler was at one time married to Harold Florsheim, an heir to the shoe company. Her son, Tom Florsheim, decided to appoint Richard Gray, a Chicago art dealer, as agent in charge of selling the collection. "That doesn't mean we won't use the auction houses," Mr. Florsheim said in a recent telephone interview. "Right now no decisions have been made."
Meanwhile, both Sotheby's and Christie's have approached Mr. Florsheim and Mr. Gray in the hopes that at least a few works will find their way to the auction block. Some experts say they believe, however, that the works will be sold privately because Mr. Florsheim isn't willing to risk selling in a venue as public as an auction, fearing that in these precarious times, if a piece doesn't sell, it will be considered undesirable.
Highlights of the collection include a 1910 Cubist Picasso, "Woman Sewing," as well as two early Picasso paintings, a 1925 Paul Klee painting called "Village in the Autumn Sun," two paintings by Max Ernst, two works on paper by Joan Miro and a rare 1932 Henry Moore sculpture.
 
French Art Tax (Cont'd.)
 The French Government has changed its mind. Again. For the second time in less than six months. The story of a Value Added Tax, or V.A.T., imposed last July on works of art, furniture, tapestries and silver continues to run its explosive and complicated course. The latest news: the Government has reduced the tax from 18.6 percent to 5.5 percent on the purchase and importation of paintings, prints and sculpture. The 18.6 percent tax on antique furniture, tapestries and silver remains. And artists must still pay a 5.5 percent tax on their earnings, that is, at least for now.
This is not the first time over the last six months that the Government has changed its mind. On Oct. 2, the eve of the F.I.A.C. (Foire Internationale d'Art Contemporain) in Paris, it reduced the V.A.T. on works by living artists from 18.6 percent to 7.5 percent (it's now down to 5.5 percent for all works of art). The change was an effort to stimulate business, which had been substantially hurt by the imposition of the tax.
The latest reduction, which went into effect the first of the year, was the result of fierce lobbying by art dealers and auctioneers who contended that the hefty tax coupled with the worldwide economic recession had been a disaster for business and a great blow to Paris as a major international art market. "We worked very hard to get the change implemented," said Guy Loudmer, the French auctioneer. "Doing business these past few months has been impossible. Sales dropped 50 percent."
"It's a very complicated issue," said Benoit d'Aboville, the Consul General of France. "And for a while there will be differences of interpretation." Under the French tax code, Mr. d'Aboville said, buyers who purchase goods through galleries will have to pay the tax based on the full value of the work. Art dealers will be obligated to pay the tax based on their profit margin. For those who buy at auction, both dealers and private buyers will have to pay the tax based on the full purchase price.
While the French auctioneers are happy with the latest change, some gallery owners say the tax reduction will not affect business. "We just changed our prices to account for the sales tax," said Yo-Yo Maeght, director in charge of contemporary art for the Paris-based Galerie Maeght. "But in some cases it was impossible. For example, I lost more than 10,000 francs on a sale to a Swiss collector who had seen a Giacometti lithograph in the gallery in June and came back to buy it after the tax had changed. Obviously, I was not able to raise the price."
But even these new tax changes are only temporary. Because of the economic unification process under way in Europe, the V.A.T rates will change again by Jan. 1, 1993, making them the same for all European countries.

What About the Other $386 Million?

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
Whenever people say, "Isn't it awful how much money the athletes make?" my standard answer is, "I'd rather see Don Mattingly have the money than George Steinbrenner." The ball players, after all, can throw and run and hit a curveball, and do many other socially redeeming acts. The owners, on the other hand, merely own.
Pardon my class identification -- my parents were union members when it was dangerous -- but I've always believed in sharing the wealth. Whenever I see an athlete signing for $3 million a year, I figure some of the owner's money is going to trickle down to the player's relatives and friends, balancing things out a little. 
 At this point during the recession, baseball teams are making $14 million per team per year on a contract with CBS and ESPN. I have been operating under the assumption that the owners were keeping some of that money for themselves. In fact, I have never seen a poor owner.
So I am not totally astounded to hear that our old friend, the Man from Tampa, has finagled the Yankees' $486 million cable-television contract in order to make some money for himself and his partners. Why else is he in the baseball business?
The way I understand it, George Steinbrenner borrowed $100 million against his cable contract, and distributed the money among the 17 partners. Since Steinbrenner owns 55 percent of the Yankees, he got to keep 55 percent of the payout. It may be shortsighted and it may be selfish, but it sounds legal to me, as long as the partners pay back the loan.
There are, of course, just a few teeny-weeny ethical questions about what Steinbrenner does with his money. Like most sports franchises, the Yankees have been known to mooch for tax breaks, because of this wonderful thing they are doing for the city, providing hope and joy and identification for the masses, and a few jobs for vendors and ushers and athletes.
Presumably, the next time the Man from Tampa puts the arm on New York for increased police surveillance or glitzy new arc lights on public streets, somebody from the city will bring up the $100 million payout. Nevertheless, I am not being facetious when I maintain that the owners had the right to make some dividends, or profits, or booty or swag, or whatever they want to call it.
The problem with the Yankees is not that Steinbrenner is a capitalist. The problem is that he is a bad capitalist. He had a good idea nearly 20 years ago, which was spending money on free agents, but then the rest of baseball caught up with him. While other organizations were building modern computerized chains of command, Steinbrenner was presiding over the downfall of his family business, American Ship Building, and shouting "Off with his head" into a long-distance phone.
Even with the $100 million going to the ownership, there should have been money available for stable management of the Yankees. But this unctuous scamp was paying more attention to buying dirt on Dave Winfield from a gambler named Howie Spira than he was to running his ball club. Basically, the man earned himself a lifetime absence from baseball for having a bad scale of values.
But Steinbrenner is not that much more of a wrongo than a lot of other allegedly smart owners. No sooner had Crazy Neal (His Prices Are In-Sane) Pilson produced that $1.46 billion television contract through 1993 than the owners began tossing huge new salaries to ballplayers both skilled and inept.
This revelation of the $100 million payout should only pacify people in smaller baseball cities who get nervous about the extra cable money available to owners like Steinbrenner. Who says money wins pennants? Maybe the Mets bought a pennant with their cable money, or maybe Eddie Murray and Bret Saberhagen will be old and injured, respectively. Steinbrenner is now blaming the Mets for his recent flurry of spending. The devil made him do it, he says.
This is why Fay Vincent should reinstate Steinbrenner as managing general partner. Pronto. A lifetime ban is too good for the guy. Steinbrenner should be forced to take responsibility for the spending, the personnel decisions, the drift. It's his team. He's making big bucks from it.
Of course, if the network money dries up after 1993, my theory is that some teams are going down in 1994. We've seen airlines and newspapers and banks and department stores disappear. You think the sports teams are immune? If the partners cannot meet the loan, Uriah Micawber Steinbrenner could operate the Yankees from yet another distant site: debtor's prison. The history of the Yankees may yet be written by a modern-day Dickens.

HEADLINE: When the President Talks

 BODY:
President Bush long ago made himself famous for his tin ear in speech. Once, he told reporters that "I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism," prompting Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York to express relief that the President hadn't gone on to offend Italians, too, by saying he was antipasto. 
 In Idaho during the 1988 campaign, Mr. Bush enthusiastically described his relationship with President Reagan: "For seven and a half years I have worked alongside him, and I am proud to be his partner. We have had triumphs, we have made mistakes, we have had sex."
After a stunned moment, he hastily corrected himself. "We have had setbacks." In New Hampshire that year, rubbing shoulders with truck drivers in a diner, he made aides wince by asking for just "a splash" more coffee.
The public has grown familiar with, even indulgent of Mr. Bush's verbal bumbles, and people chuckled this week when they heard the latest ones, from his first 1992 foray into New Hampshire. For instance, speaking of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, he unaccountably referred to the "Nitty Ditty Nitty Gritty Great Bird."
At times, however, the verbal lurches cannot be laughed off so easily; when the President of the United States talks, people listen. They were listening when he also said in New Hampshire, "I've known this economy is in a free fall. Maybe I haven't conveyed it as well as I should have, but I do understand it."
Mr. Bush has found that bumbles on matters of war, peace and diplomacy are costly and has disciplined his tongue. Such reckless exaggeration about economic matters can be costly, too. To describe the current downturn as a free fall borders on the irresponsible. This recession is one of the smallest downturns in 40 years; unemployment, now 7 percent, was higher in six of the ten years between 1975 and 1984.
Mr. Bush's loose words risk adding needlessly to the economic fears of millions. Worse, they might heighten the feverish urge of a jittery, pre-election Congress to overreact, turning a careless fumble into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

HEADLINE: School Reform Should Begin With Society and the Family

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I very much enjoyed reading "Which Students Are Worst at Science?" (Science Times, Dec. 24) and felt many interesting and noteworthy issues were brought up. One issue in particular was that of American society's role in education. 
 I am a senior at Brookline High School, a public school near Boston. When I was 5 or 6 years old, I enrolled in a small private school in my neighborhood, the South End, a mixed urban neighborhood. Although it was a private school it made itself accessible to people of different economic situations and ethnic groups.
I grew up, therefore, around a diverse group of kids. This small school went up only to the sixth grade, and at that point the students had to choose whether they would go on to public schools in Boston, the suburbs or attend private schools. For many it wasn't a choice; there were very few who could afford to send their kids outside the Boston school system.
Eight years later we had a class reunion. All of my former classmates got together and discussed what was going on in their lives. The majority were in the stages of applying to colleges, others were contemplating studying or working abroad.
The point I am trying to make is that we all developed to be "ideal" American teen-agers. We were all completely different: some very poor living in Roxbury, a poor black neighborhood; others fairly wealthy, taking vacations abroad every year. This is not a success story for my old school. The common denominator was that we all came from families -- single- and two-parent homes, adoptive parents -- who cared about education. We, the students of this small school, would not have ended up there if it wasn't for our families. From going to that school we have all come out with a great love, or at least respect, for education.
I believe that although our nation's school systems need reform badly, our society's view and interest in education is what really needs reforming. There is no way the American system can "fix the kids, no matter what is wrong with the family and the community." We should not be aiming for the top test scores to outdo our international competition, but to raise the number of kids who have a great interest in education, who will come out of school with hope for the future, with inspiration to work toward bettering our country. I believe this change needs to come from both the family and society.

HEADLINE: War of Hams Where the Stage Is All

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
HAM actors may be a horror, but fine actors playing ham actors are almost always a joy. Brian Bedford, cast as the 19th-century British tragedian William Charles Macready in Richard Nelson's new play, "Two Shakespearean Actors," is no exception. Very grand, often pickled and prone to forgetting the end of any sentence well before he has made it to the verb, Mr. Bedford's puffed-up Macready would be right at home in the hapless theatrical companies of "Nicholas Nickleby," "The Dresser" and "Noises Off." Even his version of the actor's nightmare is egomaniacal: when Macready dreams this dream, he does not forget his lines but instead plays all the parts at once.
 Mr. Bedford, a British actor who has been a mainstay of Broadway and Stratford, Ontario, over a 30-odd-year stage career, pours a lifetime of both classical and boulevard-comedy experience into this role. In Mr. Nelson's play, Macready is a tired, fading figure who arrives to perform "Macbeth" in the New York City of 1849 only to find his supremacy challenged by a younger local upstart, the first great American Shakespearean, Edwin Forrest (Victor Garber),who is performing his own "Macbeth" elsewhere in town. It's an ugly situation. A symbolic target for enraged nationalistic forces beyond his comprehension, Macready suffers the indignity of less-than-full houses, a pelting with stones and, finally, a full-scale Anglophobic riot that leaves more than a score dead outside the Astor Place Opera House. 
Yet in Mr. Nelson's fictionalized retelling of this actual history, and in Mr. Bedford's meticulous performance, Macready never ceases to be human and never becomes the butt of the piece. Though he is always patronizing to his New York hosts (his idea of a compliment is to call Americans "intelligent in an instinctive sort of way"), Mr. Bedford cloaks the snobbery in a rheumy laugh, merry eyes and a glinting smile. For all the outrageousness of Macready's Macbeth -- performed in a kilt with a Lady Macbeth firmly consigned to the upstage shadows -- this babbling ham actor is, finally and all too fleetingly, a tragic figure. When the mob boos and stones him, Mr. Bedford gives a stunned reading of the simple line "They have interrupted my performance!" that conveys the abject terror of another actor's nightmare, an audience's rejection. When the riots break out later, the spent, frightened Macready drifts into a passage from "King Lear" that Mr. Bedford plays for keeps, a fallen giant baring himself to an empty house as "a poor, infirm, weak and despised old man."
 People who love the theater will dote on Mr. Bedford, and they will be nearly as fond of Mr. Garber, who is just as good in a much less juicy role. But even if one does cherish the backstage lore and actors' shoptalk that are the currency of "Two Shakespearean Actors," it's hard to shake the feeling that this evening, often diverting and sometimes more than that when Mr. Bedford is center stage, never lives up to its promise. And a lot is promised. The star turns, the fascinating premise, the huge cast that greets the audience in the play's opening moments and the elegant staging by Jack O'Brien all imply that this production, a Lincoln Center Theater presentation at the Cort Theater on Broadway, will have epic ambitions akin to "M. Butterfly" or "Amadeus," or, perhaps more aptly, to the revisionist cultural-historical fictions of E. L. Doctorow. But Mr. Nelson's writing, as epitomized by the prosaic title, rises only sporadically to the scale of everything else.
 This disappointment is unexpected, because "Two Shakespearean Actors" is poised to pick up where the author's savage previous comedy, "Some Americans Abroad," left off. As in that play about American Anglophiles agog in present-day England, this one trades in Jamesian themes: the cultural clash between the Old World and the New, the declaration of an independent American artistic identity that is at once brave and vulgar, dynamic and insecure. Unfortunately, Mr. Nelson does not expand upon these points this time so much as reduce them to a simplistic, frequently reiterated duel of acting styles. Macready, representing England, stands for textual fidelity and outward sophistication while the rising American, anachronistically portrayed as an incipient Method Actor, stands for raw energy and the obsessive, inward study of subtext.
 Even if this formulation were an accurate picture of the contrast between English and American actors of 1849 -- which it is not -- it still would not be a big enough conflict, or, if you will, metaphor, to explain the bloody Astor Place riots. But no other explanation, real or imagined, is forthcoming in "Two Shakespearean Actors," which consistently whets the audience's curiosity about its subject only to leave it unsatisfied. The political, economic and xenophobic forces that lead to the evening's anticolonial conflagration -- sentiments that have resurfaced, less violently, as recently as the Jonathan Pryce-"Miss Saigon" contretemps -- remain hinted at but unexamined. Eventually the riots are all but forgotten, except as explosive noises off, while Mr. Nelson brings Macready and Forrest together for a sentimental, historically dubious display of noble theatrical fraternity that seems to belong to another play.
Since the personal stories of the title characters, notably Forrest's sad offstage juggling of a wife (Frances Conroy) and mistress (Jennifer Van Dyck), are also sketchily told, "Two Shakespearean Actors" often lacks emotional as well as intellectual bite. Anecdotal in structure, it is almost always at its best when it is dealing simply, parochially and sometimes uproariously with the theater of missed cues, onstage mishaps and offstage egos. The one conspicuous exception is a wildly overlong Act I sequence in which the rehearsals of the Forrest and Macready productions of "Macbeth" are supposedly contrasted but, accents and costumes aside, prove to be more alike than not.
 There and elsewhere, Mr. Garber offers evidence that he can act Shakespeare at the same high level at which he acts everything else. (Having done a mock Otello in "Lend Me a Tenor" and a mock Macbeth here, maybe it's time for him to try the real thing.) His Forrest, a creature of the stage tortured by private demons Mr. Nelson never illuminates, is a commanding matinee idol who can make even self-pity and arrogance charming. In a company full of outstanding actors in cameo roles that never quite pay off, the better assignments, all executed superbly, belong to Zeljko Ivanek as a perennial understudy torn between two companies and countries, Eric Stoltz in a lecherous and opportunistic portrait of the Irish playwright Dion Boucicault and Tom Lacy as a cynical supporting player nearing the farcical end of an unsung career.
 Like Mr. Nelson's play, Mr. O'Brien's production evinces an overwhelming affection for the theater. As bathed in silken simulated gaslight by Jules Fisher, the simple, wood-beamed set by David Jenkins allows the action to swing gracefully from auditorium to backstage to dressing room to tavern; the sense of being taken into a hermetically sealed theatrical world of the Victorian age is completed by the Cort Theater itself, a gilded relic closer in origin and spirit to 1849 than 1992. Though Mr. Nelson is an American writer, "Two Shakespearean Actors" was first produced two years ago with a different cast and director by the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-on-Avon. Rather than risk another riot, I will assume that the English production was far inferior to our own.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
DEMOCRATS VYING IN '92 RACE OFFER PAINLESS RECOVERY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Taking their cue from the successful scripts of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the Democratic candidates for President this year offer voters mostly painless solutions to the nation's economic problems.
Day after day in their campaigns, the candidates say the economy is the pivotal issue, and they repeat a common theme about ending a recession caused by the Bush Administration and launching a period of sustained economic growth. 
 But except for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, the Democrats make no suggestion, at least in their public pronouncements, that some bitter medicine might be necessary now to guarantee a healthy economy in the long run.
 
Economists Express Distress
 Their omissions distress many economists who are usually aligned with the Democratic Party, like Ted Van Dyk, who was an associate of Hubert H. Humphrey, and Charles L. Schultze, who was budget director in the Johnson Administration and chairman of President Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic Advisers.
The Presidential candidates rarely mention such unpleasant topics as the budget deficit, poor people, energy wastefulness or urban decay. Instead, they concentrate on tax cuts, universal medical insurance and new public works projects.
Economists generally agree that there is no way to finance such popular measures without increasing the deficit, raising taxes or cutting Social Security and Medicare, but a voter would never know that from listening to the Democratic candidates.
 
A Reagan 'Legacy'
 "This is significantly a legacy of Ronald Reagan," said Robert J. Shapiro, an economist here who is advising Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. "Reagan taught politicians and their handlers to focus on short-term benefits and that there was never any downside to the promise of a benefit."
Of the five major Democratic candidates, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton have published detailed statements of economic principles and proposals. They differ on many specifics but basically agree on the philosophy of using tax policy and Government resources to make workers and business more productive.
Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska talk much more in generalities. But they have staked out distinct positions along the ideological spectrum: Mr. Harkin as the apostle of the liberal and labor wing of the party who advocates spending Government money on projects, Mr. Kerrey as a moderate who wants to overhaul the medical care system.
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California says he is still working on the details of his platform, and he has avoided many of the economic issues that the other candidates discuss.
The other candidates deplore the growing gap between the incomes of the rich and the poor and blame the policies of the Reagan and Bush administrations. All the Democrats say the Government should be more actively engaged than it has been under Mr. Bush in using tax and spending policy to meet social and economic goals. And to one degree or another, all the Democrats advocate some form of economic nationalism, from Mr. Harkin's fist-pounding vow to "get tough on our trade competitors," to Mr. Tsongas's gentle urging of consumers to buy American-made products.
In his literature, Mr. Clinton maintains he is a free trader, but in campaign speeches his views are hardly distinguishable from those who openly favor a more protectionist trade policy. In the candidates' debate on Dec. 15, Mr. Clinton said he would "insist on fair trade," the euphemism used by those who favor trade restrictions, and suggested he would "retaliate" if Japan did not change its trade policies.
Many economists with strong Democratic connections said they were upset by the emphasis on trade restrictions and on the candidates' reluctance to discuss what these economists see as the country's economic difficulty, the enormous budget deficit.
"I'm terribly dismayed," said Mr. Van Dyk, who is now an economic and political consultant. He holds that any responsible Democratic platform would include a reduction in the deficit through a higher gasoline tax and a limit on what rich people could receive under Medicare and other Government programs.
Mr. Schultze, now an economist at the Brookings Institution, scolded the Democratic candidates for not coming to grips with the budget deficit. "You're not going to get out with nice, sugar-coated medicine," he said.
But the politicians remember what happened when Walter F. Mondale proposed a tax increase in 1984 and Michael S. Dukakis talked grimly about the deficit in 1988, while Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush talked only of keeping taxes low.
Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Brown support a tax reduction for middle class taxpayers, although most economists say that such a cut would do little for the economy.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey say they would finance tax relief for the middle class primarily through higher taxes on those with incomes of more than about $200,000 a year. Mr. Brown has not said how he would pay for a tax cut.
From different perspectives, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Tsongas oppose an income-tax cut and say the money could be better used elsewhere.
Mr. Harkin calls the few hundred dollars a year that would be yielded by a tax cut "a joke, a symbol," and would prefer to spend the money, as he said in last month's debate, on "roads and bridges and highways, mass transit, communications, energy systems."
Mr. Tsongas has a more downbeat tone and stresses the importance of the deficit and the strain an income-tax cut would place on the budget. But he favors other tax cuts that he says would increase saving and investment, and some of his proposals differ little from Mr. Bush's. For example, Mr. Tsongas would cut the capital gains tax, expand individual retirement accounts with favorable tax treatment and allow a new tax credit for business investments in plants and equipment.
Mr. Tsongas is not the only Democrat who sometimes sounds like Mr. Bush on economic matters. He is joined by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey in calling for a cut in the capital gains tax, long favored by the Republicans. Unlike Mr. Bush, who would apply the cut to profits from almost all investments, the three Democrats would restrict it to specific investments.
Mr. Harkin, in contrast, says a capital gains tax cut would "just dig the hole deeper" by subsidizing the rich.
 
Using the Government
 But however much some of their policies may sound like the Republicans', the Democratic candidates are distinguishable from Mr. Bush by an important feature. The President basically wants the Government to keep hands off and let the marketplace run the economy. To one degree or another, the Democrats want to use the Government's influence to guide the economy.
Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Tsongas use the phrase "industrial policy" in their speeches. This is a term, anathema to most Republicans, for throwing Government resources behind specific industries and even particular companies to give them a leg up on their international competitors. Mr. Clinton avoids the term but in many ways embraces the doctrine.
Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton espouse a new agency in the Government to channel money into civilian research, modeled after the existing Pentagon research agency that some conservatives have criticized for violating free-market principles.
Mr. Harkin also talks about investment, but it is primarily Government investment he wants. He proposes public works projects like the New Deal efforts of the 1930's that he says would put millions of Americans to work.
All the candidates would finance at least some of their proposals with military budget reductions. But none have toted up the cost of their programs or said exactly where the Pentagon would be cut.
Mr. Clinton has an additional idea. He would divide the budget into investment spending and consumption spending. Each year, the consumption budget could rise no faster than the rate of increase in personal incomes.

HEADLINE: A Fugitive, the Police and the Media

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPRING VALLEY, N.Y., Jan. 17

 BODY:
Real life seemed to have turned into a bad movie here today as this quiet community was ruffled by an intensive manhunt for a transvestite convicted killer and escaped convict who slipped away on Thursday from the F.B.I. as a fellow escapee was captured.
All Thursday night and today, hundreds of officers -- followed by teams of reporters -- crossed and recrossed this area of Rockland County, knocking on the doors of frightened residents and shopkeepers. They were looking for Frank Vandever, 37 years old, who terrified residents of Somers, Conn., by escaping from a maximum-security prison there on New Year's Eve. 
 "I'm scared, frightened," said Mary Jersey, as she showed a team of officers around the barns behind her house on Pascack Road. All night, she said, she saw the flashlights of search teams off in the woods behind the barns. "I've been here 18 years and we've never had action like this."
The search sometimes created a carnival atmosphere, with reporters dodging traffic on busy Route 59 to keep up with police teams checking on reported sightings.
Speculation here centered on whether Mr. Vandever, who had dressed in women's clothes in the past, might have eluded the block-by-block search by dressing as a woman. But Don Clark, an assistant F.B.I. special agent in charge of the multi-agency investigation here, said that Mr. Vandever was dressed in men's pants and a waist-length jacket. "I don't think he ran away in high-heeled shoes," he said.
About 3 P.M., Sheriff James Kralik of Rockland County said, a cabdriver picked up a man at the Spring Valley Transportation Center, a bus and taxi station, who officials said was probably Mr. Vandever. He bolted from the cab near a Buick dealership on Route 59, and the search then focused on that area.
Late today, the police in Orangetown notified the authorities heading up the investigation that a man wearing heavy makeup had used a fake bomb to steal $10,000 from a drive-up teller at a Marine Midland Bank in the neighboring village of Nyack. Orangetown officials raised the possibility that the thief might have been Mr. Vandever, but Officer Charles Kozler of Rockland County said that the authorities had yet to link him to the crime.
The manhunt, including roadblocks on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and the Palisades Parkway that caused long delays, began about 3:15 Thursday afternoon when Mr. Vandever pulled up to the Econolodge on Route 59, where the authorities said he had been staying for about 10 days.
Mr. Vandever, a former stockbroker who was serving a 40-year sentence for killing a client he had robbed, was accompanied by Ronald Rutan, who was serving a 19-year sentence for burglary when the two escaped from the Connecticut prison. In Connecticut the two tied up a husband and wife cleaning team in an office and stole their truck.
On Thursday, the F.B.I. office in Hartford received a telephone tip from a Connecticut woman who said that the two men were staying at the Econolodge here. Officials said she had seen a televised story on the two on the syndicated television show "Hard Copy." F.B.I. agents went to the motel just off the Thruway and saw the two men as they pulled up in the stolen truck and headed toward their room.
Mr. Clark, the F.B.I. special agent, said the agents spotted the two "before we were able to set up the way we wanted to." The agents, he said, identified themselves and the two ran in different directions. Mr. Clark said he would not answer questions about why the agents did not wait for back-up agents before confronting the men. Mr. Rutan was arrested several hundred feet away. Mr. Vandever vaulted over a fence and ran off.
F.B.I. agents and officers of New York, Connecticut and local police forces combed the woods with dogs. They warned residents to stay inside and not to pick up hitchhikers. They said they presumed that Mr. Vandever was armed and dangerous.
They searched cars at the toll plazas on the Tappan Zee Bridge, causing delays as long as three hours and infuriating drivers.
Harold Rannestad, a systems analyst from Bridgewater, Conn., whose trip home Thursday night was delayed two and a half hours, criticized the authorities for shutting down all but three toll booths.
"A lot of the cars were running out of gas," he said. "It was a dangerous condition, and I think it was poor judgment on the part of the police."
About 7 P.M. today, the search appeared to be growing less intense as the police stopped searching cars and traffic returned to normal.
This was not Mr. Vandever's first trip to Rockland County. In 1988, while he was being sought for the murder of Ronald Hiri, his former client, he was arrested in the nearby town of Orangeburg.
At the Econolodge here today, the desk clerk said Mr. Vandever had registered as Bill Weston of Causian Street in Sensor, Me., and said he was working for A. B. Capital Inc.
Officials said Mr. Vandever is a white man, five feet nine inches tall with hazel eyes and light brown hair.
The clerk, who said she would only give her first name, Roseanne, because she was afraid of Mr. Vandever, said he had been a charming guest who paid in cash and talked about wanting to move to the area. "It's scary," she said, "because he was such a gentleman. You can be taken in by him."

HEADLINE: A Pre-Election Israel: Focus on Talks With Arabs

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 17

 BODY:
With his governing coalition about to implode, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir seems to be preparing for imminent parliamentary elections by casting himself as Israel's best peace candidate, one flexible enough to talk with the Arabs but sturdy enough to protect vital national interests.
Not that Mr. Shamir has suddenly become a born-again dove. His position, restated more times than an electronic calculator can register, is that if peace means giving back even one square inch of Israeli-held territories to the Palestinians and Arab countries, forget it. 
 But talking peace is fine, he says. So is discussing some form of self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, as long as it stops there and does not lead to an independent Palestinian state.
"My will," he said today as he discussed the likelihood of early elections this spring, "is to continue the peace process."
 
A Message to U.S.
 That remark was intended to send a message in two directions -- first, to the broad Israeli political center that approves of negotiations with the Arabs; second, to President Bush, from whom he still wants to get $10 billion in loan guarantees to help cope with a tide of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. The last thing that Mr. Shamir wants to do at this dollar-crucial point is to give the President the impression that he sees the election campaign as a convenient way to dodge the peace talks.
The assumption that the Prime Minister would not weep if the peace negotiations collapsed is nurtured by a widely held view here that Israel would not be sitting at the bargaining table were it not for regular shoves in that direction by the United States.
Certainly, that is the argument offered by the political opposition. "We don't believe this Government is serious in the peace process," said Chaim Ramon, a member of Parliament and a rising star of the Labor Party. "Mr. Shamir is trying to pretend that he is interested."
Not so, aides to the Prime Minister say, insisting that he means business.
If so, he in a sense may be in a stronger position than ever to achieve a breakthrough with the Arabs, now that two far-right parties are poised to walk out of his coalition on Sunday because Israel's delegation in Washington this week uttered what they consider dirty words: Palestinian autonomy.
 
Shamir May Stay On
 Their departure will leave the Prime Minister two votes short of a majority in Parliament, and that means his Government is mortally wounded. But depending on the political machinations that ensue, and they are complicated in Israel's fractured democracy, Mr. Shamir might be able to soldier on as a caretaker for several more months.
Should that happen, he would theoretically be liberated to strike a quick deal with the Palestinians, because he would no longer have to cater to the no-concessions, not-now, not-ever orthodoxy of the far right. Few here would bet the family fortune on a fast settlement -- for one thing, the Government might wind up with an uprising by militant Israeli settlers on its hands -- but technically it is possible.
Moreover, some Israeli politicians argue that the Palestinians may recognize that it is in their self-interest to keep on talking even with a lame-duck Israeli leader, for they have few alternatives. They entered the process weak, they are divided among themselves, and the passage of time without tangible progress is unlikely to improve their situation.
While it is not clear what the next few months will bring, Mr. Shamir said today that it is "almost certain" that elections will be held before the present November deadline. May and June are the most frequently mentioned months, meaning that the campaign would have to begin by March at the latest.
Public-opinion polls suggest that Mr. Shamir's Likud Party has gained strength thanks to a rightward drift among voters and that the Labor Party is in serious need of resuscitation.
 
Memories of Scud Missiles
 It was a year ago that Iraqi Scud missiles started to fall on Israel, and lingering images of Palestinians dancing on rooftops and cheering Saddam Hussein have not been a boon for Israeli liberals and left-wingers. The same holds true for the recent wave of sniper attacks in the territories that have killed four Israelis and wounded many others.
Apparently sensing a winning issue, Mr. Shamir set the possible tone for the campaign by virtually labeling those on the left as traitors, declaring at a Likud conference last month that they were starting to "resemble our enemies, the leaders and murderers of Arab terrorism." Each Arab bullet may serve to reinforce his political position.
It may take weeks for the political situation to sort itself out, and besides, the stumbling Israeli economy and other domestic issues may be what will really get voter juices flowing, as they do anywhere else.
In the meantime, large questions loom.
 
Issue of U.S. Guarantees
 Perhaps the biggest is which way will the Russians and other new immigrants turn. There are an estimated 300,000 eligible voters among them, all unfamiliar with democratic ways. Except for a generally shared opinion that they will not support the religious parties, it is anyone's guess what they will do.
The United States is another important question mark, especially on the matter of loan guarantees.
Israel calls it humanitarian assistance. But if Washington comes through for Mr. Shamir in the midst of a campaign, he could cite it as proof of his political mastery in managing to talk peace but yield no land, to continue building settlements that the Americans hate and to get their help anyway. Would the Bush Administration be ready to bolster him like that?
On the other hand, if it withholds the aid, it could be accused of entering the campaign on Labor's side, for no doubt the opposition would waste no time declaring that Likud cannot deliver the goods after all.
And that says nothing about the prospects for ultimate Middle East peace if Israel goes through months of internal churning only to wind up with a political lineup that is not much different than now. How, some Israelis ask, will there ever be an autonomy agreement if ultimately Mr. Shamir must try to form a coalition by turning to the same right-wing partners who are now leaving him?

HEADLINE: U.S. LATIN POLICY YIELDS SOME GAINS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Jan. 17

 BODY:
As the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was preparing for today's first visit to Nicaragua by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista leader and former President, was clamoring for a meeting with Mr. Baker in Mexico before his arrival here.
Mr. Ortega's request was denied, and he had to content himself with seeking out the Secretary of State at an official lunch in Mexico City on Thursday. However, Mr. Baker was drawn into conversation not with Mr. Ortega, the Secretary of State told reporters later, but with the Cuban Foreign Minister, Isidoro Malmierca, who was at his table. 
 On Thursday night, when Mr. Baker arrived in San Salvador after witnessing the signing in Mexico of a peace accord to end the 12-year civil war, Marxist guerrillas with rock bands and red flags were holding a joyful rally in a city center plaza while President Alfredo Cristiani and his right-wing backers were celebrating in another square nearby.
Both scenes, barely imaginable a decade ago when Central America was aflame with ideological passion and violence, are illustrative of what Bush Administration officials regard as one of their most successful foreign policy initiatives: to bring peace, disarmament and economic development to this tormented region.
 
Collaspse of Soviet Union
 The strategy was immeasurably assisted by the collapse of the Soviet Union. But Bush Administration policy, low-keyed and methodical, has played an important role. First there was the virtual abandonment of the Nicaraguan contras, so championed by Ronald Reagan, followed by a diplomatic push for internationally monitored elections. Then came strong Administration pressure on the Salvadoran Government to accelerate negotiations to end the war and open the political process. Guatemala is next on the screen.
"The time has come to negotiate an end to Guatemala's 30-year-old insurgency," Mr. Baker told the Salvadoran National Assembly today. "When it ends, and it will end, we will be able to look across Central America for the first time in its history and see the promise of Esquipulas fulfilled: every nation living peacefully under a government freely chosen by its people."
Esquipulas is the Guatemalan town where in August 1987 five Central American presidents signed an accord calling for the cessation of regional conflicts, the strengthening of democratic institutions and the return of refugees and others displaced by conflicts. In mentioning Esquipulas, Mr. Baker acknowledged the importance of allowing regional leaders and organizations to take the lead. Keeping the United States in a supporting role lessens the chance of provoking traditional animosities born of Latin fears of United States dominance and interference.
 
Pressing Need for U.S. Aid
 There is also an important practical side to this. Administration officials recognize that the Salvadorans need assistance in rebuilding their country. But with foreign aid a pariah topic in an election year and the former Soviet republics already making large demands for assistance, the United States does not want to be in the position of having to refuse to pay the entire $1.8 billion estimated cost of the reconstruction of El Salvador.
Nicaragua has received about $535 million in American aid and has had $284 million in debts to Washington written off in the 20 months since the Chamorro Government came to power. An Administration official said this makes Nicaragua one of the highest per capita recipients of United States assistance.
But there were no pledges of new help made by Mr. Baker to the Central Americans. Indeed, Administration officials described this trip as in part a mission to assess the needs of the Central American nations and to begin to look for partners to help pay for regional development programs.
Among the groups that Mr. Baker hopes will contribute are wealthier Latin American nations and Canada, but the European Community is also being approached. A diplomat with years of experience in Latin America suggested that the longstanding concept of "spheres of infuence" has been substantially tempered by the Bush Administration's desire to "multilateralize" policies.
 
Role of Free Trade
 Greater regional problem-sharing is also fostered by the realization in the United States and throughout the hemisphere, where most nations now have democratic governments, that European and Asian trading blocs can be best tackled by a large free-trade area in this part of the world.
In his speech today, Mr. Baker spoke of a community of nations "whose citizens freely trade across borders from Alaska to Argentina." But many Latin Americans are convinced that movement in this direction can only be set back in an American election where a troubled economy is the main issue and voters may perceive trade agreements as foreign giveaways.
In Central America, the Administration has also encouraged a greater role for the United Nations, which is sending more than 1,000 peacekeepers to El Salvador to monitor a cease-fire due to start on Feb. 1. Secretary General Boutros Ghali presided over the signing of the Salvadoran peace accord in Mexico City on Thursday.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Loss In Quarter And Year

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Closing the books on its most difficult year in decades, I.B.M. said yesterday that it lost $1.38 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting in its first yearly deficit ever. In addition, revenues were off 6.1 percent for the year, the first time in 45 years that growth has faltered at the world's largest computer maker.
Calling the year disappointing, the company blamed a declining world economy, increased competition and the difficulties associated with introducing new product lines. 
 But a number of industry executives say the decline represents a more fundamental shift away from the centralized style of computing that since the 1950's has been the basis of the International Business Machines Corporation's business.
 
$3.4 Billion Charge
 For the quarter ending Dec. 31, usually the company's strongest, I.B.M. said revenue declined 4.2 percent, to $22.08 billion from $23.06 billion a year earlier. The loss in the period included a $3.4 billion charge as part of a sweeping decentralization and planned job cutback. By contrast, for the 1990 period I.B.M. earned $2.46 billion, or $4.30 a share. It put the cost of the restructuring at about $4.68 a share.
For the year, I.B.M. lost $2.83 billion on sales of $64.79 billion, compared with a 1990 profit of $6.02 billion on a record $69.02 billion in revenues. The results for the year included a one-time charge of $2.26 billion to cover an accounting change for retirement benefits.
After seesawing all day, I.B.M. shares ended the day on the New York Stock Exchange with a gain of 87.5 cents at $96.375.
 
Slipping in Many Areas
 "I think it's a terrible spending environment," said Stephen Cohen, an analyst at the Soundview Financial Group. "Beyond that, I think that I.B.M. is losing share in a lot of product areas, some of which they acknowledge and some of which they are not acknowledging."
Based on a trend variously referred to as "downsizing" or "network computing," corporate computer buyers have begun in recent years to move away from the multimillion-dollar mainframe systems that account for the bulk of I.B.M.'s earnings. Instead, they are buying smaller microprocessor-based systems and linking them to personal computers and work stations.
According to Computer Intelligence/Infocorp estimates, the number of I.B.M. mainframe shipments in the United States declined to 4,468 in 1991, from 6,181 in 1990. Computer Intelligence also estimates that the number of installed mainframes in the United States also declined to 24,448 in July 1991, from 25,636 in January 1990.
Yet other analysts discounted the effect of the mainframe decline. Robert Djurdjevic, an industry consultant who is president of Annex Research in Phoenix, said I.B.M.'s mainframe decline during 1991 was largely a result of the transition from one generation of systems to another. He said 1992 should see much stronger mainframe sales if the economy picks up.
Nevertheless, all sides agree that the trend away from mainframes is now reshaping the industry. On Thursday, the world's second-largest computer maker, the Digital Equipment Corporation, reported a $138 million loss for the quarter and said the company saw no early recovery. In contrast, Apple Computer Inc. said its revenues grew 10.7 percent, to $1.86 billion, for the quarter. Sun Microsystems, which is the largest producer of work stations and which will report its earnings next week, is also expected to have a strong quarter.
A number of Wall Street analysts said that despite the gloomy end-of-the-year report, I.B.M.'s efforts to control costs and restart growth would show results in 1992.
 
'In the Right Direction'
 "The momentum is beginning to move in the right direction," said Steven Milunovich, an industry analyst with Salomon Brothers. "The problem is we don't know how much better it will be this year. They will clearly need some economic help."
Last month the company told Wall Street that its special charge would be about $3 billion, but yesterday the actual figure came out $400 million higher. Analysts said that figure was a small surprise and that it suggested the company was moving rapidly on its employment cutbacks. Last year about 29,000 I.B.M. employees left the company.
Although I.B.M.'s stock has moved up strongly in recent days on rumors that the company's year-end report would be more positive than expected, it swung wildly yesterday after the company reported its results. Immediately after the announcement early in the morning the stock fell almost as low as 92, but swung back as high as 98 around noon after the company held a conference call with Wall Street analysts.
 
An Inventory Write-Off
 In the call the company said it had an inventory write-off that accounted for about 25 cents a share in earnings, which would be equal to $200 million to $250 million. This caused some analysts to revise their estimates upward and contend that the company had performed closer to expectations. However, other analysts said the company's tax rate had been lower than expected, tending to negate the effect of the inventory write-off.
In December, I.B.M. executives announced the company was radically rethinking its business to try to meet sweeping changes in the computer business. The company decentralized its management, freeing its various businesses to compete more aggressively and put in place a structure that will make it possible to sell portions of its business in the future. The company, which is based in Armonk, N.Y., also said it planned to reduce its work force by as many as 20,000 workers next year to try to contain costs.
 
'More Competitive' Now
 "We are moving into 1992 a tougher, smarter and more competitive business," said John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman. "Assuming some improvement in the current difficult and uncertain economic environment, we expect to increase revenue and improve cash flow and returns as the year goes on."
Despite a precipitous 15.6 percent decline in hardware revenue in 1991 to $37.1 billion, I.B.M. saw improvements of 5.8 percent in software, 3 percent in maintenance, 35.3 percent in services and 10.4 percent in its rental and financing business.
The company also reported that during 1990 revenue from its non-United States operations fell. Revenue from foreign operations in 1991 was $40.4 billion, a decline of 3.6 percent from $41.9 billion in 1990. Foreign earnings were $1.8 billion in 1991, compared with $4.6 billion in 1990.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Governor Seeks Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
At a time when other governors are being forced by soaring deficits to make unpopular tax increases, Governor William F. Weld introduced a package of tax cut proposals today that would reduce personal and business taxes as part of an effort to reinvigorate the Massachusetts economy.
Mr. Weld's proposals include lowering the personal income tax rate, cutting the capital gains levy and offering a series of investment credits to businesses that hire new employees, expand their plants or offer job training and child care. 
 "The time has come to help jolt our economy into recovery through further tax cuts," Governor Weld, a Republican, said in his State of the State speech Thursday evening, when he first outlined his plan. Massachusetts has lost more than 11 percent of its jobs since the recession began here three years ago, one of the worst declines for any state since the Depression in the 1930's.
Mr. Weld's program was immediately praised by some business leaders. But some economists criticized it, questioning how he could afford to make the tax cuts and whether they would help the state's deeply troubled economy. Several prominent Democrats also expressed skepticism about whether the state could afford to make the tax cuts without falling back into the pattern of budget deficits that paralyzed Massachusetts for several years before Mr. Weld became Governor last year.
The Democrats control both houses of the Massachusetts Legislature, but it is unclear whether they will vote against a tax-cut plan in an election year.
"This is a very thoughtful plan," said John Gould, president of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a trade group that represents businesses. "I believe sincerely that we could narrow the gap by which we trail the national economy if these measures are passed."
But Robert Reich, an economist and lecturer in public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said Mr. Weld's planned tax cuts "will be of little help" in revitalizing the state's economy. "We're talking about peanuts as far as the individual is concerned," Mr. Reich said.
Mr. Weld's plan calls for reducing the state income tax to 5.75 percent from 5.95 percent, and cutting the capital gains tax to zero for assets held six years. He estimated that his tax cuts would amount to $192 million in the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
 
Criticism on Service Cuts
 Noting that there had been a series of major cuts in state support for education and social services this year to balance the budget, Mr. Reich said, "This is not the time to cut taxes." For the Governor to cut taxes now, Mr. Reich said, Mr. Weld "would have to take a meat cleaver again to social services."
Governor Weld, an avowed libertarian, has frequently proclaimed his intention to shrink state government. In the 1980's, under Governor Michael S. Dukakis, a Democrat, Massachusetts developed one of the most liberal and far-reaching programs of social services, which added to the costs of state government and helped give the state the reputation of "Taxachusetts."
In his State of the State address on Thursday, Mr. Weld said that if his tax-reduction program is passed, "We will all be able to take pride in casting aside once and for all the last vestiges of the old insulting label 'Taxachusetts.' "
But at a news conference today, Mr. Weld declined to spell out what government programs would have to be cut to finance his proposed tax reductions while keeping the budget balanced. "Well, we'll see," he said at one point.
Pressed further, Mr. Weld would only say that he had ordered all his cabinet officers "to be creative about how they could deliver the same services that they have in the past at a 10 or 20 percent cut."
"I think in a way it's a phoney question to say who's going to be hurt," Mr. Weld said. "We can absorb, we can afford these tax cuts. Not only do I not think anybody's going to be hurt, I think a lot of people are going to be helped."
One of Mr. Weld's proposals would require that any future tax increase be passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature.
Richard Manley, the president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a business-sponsored tax watchdog group, said he could not say whether Mr. Weld's proposed measures were practical until the Governor releases his budget for the next fiscal year, beginning on July 1. He is scheduled to do so next week. Only then will it be clear what cuts Mr. Weld intends to propose in government services.
One important element, Mr. Manley said, is how big a deficit the state really faces in the new budget. Until recently, Mr. Weld's own advisers have placed the gap at $1.6 billion out of a budget of $13 billion. But Mr. Weld hinted today that the deficit may not be that large, and some economists say that Mr. Weld has been covering up the fact that tax revenues this year have been higher than expected.
Mr. Manley commended Mr. Weld for passing a balanced budget this year. But he said that many business leaders would be happier if Mr. Weld had just stuck with that accomplishment.
"The business community more than anything else wants predicatability and stability," Mr. Manley said. "This is more important than tax cuts," which could lead to lengthy fights with the Legislature and unsettle the state budget again.

HEADLINE: New Philip Morris Cigarette Emphasizes Less Nicotine

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In the tobacco industry's latest marketing wrinkle, the Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest cigarette company, introduced a major cigarette brand yesterday with 90 percent less nicotine than standard brands.
Philip Morris's low-nicotine cigarette is an attempt to appeal to smokers who want a seemingly healthier cigarette, but with more taste than other brands making similar claims. The industry's first such innovation, low-tar cigarettes, has now won a majority of sales. 
 Less nicotine would mean less satisfaction of the nicotine craving. The company discounted the possibility that some smokers might simply buy more cigarettes.
The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's Now brand and the American Tobacco Company's Carlton cigarettes have similarly low levels of nicotine, but emphasize low tar levels. They have rarely, if ever, made reduced nicotine a marketing theme.
Philip Morris plans to market its low-nicotine cigarette to Now and Carlton smokers.
Tar is made up of the particles in smoke that result from tobacco combustion. Nicotine is a nitrogen-based substance found in tobacco that some researchers say is strongly addictive. Unlike nicotine, which is largely flavorless, tar provides much of the distinctive taste of tobacco.
Philip Morris calls its new offering Merit Ultima, an offshoot of its troubled Merit brand. Like other full-price cigarettes, which in some regions of the country sell for $2.50 or more a pack, Merit has been selling poorly compared with discount brands, which sometimes cost as little as half the price.
Some of the most fervent of smokers are blue-collar workers, who have been hit hard by layoffs during the recession.
Merit had a 3.1 percent market share in the nine months ended last Sept. 30, a decline from 3.5 percent during the comparable period the year before, according to figures compiled by John C. Maxwell, Jr., an analyst at Wheat, First Securities Inc. Merit shipments for the period declined to 11.5 billion cigarettes, or more than half a billion packs, compared with 13.3 billion cigarettes, or close to three-quarters of a billion packs, during the 1990 months.
Merit Ultima "kings" contain one-tenth of a milligram of nicotine, compared with 1 milligram in Marlboros, which the industry dubs a "full flavor" brand. Ultima also contains a milligram of tar, compared with 16 milligrams in Marlboro, or 94 percent less. Merit Ultima 100's, a longer version, have twice the tar and nicotine levels of the "kings" brand.
Philip Morris's Marlboros are the world's best-selling cigarette.
 
Changing Focus
 David E. R. Dangoor, the senior vice president-marketing for Philip Morris U.S.A., said yesterday that the company had experimented with a cigarette having an even lower level of nicotine, four-one hundredths of a milligram, called Next De-Nic. The cigarette was designed to compete against discount brands, but Philip Morris decided instead to market with a full-price brand with low nicotine.
"We think we can get smokers who haven't switched to low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes because they haven't found anything smokable," Mr. Dangoor said.
Carlton and Now use low-nicotine tobacco blends and heavy filtration systems to reduce tar and nicotine. Merit uses what Philip Morris calls a "dual concentric filter," designed to make it easier to inhale the smoke while reducing nicotine.
 
A National Introduction
 Philip Morris, based in New York, is showing extraordinary confidence in the new product by introducing it nationally, rather than regionally. The new cigarette will be available on Feb. 18, backed by advertising devised by Leo Burnett, the advertising agency responsible for Marlboros and previous Merit versions.
The advertising slogans will be: "Introducing flavor at the lowest levels of tar and nicotine" and "Discover a new way to smoke at the lowest levels of tar and nicotine."
Philip Morris appears to be aiming Merit Ultima at men, judging from its advertising emphasis on flavor. At the end of the cigarette, it is using the brownish tipping -- a "cork" in industry parlance -- that is preferred by full-flavor cigarette smokers, usually males.
 
'Will It Work?'
 Analysts were undecided about the low-nicotine innovation yesterday. "Does it make sense? Will it work?" asked Mr. Maxwell of Wheat, First. "I guess we'll find out. Nobody really follows nicotine levels."
Low-tar cigarettes have been a growing portion of cigarette sales since Carlton was introduced in 1964, and now make up the majority of cigarettes sold. About 61.2 percent of cigarettes shipped last year had reduced levels of tar.
Such cigarettes are popular with smokers trying to quit, and, as such, have been a lucrative addition to tobacco companies' product lines.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Narrows To Smallest in 9 Years

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Plunging demand for imports and a slight increase in exports shrank the nation's trade deficit in November to $3.57 billion, the smallest level in almost nine years, the Commerce Department said today.
October's trade deficit was also revised downward, to $6.32 billion from an initial estimate of $6.73 billion, further impressing economists, who look at the average of a string of monthly trade deficits rather than a single month's total. The deficit in November 1990 was $9.54 billion. 
 The Bush Administration, which emphasized trade issues and particularly car imports during the President's visit last week to Japan, greeted the news as a sign of increased American competitiveness in world markets. But private economists said a 5.5 percent slump in seasonally adjusted imports from October, the biggest such drop in nearly a year, also showed how weak the economy had become as consumers refrained from buying.
 
Economic Slump Stands Out
 "The important thing that comes out of these statistics is the slump in economic activity," said Jeffrey J. Schott, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
One of the biggest improvements in the trade deficit came from a decline in imports of cars and car parts, which fell to $7.65 billion, from $8.79 billion in October. The improvement should help President Bush resist Congressional proposals for restrictions on automobile imports, said Robert D. Hormats, a deputy United States trade representative in the Carter Administration who is now the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
But Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Michigan Democrat who is sponsoring a bill that would force reductions in Japanese car shipments to the United States if the bilateral deficit did not improve, said the schedule in Congress would not allow it to consider such legislation for another one or two months. The trade deficit may widen again during this period, he said.
The President cannot, however, claim credit for the drop in auto imports, which was evenly divided between imports from Canada and Japan, because it came before he began seeking to narrow the nation's annual $41 billion trade deficit in cars and car parts, Mr. Hormats added. The drop in auto imports mirrored a virtually identical drop in car imports from October to November a year earlier as the recession began to deepen.
Over all, seasonally adjusted imports dropped in November to $41.03 billion from $43.43 billion.
 
Rise in Aircraft Exports
 Exports, meanwhile, rose nearly a percentage point from October to set a record of $37.46 billion in November. But Stephen L. Cooney Jr., the director of international investment and finance at the National Association of Manufacturers, said the gain was not significant because it came in aircraft exports, a notoriously volatile category, in which a single delivery can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
The nation's three most controversial trading relationships all improved in November from October. The deficit with Japan narrowed to $3.41 billion from $4.64 billion, mostly because of the fall in car shipments.
The deficit with China slipped to $1.34 billion from $1.65 billion. The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, today signed an agreement reached Thursday evening that committed China to halt the illegal copying there of American pharmaceuticals, books, computer programs and music recordings.
 
Bush Fights for China
 President Bush has been struggling to win Congress's permission for an unconditional renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade status. Administration critics in Congress have focused on China's violations of human rights and ballooning trade surplus with the United States.
The American trade surplus with Mexico widened to $272.8 million in November from $62.3 million in October. The Administration is negotiating with Mexico a free trade agreement that many Democrats oppose because they fear it will result in a large loss of low-skill jobs and scant gains of high-skill jobs.
Continued gains for American manufactured goods in trade with these and other countries gave the United States a trade deficit of only $45.7 million in November, excluding oil. According to Commerce Department figures, it was the best performance for the non-petroleum trade balance since a $53.9 million surplus in June 1983.
 
Indicator of Competitiveness
 Rockwell Schnabel, who is the Acting Commerce Secretary pending Senate confirmation of Barbara H. Franklin, said non-petroleum trade was "a better indicator of our international competitiveness" than the overall trade deficit.
The overall November trade deficit was the smallest since a deficit of $2.84 billion in March 1983.
Several economists said today that recent growth in exports could be threatened if the weeklong rally in the dollar's value resumes and lasts into early spring, which would make American exports more expensive overseas, and if foreign economies continue to weaken, reducing their ability to afford American goods.
If both trends continue, Mr. Hormats said, "We're going to see a weaker share of a smaller market" for internationally traded goods.
 
Fed Intervenes in Markets
 Some Administration officials appear to share that concern, and some currency traders said the Federal Reserve intervened heavily in the market today to help the dollar reverse course.
The dollar had been rising in recent days despite official approval by President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in Tokyo last week for the downward drift in the dollar during late 1991. "The President and Prime Minister reviewed developments in financial markets and agreed that recent exchange rate movements were consistent with current economic developments," the two leaders said in a statement.
But the dollar has only gained back a third of the value it lost against the German mark in the second half of 1991 and an even smaller fraction of its losses against other foreign currencies, thereby retaining its competitive advantage for exporters.
"It would take a rally of historic proportions to have an effect on our exports now," said Mr. Cooney of the National Association of Manufacturers.

HEADLINE: For 2 U.S. Divisions in Germany, Taps

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Two United States Army divisions that landed at Normandy 48 years ago and later defended American interests in the cold war marked their last day in Europe today as they were officially disbanded.
As flags came down, the commander of the Third Armored Division, Maj. Gen. Jerry R. Rutherford, said: "The cold war is over. Our mission is accomplished. It's time to go home." 
 A band played under a chill, cloudy sky, and soldiers and their families stood in silence with American and German officers and diplomats, as cannon roared a 14-gun salute.
The Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, deftly wrapped the colors of the Third Armored around a flagstaff lowered by a division standard-bearer. General Rutherford, then tugged a khaki casing over the colors, bringing to an end his troops' watch on what used to be the fault line between the free West and the Communist East.
Robert M. Kimmitt, the American Ambassador to Germany, told the remnant of the division that remained to form the honor guard, "You leave Europe and the people of Europe more peaceful, more prosperous and more stable than they have been in their modern history."
 
Most Go to Other Units
 When the day was over, the Third Armored and Eighth Infantry divisions, once powerful forces in NATO's forward defense, were no more. The Third Armored has been deactivated and most of its soldiers have been ordered to other units, while some have left the Army. The division headquarters, where today's ceremony was held, will probably soon be transformed into an industrial park by the Germans.
At a second ceremony, the Eighth Infantry was also deactivated and its remnants merged with the First Armored Division, which has headquarters in Bad Kreuznach, 40 miles southwest of here.
The troop withdrawals from Germany, where the mainstay of the United States forces in Europe have been stationed since the close of World War II, is part of President Bush's plan to reduce American military strength in Europe to about 150,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen by 1995. More than 300,000 were here at the close of 1989, when the Berlin wall came down.
Military spokesmen said the Army now has about 150,000 soldiers in Europe, down from a peak of 230,000. By 1993, when the reduction is to be completed, 93,000 will remain.
 
Relics of Last War
 At Drake barracks, a former German army encampment that was the Third Armored headquarters, relics of the last war bear testimony to the division's role in Europe. There are carefully kept Sherman tanks and other World War II-vintage armored vehicles of the kind that the unit used when it joined other American, British and Canadian troops at the Normandy landing in 1944.
The division's nickname, Spearhead, derives from its role in leading allied forces across northern France and into Germany, all the way to Dessau on the Elbe River.
Today, a small band of Dutch citizens from the Limburg region traveled by car to the ceremony. Each year, representatives of the Third Armored make a pilgrimage to the Netherlands to lay wreaths at war graves, including that of Maj. Gen. Maurice Rose, the division commander, who was killed in the 1944 fighting.
Deactivated after the war, the division was renewed in 1949 and deployed in Germany in 1956 at the height of the cold war, stringing its forces out along the Fulda Gap, across gentle valleys from the armies of the Warsaw Pact.
 
Thanks From Hesse's Premier
 Opinion polls have always showed a broad majority of Germans thankful for the American presence, and today, the Social Democratic Premier of Hesse state, Hans Eichel, whose party often appeared uncomfortable with American military might, thanked the soldiers profusely for the "decisive role" their presence played in bringing about Germany's reunification.
Among the soldiers who began gathering several hours before the ceremony began was Maj. Randall Scheffler, who fought with the Third Armored in the Persian Gulf last year after serving for five years at the Fulda Gap.
"It's not just changing politics, it's the changing of an era," he said. "Then, it was a question of alertness, of readiness, because you read the intelligence reports, you knew the enemy was right over here, moving up, then back, meaning that at any moment this might be it. Now, you're training for rapid reaction anywhere."
Many of the soldiers face uncertain futures as entire divisions yield to leaner and more mobile NATO forces supported by smaller nuclear arsenals.
 
6,000 Returned to U.S.
 Since the Third Armored returned from the Persian Gulf last summer, 6,000 soldiers and their families have been sent back to the United States, many of them to seek jobs outside the Army in a recession economy.
For German regions losing the troops, the blows will be equally harsh. The Army employs more than 50,000 German civilians, and by the middle of the decade that number will drop to about 33,000. Thousands more thrive indirectly on the army's presence.
"Just go up around Heidelberg or Kaiserslautern, and you'll see how hard it will be," said Hermann Schultz, 72 years old, who has run a handful of fried chicken shops near American bases since the 1960's.
 
A 'Normal' U.S. Presence
 For younger Germans, like Niels Bojunga, a 23-year-old student who commutes to Frankfurt University from a neighborhood laced with American military, the departure is met with indifference.
"For my generation, they became part of the landscape," he said of the Americans, adding, "Until German unification, I believe it was completely normal for them to be here."
Mr. Bojunga said he believed the alliance with America to be "still important, though a military presence is not necessary."
His is not a view shared by Government officials who complained this week to visiting Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that America's withdrawal is moving ahead too quickly, at a time when Bonn is only beginning to reflect on its changing role in a Europe marked by economic crisis to the east, turmoil in Russia, and 180,000 soldiers of the old Soviet Union still stationed in ther former East Germany.
But for some Germans, the American withdrawal is the natural consequence in a Europe from which the onetime adversary, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, has disappeared. "The real watershed was the end of the East-West conflict," said Volker Muller-Siebert, a Frankfurt lawyer in his 30's. "This withdrawal is merely a consequence. There is no need for them anymore."

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Role In Sanitation Is Faulted

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
The departing Sanitation Commissioner of New York City is faulting the Dinkins administration for failing to acknowledge the fact that it is running out of ways to get rid of its garbage.
The Commissioner, Steven M. Polan, said that while Mayor David N. Dinkins has offered "tepid" support for new incinerators, he has failed to move forward in building them. The Mayor has also failed to fully support recycling, Mr. Polan said. 
 And Mr. Dinkins is not alone, the Commissioner said.
"Every elected official in this city and state that I have spoken to in the last two years has told me privately that we need to build incinerators here," he said. "But none will say so publicly. If the problem doesn't need to be solved today, in their terms of office, why should they bother? We haven't built a new solid-waste facility in this city in 30 years. The obvious question here is, are these people leaders or followers?"
 
'Ridiculously Naive'
 With its recycling programs floundering, its vast fleet of garbage trucks serviced by a dwindling crew of mechanics and its plans for up to three new incinerators opposed with a steeply rising intensity, Mr. Polan said the city faces problems it may soon be unable to solve.
His comments came during an unusually stark assessment of his tenure at the department and reflected his frustration with the city's failure to address a growing problem.
"The original premise of the recycling program was ridiculously naive," said Mr. Polan, who in April 1990 became head of the department and next month will turn it over to Emily Lloyd, who was appointed on Wednesday. "The underlying premise was that the city would embrace it. That didn't happen. We have not met our goals. Markets have not developed. And right now we are spending money we don't have."
Despite evidence that incineration and recycling have been compatible in many countries, the two approaches to waste disposal have created defiantly separate camps in New York City. Mr. Polan, however, has long argued that the city must broaden both its recycling program and its capacity to burn garbage. In doing so, he has often alienated both sides. But he has been regarded as a highly effective manager, softening the brunt of the large budget cuts his department has endured.
Environmentalists, however, who have often regarded him as well meaning and well spoken, say he has been unable to accomplish the city's goals: a sharp reduction in waste and a huge increase in recycling.
"He tried," said Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "But either he or the city weren't able to move as far forward as we need to go." Political gridlock has prevented building new incinerators. Anemic compliance and steady budget cuts have disemboweled the recycling program.
Since he announced his resignation more than a month ago, Mr. Polan has made it clear that he decided to leave out of deep frustration at his inability to convince the Dinkins administration of the need to address either issue more forcefully.
Mr. Polan stopped short of blaming Mayor Dinkins for the seemingly endless impasse on building new incinerators, although he questioned whether the Mayor or any other city official would pay serious attention to a major new solid-waste plan the department will release next month.
 
Volume for the Bookshelf?
 The 20-year plan, which will address the need for as many as three new incinerators -- at a projected cost of at least $1 billion -- and a much more vigorous recycling program, has been under development for more than a year.
"After all this time and effort I think there is a real question whether it will mean a thing," he said. "It may become just another volume for the bookshelf, and the city cannot afford that."
Mr. Polan noted that unlike most elected officials, the Mayor has said publicly that the city would eventually need new incinerators. But the Commissioner said that there would be no solution without more visible leadership, because few neighborhoods ever welcome such unpleasant necessities.
The Mayor's press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said that Mr. Dinkins was studying proposals for an incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and other locations, but had not made a final decision. Mr. Jones added that Mayor Dinkins was well aware of -- and shared -- Mr. Polan's frustrations about such issues as recycling, street cleaning and the loss of nearly 200 mechanics last year, which jeopardizes proper maintenance of the department's fleet of 4,000 vehicles.
 
Little Choice
 "Recycling has been difficult," Mr. Jones said. "And right now there is genuine concern about how much you can collect and how much you can recycle."
In New York, neither figure has been high -- and it has proven difficult to sell much of what has been recycled at a reasonable profit. Mr. Polan estimated that it now costs $300 to collect and process every ton of recycled waste in the city. By comparison, the expenses of collecting it and dumping it at the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island is less than $200 a ton.
But Fresh Kills, the world's largest dump, will close within the next decade. At the same time, Congress has begun to edge toward permitting states to ban the importation of garbage. When those alternatives disappear, it will leave the city with little choice but to recycle or burn its refuse.
In the 12-month period that will end in April, the city had planned to recycle 2,100 tons of its 17,000 tons of residential trash each day. Sanitation officials concede that the department will be lucky to recycle 1,000 tons, barely 6 percent of the daily total. Commercial recycling, mandated by law as of November, has also struggled to prove economically viable.
Major recycling efforts in the city began only after the City Council required it in 1989. The law established gradually expanding goals -- 25 percent recycling by 1994 -- that now seem impossible.
"The situation here is very bleak," Mr. Goldstein of the Natural Resources Defense Council said. "But it is going to get much worse. Nobody is willing to break the logjam. There has been a revolution in handling trash in this society and in New York nobody wants to acknowledge it or invest in the future."
Mr. Polan agrees, up to a point.
"The program will have to be expanded to succeed," he said of recycling. "But it may be possible even with the best of efforts that the type of recycling this city envisioned won't work here. We have to begin to look at what makes sense and not just what we would like to see."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
PRESIDENT JOINS KING OBSERVANCE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 17

 BODY:
President Bush came to the resting place of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. today, locked arms with his widow and sang "We Shall Overcome" in a trip clearly aimed at smoothing the edges of the Presidential image on race.
But before Mr. Bush left the stage of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, he heard an angry benediction from one of Dr. King's daughters, the Rev. Bernice King. In her prayer, she said the problems of racism, poverty and violence that her father had fought against remained a blight on the land, although she did not link their persistence directly to Mr. Bush. 
 "How dare we celebrate when more than 40 million Americans are without health care?" she demanded in the closing prayer. "How dare we celebrate in the midst of a recession, when nobody is sure whether their jobs are secure?"
It was a tough note of implicit criticism in an otherwise gently planned day in which Mr. Bush surrounded himself with the symbols of racial tolerance and biracial democracy. He laid a wreath at Dr. King's tomb, signed a proclamation declaring Monday a national holiday to honor Dr. King and kept Coretta Scott King close to his side.
The President was accompanied by his only black Cabinet member, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, who seldom travels with him. Before joining the Cabinet, Dr. Sullivan was president of the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.
In Mr. Bush's speech at the King Center today, he appealed for "compassion" and "service" and the values that Dr. King "beseeched us to embrace -- of tolerance and decency and mutual respect." Mr. Bush talked of his committment to "root out bigotry wherever we find it." He listened to the glee club from Dr. King's alma mater, Morehouse College, sing spirituals like "I've Gotta Mind to Do Right Everyday."
 
'Cannot Walk the Walk'
 But there was blunt criticism of the President's trip from Democrats. John Lewis, the Democratic Congressman from Georgia who served with Dr. King in some of his bloodiest campaigns, said in an interview of Mr. Bush, "He's good at talking the talk, but he cannot walk the walk." Mr. Lewis added, "Dr. King didn't go in much for symbols."
And Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, declared in a statement: "Today, at the gravesite of Martin Luther King Jr., President Bush's hypocritical rheotric was at its worst. How can a President who allowed racially divisive ads to become the cornerstone of his Presidential campaign, who signed the Civil Rights Act only after insurmountable pressure from civil rights organizations, be taken at his word when he claims he's committed to ridding our country of bigotry and racism?"
Mr. Brown was referring to the Bush campaign's use in 1988 of the case of Willie Horton, a black convicted murderer who escaped from the Massachusetts prison system while on a weekend furlough and later raped a Maryland woman and stabbed her fiance. The campaign used the case to attack Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, as soft on crime.
 
Where Sensitivity Counts
 As he enters an election year, Mr. Bush has two political reasons to send signals of racial sensitivity. Republicans have long hoped to nibble away at the Democrats' support among blacks, which is overwhelming in Presidential elections and many statewide races. At the same time, Mr. Bush has to pay attention to his party's image on racial issues among centrist white voters.
Some analysts argue that these voters can be turned off by the rougher racial politics of recent years, including Mr. Bush's repeated attacks on Congress for advocating what he asserted was a "quota bill" but what its advocates, Republican and Democratic, asserted was simply legislation to combat job discrimination. Moreover, such voters are likely to be alarmed by the rise of David Duke, the former Klansman who ran for Governor of Louisiana last year and is now seeking the Republican Presidential nomination.
Mr. Bush told his audience at the King center today that he was proud that two major civil rights bills had been passed during his Administration: the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Civil Rights Bill of '91. The latter measure generated a two-year struggle between the White House and Congress that ultimately ended in compromise.
 
'Kindler, Gentler' Oratory
 Mr. Bush's day was infused with the kind of "kinder, gentler" oratory that he occasionally used in the otherwise hard-edged 1988 campaign. He talked of the importance of family -- "Barb and I feel it in our own lives" -- and the importance of community service. He noted that he had met this week with Magic Johnson and said he wanted to help the basketball star in fighting the spread of AIDS.
"I want to use the bully pulpit of the White House -- continue to use it for that same purpose, to speak out for strong research so to help people better understand the disease and to speak out for a change of behavior," said Mr. Bush, who has often been criticized by advocates for people with AIDS for not doing enough.
Mr. Bush also took the opportunity today to announce a reorganization of Federal job training programs that he said would make certain that such programs suited "the needs of the workplace and the marketplace." Administration officials said the move was intended to streamline and consolidate such programs, currently spread over several Federal agencies, and create "one stop shopping centers" for such services.
An Administration official said it would not involve any additional money.
Mr. Bush was greeted here today by a poll in The Atlanta-Journal Constitution that showed that even in the South, which is considered his stronghold, the President is suffering political harm. In the poll, conducted by telephone in 12 Southern states, Mr. Bush's approval rating had dropped to 55 percent, from 73 percent in September.
The survey, conducted by telephone Jan. 9-13, was based on interviews with 802 people considerered likely to vote and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Makers of Small Planes Wait for Brighter Skies

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Domestic makers of small airplanes sold fewer last year than at any time since World War II. One major manufacturer, Piper, is in bankruptcy; another, Cessna, is up for sale.
But like flying the rickety little machines that gave rise to the modern aviation industry, making small planes today has some long-term promise to compensate for the immediate perils. The industry is developing many new products, with exports and sales of business jets growing. 
 Still, the industry sold only 1,021 planes last year, a decline of 11 percent, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association of Washington reported this week. The association represents makers of planes including corporate jets, small personal aircraft and commuter planes with 19 or fewer seats, but not larger commercial airliners.
The latest news was a gloomy echo of what has been heard year after year, and it was attributed to familiar causes. Aside from the recession, the industry's perennial ills include high costs for product liability, uncomfortably congested airports and two tax changes: the elimination of the investment tax credit in 1986, and the imposition in 1990 of a 10 percent sales tax on luxury goods, including many small planes.
"That is how you go from building over 17,000 airplanes in a single year to only 1,021," said Brian E. Barents, president of the Learjet Corporation and chairman of the trade group, alluding to the decline in the industry's shipments since 1978, the peak year. "That is how you reduce employment in the general-aviation manufacturing sector by half."
Last year's results prompted John Modzelewski, an analyst at Paine Webber, to note that the industry's annual reports of recent years have always had the same message: "This is the bottom; no, this is the bottom; no, this is the bottom," he said.
 Among the causes for optimism, most companies in the business are efficient producers, he said. If sales of small planes rebound after sinking below $2 billion last year, manufacturers could find themselves suddenly making a lot of money.
"You don't need all that big a rebound," he said.
The industry wants the Government to stimulate that rebound with specific tax changes rather than with broadly stimulative fiscal and monetary policies.
"The secret, not only for our industry, but for many others, is to reintroduce the investment tax credit," said Mr. Barents, who does not expect an economic turnaround until the second half of the year. "We can't think of any other initiative that would have more impact."
Investment tax credits would refund to corporations part of taxes they owe, based on how much they invest in capital goods and equipment.
 
Seeking Repeal of Luxury Tax
 The association called not only for the tax credit, but also for repeal of the 10 percent luxury tax on planes used less than 80 percent for business purposes. The tax, the manufacturers said, has sharply reduced airplane sales and raised almost no revenues.
The Bush Administration is drafting tax proposals to help pull the economy out of recession. Although an investment tax credit is not often mentioned as part of the package, the plan is said to include accelerated depreciation for business investments, which would have the same stimulative effect as a tax credit on business spending for all types of equipment, including airplanes.
Whatever emerges in tax policy, changes in the industry appear inevitable, especially in the market for small, piston-driven propeller planes. Although the Raytheon Company's Beech unit and a few other companies are still making piston planes, only 613 were delivered last year.
 
Piper in Bankruptcy

The Piper Aircraft Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July, has agreed to sell most of its assets to Cyrus Eaton Group International Ltd., which plans to move production to Canada; some planes may also be built in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union.
The company found that the cost was too high to insure itself against liability for accidents involving thousands of existing Pipers. A move to Canada would erect a barrier between the new owner and potential litigants.
The Cessna Aircraft Company, also citing liability concerns, stopped making small, piston-driven planes in 1986, and now its parent company, the General Dynamics Corporation, has put Cessna up for sale. Final bids are expected soon and a decision about whether to sell the company or spin it off into a separate entity could come within weeks.
Mr. Modzelewski said the fate of Cessna represented a test of the industry's health and the best single indication of Wall Street's outlook for the industry. "I have been saying they will get $700 million for it, which I think is a good price," he said. Today, Raytheon and Dassault Aviation S.A., of France, confirmed that they were separately bidding for Cessna, but declined to say how much.
 
Business Jets Do Better

Cessna delivered 176 planes last year -- many of them Citations, the most popular line of business jets in recent years. The business jet market did nicely in 1991, as the industry shipped 186 planes, 11 percent more than the year before. Billings were $1.3 billion.
Manufacturers have continued to invest heavily in new designs. Several new business jets have been announced, and others, including the Learjet 60 and the new Citationjet, are about to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But the suppliers, like their customers, said that the business jet market was being held down by both the recession and tax policy. "When the country regains its economic strength, we anticipate that the demand for business travel, and therefore business aircraft, will increase," said Cassandra Bosco of the National Business Aviation Association, a Washington trade group representing companies that own and operate planes for business purposes. The group strongly endorses renewal of the investment tax credit.
Export markets also held up well in 1991, largely because of favorable exchange rates. More than a third of the planes sold last year were exported.
But the market for turboprop planes -- whose propellers are driven by turbine engines -- including the smaller planes used by commuter airlines, was weak last year. Shipments dropped 21 percent, to 222 aircraft valued at $527 million.

HEADLINE: California Governor Tells of Suffering, But Question Now Is Whose Was It

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 17

 BODY:
In his State of the State Message last week, did Gov. Pete Wilson invent a cast of brave California characters struggling with the recession? Even his press office did not seem to be sure today.
In a portion of the speech that he wrote, Mr. Wilson gave a detailed account of a farm worker, a businessman and a carpenter who had impressed him with their suffering and determination. But when reporters tried to track them down, his press office said they did not exist but were composites. 
 "I don't have the name," a deputy press secretary, Franz Wisner, is quoted as saying in today's San Jose Mercury News, which said it spent four days trying to find the carpenter. "There is no name. There is no carpenter. That first part of the speech is a composite of the thousands of Californians the Governor has come in contact with."
But today Mr. Wisner said: "There is a carpenter. His name is Shad Murphy. He is unemployed and he makes toys." He also identified a farm worker and a businessman who fit the Governor's descriptions.
 
Common Among Politicians
 "Isn't that funny?" said Susan Estrich, the former Presidential campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis who now teaches law at the University of Southern California. "They finally found them. It seems to have taken a massive state effort by his aides to refresh everyone's recollections."
She said it was common for politicians to furnish vivid personal examples in their speeches but that it was obligatory for their staffs to be prepared to present living proof.
"Politics are theater, but they are not Hollywood," said Ms. Estrich. "There are rules of the game and one of the basic rules is truth."
Even as Mr. Wisner spoke today, another deputy press secretary, accompanying Mr. Wilson on a visit to the University of California at Davis, repeated his office's earlier explanation, saying: "Let's face it, every writer in the world has used allegory. Instead of focusing on one individual, the Governor used the image of Californians who are struggling for their livings."
And a press release issued today by the Governor's office called his heroes "symbolic representations" and said, "The statements are a composite of the many conversations he has had with people throughout California."
Mr. Wilson spoke of seeing "worry in the face of a farm worker idled by a killer arctic freeze" and of watching "the eyes of a gruff, gray-haired businessman grow wet as he spoke of having to lay off people who'd kept his small shop running for years."
Most colorfully, he described "the kindly face of a carpenter who could find no work framing houses and now makes children's toys for free."
Reached at the Mendocino Center for the California Conservation Corps in Ukiah, where he does general construction work, Mr. Murphy said he been among a group of workers who had met with the Governor on Dec. 20 in conjunction with a Rotary Club donation of handmade toys.
Asked if Mr. Wilson's description of him was accurate, he said, "Kindly face? Yes. A carpenter? I just wouldn't use that word for myself. Or making children's toys for free."
He said he had not told the Governor that he had been unemployed. But he added, "If he was using me as that, I feel that's fine."
 
'My Eyes Do Get a Little Wet'
 The businessman, Wesley C. Seastrom, chairman of Seastrom Manufacturing Company in Glendale, also said he was comfortable with Mr. Wilson's references to him. "He was at my plant and we discussed it, and my eyes do get a little wet when I talk about laying people off," he said.
The farm worker was identified by Mr. Wisner as Concepcion Meza of Visalia, but there was no Concepcion at the one Meza household listed in the Visalia directory.
Mr. Wilson's references to individual examples recalled the style of another Republican Governor of Californaia, former President Ronald Reagan. And today's controversy also called to mind the criticisms of Mr. Reagan for fabricating some of his examples.
"Reagan was famous for doing things like that," said Paul Slansky, who wrote "The Clothes Have No Emperor" (Simon & Schuster, 1989), a book about the Reagan years. "Supposedly there was some woman in Chicago, a welfare cheat, who Reagan talked about who drove a Cadillac to pick up her check, but when he was asked, he could never say who she was or when this happened."
 
A 'Good Story'
 After one of Mr. Reagan's misstatements in 1982, regarding strict firearms laws in Great Britain, his spokesman, Larry Speakes, said:, "Well, it's a good story, though. It made the point, didn't it?"
In the State Senate, where Mr. Wilson delivered his speech and where a battle is now under way over the budget he presented the next day, one staff member said good stories like these overstep the accepted norms of colorful rhetoric.
"This doesn't do much for his credibility," said Bob Forsythe, an aide to Senate President pro Tempore David Roberti, a Los Angeles Democrat.
"California is a place of professional politicians who have made countless speeches in their careers," Mr. Forsythe said. "They understand rhetorical devices -- pathos, ethos and logos, if you're following Aristotle -- but I don't know in my experience that anyone has made this big a stretch."
At The Mercury News, the managing editor, Jerry M. Ceppos, said, "Journalism has had its own problems with composite characters, and I had assumed that by this time, both journalists and politicians knew that you can't use composite characters unless you identify them as such."

HEADLINE: Consumer Report Shows Spirits Have Yet to Revive

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The nation's spirits have yet to revive from last fall's recessionary levels, according to the closely watched University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment.
"Sentiment has remained largely unchanged" from December, its report to subcribers said. The sentiment index edged down from 68.2 in December to 67.1 in January, but a decline of a point or so is not statistically significant. 
 The report was disappointing, not only to investors but to Federal Reserve officials who were looking for some sign, however slight, that the Fed's latest easing move was having an impact on Main Street. On Tuesday, a rumor that the survey would show a sharp rise in confidence helped the stock market to a hefty rally.
"There's no great watershed reaction to the Fed's discount rate reduction," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, "Stock market euphoria hasn't swept consumers."
This initial look at the way consumers feel about the economy and their own finances in January is based on a telephone survey of about 300 families around the country in the first half of the month -- slightly more than half the total sample.
The closely watched monthly survey, which economists say tracks current consumer spending reasonably well, is included in the Department of Commerce's monthly index of leading indicators.
There are several crosscurrents in the January results. Though consumers have become slightly more upbeat about the present, they have also turned gloomier about the future. While the index of current conditions rose to 80.7 percent vs. 78.7 in December, the index of expectations declined to 58.4 percent from 61.5 percent.
The problem, not surprisingly, is jobs or, rather, the lack of them. Fifty-seven percent of households expect the jobless rate to climb in the year ahead compared with 47 percent just two months ago.
Interestingly, 64 percent of the consumers surveyed mentioned hearing news reports of rising joblessness. That is the highest portion ever recorded in the history of the survey, which began in 1954.
"Any pickup in consumption this quarter is likely to be modest," said Michael Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
Still, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, will find one cheery footnote in the Michigan report. The fraction of households who say that now is a good time to buy a house spurted to two-thirds.

HEADLINE: New York Takes Hertz To Court Over Surcharge

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
New York City and New York State sued Hertz yesterday over its two-week-old surcharge for renters from four New York City boroughs, calling it illegal discrimination.
At a City Hall news conference announcing the suit, Robert Abrams, the Attorney General, said the Hertz Corporation "can charge whatever rate it wants." But he added, "What it cannot do is charge different people different rates based on where they live." 
 The company said it was doing nothing wrong and would see the city and state in court.
 
$56-a-Day Surcharge
 On Jan. 2, Hertz imposed a $56-a-day surcharge on Bronx residents and smaller fees for residents of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The company, based in Park Ridge, N.J., said it was paying $15 million a year to settle suits brought by pedestrians, passengers and others injured in accidents with Hertz cars and a disproportionate number of those suits involved cars rented by people from those boroughs.
In a statement yesterday, Hertz called the news conference "little more than political posturing for publicity purposes." The company said that what it had done was "reflective of real costs we've incurred."
"It is our fundamental belief that every company has a right to price its product in accordance with the costs associated with the delivery of that product," the company said. Joseph Russo, a Hertz spokesman, said that the company had not lost much business because of the change.
But Mayor David N. Dinkins said at the news conference that the company, which is the nation's leading car rental concern, was approaching the problem the wrong way.
"If you want to discriminate on the basis of a person being a lousy driver, fine," he said. "But it is unfair to target people for reasons unrelated to driving records."
 
Move to Terminate Leases
 Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, saying she was galled by Hertz charging extra to Queens residents when most of its New York City business is at the airports, added that she had asked the Port Authority to terminate Hertz's leases at LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark airports. She had previously called on the city to stop buying Fords because Ford owns 49 percent of Hertz, and Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that the city would consider it.
While many officials have expressed outrage at the charges, Mr. Russo said yesterday that the company had not seen "a significant negative impact."
Some renters from the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens have decided to rent elsewhere, he said, but that was what the company wanted. In Manhattan, where the surcharge is $3 a day, he said, some customers "make known that they are upset with the new rate structure, but we're trying to explain the reasons why." Nearly all go ahead and rent, he said.
At Hertz's chief competitor, Avis, business was good, but Russell James, a spokesman, said that he could not attribute this to Hertz's surcharges.
The suit filed by the city and state argues that the effect of the company's surcharges "will fall disproportionately upon African-American, Latino and Asian-American residents." There is a rough correlation between the charges and the minority population of each borough. Hertz said that it found those accusations inflammatory, and that they were "offensive and totally without merit."
The suit also said that the policy "inflicts significant economic, social and moral injury upon the state and city."

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Down 0.2% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Industrial output sagged two-tenths of 1 percent in December, the third modest decline in a row, the Federal Reserve reported today.
This pushed production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities to the lowest point since June, when it appeared that the industrial sector -- about 30 percent of the overall economy -- had begun to lead the economy out of recession. 
 "It has gone from being a source of strength to being a small drag," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh.
Today's report also showed that industry operated at 79 percent of capacity last month, down from 79.3 percent in November, also the third straight month of decline.
 
 
Decline for Year
 For all of 1991, industrial production averaged 1.9 percent less than in 1990 for its first annual decline since 1982, the final year of the preceding recession. From December 1990 to December 1991 production rose by six-tenths of 1 percent.
Signs of economic weakness were also evident in a Commerce Department report today on the November trade deficit. Although the trade gap shrank to $3.57 billion, its lowest level in almost nine years, a plunge in imports spotlighted consumers' reluctance to buy and a gain in exports was largely attributed to aircraft sales, a volatile category. [Page 50.]
Despite the obvious stagnation in the industrial sector in December, many analysts found at least some grounds for encouragement in the Fed report, noting, among other things, that output would have shown no change were it not for exceptionally warm weather that sharply cut demand for electric power and natural gas.
"I'm rather encouraged," Robert G. Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said of today's figures. Output may not be rising, he added, "but it really isn't slipping" either. He said things were better than many people seemed to think.
 
'Special' Factors Cited
 This view seemed to be shared by Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, who pointed to two "special" factors as accounting for the December decline. In addition to the unseasonable weather, which chopped utility production 3 percent, Mr. Richards said the automobile industry was still suffering from excess inventories as it adjusted to the problem of chronic oversupply dating from the late 1980's.
Rejecting the notion that the economy was dipping back into recession, Mr. Richards contended that the latest figures "are consistent with a pattern of extremely slow growth," which he put at a rate of 1 percent or less for the fourth quarter.
Many others project a decline in fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which is to be reported by the Commerce Department on Jan. 29.
Output at factories edged up one-tenth of 1 percent last month after declining three-tenths of 1 percent in November. A two-tenths of 1 percent decline in durable goods was more than offset by a four-tenths of 1 percent advance for nondurables.
Durables, such as transportation equipment, furniture and other goods designed to last at least three years, account for about 48 percent of industrial production. Nondurables, such as foods and chemicals, account for 37 percent. The remaining output is accounted for by utilities and mines, each with about 7.5 percent.
Motor vehicles were assembled at an annual rate of 9.3 million last month, down from 9.5 million in November and 10 million in October. Autos, at 5.6 million, and trucks, at 3.7 million, were each about 100,000 below the November pace. Appliances and other goods for the home were also lower last month -- consumer goods over all fell four-tenths of 1 percent -- but many nondurables, including clothes, paper and chemicals, posted modest increases.
Output of business equipment, not counting cars and trucks, was virtually unchanged during the month while construction supplies climbed four-tenths of 1 percent after a five-tenths gain in November.
At 107.8 percent of its 1987 average, the Index of Industrial Production was at its lowest point since a reading of 107.3 in June. After posting four straight increases, the index peaked at 108.1 in July and has gone nowhere since. November's decline, initially reported at four-tenths of 1 percent, was cut in half today, but at the same time a downward revision showed October now one-tenth of 1 percent negative instead of unchanged.
 
Quarter Average Unchanged
 Industrial production is one of four components of the Commerce Department index designed to gauge the economy's current state. At 108, the average for the fourth quarter was essentially unchanged from the third quarter's 108.1.
Early indications are that January will see little improvement in output, said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist for Midland Montague Securities in New York. He said today's trade report from the Commerce Department showing a big drop in imports during November showed that "Americans are not buying anything, no matter where it is made."
He added that "there's really no need for industry to gear up" yet for the stepped-up demand that sooner or later will come as the economy shakes off recession.

HEADLINE: W. John Kenney Is Dead at 87; Was Marshall Plan Administrator

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
W. John Kenney, a top official in the United States Navy during World War II and in the Marshall Plan program for postwar recovery overseas, died Thursday at his home in Washington.
He was 87 years old and died of pneumonia, his family said. 
 Serving under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, Mr. Kenney rose to the post of Under Secretary of the Navy and later became the administrator of the Marshall Plan.
His Government career began in 1936 when he was appointed chief of the oil and gas unit of the Securities and Exchange Commission. After practicing law for three years in Los Angeles, he returned to Washington in 1941 as a special assistant to the Under Secretary of the Navy, a post he later assumed.
Under the Marshall Plan, President Truman named him director of the Economic Cooperation Mission to Britain. From 1950 to 1952 he became the operating chief of the entire Marshall Plan under its director, W. Averell Harriman.
Returning to corporate law, he was a partner with Sullivan, Shea & Kenney in Washington until 1970 and then with Cox, Langford & Brown firm. In 1973 it merged with Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, where he remained a partner until his retirement in 1989.
A Democrat, he was the party chairman for the District of Columbia and in 1956 worked on Mr. Harriman's Presidential candidacy.
He helped found the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and was a trustee of the George C. Marshall Foundation and a director of Riggs National Bank. He was chairman of the District of Columbia chapter of the American Red Cross and the Community Chest fund drive in Washington. He also headed the Alibi Club, a men's club whose members included President Bush and and the former Chief Justice of the United States, Warren E. Burger.
Born in Oklahoma, Mr. Kenney grew up there and in Washington, Los Angeles and Carmel, Calif. He graduated from Stanford University in 1926 and Harvard Law School in 1929 and practiced law in San Francisco until 1936.
Surviving are two daughters, Elinor K. Farquhar of Washington and Priscilla K. Streator of London; two sons, David Kenney of Washington and John Kenney of Nancy, France; 15 grandchildren, and three great grandchildren. His wife, Elinor, died last year.

HEADLINE: Another Dow High: 3,264.98, Up 15.43

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose modestly yesterday, again in busy trading, aided by the expiration of stock and index options and major market index futures. While smaller stocks showed weakness, the Dow Jones industrial average clicked off yet another record, ending at 3,264.98, up 15.43 points for the day and 65.52 for the week.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 287.4 million shares traded, but down from 336.2 million on Thursday. Gaining issues were ahead of losers by a margin of 922 to 831. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.65 point, to 418.86, while the American Stock Exchange index gained 1.55 points to end at an all-time high of 415.32. Trading in the secondary market pulled the Nasdaq composite down slightly, to 626.85, off 0.49 point, but the Russell 2,000 inched to a high of 205.06, up 0.67 point.
 
'Double Witching Hour'
 John H. Blair 3d, senior vice president and head of trading for County NatWest Securities USA, described the market as orderly, as it went through its "double witching hour."
"A large number of expiring indexes were on the buy side yesterday, causing blue chips to rise in late afternoon trading," Mr. Blair said. "But a selloff in the last few minutes moved the market lower at the close."
He liked the market's tone and volume, even though it was not as high as in the last couple of sessions, and noted that there was good rotation in stocks and some cycles, like I.B.M., which opened lower on a large fourth-quarter loss but recouped to close with a gain of 7/8 at 96 3/8.
I.B.M.'s performance was an indication that people are looking through earnings and taking comfort that things will get better, some traders said.
For a good part of the day the Dow struggled to hold on to mild gains as the broader market fell under pressure. A mixed batch of economic data and corporate earnings released early in the morning made investors unsure about the direction of the economy and of interest rates. Uncertainty generally puts a collar on buying and pressure on stocks.
Recent winners in the market, like airline and bank stocks, slipped in trading. Analysts said Apple Computer's higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings helped offset some of the anxiety generated by I.B.M.'s announcement of a $1.38 billion loss in the fourth quarter.
The mixed bag of data included a much-smaller-than-expected November trade deficit, which was a plus for stocks. But a decline in December industrial production and capacity utilization and the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index, which showed that consumer confidence faltered early this month, put downward pressure on the market.
Traders said bargain hunting in the "old" leadership stocks was apparent at one point in the session, as selling in some of the cyclical stocks eagerly sought during the week dampened buying enthusiasm somewhat.
Apple Computer was among yesterday's gainers, rising 2, to 64 3/4.
United Technologies gained 1 5/8, to 56 5/8; Du Pont was up 1 1/2, to 50 1/2; General Dynamics rose 1 3/8, to 61; Reebok added 1 1/2, to 31 1/2, and Commodore International picked up 1 1/8, to 17.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Sharply Lower On Troublesome Trade Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against other currencies yesterday, depressed by Federal Reserve intervention in the market and by disappointment in United States trade figures.
The dollar dropped in early trading after the market found evidence of a weak United States economy in the trade deficit report for November. 
 The shortfall shrank to $3.57 billion, but that was largely because imports fell as Americans curtailed their purchases. Although the report also showed a gain in export sales, that increase was mainly attributed to strong aircraft sales, a one-time phenomenon, and did not reflect a surge in the manufacturing sector of the overall economy, analysts said.
Traders sold the dollar on the belief that if the economy is weak, the Fed will be under more pressure to drop interest rates again. Since stable or higher rates make United States investments and the dollar more attractive, negative economic news is often a signal to sell on the currency markets.
Ronald H. Holzer, chief foreign exchange dealer with Harris Trust & Company in Chicago, said a decline in interest rates in the bond market also undermined the dollar.
The dollar weakened further in afternoon trading in New York after it was reported that the Fed had sold dollars for Japanese yen. The move supports the view, Mr. Holzer said, that it is in everybody's interest "to keep the yen strong at this point."
A stronger yen would help lower the United States trade deficit by making American goods cheaper in Japan and Japanese goods more expensive in America.
The dollar skidded more than 3 yen in New York, to 124.55 yen from 128.22.
Earlier, the Bank of Japan governor, Yasushi Mieno, called for a stable yen. His remarks, which occurred during the trading day in Japan, served to weaken the dollar in Tokyo. The dollar fell to 127.95 yen in Tokyo overnight from 128.43 yen, and in London it fell to 127.40 yen.
The British pound jumped more than 3 cents against the dollar, climbing to $1.7955, from $1.7627 late Thursday in New York. Earlier in London, the British pound rose to $1.7780 from $1.7615.
Against the German mark, the dollar fell to 1.5920 marks from 1.6170 in New York trading.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.4085 Swiss francs, down from 1.4355; 5.4275 French francs, down from 5.5120; 1,199.25 Italian lire, down from 1,218.00, and 1.15025 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15425.
Gold fell $2.40 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $354.00 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $354.00, off $2.30.

HEADLINE: Theodore Small, 52, an Innovator In Finding Jobs for Disadvantaged

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Theodore D. Small, a pioneer in training and placement programs that found jobs for tens of thousands of disabled people, died on Monday at his home in Brooklyn.
He was 52 years old. The cause of death apparently was heart failure, his family said. 
 Mr. Small's programs aided a wide variety of people, including the physically impaired, the homeless, unemployed war veterans and ex-convicts. "Everybody is employable at something," he once said. "The key is to find the match."
The projects he set up often entailed the cooperation of businesses, nonprofit agencies and government. One of them, Utility Plastics, hires poor youths in East New York to recycle plastic waste into traffic cones. Another, Esteem, finds jobs for women who are beaten by their husbands so that the women do not feel economically trapped in abusive relationships.
Binding Together is a copy shop and bindery at which recovering drug addicts are trained. Multitasking Systems hires people with AIDS to provide office services to other companies. Other programs enable handicapped people to work at home.
Mr. Small began working with such programs when he directed Skill Upgrading, a training program in Cleveland, from 1968 to 1972. For six years after that, he was president of the Metropolitan Cleveland Jobs Council, a business and government partnership for disadvantaged people. From 1978 to 1984 he was president of the New York City Private Industry Council, which placed 18,500 people with 3,200 companies during his tenure.
Since 1984 he had served as president of Small and Associates, the consulting firm he founded to help companies hire the disadvantaged. Among its clients were I.B.M., Marriott, Holiday Inns, U.S. Sprint and Morgan Guaranty Trust. He was chairman of the National Association of Private Industry Councils and the State Labor Department's Job Service Employers Committee for Manhattan.
Mr. Small was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from Columbia College and Yale Law School, he served three years in the Peace Corps in Liberia.
He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and two sons, Ronald and Alan, all of Brooklyn; his mother, Frances, of Columbus, N.J., and a sister, Cheryl, of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Deeper Consumer Gloom Lifts Bond Prices

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The credit markets stabilized somewhat yesterday, as buying of Treasury securities was enough to push prices of notes and bonds higher for the first time in a week.
The better tone was established in overnight trading in Asia, after results of the University of Michigan's midmonth snapshot of consumer attitudes became known. 
 At the height of the market's selloff on Thursday, there were strong rumors that the survey would show that confidence improved greatly in early January, in large part because of the Fed's decisive cuts in interest rates right before Christmas.
 
New Hopes for Rate Cuts
 The rumors were false. Indeed, based on the 15-day reading, consumer expectations were even gloomier than in December.
The report, coupled with the weak money-supply figures released on Thursday, renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve Board might cut interest rates again.
"The combination of the money numbers and the confidence survey don't give the Fed much room to stand pat," one Government bond trader said.
Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers, was one of many who had expected the Fed's move to generate a positive response among consumers.
"It is astounding to me that the Fed takes its best shot, one that puts it on the front page of every newspaper in the country, and you still can't get a pickup in confidence," he said. "It makes you wonder what you have to do to get the country back in a spending mode and feeling better."
 
 
Comments by Fed Governor
 Comments by Wayne D. Angell, a Fed governor, also tended to dampen growing fear in the credit markets that the economy was about to turn around quickly.
Mr. Angell told an audience at the Executives Club of Chicago that he expected nominal gross domestic product to expand 3 to 5 percent this year, well below the normal pace of postwar recoveries.
"A robust, roaring recovery isn't there," Mr. Angell told his audience.
In their daily market commentary, analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, said, "Mr. Angell's comments and the University of Michigan survey has given the market some much-needed perspective" about the nature of the recovery.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 10418/32, up 5/8 point, to yield 7.60 percent, compared with 7.66 percent late Thursday and 7.45 percent on Jan. 10.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes rose by 13/32, to an offered price of 10229/32, to yield 7.08 percent. The 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 9725/32, up 17/32, to yield 6.77 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 1001/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 4.98 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to slightly lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.76 percent late yesterday, down 2 basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged at a late offered rate of 3.87 percent.
The pace of new-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market slowed noticeably from the frantic pace of the last two weeks. During that time, an average of about $2 billion worth of securities were brought to market.
Activity yesterday was highlighted by a two-part, $260 million offering of securities from the Texas-New Mexico Power Company.
