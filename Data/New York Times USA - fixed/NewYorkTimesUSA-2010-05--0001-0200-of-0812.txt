HEADLINE: Sleep Tight? In These New York Hotels, There Is No Other Way

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
At a boutique hotel near the exclusive shops and hangouts of New York's meatpacking district, a bellman, polite and formal in the classic uniform of burgundy trimmed in gold, pushed open a rich wood door for a guest the other day. Beyond it was a carefully designed space with luxury touches: high-thread-count cotton sheets, large flat-screen television, bathrobe and spa sandals. 
 ''Your presidential suite,'' the bellman announced. 
 Except that this was the Jane, a restored residential hotel rising over the West Side Highway, and the ''presidential suite'' was one of its standard single rooms. Reminiscent of a high-class train cabin, it was tiny: all of 50 square feet, just big enough for a custom-made twin bed and a shelf. 
 And at $89 a night, no one was complaining. ''It's like having a virtual Manhattan apartment,'' said Peter Griesar, 41, a regular guest, noting that the rough cost of a month's stay -- $2,670 -- was not a bad deal for a West Village address. ''The price is right, the neighborhood's great, and who spends time in a hotel room in New York anyway?''
 In a city where space is at such a premium that bragging rights are measured in square feet, small is getting big. An expanding clutch of hotels like the Jane offer cramped sleeping quarters on the cheap, often with shared bathrooms and bunk beds, to budget-minded travelers seeking a dash of style along with their savings. 
 There is the Pod, which opened three years ago with 345 rooms averaging 100 square feet. The hotel, on East 51st Street, has been such a success, said Richard Born, one of the owners, who is also a partner in the Jane, that he is planning a second Pod in Manhattan. 
 The British chain Yotel, known for sleek capsules that travelers rent by the hour at European airports, is opening its first center-city hotel on West 42nd Street next year. In a nod to the American love of large, executives said, its 669 rooms will be bigger than usual, though still tight: 170 square feet rather than 108. 
 ''In the old days, the bigger the space in a hotel, the more luxury you had,'' said Simon Woodroffe, the chain's founder. ''But very, very rich people stay in reasonably small spaces on luxury yachts, and very, very rich people travel in extremely small spaces on Learjets.''
 Pocket lodgings have long been a staple in Asia and Europe. And boutique hotels in New York have been luring guests to good-looking but less-than-spacious rooms since 1984, when the Morgans hotel opened, promising affordable luxury, contemporary design and a lobby that doubled as a social destination. 
 ''Why would Cher stay on 37th and Madison in a 200-square-foot hotel room with bad plumbing?'' Mr. Born said of the hotel, which was started by the club impresarios Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell. ''Because she was Steve's friend and Steve created a cool environment.''
 But these new hotels are even smaller, almost like chic youth hostels, said Lalia Rach, dean of the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. The emphasis on style over space -- one way to make the economics work for a budget hotel in an expensive urban center, Dr. Rach said -- appeals to out-of-towners who want to feel like New Yorkers, right down to fleeing a shoebox to experience the city's culture and nightlife. 
 ''This is attractive to a very large market,'' she said, referring to travelers ages 16 to 30. ''They want to live the destination, not live the hotel.'' 
 At the same time, the theory goes, these hotels need to be destinations for the locals -- or at least to feel as if they could be -- for guests to sense that they are tapping into the real New York. So Yotel, whose futuristic rooms feature purple mood lighting and private monsoon showers, plans to turn part of its fourth floor over to a restaurant, bar and 20,000-square-foot outdoor patio.
 Room Mate Grace, on West 45th Street, originally the QT, has a swimming pool with a bar in the lobby. The Ace, on West 29th Street, attracts such an artsy throng that its lobby can resemble a nightlife mini-mall, with list-toting men guarding entrances to the hotel and the various eating and drinking spaces inside. 
 Alex Calderwood, who opened the Ace last year, said he conceived the lobby as a living room for the neighborhood where guests and New Yorkers could mingle. 
 Perhaps no place embodies that spirit more than the Jane, where guests can, by design, overhear a long-term tenant placing bets over a pay phone in the hallway, brush their teeth with others in the communal bathrooms, or drink and dine with West Village locals downstairs at Cafe Gitane or the lobby bar. The hotel, which plans to expand its hangout spaces with an outdoor patio and a rooftop bar, is designed with an artfully distressed, Old World Eastern opulence; a stuffed monkey in a fez hovers over each end of the bar.
 A lounge known as the Ballroom is temporarily closed, but in its heyday, the waiting line stretched down the block, annoying the real New Yorkers living nearby. At busy times, some people would take a room for the night just to gain entry, said Sean MacPherson, a co-owner.
 On a recent weeknight, the lobby bar played host to a small crowd of mostly New Yorkers as Laurence Passera, a photographer from London who declined to give his age, took advantage of the lull. A regular guest, he said he loved the single berths. 
 ''I even had a girl up there,'' Mr. Passera said. ''Fantastic.'' 
 Uptown, the Pod has created a world of its own. Decorated with a cheerful minimalism -- think Ikea meets Devo -- the emphasis is on D.I.Y.: there is no restaurant or bar, but guests can bring in their own refreshments and congregate in the lobby, patio or rooftop garden.
 They can also use the hotel's free WiFi and blog to connect for shared rides from the airport and drinks, meals and shopping in town. (''My friend and I are coming over to NYC from Brazil on April 10th and we'll be there for a whole week,'' read a recent message from Two Brazilian Dudes in the Big Apple.) 
 The entry-level rooms include stainless steel sinks and lights over the door, like those on an airplane, indicating when the bathrooms down the hall are free. The hotel attracts a mix of tourists, many from Europe, ranging from high school groups to middle-age couples on shopping vacations.
 One sunny morning, Harald Widemann, 52, and his son, Dennis, 22, of Hamburg, Germany, were on the roof, taking in the sweeping view. They are both 6-foot-4 but had no complaints about their pint-size room with twin bunk beds, even after their stay was extended for a few days by the Icelandic volcano ash. 
 ''I wanted to have a decent hotel with at least a minimum of comfort but not with too much space,'' the elder Mr. Widemann said. ''I don't need 20 or 30 or 40 square meters'' -- the equivalent of 215 to 430 square feet -- ''when I'm using the room only for sleeping.''
 Still, he said, when he visits with his wife, he will have to stay at the Hudson, near Columbus Circle where rooms start at a knee-skinning 136 square feet. ''I need a bigger room for her luggage,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Arizona Law and Its Discontents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Why Arizona Drew a Line,'' by Kris W. Kobach (Op-Ed, April 29), defending the Arizona immigration law:
 While it is true that federal law requires noncitizens to carry immigration documents, this is almost never enforced or prosecuted. What's more, it's a far different story to permit federal officials to punish a noncitizen for failure to carry immigration documents and for state and local officials to do the same. Immigration regulation is a federal function.
 I find it disingenuous to cite a hypothetical of 12 nervous, shifty-eyed passengers crammed into a minivan being stopped by the police for speeding as being the typical case in which the Arizona police will inquire into a person's immigration status. 
 What about the case of two young males wearing sombreros speaking in Spanish in front of a convenience store, or three poorly dressed Spanish-speaking women sitting together at a cafe? Are we really to believe that Arizona's police officers are not going to make inquiries in those situations?
 This law isn't good immigration enforcement; it's an invitation to flagrant abuse of the civil rights of anyone caught in its web, including American citizens, permanent residents and applicants for asylum or another lawful status.
 Theodore Ruthizer New York, April 29, 2010
 The writer, a lawyer who works on business immigration matters and a lecturer at Columbia Law School, is a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
 To the Editor:
 The reason the American Civil Liberties Union is calling the Arizona law unconstitutional (as Kris W. Kobach points out) is that it's true. It's also discriminatory, unfair and un-American.
 It is hard to imagine how this law can be enforced without racial profiling, and claims to the contrary are disingenuous. On what other basis would a police officer suspect that someone is not lawfully present in the United States?
 Hollow language inserted in the bill supposedly to prevent such profiling is cosmetic. It won't prevent the police from asking people for their papers based on race and the way they look.
 Racial profiling is already rampant in Arizona, and this law will make it worse. We have seen the effects of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office's targeting of Latinos, including American citizens and lawful permanent residents, in its mass sweeps and enforcement operations. The A.C.L.U. has sued that office, and the United States Justice Department has started a civil rights investigation into its practices.
 This extreme law puts Arizona completely out of step with American values of fairness and equality. The A.C.L.U. will vigorously challenge this law in the courtroom and elsewhere to make sure that it doesn't take effect.
 This law says show us your papers. In response, we'll show the State of Arizona the Constitution.
 Anthony D. Romero Executive Director, A.C.L.U. New York, April 29, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In defense of the Arizona immigration law that he helped draft, Kris W. Kobach writes that ''the Arizona law hardly creates a police state,'' noting that ''other nations have similar documentation requirements.'' The fact that other countries have used internal identity papers for the most reprehensible reasons hardly justifies our adoption of similar restrictions.
 Why is it that the far right is eager to look to the worst practices of other countries to defend restrictions on our civil liberties, but objects when comparisons are made about other countries' best practices, like health care and the abolition of the death penalty?
 Jay N. Feldman Port Washington, N.Y., April 29, 2010
 The writer is a lawyer.
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Arizona's New Immigration Law Widens the Chasm Between Sides'' (news article, April 26):
 I sympathize with those Mexicans and other immigrants who live in Arizona legally and also with those seeking a better life. I would point out, however, that it has always been the law that legal resident aliens carry their ''green cards'' with them at all times.
 As a naturalized citizen who waited five years to obtain a green card and then another four years to become a citizen (with all the expense and paperwork involved), I see no reason to condone illegal immigration.
 If we, as American citizens, illegally entered Australia, Canada, Britain or any other country, we could hardly object to being asked for our papers, nor be surprised to be deported forthwith if we didn't have them. Has everyone lost sight of the meaning of the word ''illegal''?
 If profiling occurs, then certainly we should revisit the law. In the meantime, let's withhold indignation and wait and see how the law is administered.
 Elizabeth Skelton San Diego, April 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 It's a shame that Gov. Jan Brewer didn't consider the downside to S.B. 1070, Arizona's new immigration law: It amounts to state-sanctioned racial profiling, usurps federal authority and feeds into a volatile dialogue on immigration in Arizona, which correlates with a rise in hate crimes. It does nothing to fix our immigration system, but will cause hardship, compromise public safety and hurt the economy, as has happened elsewhere as a result of anti-immigrant policies.
 At the least, she might have considered that Arizona has more than two million Hispanic and Asian residents -- about a third of the state's population -- a million of whom are registered to vote, and they (and others, too, both immigrant and native-born) are fighting mad that she has dragged Arizona through the mud with this law.
 In 2008, the popular mayor of Hazleton, Pa., who had raised his profile by enacting anti-immigrant provisions (his ticket to national office, he thought), lost his race for Congress, in part because the immigrants he had so maligned were motivated to vote. Perhaps that is a lesson Governor Brewer will come to learn.

HEADLINE: Consumers Give Boost To Economy

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The United States economy has expanded for three quarters in a row, the Commerce Department said on Friday, helped along by consumer spending. Now the question is, Will the jobs follow?
 The broadest measure of the overall economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the Commerce Department reported. It had expanded 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2.2 percent in the third quarter. 
 While the expansion is welcome, it has not delivered the level of hiring needed to recover the ground lost during the recession.
 Speaking in the Rose Garden on Friday, President Obama acknowledged that many Americans might find little comfort in the numbers because '' 'you're hired' is the only economic news they're waiting to hear.'' 
 Still, economists are hopeful that news of solid, continued growth may bolster business confidence and persuade more companies to expand. 
 ''It's been a case of, when will they stop worrying and learn to love the boom?'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG, who added that many analysts and companies had underestimated the economic turnaround. 
 After dragging their heels for many months, consumers were at last a major contributor to economic growth in the first quarter. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, a big gain from the 1.6 percent rate of the previous three months. Purchases of durable goods like cars led the way.
 Whether Americans might retrench for the long haul after seeing their homes lose value has been one of the biggest questions about the aftermath of the Great Recession. Consumer spending makes up more than 70 percent of the economy, and it usually drives growth during economic recoveries. 
 Economists are hopeful that families will continue to pick up the pace of purchasing and make the recovery more sustainable, although consumers may remain cautious about spending given the tepid growth in job creation and personal income. Consumer sentiment dipped slightly in April, according to a Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index released on Friday.
 ''We haven't had consumer spending growth this strong in three years,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''But the caveat is that with real disposable incomes not growing, this was all done through the saving rate. We cannot rely on consumers continually driving down their savings. They need income support from hiring.''
 Small businesses say Americans are loosening up a little after a bewildering period of debt reduction and uncertainty.
 Nate Evans, who owns a pottery-making business with his wife, Hallie, in New Albin, Iowa, said sales in 2009 were the worst ever but that business was just starting to pick up. The Evanses sell their wares from their Allamakee Wood-Fired Pottery home studio as well as in galleries in nearby states, and at craft shows in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois.
 ''I felt like the energy of the crowd was better,'' Mr. Evans said of the first fair this year, in Minnesota, adding that other craft sellers seemed to agree. ''Most of the people we talked to said it was better than last year. Hey, it's not great, but it's better than last year.''
 Just as Americans stepped up their purchases of autos and other products in the first quarter, companies invested more in capital goods. Business purchases of equipment and software, for example, grew at an annual rate of 13.4 percent, building on a 19 percent increase in the final quarter of 2009.
 For the first time in two years, businesses started increasing their stockpiles of goods. This inventory growth accounted for about half of the expansion in the first quarter. In the previous quarter, about two-thirds of economic growth resulted from a decision by companies to draw down their inventories more slowly -- that is, not clearing their stockroom shelves so quickly but still not adding to them.
 Additional spending by companies ''is very good news, since it indicates businesses are feeling more confident about the expansion to start spending some of their cash,'' Mr. Gault said. ''If businesses are spending more on equipment, usually that would go along with more hiring, too.''
 Federal government spending, including some remaining money from stimulus programs, grew at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter. But this was more than offset by continued cuts by state and local governments, whose spending decreased 3.8 percent. It was the third consecutive quarterly decline for state and local spending. 
 ''Government spending contracted, for all the ballyhoo about stimulus,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''This recovery is going to have to stand on the backs of private-sector demand, not on government demand, given all the current fiscal challenges.'' 
 Modest expansion in business activity may not be enough to ease the lasting pain of the recession, many economists say.
 Hiring only recently began to materialize, with the economy adding 162,000 jobs in March, of which 48,000 were temporary Census-related positions. The economy had shed about eight million jobs since the recession began in December 2007.
 Job growth hasn't been as strong as economic growth for several reasons, economists say. Businesses have found ways to make more with fewer resources, meaning that they have been able to meet additional demand for their products without bringing on many new workers. And companies are sitting on a tremendous amount of cash and appear unwilling to spend it.
 ''Companies may be reluctant to invest because there's an enormous amount of uncertainty ahead for them, not just in health care policy but tax policy,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. ''This isn't just about the sustainability of the recovery itself.''
 Mr. Obama, in his remarks on Friday morning, rejected criticisms that his policies were bad for hiring by talking about tax cuts for small businesses, loans backed by the government and investments in areas like clean energy -- policies intended in part to encourage job creation.
 Even if hiring does finally start to grow at the same rate with demand, the economy is simply not growing fast enough to make a big dent in unemployment, economists say. 
 The nation's gross domestic product -- a broad measure of goods and services produced in the country -- is far below its potential, according to projections of where the economy would have been had it followed its long-term trend. 
 Output would need to grow at least 5 percent annually for several years to get back on track -- and perhaps what is more important, to stimulate enough job creation to employ the 15 million Americans already out of work and the 100,000 new workers joining the labor force each month.
 Right now, many economists expect the nation's output to expand 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year. 
 ''Unless the pace of growth picks up significantly, we will see high unemployment rates for years to come,'' said Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington.

HEADLINE: To Protect Consumers, Who Will Be Regulated?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An unlikely new tenant in the halls of the Federal Reserve would set out sweeping rules on a wide swath of consumer transactions, possibly making it one of the most powerful new federal agencies in a generation.
 The proposed agency is causing concern and confusion, however, among owners of small businesses -- drug stores, jewelers, pawnbrokers and car dealers -- who fear that by allowing any customers to buy on credit, their businesses could be subject to significant new regulations. 
 While most of the headlines about the Senate's consideration of a financial regulation bill have concerned financial giants like Goldman Sachs and complex investments like synthetic collateralized debt obligations, the proposed Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is a major part of the legislation, is likely to be an intense battleground in coming weeks. 
 Much of the bewilderment -- and therefore the argument -- stems from the imprecise nature of some of the proposed rules. The new agency would regulate financing provided by most car dealers, for example, but not by rent-to-own furniture vendors, according to the bill's advocates. Department stores with private-label credit cards would be covered; stores that let their customers pay in installments, without interest, would not, they say.
 A review of the consumer protection provisions, which account for 335 pages of the 1,565-page bill, shows that the intent of the legislation is not to cover Main Street businesses. But the ambiguity of some terms -- like the word ''significantly'' -- leaves the regulations open to a broad interpretation. 
 Senate Democrats and Obama administration officials say nearly all nonfinancial businesses would be exempt from the new bureau's regulations, which would focus narrowly on consumer finance businesses.
 ''There are a large number of different types of companies across the country involved in the finance business, consumer finance business, that took advantage of the current system and left people with financial obligations they did not understand, could not afford, were not appropriate for them, and the damage of that was catastrophic,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said at a Senate hearing on Thursday.
 But Republicans and business groups have countered that the new agency's approach is scattershot rather than focused, and would stifle the ability of small Main Street businesses to offer credit to strapped customers.
 Rich Gallo, the owner of Office Outlet, an office products company in Indiana, Pa., said he regularly devised payment plans for his customers, and was concerned that the consumer agency would impose a new layer of regulation. Told that the bill's advocates say his business would probably not be covered by the bureau, Mr. Gallo remained skeptical. ''I just think that is the way our government seems to be going right now, to more regulation,'' he said.
 The bill also would cast a broad net, opponents say, over companies that had little to do with the housing crisis and subsequent recession -- a group known as nonbank financial companies, which includes such longtime Democratic targets as payday lenders, which make short-term loans at high interest rates. 
 ''There is growing concern that in an effort to hold Wall Street accountable, this bill could catch the little guys up in the same net as the big banks,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said earlier this week after the Senate agreed to begin debate on the bill, formally known as the Restoring American Financial Stability Act. 
 With its ''ambiguous language,'' Mr. McConnell added, ''there is real concern that this bill could penalize anyone in this country who buys or sells something on an installment plan,'' potentially subjecting any merchant that offers credit that is subject to a finance charge or extends over more than four installments to the authority of the consumer bureau.
 The crux of the debate would appear to rest on the definition of ''significantly.'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the primary sponsor of the bill, points to a section that says the new bureau cannot regulate ''a merchant, retailer or seller of nonfinancial goods or services that is not engaged significantly in offering or providing consumer financial products or services.'' 
 That might seem to rule out auto dealers, which, after all, are principally engaged in selling cars and trucks. But roughly four out of every five car loans are generated by the dealers themselves, according to the Cambridge Winter Center for Financial Institutions Policy, a Washington research group that says it believes dealers should be covered by the agency. The dealers set the interest rate, and the loan fees that they earn are a big contributor to their profits.
 That, Democrats say, makes most auto dealers enough of a financial company to fall under the new bureau.
 Some small-business owners support the creation of the consumer agency, saying they are not threatened. ''There is nothing onerous in these regulations,'' said Lewis Prince, the owner of Vintage Vinyl, a St. Louis music retailer who participated in a news conference Wednesday sponsored by senators who support much of the Dodd bill. Consumer protection ''can only help small business by providing the kind of stable financial environment in which small businesses can thrive,'' Mr. Prince said.
 Even as businesses say the bill might be too far-reaching, some consumer advocates fear that the bureau will be able only to write rules, not enforce them. The bill would give the bureau enforcement powers over ''larger participants'' in nonbank or nonmortgage lines of business, like payday lending. How to define ''larger'' is left up to regulators.
 Both sides seem to agree that the consumer agency has an ample amount of independence -- and maybe too much for some lawmakers. The bill states that the agency can demand that companies furnish information about ''the organization, business conduct, markets and activities of persons operating in the consumer financial services markets.''
 The bill would require the Federal Reserve to turn over 10 percent of its operating budget each year to finance the agency. That would leave the new bureau with a budget of nearly $500 million -- 75 percent larger than the budget of the Federal Trade Commission, another agency that currently has consumer protection responsibilities.
 Whatever the new agency's powers, businesses and their advocates in the Senate are more concerned over who will be regulated. ''No one can deny that the language of the bill is ambiguous, that it lends itself to broad interpretation, so let's tighten it up,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''The authors of this bill may believe some of these concerns are misplaced. But they are going to have to prove it.''

HEADLINE: Some Lessons From the Oil Spill in the Gulf

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig (front page, April 30) is a stark reminder that drilling for oil too close to Florida's coastline imperils Florida's economy, environment and security. This disastrous event should alter the Obama administration's plan to bring oil rigs closer to Florida's coastline. The current 235-mile buffer off the west coast of Florida, carried out under the bipartisan Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, should be maintained. 
 Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said there are some places in our country that are too special to drill. Florida's coastline fits that description. Florida's west coast is home to many beautiful beaches and is an economic engine not just for our state but for our country.
 Over many decades, Florida developed thriving tourism and fishing economies rather than industrialize the coastline. Florida's long-term economic health is dependent on clean beaches and clean oceans.
 Kathy Castor Member of Congress, 11th Dist., Fla. Tampa, Fla., April 30, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As a veteran of the Exxon Valdez disaster, I find that the unfolding oil spill in Louisiana touches deep nerves.
 The oil industry is increasingly creative at remote, offshore drilling, but has made little progress in recovering oil once it gets in the water. Oil spill response plans trot out the same, tired promises to mechanically remove oil. But in practice, response quickly devolves to chemical dispersants and fire, whereby little oil is actually recovered. Less than 5 percent of the Exxon Valdez spill was actually removed.
 Louisiana's spill gives pause to decisions to expand drilling in Alaska's Arctic, our harshest offshore waters. This summer's planned exploratory drilling would be subject to the region's extreme weather and sea ice; drill sites hundreds of miles distant from spill response vessels; and extremely limited response capacity.
 A timeout on offshore Arctic drilling is warranted until a more realistic view of spill response is addressed.

 To the Editor:
 States affected by the oil spill include several of those enraged by federal interference in their affairs. Why have none rejected federal help, in line with their principles?

HEADLINE: Fishermen May Be Cleaning the Spill That Put Them Out of Work

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
VENICE, La. -- About 1,000 angry and frustrated fishermen packed an elementary school gymnasium here Friday afternoon. In a cruel occupational twist, they were seeking employment with the company they blame for an oil spill that may wipe out their industry this year and beyond.
 Life in this coastal community centers on seafood -- mullet, shark, shrimp and oysters. From May to December, dozens of boats haul shrimp here from the Gulf of Mexico. But aside from two days of fishing allowed this week ahead of the approaching oil slick, the shrimp season has been suspended. 
 So the fishermen came to receive training in how to clean up the oil spill that was creeping up on the nearby coastline. They were hoping to be hired by BP, the company blamed for the spill and responsible for cleanup efforts.
 ''Either the seafood industry or the oil industry -- that's the only jobs down here, so I guess I'm trying to move from seafood to oil today,'' said Bernel Prout, 55, a fisherman and Venice native.
 Friday's training session was led by local firefighters and law enforcement officials and attended by representatives from BP, the parish government and the local fishermen's association.
 BP has said it will hire as many local residents as possible to clean the beaches and distribute booms through the surrounding marshes and waterways.
 But the fishermen said they were reeling from the loss of revenue. They were not told how many would be hired, at what wages, or when. But they were asked to fill out forms listing their names, contact information and available equipment and skills.
 ''This is not our fault,'' Mr. Prout said. ''It's the fault of the oil company.''
 The mood inside the crowded, hot gymnasium was one of confusion and growing anxiety. 
 ''We have bills to pay,'' said Acy Cooper, the president of a local fishermen's association. ''I don't care if it's the federal government or BP, but someone needs to step up and compensate us.''
 David Kinnaird, a project director for BP who is coordinating the company's response in Venice, said BP would hire as many local workers as possible. ''We're not asking the community to do this work for nothing,'' he said. ''BP is willing to compensate them.''
 But Mr. Kinnaird could not say when local fishermen would be hired, how much they would be paid or whether they would be compensated for their lost revenue.
 The fishing industry is just now recovering from the hurricanes of recent years, said Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish, where Venice is located. But he said the oil spill could be an even greater setback, potentially changing fishing conditions for years.
 ''This could be six Katrinas, where for years and years and years there's not as much work,'' he said. ''These people have fished their entire lives. They don't know anything else.''
 Still, he said, his job requires balancing the area's two dominant local industries. He urged federal officials to not let this disaster lead to less oil excavation in the Gulf of Mexico.
 ''Don't overreact,'' he said. ''We don't ground every plane every time one plane crashes.''
 All skiffs were docked in their harbors Friday. A local seafood company, Sharkco, was selling its final 50 pounds of shrimp and had already been depleted of oysters and fish.
 ''Last shrimp for a long, long time,'' yelled Kim Vo, the owner of Sharkco, to passing fishermen, who paid $3 a pound.
 ''This is for us to eat,'' one fisherman said. ''We can't use it for bait. There's not going to be any fishing around here for months.''
 ''First Katrina, then Ike, Gustav, the fishermen's strike -- and now this,'' said Thi Lee, 35, whose husband lost his skiff in Katrina and only recently restored a second skiff to working condition after it was battered by another hurricane. 
 ''We have no idea what to do,'' she said.
 A group of fishermen who were gathered around a car in the Sharkco parking lot grew more agitated as they listened to radio reports about the worsening spill.
 ''This spill isn't going to be fixed in a day, probably even in a year,'' said Chuc Nguyen, 35, who emigrated from Vietnam as a child and has fished his entire life. ''What else can I do? I don't know how to read and write. If you tell me to do something other than fishing, I don't even know what it would be.''
 Chan Tran, a dock owner in Venice, said insurance had risen more than 200 percent since Hurricane Katrina. Insuring her fishing dock now costs $50,000 a year, and she planned on paying the bill due this summer with money from the sale of shrimp.
 ''I cannot sleep for two days,'' she said. ''I'm done for business.''

HEADLINE: Designer Has Fan at Top, But Too Few at the Stores

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Fashion and politics are seasonal and unpredictable, yet the two came together quite well here for the hometown designer Maria Pinto and Michelle Obama, whose first memorable bursts onto the national scene were often in Pinto creations.
 Remember the purple sheath Mrs. Obama wore the night of the fist bump heard round the world? The teal number at the Democratic National Convention? Or the red dress she wore to meet the Bushes on their way out of the White House? Maria Pinto all, designed right here where both women were born and raised and, over the course of one remarkable election, became stars. 
 So when Ms. Pinto abruptly put up a ''closeout sale'' sign in the window of her West Loop boutique and announced that she was folding her fashion business, Chicago -- and Pinto devotees all over -- reacted with disbelief: What in sartorial heaven happened? ''I pushed as far as I could,'' Ms. Pinto, 53, said in her first lengthy interview since the demise of her store and wholesale operations in mid-February. 
 Just back from a month's break in Barcelona, she pointed to the strain that a sour economy had placed on her business just as it was expanding and gaining major traction beyond a loyal Chicago following. 
 But Ms. Pinto acknowledged having made some typical startup mistakes in building her brand, in areas like financial management and operations.
 After 16 years of designing out of a somewhat anonymous atelier, she opened the boutique, named after herself, in August 2008, capitalizing on a wave of enthusiasm for her work, as displayed mostly by Mrs. Obama on the campaign trail. She also increased her wholesale operations and had been maintaining a showroom in New York.
 While Mrs. Obama diversified her style after becoming first lady (she has been drawn to high-end designers like Jason Wu and Narciso Rodriguez, as well as brands like J. Crew), she still sported Maria Pinto every now and then. But even high-profile support of the brand, priced in the hundreds and thousands of dollars, could not save it from the reality of the Great Recession. 
 The real problems started right after the introduction of the spring 2010 line in New York last September, Ms. Pinto said. ''They loved the line,'' she said. ''I was like, where are the orders? O.K., this is not a good sign.''
 Pinto was carried at stores like Barneys, Saks Fifth Avenue and Takashimaya -- a store whose New York location will soon be closing its doors, another victim of the recession.
 ''She's such a highly regarded talent,'' said Anne Brouwer of McMillan Doolittle, a Chicago firm that specializes in retail analysis. ''It was certainly a really difficult time to open.''
 Still, fashion watchers said her style helped define a moment. ''As a fan of the first lady's, I was discovering Michelle Obama's style influence, and Maria Pinto was part of that story from the very beginning,'' said Mary Tomer, creator of Mrs-O.org, a blog devoted to Mrs. Obama's clothes.
 But Mrs. Obama chose from the conservative end of Ms. Pinto's collections, which also included pieces like leather jeans, dresses of sassy feathers and kangaroo jackets. There is so much more the designer wishes she could have been known for. 
 ''Yes, it was heartbreaking and very sad,'' Ms. Pinto said of the last few months. ''The good news is that my creativity goes with me anywhere I go.''
 For now, it will go into yoga, gardening, painting -- and a lot of soul-searching.

HEADLINE: Tighter Rules for Helicopter Sightseeing

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from community groups upset by the noise of whirring rotors, city officials have banned most types of helicopter sightseeing flights leaving from Manhattan.
 The new rules, which went into effect this week, prohibit tourist flights from swooping over Central Park, the Empire State Building and all of Brooklyn. They are restricted to flying over water, with one exception: tours that hover over Yankee Stadium in the Bronx are still allowed, said David Lombino, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation.
 The agreement between officials of the development corporation and the helicopter operators eliminates the short tours that were the most profitable offerings. Those quick spins, which lasted four to eight minutes and cost as much as $130 per passenger, accounted for nearly one-fifth of the sightseeing traffic at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. 
 The downtown heliport, at the edge of the financial district in the East River, is one of three commercial heliports in Manhattan, but the only one that serves sightseers. On April 1, the heliport at the west end of 30th Street stopped accepting tourist flights as part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by community advocates who had complained about noise and odors filling the Hudson River Park.
 Similar complaints had flooded the city's 311 phone line from residents of Lower Manhattan and neighborhoods along the Brooklyn waterfront after most of the tourist traffic shifted to the downtown heliport. That heliport is owned by the city and operated by Saker Aviation Services, a financially troubled company whose board of directors includes Alvin Trenk, whose family has operated the West 30th Street Heliport for many years.
 From now on, excursions taking off from downtown must head south toward the harbor, keeping as far as they can from the new Brooklyn Bridge Park across the river, then up the Hudson to 79th Street or on to the stadium, before turning south back down the river.
 ''Our goal was to keep them over water as much as possible,'' Mr. Lombino said of the sightseeing flights. ''We needed to make a concession for them to be able to fly over part of Manhattan to do their Yankee Stadium tour.''
 Mr. Lombino said the development corporation officials sought to balance the demand for restrictions on the flights with the city's desire to keep the business, which he said employs more than 300 people and takes in about $45 million a year.
 The city also will start fielding the noise complaints to 311, instead of forwarding them on to the development corporation. The 311 receptionists will catalog the data and time of the complaints and request descriptions of the offending helicopters to help determine whether the new rules are being violated, Mr. Lombino said.
 Elected officials welcomed the agreement as a way to quell the uproar over the helicopters' emissions. ''These regulations are a good initial step to mitigating the shake, rattle and rumble of excessive helicopter traffic over Brooklyn,'' said Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president.
 They were less popular with tour operators.
 ''Is it exactly what we want? Of course not,'' said Jeff Smith, a pilot who is chairman of the Eastern Region Helicopter Council, which represents the operators.
 But Mr. Smith, who described the short tours that have been banned as ''our absolute biggest money makers,'' said the operators had been making concessions for decades. ''If you look at our record, we have a 30-year history of doing things just like this,'' he said.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Recession Ebbs, Many Still See Gloom

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THROUGH recession after recession over the last four decades, Americans remained more optimistic than pessimistic about their own futures, even when they grew very worried about the overall economy.
 But that ended during the 2007-9 downturn. More people thought their own financial situation was going to get worse than thought it would improve. 
 The Conference Board has been asking consumers the same questions since 1967 as it compiles its consumer confidence index. Three of the questions deal with forecasts of what will change over the next six months, but they differ in perspective.
 One asks whether the person expects business conditions to improve, stay the same or worsen. Another asks whether the person thinks employment with grow, stay about the same or shrink.
 Both of those questions seek an assessment of the overall economy, and at the bottom of recessions there has usually been a lot of gloom. 
 The recent recession was, as seen by those questions, similar to other deep recessions in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s.
 The third question, which is shown on the accompanying chart, is fundamentally different. It does not ask how the economy will do. It asks how the specific person expects to fare. In six months, does the respondent expect his or her own family's income to be higher, lower or about the same?
 Until this downturn, the number of people expecting things to get better for themselves had always exceeded the number expecting lower incomes. But at the low point in this cycle, in February and March of last year when the financial system seemed most vulnerable, fewer than 8 percent of respondents expected their income to get better, while almost a quarter thought their incomes were set to decline.
 The chart shows the difference between those two groups, ignoring the percentage, always large, that expects things to stay about the same.
 The pessimism shown by those responses has declined since then, but not gone away. In April, the Conference Board reported this week, about one person in 10 expected his or her family's income to improve, while about one in six expected family income to go down.
 As can be seen from the chart, good times in recent years have produced less net optimism than in previous cycles, while bad times have brought more pessimism.
 On its face, such a result would seem to indicate Americans are losing their optimism, but it may not be as simple as that. In this cycle, unlike earlier ones, many workers were forced to take pay cuts, at least on a temporary basis. So it became reasonable to expect lower income, even for some who did not expect to lose their jobs.
 Still, the decline in expectations regarding their own incomes is another indication of how much this recession scared people -- and that some of the fright remains.

HEADLINE: Barclays Posts 29% Higher Profit as Bad Loans Subside

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Barclays reported on Friday that its profit rose 29 percent in the first quarter, helped by its investment banking business and fewer bad loans.
 But some investors were disappointed at the pace of growth at the securities unit, the biggest contributor to Barclays' earnings, and shares dropped 4.4 percent in London on Friday morning. 
 ''Concerns regarding a slowing in the pace of improvement for the group's investment banking operations have hit the shares,'' Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said. The earnings announcement on Friday ''appears to be reminding investors that the road ahead will be bumpy.''
 Profit rose to $:1.07 billion, or $1.65 billion, from $:826 million in the first three months of last year. Barclays Capital, the securities unit, reported that pretax profit rose 62 percent to $:1.47 billion, making it the most profitable business for Barclays.
 But the investment banking earnings followed strong results from rivals like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase last month. Barclays Capital, run by Barclays' president, Robert E. Diamond, received ''lower contributions from rates and commodities,'' which was offset by its credit businesses and emerging markets, the bank said.
 Impairment charges and money the bank set aside for loan defaults declined to $:1.51 billion from $:2.31 billion in the same period last year and from $:1.86 billion in the last the months of 2009.
 ''The improvement that we have seen in impairment reflects the signs of economic recovery now evident in many of the markets in which we operate,'' John Varley, the chief executive, said in a statement.
 Barclays invested in expanding its investment bank in Europe and Asia by hiring staff members after buying Lehman Brothers' operations in the United States. 
 Chris Lucas, the chief financial officer, said on Friday that the bank set aside the same ratio of revenue for bonus payments as last year, but added that the exact level remuneration would only be decided toward the end of this year.
 The bank also said that its exposure to the Greek economic crisis was ''small'' and it did not expect the country's economic turmoil to pose ''a government bond risk'' for the bank.
 Barclays increased its risk-weighted assets by 8 percent to $:415 billion.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Finishes April With a Thud

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Wall Street ended the month on a down note Friday as shares struggled from the open.
 Fueling Friday's decline were the uncertainties surrounding the Greek debt crisis and downgrades of the investment bank Goldman Sachs. The bank's stock dropped 9.4 percent, to $145.20, a day after reports that the United States attorney's office in Manhattan had started a criminal investigation into the bank's trading. That sent other bank shares lower.
 ''The matters now facing Goldman perhaps would make investors approach banks with greater caution than otherwise,'' John Lanski, Moody's Capital Markets' chief economist, said. But, he added, it is hard to ''argue convincingly of a possible contagion effect'' of any new charges. 
 ''But I think the problem with banks' stocks of late is more related to where financial reform is leading as opposed to the difficulties or the matter pertaining to Goldman Sachs,'' Mr. Lanski said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average settled at 11,008.61, down 158.71, or 1.4 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was at 1,186.68, down 20.10, or 1.7 percent, and the Nasdaq was at 2,461.19, down 50.73, or 2 percent. 
 For the week, the Dow declined 1.7 percent, the S.& P. fell 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7 percent. Still, indexes finished the month higher. The Dow and the S.& P. both rose about 1.4 percent for the month. 
 The major European markets also fell. The FTSE 100 in London dropped 1.2 percent, the DAX index in Frankfurt declined 0.2 percent, and the CAC-40 in Paris fell 0.6 percent.
 ''We have gone through episodes recently where the market thought that a resolution was close at hand,'' Mr. Lanski said, referring to the Greek debt crisis. ''There are definitely lingering concerns about another intensification of the Greek government debt crisis.'' 
 Greek officials said the government had agreed to austerity measures totaling 24 billion euros (about $32 billion) that would include cutting some workers' pay and some public sector jobs as well as opening up parts of the economy. Details could be announced on Sunday.
 While the stream of earnings and economic indicators this week have suggested some improvement in the economy, the latest indicator fell just shy of expectations. The government said the overall economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter, but the expansion has still not brought jobs growth to levels compensating for recession losses. 
 ''The equity market received no support from an as-expected first-quarter reading of G.D.P.,'' Mr. Lanski said. But, ''I would not blame the sell-off on a somewhat disappointing G.D.P. report.'' 
 ''I think it is more because of worries over the European sovereign debt, he said, ''as well as the unknown final fate of financial reform legislation,'' which the Senate began debating on Thursday.
 ''That type of uncertainty is going to weigh more heavily on banks, and that seems to be the case today,'' Mr. Lanski said.
 Terry Morris, the senior vice president and senior equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust, said that the market had probably already factored in the G.D.P. report.
 ''I think it was already built in, so that it was somewhat of a nonevent,'' he said. ''It is going to take more to make this market keep going higher.'' 
 Among other bank stocks, Morgan Stanley dropped 3.5 percent, JPMorgan Chase fell 3.2 percent and Citigroup 4.1 percent.
 The insurer Genworth Financial closed down 8.7 percent at $16.52, after posting a quarterly profit that fell short of estimates.
 Industrial and heavily traded information technology stocks were also lower. The chip maker Intel ended down 2.8 percent at $22.84. The utilities sector posted the most gains. The FPL Group was up 2.7 percent at $52.05, and NRG Energy was up 1.6 percent at $24.17.
 Bond prices rose on the day. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.65 percent, from 3.73 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Shadow of Hurricane Katrina Hangs Over Obama After Spill

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There's a world of difference between the impact of an oil spill and a deadly hurricane. And the White House hopes it stays that way.
 As President Obama stepped up his administration's response to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, ordering a moratorium on new offshore drilling leases and dispatching cabinet secretaries and cargo planes to the region, the White House is also trying to avert the kind of political damage inflicted on former President George W. Bush by his administration's slow response to Hurricane Katrina.
 In contrast with his treatment of the Massey Energy Company, which operates the West Virginia mine where 29 miners recently died in an explosion, Mr. Obama has not directed any tough rhetoric in public against BP, the British oil giant that was leasing the oil rig that exploded 11 days ago. Nor has he struck any tones of outrage on behalf of Gulf Coast residents and businesses affected by the spill. 
 But administration officials said privately that there was increased frustration with BP's response, and the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, pointedly refused to say whether the White House had confidence in the company's handling of the spill. 
 Mr. Obama, for his part, vowed, for the second time in two days, that his administration would respond aggressively to the oil spill. He maintained that he continued to ''believe that domestic oil production is an important part of our overall strategy for energy security,'' addressing concerns about whether the administration would stick with its plan to increase drilling in the gulf. 
 But administration officials left open the possibility that they might reconsider the decision to expand offshore drilling if conditions in the gulf worsened. Mr. Gibbs said there would be ''an extensive environmental review before deciding'' on issuing new drilling leases.
 The fact that Mr. Obama has no plans to visit the Gulf Coast in the next few days has already raised the eyebrows of some administration critics, in particular as it relates to the president's plans this weekend. He is scheduled to attend the high-wattage, celebrity-studded White House Correspondents Dinner on Saturday night, which CNN has been promising, in hourly promos, that it will broadcast live starting at 7 p.m. with dispatches from the red carpet. 
 For Mr. Obama, the potential political fallout ''is going to be aggravated by the fact that the president traditionally gives a humorous speech,'' said Martha Kumar, a political science professor at Towson University. ''There you are in Washington with celebrities and the media while wildlife and fishermen are doused in oil? That's not going to do much for the White House or for the press, for that matter.''
 White House officials said the president's weekend plans remained on track. He will fly to Michigan on Saturday morning to speak at the commencement of the University of Michigan, and will then return to Washington for the dinner. Aides add that Mr. Obama could use his remarks at the dinner to highlight the plight of gulf residents, fishermen and wildlife. 
 ''I think that given the serious nature of the problems that we face as a country, you could say that about any event on any day,'' Mr. Gibbs said in an interview, responding to suggestions that the president's attendance at the correspondents dinner might look unseemly while an environmental calamity was under way. 
 Natural disasters provide great opportunities, or great peril, for presidents. President Bush's slow response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, magnified by his now-infamous ''You're doing a heck of a job, Brownie'' praise of his FEMA director, Michael Brown, cemented an impression that his administration failed to act with enough urgency to address the suffering of tens of thousands of people.
 The widening environmental calamity in the gulf is the first time Mr. Obama has confronted a domestic disaster. Complicating the White House response is the fact that the spill occurred just a month after the president announced he was expanding offshore drilling.
 Officials note that a key difference between the spill and Hurricane Katrina is the pace of the onslaught of the disaster. While the hurricane hit the Gulf Coast in a fury, the oil has -- literally -- crept to the shores of the gulf. While the eventual harm from the leak could outstrip that of the Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska, that will not be known for weeks, if not months.
 While characterizing the Obama administration's response to the spill as intense, Bill Eichbaum of the World Wildlife Fund said the disaster showed that the expansion plans were a bad idea.
 ''This spill in the gulf is like having a heart attack in New York City,'' he said. ''Everything is there that you need to fix it. If you have a spill in the Arctic, it's like having a heart attack on the North Pole. There's nothing there to help you fix it.''

HEADLINE: Clare Sabatini, 77; Beat Trump in Land Fight

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Pacific Avenue isn't usually a sought-after property in the game of Monopoly, which uses real Atlantic City street names. But Clare Sabatini forced Donald Trump to triple his offering price for her Pacific Avenue restaurant after defeating New Jersey's effort to take it by condemnation.
 With her husband, Vincent, by her side, she did most of the talking as the couple fought a landmark legal case that ultimately barred New Jersey from using the process of eminent domain to close a going business in order to help another going business. 
 They then stared down Mr. Trump until he paid around $2 million for their Italian restaurant, Sabatini's, at 2210 Pacific Avenue. The first offer, 12 years earlier, had been $700,000.
 Mrs. Sabatini died on April 23 at her home in Ventnor City, N.J., at the age of 77. Her son Stephen said no cause was determined, although she had suffered from heart problems.
 ''This fight is so aggravating,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1997 in the midst of her legal battle. ''Sometimes I just have to pop my nitro and get through the day.''
 There were hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, which foes of eminent domain abuses helped pay. There was even intimidation: a representative of the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment Development Authority threatened Mrs. Sabatini that she would be removed from her restaurant in handcuffs if she refused to sell, The Associated Press reported in 2005.
 There was also humor, although Mr. Trump didn't think so. Garry Trudeau devoted a week of his ''Doonesbury'' comic strip to a story line that featured a long-haired, baggy-cheeked tycoon scheming with the strip's Uncle Duke character to get their hands on the tiny restaurant.
 ''Problem: How to get these yo-yos to fold and get out!'' the Trump character says.
 Mr. Trump responded by calling the comic a ''low blow'' by ''a third-rate talent.'' He was traveling Friday and could not be reached for comment.
 Mrs. Sabatini eventually developed an affection for Mr. Trump, who during the darkest days of the struggle ordered soup from the restaurant and called her when she was in the hospital.
 ''Mrs. Sabatini is a wonderful lady and I'm glad we finally made a deal,'' Mr. Trump said through a spokeswoman at the time.
 Clare Barone, the daughter of Sicilian immigrants, was born in Atlantic City on June 8, 1932. She and Mr. Sabatini both grew up on Arctic Avenue, which did not make the Monopoly board. Mr. Sabatini said he knew at 16 he was going to marry Clare, who was 14 at the time.
 Mrs. Sabatini earned an associate's degree from Atlantic Cape Community College and a bachelor's degree in education from Rowan University. At around 50, she completed a master's degree in early childhood education and then worked as a coordinator for the Head Start program.
 In addition to her husband, Mrs. Sabatini -- who was New Jersey's mother of the year in 2001 -- is survived by her sons Charles, Louis, Michael and Stephen; her daughter, Anna Marie Sabatini; six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
 The Sabatinis liked to point out that Mrs. Sabatini and four of their children earned degrees from restaurant earnings. ''I had to cook a lot of spaghetti,'' Mr. Sabatini said.
 Mr. Sabatini, the son of a chef, wanted to open a restaurant, and Mrs. Sabatini was eager to start a business. Sabatini's opened in 1965, and it quickly won a following with excellent veal dishes and succulent clams cacciatore. Mrs. Sabatini greeted and thanked customers and handled finances, while Mr. Sabatini cooked. He called her ''boss.''
 In 1976, New Jersey voters approved casino gambling for Atlantic City to revitalize its sagging economy. The development authority paved the way by condemning hundreds of properties for the development of hotels, casinos and other new businesses.
 In 1993, the authority made an agreement with Mr. Trump to acquire property to allow construction of a parking lot, a park and a limousine-staging area near the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. In addition to Sabatini's, a nearby homeowner, Vera Coking, refused to sell, and a jeweler held back on his store. (He later sold; Mrs. Coking did not.)
 There were many legal twists and turns over five years, but in 1998, a court stopped the condemnation of the Sabatinis' restaurant. As a result, they were free to keep it or sell it at a price they wanted.
 Finally, in 2005, Mr. Trump agreed to buy the property for a price the Sabatinis said was around $2 million. She said in an interview with The Daily News that it was also a victory for principle.
 ''I think we were an example to a lot of little people out there sticking up for themselves against the rich and powerful,'' she said. ''We're glad we fought that fight.''

HEADLINE: Job Cuts at ABC Leave Workers Stunned and Downcast

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
If ''Good Morning America'' or ''World News'' look any different in the coming weeks, it might be because ABC News is employing nearly 400 fewer people.
 Earlier this week, ABC News, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, largely completed one of the most drastic rounds of budget cutbacks at a television news operation in decades, affecting roughly a quarter of the staff. The cutbacks promise to change ABC both on- and off-camera.
 For some employees, like the longtime Los Angeles correspondent Brian Rooney, Friday was their last day. Mr. Rooney said his contract expired at ''exactly the moment when they needed to shed an enormous amount from the payroll.'' In an e-mail message, he compared it to ''standing looking straight up when the bomb dropped.'' 
 Personally, he said, the next step is scary. ''I'm 58 years old with a wife, two daughters in school and a little dog who likes to be fed. They have cut me loose into the worst economy in my lifetime,'' he said.
 The business of news is a particularly ugly one these days, and news outlets across the country have trimmed their staffs. But it is exceedingly rare for a newspaper or a network to shed a quarter of its employees all at once, as ABC has done.
 For viewers, the effects will be felt on the individual broadcasts, like ''World News with Diane Sawyer,'' which lost two of its six senior staff members to buyouts. They will not be replaced.
 In the future, more segments will be reported, filmed and edited by jacks-of-all-trades, called digital journalists, internally. They may lack the polish that a traditional four-person crew can provide, but they are much less expensive. Sometimes two of the digital journalists will team up for reports.
 ''We are now, as a work force, becoming much more flexible,'' said Jon Banner, the executive producer of ''World News.''
 David Westin, the ABC News president, said that Mr. Banner was having each of his producers trained as digital journalists. But he emphasized that there was still a place for veteran videographers and editors at ABC.
 Other changes may be more subtle to viewers. More interviews will happen via Skype, rather than an expensive satellite truck. Prime-time shows will rely more heavily on freelance employees. More assignments will be made from a centralized office in New York, rather than by far-flung bureaus, because some of those bureaus have been severely downsized.
 Buyouts were announced in February as the prospect of layoffs loomed, and Mr. Westin made no secret of the fact that they would result in a leaner, smaller organization, a bid for survival in a crowded media landscape. 
 More than 300 employees were approved for buyout packages. An unknown number were laid off. A person with knowledge of the cutbacks said 22 staff employees were laid off on Tuesday in a final round of cuts, but ABC would not disclose the numbers. 
 Morale is very low, according to some of the dozen ABC News staff members who agreed to be interviewed for this article. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by ABC to speak publicly. 
 People are ''walking around like they've been punched in the gut,'' one of the employees said, referring to people still with jobs.
 Mr. Westin acknowledged in an interview on Friday that ''this is a difficult time for everybody at ABC News, not least for the people who are leaving.''
 ''At the same time, we really are looking forward to the future,'' he said.
 Inside ABC News, it is widely believed that the cutbacks were mandated by Disney. The cuts came shortly after CBS News, one of the other three network news divisions, lost about 70 staff members. The third division, NBC, is in a much better financial position because it has a cable news arm, MSNBC.
 Amid the buyout and layoff process, there has been widespread speculation about a potential pairing between ABC News and the Bloomberg TV cable channel. The two already share some content. Mr. Westin said ABC regularly talks to Bloomberg and another partner, the BBC, ''about whether there are ways we can expand'' their relationships, but ''there's no major change that's imminent.''
 Richard Gizbert, a former ABC correspondent who now is host of a weekly media criticism show on Al Jazeera English, said the extent of the cutbacks stunned some former ABC employees. He noted that ABC's London bureau, which is responsible for covering Europe and Africa and which employed about 100 people in the early 1990s, had already suffered a series of cuts over the years, and will soon employ barely a dozen people. 
 ''Yet there's no fewer broadcasts,'' Mr. Gizbert noted. 
 (Mr. Gizbert's contract was not renewed by ABC in 2004, and he lost a lawsuit against the network in 2006.)
 Already, some bureaus, like Los Angeles, have been reduced significantly. Along with Mr. Rooney, other departing correspondents include Betsy Stark, Lisa Fletcher and Laura Marquez.
 But ABC executives sharply disagreed with suggestions that the news division was throwing up its hands.
 ''The entire news industry is at a crossroads right now,'' Mr. Westin said. In ABC's case, rather than simply reducing headcount, ''this is, 'Let's redefine jobs and what people do and what their skills are.' ''
 But to Mr. Rooney, the title of digital journalist is ''really a code for cheaper and less professional.'' 
 ''Good television news is expensive to do,'' he wrote. ''The shorter the deadline, the more people and equipment it takes. In the western states in particular, it would be very challenging for one or two people to shoot, write, edit and feed a breaking news story by 3:30 in the afternoon. Wildfires tend to happen in places where there is no cellphone coverage and no Starbucks with free Wi-Fi.'' Despite his skepticism about the digital journalist strategy, Mr. Rooney said he believed that Mr. Westin was ''trying to save ABC News.''
 ''I hope they succeed,'' he said, ''although I like to think they will have a harder time doing it without me.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Names Ex-Mayor of Indianapolis, Lauded as Cost Cutter, to No. 2 Post

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Reaching far beyond the walls of City Hall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Friday appointed Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis and a management guru at Harvard University, to the powerful post of deputy mayor for operations.
 The selection of such a high-profile outsider seemed to confirm Mr. Bloomberg's determination to shake up his cabinet, which is known as close knit and long serving, in a third term fraught with budget woes and an emboldened political opposition.
 Mr. Goldsmith, 63, has never lived in New York City, and conceded that ''I don't know nearly enough'' about it. But, he said, ''I know a lot about how to run a government.'' 
 In his new job, Mr. Goldsmith will serve as the mayor's No. 2 in city government, overseeing about a dozen agencies -- including the Police, Fire, Transportation and Sanitation Departments -- that deliver the services by which most New Yorkers measure the effectiveness of their government.
 As mayor of Indianapolis from 1992 to 1999, Mr. Goldsmith, an understated personality with a surprisingly fast-talking style, emerged as a national leader in the movement to introduce corporate-style accountability and cost-cutting into government bureaucracy. It was the same quest that Mr. Bloomberg adopted in his 2001 campaign for mayor. 
 In what was considered a daring experiment, Mr. Goldsmith cut $100 million from the Indianapolis budget by forcing city agencies to bid against private corporations for contracts for about 50 services -- even filling potholes. 
 ''Bureaucratic monopolies are bad for taxpayers and bad for public employees,'' he wrote in an Op-Ed article published in The New York Times in 2001.
 Big-city mayors flocked to study his work -- Indianapolis set aside a special day for 30 urban experts to visit him at one time -- and he became an informal adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
 ''He, more than anyone else, sets the tone for the new mayors of the 1990s,'' said Fred Siegel, a visiting professor at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and a fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, who wrote a biography of Mr. Giuliani. ''He was the first to talk about how you could make city government work better.''
 A fiscally conservative Republican and an adviser to George W. Bush during his 2000 campaign for president, Mr. Goldsmith will be in a position to overhaul how city services are delivered, budgets are drafted and municipal labor contracts are settled in New York, areas that could put him on a collision course with the city's restive and politically powerful unions. 
 Aides to the mayor said Mr. Goldsmith was an ideal choice for a third term that was likely to be defined by budget cuts. Through much of his second term, Mr. Bloomberg benefited from a roaring economy that underwrote economic development and generous raises for city workers. 
 Next year, however, the city faces a nearly $5 billion budget deficit and potentially thousands of layoffs. At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg must contend with a City Council speaker, a public advocate and a comptroller who harbor mayoral ambitions. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has been eyeing Mr. Goldsmith since he learned that Edward Skyler, who held the deputy mayor position since 2007, planned to take a job in the private sector.
 In late March, Mr. Bloomberg and two of his deputies, Patricia. E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey, met with Mr. Goldsmith to discuss the position in his office at Harvard, where he is a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, aides to the mayor said. Mr. Bloomberg explained that he wanted to infuse his final four years as mayor with big ideas and small experiments. Mr. Goldsmith, who had just completed a book about government innovation, joked that he had devoted far more of his writing to New York City than he had expected because of the mayor's focus on experimentation. A few weeks later, Mr. Goldsmith interviewed with the mayor again, at City Hall, and met with his staff members.
 ''It seemed to me an irresistible opportunity -- not one I was looking for -- when I received the mayor's phone call,'' Mr. Goldsmith said at a news conference announcing his appointment at City Hall. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said, ''Lots of people talk about reinventing government; I think it's fair to say Steve has actually done that.''
 Mr. Goldsmith is working on a voluntary basis until June 1, giving him time to end any business dealings that might create a conflict of interest with his work at City Hall. As deputy mayor, he will earn $213,000 a year. He lives in Washington but said he would soon begin house hunting in New York City. 
 Asked if he would entertain running for office in New York, Mr. Goldsmith replied emphatically, ''No, and no.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who broke his pledge to serve only two terms by undoing term limits in 2008, noted wryly, ''I said that, too.''

HEADLINE: Immigration Law Debate Resonates Far From Border

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE , JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. , MONICA DAVEY, WILLIAM YARDLEY and KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
 Across the Country, a Close Vote on a Bill
 BOSTON -- The Democratic-controlled House in Massachusetts came unexpectedly close to passing a measure this week that would have barred illegal immigrants from receiving state and federal benefits in the state.
 In the end, the bill failed 75-82, but that was much tighter than the tally on a similar measure last year, which lost by a lopsided 40-118.
 The difference, both proponents and political analysts say: Arizona.
 This year's proposal would have required any resident alien receiving benefits to be verified first as legal by a federal database. 
 The measure was championed by State Representative Jeff Perry, a Republican, who is running for the Congressional seat being vacated by Bill Delahunt, a Democrat. It had the backing of high-profile political figures, including two candidates for governor -- Tim Cahill, the state treasurer who is running as an independent, and Charles Baker, the Republican.
 ''It suggests the dangerous growth of anti-immigration hysteria from Arizona,'' said Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, who said the measure was unnecessary because undocumented immigrants were not eligible for benefits anyway.
 ''It was pure political showboating,'' she said.
 Hundreds of people in New England are expected to join the nationwide protests against the Arizona law on Saturday, with rallies planned from Portland, Me., to Providence, R.I.
 About 450,000 immigrants have come to Massachusetts over the last decade. Between 150,000 and 170,000 are estimated to be here illegally, and state and city resources across the state are scarce. Mr. Perry said the unexpected support for the bill was partly because of concern over costs for their benefits.
 Without the Arizona legislation, the Massachusetts measure most likely would not have come to the floor right now and it certainly would not have done so well. But the vote shows how immigration is simmering just beneath the surface as a political issue here. Republicans are trying to use it as a cudgel against vulnerable Democrats in the state. Democrats want Congress to do something fast -- to get it off their plates before November.
 Demographers say that immigrants to New England have generally moved to the bigger urban areas rather than more rural regions, although there are pockets of Somalis in Lewiston, Me., and Brazilians on Cape Cod.
 One particular immigrant in South Boston has drawn national attention: President Obama's aunt, Zeituni Onyango, has been living in public housing and is still fighting a deportation order from 2006. She appeared in court in February seeking to have that order overturned; her supporters argue that she would be in danger if she returned to her native Kenya because of her relationship to Mr. Obama, who is the son of her half-brother. President Obama has not intervened in the case. KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 
 Political Considerations and Practical Ones
 HOUSTON -- On most subjects, it's hard to find a politician in the country more conservative than Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, but when it comes to Arizona's new immigration law, you find the gun-toting, Obama-bashing, regulation-slashing, state-rights-touting governor walking a fine line.
 ''I fully recognize and support a state's right and obligation to protect its citizens,'' Mr. Perry, a Republican, said in a statement, ''but I have concerns with portions of the law passed in Arizona, and believe it would not be the right direction for Texas.''
 One of those concerns, Mr. Perry went on, was that the local police and sheriffs would end up spending too much time corralling illegal immigrants and would neglect to catch criminals and keep the public safe. But he also blamed the federal government for not securing the border and repeated his stance that no immigration reform should be passed until the border is secured.
 That is a common position among Republican officeholders here, including Senator John Cornyn. They all portray the Arizona bill as a result of the state's frustration with the failure in Washington to seal the border.
 But Mr. Perry's real concern may be as much political as it is practical. Statewide officials in Texas, especially Republicans, have a hard time getting elected without Hispanic voters. Yet, Republicans still need to keep white conservatives, their base, happy.
 Mr. Perry has taken steps to increase the number of state police officers and cameras along the border. But he also has come out against ending the basing of citizenship on being born on American soil, opposed the border fence and favors a guest-worker program. JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 
 Divided Opinions Around the Midwest
 CHICAGO -- In the Midwest's larger cities, protests against the Arizona law have cropped up, leaders of immigrant rights groups and the Democratic governor of Illinois have railed against it, and at least one mayor, Chris Coleman of St. Paul, announced that city workers could no longer travel to Arizona on city business.
 Mr. Coleman said the law will ''create a culture where racial profiling is acceptable, and will create a dangerous wedge between police officers and the communities they serve.'' He said he was also writing letters to the Democratic and Republican national committees to urge them not to choose Phoenix as a site for national conventions in 2012. And he wondered aloud what his own grandmother would have felt like, had there been ''a similar anti-Irish law.''
 At least one Republican candidate for governor of Minnesota announced support for the measure (calling it a ''wonderful first step''), and the question was swiftly becoming a must-answer matter for debates, forums, interviews -- despite its potential political fallout on either side.
 ''My peers are going to have to answer this question,'' said Bob Vander Plaats, a Republican candidate for governor of Iowa, who has already offered his take: As governor, he would encourage a similar law in Iowa.
 ''The people in Iowa, the people in Arizona, people around the country are taking a look at the federal government and thinking that they have been completely inept with the handling of this issue,'' Mr. Vander Plaats said, adding that politicians' answers to the Arizona question ''probably say more about the candidates' stances on other issues, not just illegal immigration.'' MONICA DAVEY 
 Cheap Labor a Factor in Rural Economies
 SEATTLE -- In Idaho, a measure that would require employers to electronically verify the legal immigration status of people they hire has yet to make headway in the state's Republican-controlled Legislature.
 ''It would just seem logical, as conservative as Idaho is supposed to be, that it would embrace this type of legislation,'' said State Senator Mike Jorgenson, a Republican who sponsored the bill. ''But the fact of the matter is this is not a party issue, Republican versus Democrat, as much as it is a cheap labor issue.''
 Mr. Jorgenson, who is from Hayden Lake in northern Idaho, said some of the state's large agricultural industries, led by dairy farmers, have opposed the bill. Since 2000, Idaho's Hispanic population has grown by about 50 percent, according to Census data.
 Although Idaho is far more conservative than the states to its west, Washington and Oregon, all three share some broad characteristics. They are made up of vast rural and relatively conservative areas and large, more liberal cities.
 In Washington, commissioners in King County, which includes Seattle, voted 5 to 4 in November to adopt a ''don't ask'' ordinance that prohibits county agencies from allowing immigration status to affect the services they provide to people. The ordinance formalized a policy that had been in practice for years by agencies including the Office of the Sheriff and the Public Health Department.
 Earlier this month, at a large immigration rally in Seattle's Pioneer Square, the King County executive, Dow Constantine, a Democrat who was elected last fall, told those present, ''Wherever you began your day, wherever you began your life, you are welcome here in King County.'' WILLIAM YARDLEY 
 Outrage in Schools, and Campaign Fodder
 DENVER -- The Denver Public Schools' superintendent, Tom Boasberg, announced on Thursday a ban on travel to Arizona for all district employees on district-sponsored trips.
 ''This legislation is an assault on human dignity and our core values,'' Mr. Boasberg said in a statement on the system's Web site. ''We will not put our employees at risk of the arbitrary and potentially discriminatory harassment that can now occur in Arizona as a result of this reprehensible identity-document legislation.''
 In the race for governor of Colorado, immigration is back on the table -- if a little short on specifics. The leading Republican candidate, Scott McInnis, said in a radio interview this week that he would support a bill ''very similar'' to Arizona's if elected, without saying exactly what that might mean. His likely opponent, John Hickenlooper, the mayor of Denver and a Democrat, was circumspect in the other direction.
 ''Arizona's law is troubling,'' Mr. Hickenlooper said in a statement. ''But I am not surprised states are trying to address immigration policy, because Congress hasn't.''
 In Utah, the speaker of the State House of Representatives, David Clark, a Republican, said he expected there would be a very similar bill to Arizona's up for consideration in the Legislature next year.
 The Denver Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau has received two or three inquiries so far, a spokeswoman said, from groups who might be rethinking Arizona for their business meetings.
 ''We're not actively soliciting business that might be lost from Arizona,'' said the spokeswoman, Carrina Junge. ''Right now, we're just kind of waiting to see what happens.''
 And students from as many as 20 schools in Denver, from middle school to college, were walking out of class Friday afternoon for a rally at the State Capitol against the Arizona measure. KIRK JOHNSON

HEADLINE: Citing Financial Reform, Dodd Quits Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a leader of Congressional efforts to crack down on Wall Street abuses, announced abruptly on Friday that he was canceling a planned appearance at a fund-raiser attended by financial industry executives in Manhattan next week.
 Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, however, said she would attend the fund-raiser. The event on Monday night, which is intended to help her fortify her financial position as she runs for election this fall, is being held as the Senate considers Mr. Dodd's legislation to overhaul the nation's financial regulatory system. 
 Mr. Dodd's decision occurred after several newspapers ran unflattering storiesreporting that he and Ms. Gillibrand would attend the Park Avenue event. 
 In a statement, Mr. Dodd's communications director, Bryan DeAngelis, said the senator must remain in Washington next week to manage floor debate on the bill. Mr. Dodd, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate banking committee, is the chief sponsor of the legislation. 
 ''Monday's event was scheduled before we knew when Dodd's Wall Street reform bill would come to floor,'' Mr. DeAngelis said.
 Mr. Dodd, who is not seeking re-election, agreed to attend the event weeks ago as a show of support for Ms. Gillibrand, a New York Democrat.
 The fund-raiser will be held at the home of Ralph Schlosstein, the president and chief executive officer of Evercore Partners, the boutique investment bank; and his wife, Jane Hartley, a prominent Democratic donor.
 The guests from the world of finance will include Roger Altman, a former Treasury Department official and founder of Evercore; David Topper, vice chairman of J. P. Morgan's investment banking division; Richard Beattie, a Wall Street lawyer; and Charles Myers, a senior managing director at Evercore.
 Matt Canter, a spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand, said there was no connection between the fund-raiser and the work he said the senator was doing in Washington to revamp financial regulations.
 ''Senator Gillibrand's strong support for comprehensive financial reform proves there is zero conflict,'' Mr. Canter said. ''She has worked as hard as anyone to create rules of the road to ensure we never again experience a financial crisis due to too much risk in the system, institutions that were too big to fail and a lack of proper oversight and accountability.''
 He insisted that it was an event organized by prominent Democratic donors, not the Wall Street crowd.
 ''It is not an industry event,'' he said.
 Normally, the kind of reception being held on Ms. Gillibrand's behalf would not draw much attention. But it underscores the complicated relationship that Democrats in Washington have with Wall Street.
 The financial industry has provided Democrats with millions of dollars in campaign contributions in recent years, helping them establish and maintain majorities in both chambers of Congress.
 Ms. Gillibrand has collected nearly $700,000 from the financial industry since 2005, while Mr. Dodd has raised nearly $1.3 million from the industry in that period, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.
 But Democrats are keenly aware that being too closely associated with the titans of Wall Street could be politically damaging as Americans face economic hardship and esteem plummets for financial institutions. Even Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a longtime defender of the financial industry who has been the top recipient of campaign donations from Wall Street executives, has thrown his support behind new restrictions on the industry.
 Ms. Gillibrand, as a member of Congress representing a conservative rural district in upstate New York, voted against an emergency spending package that provided billions of dollars in federal aid to ailing financial institutions.
 But since being appointed to fill the seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton last year, she has reached out to financial industry executives and refrained from the kind of anti-Wall Street rhetoric used by liberals in her party.
 Ms. Gillibrand supports Mr. Dodd's bill, which calls for a broad overhaul of the financial regulatory system. The legislation would allow the federal government to close failing financial institutions, impose new rules on hedge funds and the complex instruments that led to the crisis on Wall Street and create a consumer protection bureau to crack down on predatory lending and other abuses.
 As chairman of the banking committee, Mr. Dodd has had a close relationship with executives in the financial industry. He has also found himself in the midst of several controversies stemming from his ties to the industry.

HEADLINE: Make Things Happen

 BODY:
I WAS artistic as a kid. When I was 8 or 10, I would exchange letters with a great-aunt in Tennessee who was also talented in drawing. Each letter I sent included my rendition of a picture or photo from a book or magazine. In her next letter, she'd include a dime for my previous picture, tell me what a great job I had done and include another, more complicated picture for me to draw.
 My father worked for Connecticut Light and Power and was a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. When I was in junior high, the union went on strike, and my dad needed to figure out a way to make money. He looked in the want ads and saw there was a demand for floor refinishers, so he rented equipment and calculated how much it would cost to buy tools and supplies. 
 School was out for the summer, so he and I drove around and bid on jobs. We won a few bids and learned how to sand and refinish hardwood floors as we went along. It felt good to look at the results of our work and to know the customer was happy. 
 The experience taught me that if you're in a difficult situation, you have to make something happen rather than sit back and feel sorry for yourself. When I looked at career opportunities, I decided I wasn't talented enough to pursue art. I knew I could use my artistic skills in the architecture field. I got a B.A. in architecture from Howard University and worked for a small firm for two years. 
 In the early 1980s, interest rates rose and construction declined in the Northeast. I decided to return to school for an M.B.A at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. I thought I'd focus on real estate finance and development when I graduated. Instead, I went straight to Wall Street. In 1984, I received an offer from what was then Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, and by the time I started, American Express had bought the company. 
 At Lehman, I had responsibility for one of the derivatives areas. In 1992, I left the company with two other colleagues to start a division of Jefferies & Company that packaged complex derivative instruments. 
 My colleagues and I left to start Williams Capital Group in 1994. Then interest rates started to rise and several of these types of vehicles started losing money. I was perilously close to losing the business and told my wife I needed to withdraw money from our personal account for the company. We had two young children, and she gave me a look that said, ''I hope you know what you're doing.'' That October was our first profitable month after the downturn. 
 At the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, we had been offering clients a prime money market fund. Customers expect to be able to withdraw their money from this type of fund with a day's notice and receive 100 cents on the dollar. But liquidity was declining at an alarming rate, and we were afraid it would be difficult to sell our investments to satisfy shareholder redemptions if we needed to. 
 We asked our mutual fund board to let us convert to a government fund that would invest in lower-yielding but safer, more liquid instruments, and it agreed. It was an aggressive step that wasn't popular at the time, but had we not done what we did, our fund may have ceased operations like several others. 
 Several years ago, my wife and I decided to turn an old farmhouse into our weekend country retreat. With me as the architect, we expected to finish under budget. But a client married to the architect doesn't hesitate to request expensive design changes, even in the middle of construction.

HEADLINE: In and Out of Each Other's European Wallets

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Despite the best efforts of the International Monetary Fund, the financial crisis in Europe seems full of suspense. Will Germany and the European Union actually cough up the money to help bail out Greece, which is on the edge of a financial meltdown? Will the contagion spread to other vulnerable countries, like Portugal and Spain? 
 But like some mystery novels where the ending is telegraphed in the opening pages, the denouement will probably be unsurprising. For all the handwringing, the reality is that the Germans, the French and the rest of Europe have little choice. In the decade since the introduction of the euro, the economies on the continent have become increasingly interwoven. With cross-border banking and borrowing, many countries on the periphery of Europe owe vast sums to one another, as well as to richer neighbors like Germany and France.
 Like the alliances that drew one country after another into World War I, a default by a single nation would send other countries tumbling. If that message was lost on anyone, there was a reminder last Tuesday when Standard & Poor's downgrade of Spanish and Portuguese debt hammered stock markets everywhere, including in the United States.
 The first domino is Greece. It owes nearly $10 billion to Portuguese banks, and with Portugal already falling two notches in S. & P.'s ratings and facing higher borrowing costs, a default by Greece would be a staggering blow. Portugal, in turn, owes $86 billion to banks in Spain; Spain's debt was downgraded one notch last week.
 The numbers quickly mount. Ireland is heavily indebted to Germany and Britain. The exposure of German banks to Spanish debt totals $238 billion, according to the Bank for International Settlements, while French banks hold another $220 billion. And Italy, whose finances are perennially shaky, is owed $31 billion by Spain and owes France $511 billion, or nearly 20 percent of the French gross domestic product.
 ''This is not a bailout of Greece,'' said Eric Fine, who manages Van Eck G-175 Strategies, a hedge fund specializing in currencies and emerging market debt. ''This is a bailout of the euro system.''
 Solutions are also not easily forthcoming. ''In the end, we're all saying we don't know how to deal with it,'' said Dirk Hoffmann-Becking, a bank analyst with Alliance Bernstein in London. ''We don't know how the channels work, or where the problems will pop up next.''

BYLINE: By ELSA DIXLER

 BODY:
SHOP CLASS AS SOULCRAFT: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work, by Matthew B. Crawford (Penguin, $15.) This ''beautiful little book about human excellence and the way it is undervalued in contemporary America,'' as our reviewer, Francis Fukuyama, described it, argues against the idea that the United States labor force needs to be retrained to face the challenges of a high-tech, global economy. On the contrary, argues Crawford -- a philosopher who operates a motorcycle repair shop -- blue-collar work leads to knowledge both about the world and about oneself. He illustrates by explaining in detail just what is involved in rebuilding a Volkswagen engine.
 HOW TO SELL, by Clancy Martin (Picador, $14.) Martin's entertaining first novel is a coming-of-age story; its hero, a high school dropout, is taken under the wing of his coke-addled brother, a double-dealing jeweler. Descriptions are ''executed with no less manual and verbal dexterity than that of the book's fine-fingered and silver-tongued'' characters, Tom McCarthy wrote in the Book Review. 
 ROCKET MEN: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon, by Craig Nelson (Penguin, $17.) Nelson makes good use of NASA oral histories in this engaging account of the lunar program. He provides vivid detail (the Apollo 8 command module felt like ''an outhouse'' by the time it splashed down) and contrasts the Apollo period with the shuttle and space-station era that followed (Soviet-American competition in space was a ''celestial Olympics,'' he writes).
 THE GREAT PERHAPS, by Joe Meno (Norton, $14.95.) Two scientists dedicated to unpromising research have a collapsing marriage and a pair of rebellious teenage daughters; they are mired in pessimism and passivity. Since the action takes place on the eve of the 2004 election, that might be a political comment, but the narrative moves back in time to show various cowardly ancestors. This darkly funny novel, Meno's fifth, is full of modernist daring.
 SUMMER WORLD: A Season of Bounty, by Bernd Heinrich (Ecco/HarperCollins, $14.99.) For most creatures, writes Heinrich, an emeritus professor of biology, summer is ''the season of reproduction, feeding, growing and trying to avoid being eaten.'' As he observes and takes measure of the plants and animals around him, Heinrich has a ''magical'' ability ''to conjure a riot of life from what others less attuned might consider your standard Northern woodlot,'' our reviewer, Elizabeth Royte, said.
 TOWARDS ANOTHER SUMMER, by Janet Frame (Counterpoint, $14.95.) This novel was written in 1963 but considered too personal to be published during Frame's lifetime (she died in 2004). Its protagonist, a solitary writer, accepts an invitation to a weekend in the country. Excruciatingly ill at ease, she is flooded with memories of her childhood in rural New Zealand, beautifully evoked from a child's point of view. Then she returns home to write the story of the visit.
 GO DOWN TOGETHER: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde, by Jeff Guinn (Simon & Schuster, $16.99.) The bumbling Depression-era stickup artist Clyde Barrow and his girlfriend Bonnie Parker were made fascinating by the 1967 movie ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' a hymn to youth rebellion. (In reality, ''about the only thing they did well was shoot people,'' Bryan Burrough wrote in the Book Review.) Guinn entertainingly synthesizes recent scholarship in what Burrough called ''a fine work of history.''
 FANON, by John Edgar Wideman (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $13.95.) Wideman's protagonist is a writer -- Wideman himself -- trying to write a novel about Frantz Fanon (1925-61), the psychiatrist and revolutionary whose book ''The Wretched of the Earth'' is a classic meditation on violence and injustice. Our reviewer, Lee Siegel, found it a ''thrilling, important novel,'' by turns ''eloquent, crude, despairing and heartbrokenly hopeful.''
 LAND OF THE LOST SOULS: My Life on the Streets, by Cadillac Man (Bloomsbury, $15.) Thomas Wagner, known as Cadillac Man, became homeless in 1994, when he was 44. ''I had a good life and I screwed up,'' he writes, ''plain and simple.'' His book is full of piquant details about the intricacies of living on the New York City streets.
 GOD IS BACK: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World, by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge (Penguin, $17.) ''God is back, for better,'' the authors conclude. They are most interested in the rise and global spread of the American megachurch, set off, they say, ''by the same forces driving the success of market capitalism: competition and choice.''
 BLOOD MOON,by Garry Disher. (Soho, $14.) Solid police work and coordinated effort solve a series of killings with social implications in the fifth Inspector Hal Challis mystery by Disher, an Australian writer. THE FATE OF KATHERINE CARR,by Thomas H. Cook . (Otto Penzler/Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $13.95.) A travel writer in despair after his young son's murder tries to unravel the mystery of a reclusive poet who disappeared 20 years earlier and left a manuscript with cryptic clues about her fate.

HEADLINE: Fueled by Anger Over Arizona Law, Immigration Advocates Rally for Change

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON; Lilly Fowler contributed reporting from Los Angeles, Ana Facio Contreras from Phoenix, Emma Graves Fitzsimmons from Chicago and James C. McKinley Jr. from Houston.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In protests fueled by anger over a tough anti-illegal immigrant law in Arizona, tens of thousands of demonstrators joined marches and rallies Saturday in cities across the country, calling on Congress to pass an immigration overhaul.
 In Los Angeles, the police said the crowd had peaked at 50,000. Protesters numbered 25,000 in Dallas, more than 10,000 in Chicago and Milwaukee, in the thousands in San Francisco and here in Washington, D.C., according to the police and independent estimates. Organizers said rallies and vigils were held in more than 70 places around the country.
 In Washington, Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, was arrested after staging a sit-in on the sidewalk in front of the White House with about three dozen other people, in front of a crowd of thousands.
 At a rally before he was arrested, Mr. Gutierrez, speaking in English and in Spanish, evoked memories of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. 
 ''There are moments in which you say, 'We will escalate this struggle,' '' he said. ''Today they will put handcuffs on us. But one day we will be free at last in the country we love.'' 
 In all, 35 people were arrested in the sit-in, the United States Park Police said.
 At rally after rally across the nation, protesters chanted ''shame, shame, Arizona,'' and carried signs saying, ''Todos Somos Arizona,'' or ''We are All Arizona.''
 The bigger demonstrations were far larger than planners had anticipated in March, when the events were first announced. The protests were originally called by immigrant advocates who had set May 1 as the deadline for Congress to introduce overhaul legislation that would include measures to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants. 
 But organizers said the Arizona legislation, which was signed into law April 23, had been a watershed event for disparate advocate organizations, transforming them into something akin to a civil rights movement with a national profile. 
 The Arizona law made it a crime to be present in the state without legal immigration status and authorized the police to question people about their status based on a suspicion that they might be illegal immigrants. 
 Supporters of the law, including Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, a Republican, said the state had to act because the federal government had failed to enforce the immigration laws. Critics across the country said the law would lead to racial profiling and spread fear in immigrant communities. 
 In Los Angeles, protesters marched through the streets and held a crowded rally downtown, just down the street from the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. 
 Demonstrators waved American flags and signs, including one that said: ''We Latinos are the Jews of the 21st century.'' Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa told the crowd that a federal immigration overhaul was long overdue.
 ''Let me be clear about those laws that make suspects out of people based on the color of their skin,'' Mr. Villaraigosa said. ''They have no place in our great country.'' 
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles drew cheers when he said, ''Everyone in God's eyes is legal.'' 
 ''Every time we have an economic downturn, there is a new attack on immigrants,'' Cardinal Mahony said.
 One Los Angeles protester, Dorien Grunbaum, 67, a teacher at a community college in the city, said she was there ''primarily to support the immigrants in Arizona. I'm disgusted by what's happening there,'' Ms. Grunbaum said. 
 No overhaul legislation has been introduced in Congress, and President Obama said last week that lawmakers ''may not have the appetite'' for a volatile debate on immigration this year. A group of Democratic senators on Thursday presented an outline for an overhaul bill, written primarily by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. 
 In Washington, Mr. Gutierrez sat crossed-legged on the sidewalk in front of the White House at about 3 p.m., holding a small American flag and wearing a white T-shirt with red letters that read, ''Arrest me not my friends.'' The protesters each held letters that spelled out the message, ''Obama, stop deporting our families.'' 
 Mr. Gutierrez was handcuffed behind his back with plastic cuffs by the Park Police, and he walked in silence when an officer led him away along the black wrought-iron fence in front of the White House. Among others arrested with him were Jaime Contreras, director for Washington, D.C., of the Service Employees International Union; Joshua Hoyt, Ali Noorani, Deepak Bhargava, and Gustavo Torres, leaders of immigrant advocate organizations; and Gregory Cendana, president of the United States Student Association. 
 The protesters were arrested for violations of a regulation requiring people to keep moving when they pass in front of the White House, said Sergeant David Schlosser, a spokesman for the Park Police.
 In Chicago, Mr. Obama's hometown, thousands of people marched through downtown with signs that said, ''Being brown is not a crime'' and ''Hey Obama! Don't deport my mama.'' 
 Many of the Chicago protesters expressed frustration at what they saw as the president's lack of action on immigration. 
 Dulce Blanco, 48, was at the rally with a church group. She said she voted for Mr. Obama after attending a meeting where he said he would pass immigration reform. ''If they don't pass reform, we won't vote for Obama again,'' she said in Spanish. 
 Guadalupe Concepcion, a 22-year-old student in Chicago, began to cry during one of the speeches. She said she had been an illegal immigrant until she married her husband and that her parents faced discrimination because they are not here legally.
 ''The Arizona law is just plain racist,'' she said. ''It happened with African-Americans in the past, and now they want to do the same thing with us.''
 Addressing the Chicago crowd, the Rev. Jesse Jackson encouraged a boycott of Arizona, saying the law would encourage racial profiling. ''Arizona has become the Selma,'' he said. ''It is a showdown.''
 In downtown Dallas, demonstrators gathered at the Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe, named for the patroness of Mexico, and marched to City Hall. Many carried American flags, or draped them over their shoulders.
 Among the widening reverberations from the Arizona law, the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, a historically black organization whose members included Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall, announced that it was moving its annual convention in July to Las Vegas from Phoenix. The fraternity said it had been expecting as many as 10,000 people, including members and their families, to come to the meeting. 
 The fraternity's board decided that it could not host a meeting in a state with ''a law that could put the civil rights and the very dignity of our members at risk during their stay in Phoenix,'' said Herman Mason, the general president. 
 In Phoenix on Saturday, a far smaller and more subdued crowd of about 1,000 people gathered by 3 p.m. on the lawn at the State Capitol. 
 Most had handmade signs, including one with Governor Brewer wearing a black witch hat and reading ''Jan Brewer: Arizona's wicked witch of the West.'' 
 The rally was primarily peaceful with the mostly Latino crowd marching around the Capitol, but a few arguments broke out with people who supported the law.
 One demonstrator, Martina Paz, 42, of Phoenix, held a photograph of her 23-year-old son, Adan Buelna, who she said was in the Army stationed in Texas and was waiting to be deployed to the Middle East.
 ''My son will be protecting the rights and liberty of people on the other side of the world, but who is going to protect our rights here in Arizona,'' Ms. Paz said.
 She said that she feared that even though she and her husband have submitted applications to become legal residents, they will be stopped by the police and possibly be deported.

HEADLINE: What About the Raters?

 BODY:
Everyone (except Wall Street bankers) seems to be outraged about Wall Street banks, which made billions by trading complex confections of dicey mortgages and then passed us the tab when the investments went belly up. But what about the agencies that bestowed triple-A ratings on many of the noxious financial products?
 Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, whose ratings assured investors that the newfangled investments were as safe as United States Treasury bonds, arguably bear as much responsibility for the financial crisis as the banks that put the investments together. But the raters have mostly avoided public scrutiny, and from the look of Democrats' current proposals to overhaul financial regulation, it looks as if they will remain off the hook. 
 From 2004 to 2007, agencies made hundreds of millions of dollars rating thousands of deals in residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. Their fees could exceed $1 million per transaction, on top of annual ''ratings surveillance'' fees of tens of thousands of dollars.
 Ninety-one percent of the triple-A securities backed by subprime mortgages issued in 2007 have been downgraded to junk status, along with 93 percent of those issued in 2006 and 53 percent of those issued in 2005. On Jan. 30 of 2008 alone, Standard & Poor's downgraded over 6,300 subprime residential mortgage-backed securities and 1,900 C.D.O.'s.
 Triple-A is what the raters assign to United States government debt. Had they warned investors that the new mortgage-based products were just high-tech junk bonds, it is unlikely so many financial institutions would have loaded up on the stuff.
 It is not just that ratings agencies are incompetent, made wrong assumptions about the housing market and used flawed models to evaluate mortgage-backed securities. Their business is rife with conflicts of interest. The banks pay the raters and have an enormous incentive to shop around for ratings. E-mail made public in April indicates that raters give in to the temptation to manage their ratings in order to acquire more business.
 A 2004 e-mail message from one Standard & Poor's employee to another referred to a meeting to ''discuss adjusting criteria for rating C.D.O.'s of real estate assets this week because of the ongoing threat of losing deals.'' A 2007 e-mail message from a Moody's employee to a Chase banker suggested a colleague was ''looking into some adjustments to his methodology that should be a benefit to you folks.''
 And yet, the financial reform bills before Congress have only vague proposals to fix the agencies. They would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Senate bill would allow the S.E.C. to pull their registration if they were consistently wrong. Raters would have to disclose conflicts of interest, and investors would be able to sue for blatant recklessness.
 That is not enough. Some good ideas are floating around to do much better. If raters are considered to be a public good, they should be financed like a public good, with a tax or other levy, and paid by the government. Another option would be to let banks pay for ratings but take away their ability to choose who rates their bonds, letting the S.E.C. decide based on raters' performance.
 If there is no way to improve raters' track record, a more drastic step would be to eliminate them, or at least eliminate the legal requirement that some insurance companies, pension funds and other entities hold assets with high ratings, a rule that gives the raters enormous quasi-regulatory power.
 This is not a perfect solution. A world with no rating agencies would leave many investors at sea. But it is not much of a life raft if agencies cannot do better than they did during the housing bubble.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2010, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on May 2 on financial ratings agencies said that one drastic step Congress could take would be to eliminate the requirement that some institutions may only hold assets with high ratings. The House version of the bill includes such a provision.

HEADLINE: The Goal: 3 Races, 1 Network

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sandor@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If Bob Evans, the chief executive of Churchill Downs Inc., could turn his preference to reality, one television network would broadcast the three Triple Crown races starting next year, as NBC did from 2001 to 2005. 
 ''I certainly hope that turns out to be the case,'' Evans said Friday from Louisville, where the Kentucky Derby, the most-viewed of the Triple Crown races, will be run Saturday. ''But I can't do it alone.''
 He wants NBC to be that lone network, a departure from the current setup in which NBC has carried the Derby and the Preakness Stakes since 2006 and ESPN has shown the Belmont Stakes on ABC. 
 Evans is enamored with the way that NBC has turned the Derby into a broader entertainment program by using its sister networks, like Bravo and CNBC, and programs like ''Today'' to promote the race.
 Mike McCarley, a senior vice president of NBC Sports, said, ''Our ability to cross-promote to a broad audience, both men and women is one of our biggest advantages.''
 Women, who made up 52 percent of last year's Derby viewership, have become crucial to boosting viewership.
 Last year, NBC attracted 16.3 million viewers, the most in 20 years, to see the 50-1 long shot Mine That Bird win the Derby. When Rachel Alexandra won the Preakness, 10.9 million watched, the second most in 20 years.
 ''They've changed the way horse racing is presented,'' said Evans, alluding to NBC's Derby production and the series of pre-Derby prep races around the country that Churchill Downs and the network have collaborated on.
 Evans's wish is not great news for ESPN. It snared the Belmont Stakes by capitalizing on the New York Racing Association's dissatisfaction that it received only 25 percent of the $51.5 million that NBC paid in total from 2001 to 2005. The Derby received half the revenue and Pimlico, home to the Preakness Stakes, also received 25 percent.
 But the split network setup that grew out of NYRA's secession appears set to end with the expiration of NBC and ESPN/ABC's contracts this year. 
 NBC wants what Evans wants. ESPN wants, at the very least, to keep the Belmont Stakes and add races from Belmont Park and the Saratoga Race Course, which NYRA also runs.
 Len DeLuca, a senior vice president at ESPN, said he had been discussing a Belmont extension but that NYRA's chairman, C. Steven Duncker, had been ''extremely transparent'' in saying he will examine all options.
 ESPN would not mind acquiring the rights to the Derby and the Preakness. But DeLuca said that ESPN would be happy to receive a broader deal from NYRA and continue to carry the Breeders' Cup, which it has through 2013.
 Having only the Belmont presents a risk if a horse is not vying for the Triple Crown. Viewership spiked in recent years for Big Brown's (2008), Smarty Jones's (2004) and Funny Cide's (2003) failed attempts to win the third race. It is worth noting that with a Triple Crown at stake in each year from 2002 to 2004, NBC averaged 14.4 million viewers when it still carried the Belmont. Perhaps that is the benefit Evans is seeking in advocating to carry the races on one network. But in 2008, with Big Brown racing for a Triple Crown at Belmont Park, ABC drew 11.3 million viewers.
 ''If you have all three, clearly you have an edge,'' DeLuca said. ''But the Triple Crown has survived over the past 40 years by being on one network, and being on two. These are championship events that stand on their own.''
 Although NBC's and ESPN's Triple Crown rights fees have not been disclosed, the recession's effect and the state of horse racing (DeLuca politely calls it ''volatile'') seems to give the networks leverage in future talks. Pimlico has been part of its parent company's bankruptcy reorganization while NYRA struggles financially. Churchill Downs, the strongest entity of the three, is well-positioned to lead the TV negotiations.
 Evans hedged when asked which side held the best hand. Asked if the races' rights fees could drop, he said: ''I'm trained as a quantitative economist. More is preferred to less.''
 DeLuca added, ''We enter these negotiations in a different world.'' 
 It might look like a different world at the Derby on Saturday with torrential rains expected, at least through early afternoon. 
 David Michaels, NBC's director, said that the track could be a chaotic place. ''You have animals running on dirt,'' he said on a conference call Thursday. ''You have mud everywhere, you have cameramen who are holding pointers to the sky that are nothing more than high-tech lightning rods.''
 Gary Stevens, who won three Derbys as a jockey and is NBC's lead analyst, said on the call: ''You can see these jockeys wearing up to 10 pairs of goggles. When you've got that many layers of goggles stacked up, everything becomes very distorted. Your vision is impaired significantly.'' 
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Home Equity Watch

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS with secure jobs and no immediate plans to move will often watch mortgage rates anyway, just in case they have the opportunity to refinance their loans. But few of them will regularly bother to check housing sales or foreclosures, which could also affect their ability to refinance.
 The market downturn has greatly reduced home values in many parts of the country, leaving homeowners with significantly less equity in their properties. According to Cameron Findlay, the chief economist at LendingTree, home prices nationally have slipped to 2003 levels. 
 If a borrower's home equity falls below 20 percent, he or she must buy private mortgage insurance for a new mortgage, which adds to the loan cost, at least until the equity reaches the level where the insurance is no longer needed. So, depending on when a home was bought, refinancing now may not be a viable option.
 ''Compared to a year ago, many more people are calling me now and I just can't do anything for them,'' said Tom Vanderwell, a loan officer with a large regional bank, about homeowners looking to refinance. (Mr. Vanderwell also writes a blog, Straight Talk About Mortgages.) 
 Those seeking government-insured loans, like those through the Federal Housing Administration, will face similar insurance premium costs.
 Meanwhile, those wanting a second mortgage, or home equity credit lines, and even people who already have them, can also run aground if they near the 20 percent equity threshold. This is known as the 80 percent loan-to-value ratio, or L.T.V. for short.
 If a borrower's first and second mortgages would reach a combined loan-to-value ratio of 85 percent, most lenders would reject the application for a second mortgage, Mr. Vanderwell said. And if a borrower's home equity shrank to the point where his equity credit line neared that level, a lender might, as they have in recent years, stop him from taking out more money.
 In the New York City area in March, average resale prices of homes rose by 3.4 percent compared with a year ago, according to a report last month by the National Association of Realtors. Nationally, prices rose by 0.6 percent, the report indicated. Some economists expressed concern that those increases could end with the expiration of the federal housing tax credit for home buyers on April 30.
 There is no precise way to determine one's home value, aside from applying for a loan and paying for an appraisal. But there are some tools that borrowers can use to obtain quick estimates.
 Zillow.com, for instance, relies on publicly recorded sales and mortgage documents from nearby and similar homes, among other things, to determine value. 
 Mortgage brokers and others emphasize that Zillow should be used only as a rough guide, because it does not consider the condition of properties that have been sold, among other factors.
 Meanwhile, Trulia.com offers broader information on real estate value trends, as well as local foreclosure figures. Foreclosures can suppress selling prices and, if a property falls into disrepair, even reduce the value of surrounding homes.
 Mr. Vanderwell of Straight Talk About Mortgages says homeowners considering a new loan, who want to avoid the time and expense of making a formal mortgage application to determine whether they qualify, should try another route.
 ''Find a real estate agent who really knows the area, and ask them to come out and take a look at the house,'' he said. ''Tell them they're not thinking of selling it, but want an idea of what it would appraise at.''
 If the agent's informal appraisal is close enough to the figure you would need to qualify for a refinanced loan or a second mortgage, Mr. Vanderwell said, it is worth applying. If it is significantly below, you are better off waiting for conditions to improve.

HEADLINE: A Long, Hot Summer

 BODY:
Mayors across the country are rightly worried about Congress's failure to provide money for the summer jobs that keep teenagers off the streets while giving them sorely needed work experience. Unless the Senate acts quickly, this will be one the bleakest summers on record for youth employment. That raises the very real danger that it could be a violent summer as well. 
 The part-time jobs that young people once took for granted -- and that most of them can no longer find -- began to disappear long before the recession. A new analysis from Andrew Sum, an economist at Northeastern University, finds that the year-round employment rate for teenagers fell from just over 45 percent in 2000 to about 26 percent as of March. The summer employment rate for teenagers dropped below 33 percent in 2009, which represents a record low, despite a summer jobs program that was paid for through the stimulus package. 
 The problem of joblessness among teenagers is far more severe in poor, minority communities. Those are the places where violent, criminal street gangs actively recruit disaffected teenagers. Teenage joblessness has other long-term consequences; young people who fail to find early jobs are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed into their 20s and permanently trapped at the margins of the economy.
 In an April letter urging Congress to act, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that far more help from Congress would be needed to reverse a steady decline in employment in New York and other cities. Last summer, 140,000 young people applied to the city's Summer Youth Employment Program, which places young people in temporary jobs. It could employ only about 52,000 of them. 
 The House has approved $600 million for summer jobs for teenagers. The Senate has failed to act. Senate Republicans have blocked a separate proposal by Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, that would have committed $1.3 billion to create 500,000 summer jobs for the young. 
 Bills like these are often portrayed as pork barrel spending. But summer jobs help young people in desolate communities find meaning in their lives while improving their long-term work possibilities. The Senate needs to act soon. States and localities need time to set up effective jobs programs before school lets out.

HEADLINE: Falling Off the World

BYLINE: By RACHEL SONTAG. 
Rachel Sontag is the author of the memoir ''House Rules'' (Harper Perennial). E-mail: modernlove@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CRAIG was an unemployed architect, a cat-owning vegan and recently divorced. The man was wrong for me. And yet I couldn't get him out of my head. 
 We met at a pool hall. I adored the way he listened and thought before he spoke. He had chiseled features and those Prada eyeglasses architects favor. He smelled good; not like cologne, but like air and cotton. We shared a love of live music, matinees and independent bookstores. Plus, we'd both been laid off from our jobs: I from a community college where I taught English, and he from a small architecture firm.
 Without jobs, we had nothing but time, so we made a career of getting to know each other. We walked the city all day long, ignoring our hunger. We ate lunch at midnight and breakfast at 4 a.m. We stayed up until morning, with no help from unnatural stimulants, talking, laughing and having sex. He lay beside me on the couch as I read him passages from my favorite books: ''Franny and Zooey,'' ''Cathedral.'' 
 I've always loved the way life slows down when the unexpected happens: a 48-hour power failure that causes people to flock to the streets with food for their neighbors; a subway strike that forces businessmen to roller-skate to work. 
 Whenever my flight is delayed I try to have a beer at the airport bar. I don't hang around the terminal, bombarded by irate passengers. There's nothing I can do. But there's music playing in the airport bar, and better lighting. Craig was my airport bar. He was the best person with whom to ride out an international financial crisis. 
 Everyone has a different yardstick for success, whether it's marriage, children, a satisfying career, or owning a dog, a car or a home. I had yet to achieve any of these.
 Craig, on the other hand, had already been married and divorced. With his ex-wife, he'd bought, renovated and sold a brownstone, adopted shelter animals and owned cars. But after a year of being unemployed, no tangible evidence of his brush with adulthood remained. He longed for the stability, confidence and financial resources he'd grown accustomed to, but instead, at age 37, he moved out of his studio apartment and into his mother's house in New Jersey. 
 I was living in one of those rent-controlled artist's apartments in the West Village that makes living in New York on a teacher's salary possible. It became our saving grace. We treated it like a cave, ignoring the temptation of the city's summer consumption like hibernating bears. 
 The days were long and muggy. At night we'd lie on our backs, eyes closed, lights off, like children making snow angels, as we played our favorite songs for each other. He gave me Elvis Costello and Fiona Apple's rendition of ''I Want You.'' I gave him Joni Mitchell's ''A Case of You.'' We drank coffee all day long. The world kept turning. The sun kept rising and setting. But we had fallen off the map. 
 Just for fun we'd play ''What would you buy if you had money?''
 ''A ticket to New Zealand,'' I said.
 ''I'd take you out for dinner,'' he said meekly. ''A really nice place.''
 I smiled.
 ''I'd buy you a dress,'' he said. ''I'd like to buy you a dress some day.''
 I could tell the hypothetical was less fun for him, but I'd grown accustomed to the romance associated with not having money. I was so used to being broke that on the few occasions I'd had money it felt as if it didn't belong to me.
 My attempt to find work was halfhearted. I called friends and former employers, sent resumes into the black abyss. Nothing was coming through, and part of me was relieved. I had tried to find a job and failed. What more could I do? I simply needed to make enough to pay next month's rent so we could maintain our state of suspended existence together.
 I took a job as a hostess at a restaurant in Harlem. I walked neighbors' dogs. I bathed and fed friends' children. I pursued work as a foot fetish model. I posed nude for a 75-year-old artist doing a series of oil-painted vulvas. I sold beer at death-metal shows called ''Brutal Truth,'' ''Pig Destroyer'' and ''Repulsion.'' 
 The odd jobs didn't add up. I considered a roommate, but the apartment was the only place Craig and I could be alone together. So instead I rented it by the night, like a hotel, so that we could afford to stay for at least a couple of weeks each month. It was a tricky business, of course, the question of where we'd go when we were displaced.
 Lucky for us I had friends who traveled. Friends with dogs and cats, plants and mail that needed tending to. Friends who generously left us keys and fresh sheets for their beds: a weekend in Connecticut, a week in the East Village studio of Craig's ex-girlfriend. 
 Then came the cat-sitting job at his ex-wife's. She lived in Boston, where Craig had lived for 15 years. They remained on good terms, and she'd made it clear I was welcome to stay as long as we slept on the couch and not in her bed. I agreed to the arrangement. 
 Looking back, it was a strange decision, but at the time it made sense. For much of the summer we'd been on my turf, and he wanted to show me his. We treated the ex's place with the distanced appreciation one might offer a bed-and-breakfast, while ignoring the obvious. We walked the length of the city as he excitedly shouted out details of the projects he'd worked on and explained the histories behind old buildings.
 On our second day, while Craig headed out with a list of errands from his ex-wife (picking up her dry cleaning, her prescriptions, more cat food), I stood in the shower and stared at her shampoo. Later, I stood in the kitchen and assessed the contents of her pantry. In the living room I scanned the faces in the frames of her photos. I closed my eyes and kept them closed for some time. What were we doing?
 Soon the oppressive August heat lifted, and I welcomed the relative cool of September. With it came a sense of urgency I hadn't felt all summer. I threw on my suit and heels and, resume in hand, aggressively pursued jobs.
 Craig found steady work moving refrigerators. I found administrative work. I'd convinced myself that jobs would jump-start our lives together. We'd save money, stop running around, start thinking about the future. No more lazy days of reading to each other on other people's couches. No more midafternoon movies or sleepless nights of listening to music and making out and drinking wine. It was time to get back to the ''real'' lives we'd been taking a break from. But we'd never known each other in this ''real'' world. 
 With schedules and bedtimes we soon saw less of each other. Quick phone calls replaced our entangled marathon days. One night we had drinks in a hotel bar: not beer or cheap wine, but concoctions with egg whites and orange rinds and freshly grated ginger. 
 ''I can get used to this,'' I said, although I felt as if we were playing dress-up. 
 We were exposed to different sides of each other. I was surprised by Craig's passivity, the shy manner in which he requested hot sauce at a restaurant for fear of annoying the busy staff. 
 ''Look,'' I said. Then to the waitress: ''Can we have some hot sauce? Whenever you get a chance.'' And the hot sauce came.
 OF course it wasn't about the hot sauce, but his seeming inability to ask for what he wanted. I could hear myself, irritated, impatient. He could hear it, too. 
 ''Why are you so quick to judge?'' he asked.
 ''Quick to judge?''
 ''Hard on everyone.''
 ''Hard on you?'' I asked.
 ''Maybe if you weren't so hard on yourself you wouldn't be so hard on others,'' he said.
 ''You think I'm critical?''
 ''Yes.''
 ''How long have you felt this way?'' I asked.
 ''All along, I guess.''
 ''Why didn't you say something, Craig?''
 ''It wasn't clear.''
 What was clear: that we had little experience with the everyday issues that come up in relationships. We began to see each other with the distance and perspective we didn't have over the summer. Slowly he withdrew. Then I did. 
 In the months that followed, I missed the beautiful childlike state we'd managed to exist in, how as a couple we had succeeded -- if just for six months -- in stopping life's traffic and receding from the world. But we needed the recession to fuel our romance. We weren't prepared for the recovery.

HEADLINE: Driving Shifts Into Reverse

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
Economists have long studied the relationship between driving habits and gasoline prices. Low gas prices can bring periods of profligate driving, and a quick jump in prices can cause many vehicles to languish in garages. 
 Until recently, Americans have driven more each year than the previous one, with a few brief exceptions. In 1956, Americans of driving age drove about 4,000 miles a year, on average. Fifty years later, that figure had climbed above 10,000.
 But the latest recession has caused some big changes. High unemployment meant that fewer people were driving to work, and a slump in consumer spending meant that less freight needed to be moved around the country. As gas prices soared in 2005, the number of miles driven - including commercial and personal - began to fall, and continued to drop after 2008 even as gasoline became cheaper.
 ''People were surprised by the very rapid rise in gas prices, and they changed their driving behavior,'' said Kenneth A. Small, a transportation economist at the University of California, Irvine. ''But my suspicion is that it is temporary. As soon as unemployment gets back to pre-recession levels, we will see Americans doing a lot more driving again.

 GIVEN that German blood flows through the veins of British royalty, it is perhaps fitting that the most blue-blooded of English motorcar companies, Rolls-Royce, has produced an offspring that carries a healthy dose of Bavarian DNA.
 To be specific, the latest model, the Ghost, is a BMW at its core. As was the case three centuries ago when England turned to Hanover to fill its throne, the cross-cultural pollination stemmed from practical considerations. Why shouldn't practicality apply to a Rolls-Royce? 
 The Teutonic underpinnings make sound economic sense. By adopting the long-wheelbase platform of the existing BMW 760Li, and the company's big V-12 engine, Rolls-Royce engineers and designers preserved the resources to tailor a fine bespoke British suit to clothe the German muscle underneath.
 Pedigrees are overrated in any case. The Bentley Continental GT and Flying Spur, both fine cars, are essentially rebodied Volkswagen Phaetons that share components with Audis. Among luxury automakers of the 21st century, sharing is caring. Get used to it. 
 After BMW acquired the Rolls-Royce name -- and little else -- some seven years ago, it developed the Ghost's two predecessors essentially from scratch. Those cars, the Phantom and the Drophead Coupe, have proved quite successful. Perhaps BMW's surprisingly uncanny sense of what constitutes British-ness can be traced to having done most of the development work on the third-generation Range Rover (2002-present) and its clever, campy revival of the Mini Cooper.
 With the Ghost, the challenge was no less tricky, and the importance of getting it right was never more essential. The brand would have a difficult time remaining profitable if it relied only on its loyal but tiny cadre of customers. What the company needed was a car with broader appeal, greater versatility and a less daunting price. Yes, Rolls-Royce needed a daily driver.
 ''The Ghost is meant to offer our customers a vehicle that can be used in a wider range of driving situations,'' Paul Ferraiolo, the company's president for North America, said recently. 
 Many Rolls-Royce owners are not, in fact, drivers. Mr. Ferraiolo said he was surprised, at a recent driving clinic for prospective buyers, to hear from one enthusiastic Phantom owner that ''17 miles was the farthest the man had driven himself in the last seven years.'' Clearly, this is a demographic few automakers would pursue. 
 The Ghost's base sticker price of $245,000 may be a bit more palatable to today's diet-conscious luxury tastes than the Phantom's sobering $380,000 price tag -- or the Drophead Coupe at (gulp!) $433,000. Options alone for those larger models can easily add the equivalent of an Audi A8 to the final tab.
 The Ghost can be tarted up as well. Indeed, ticking every box on the order form will push the drive-it-away price close to $320,000.
 If a court-appointed special master has cut your corporate bonus, perhaps you could do without the back-seat coolbox, the rear privacy curtains, the leather headliner, the folding rear picnic tables and the lambswool ''footmats.'' 
 There, you've just saved $16,000. 
 But would you really want to scrimp on the $5,000 Silver Satin Bonnet? This contrasting hood, in a brushed metallic finish, fairly screams ''Rolls-Royce.'' It coordinates well with the Ghost's mold-breaking grille, which adds an aerodynamic curve to the traditional Parthenon-inspired shape that has always been a Rolls-Royce signature.
 Still, passers-by in Southern California had little trouble recognizing the Ghost as a ''Royce'' (only the unwashed would call it a Roller). Most motorists seemed gracious about yielding the right-of-way, which came as something of a surprise. Only a short time before, in the same general area, I had sampled the charms of a Bentley Continental Supersports to a less favorable reception.
 Other motorists seemed to take great delight in short-braking that uber-Bentley while saluting me with up-raised digits and hurled insults. One irate Ford pickup driver kept pace for nearly a quarter-mile in an almost incoherent rage. I was finally able to make out the epithet he was shouting: ''Banker!'' Worse, perhaps, was my test drive of a Maybach 57 some time back, a period during which I and the car were utterly ignored. Who wants to spend $400,000 to drive in the kind of quiet anonymity you can get in an upscale Japanese sedan?
 The Ghost is an abbreviation of one of the great names in the marque's history, the Silver Ghost that made its debut in 1906. Autocar called that model the ''best car in the world.'' The new Ghost seems to occupy the pinnacle of an emerging class of six-figure luxury sedans, above the Bentley Flying Spur and new entries like the Aston Martin Rapide and the Porsche Panamera.
 The Ghost certainly cruises with the gravitas you'd expect, given its curb weight of nearly 5,500 pounds, about the same as a Range Rover Sport (but a bit less than a Bentley Flying Spur). Yet it sprints from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in less than five seconds. 
 The silky-smooth twin-turbo V-12 deserves the credit. The new engine is related to the BMW 760Li's, though displacement is larger (6.6 liters instead of 6.0) and the output is higher: 563 horsepower and 575 pound-feet of torque. 
 One presumes that customers will not blink at a $1,700 gas-guzzler charge, the penalty for a mileage rating of 13 in town, 20 on the highway. 
 When prompted, the engine, mated to an 8-speed ZF automatic transmission, delivers power in measured but explosive bursts. You cannot hear it, however. While the Phantom is engineered to ''waft'' over the road, the Ghost is set up to devour the pavement in silence.
 Just enough sensation is dialed into the suspension to keep the ride from being numb. The steering, linear and properly weighted, takes barely three turns lock to lock. The Ghost tracks straight and true, and the adaptive air suspension is mostly unflappable, adapting well even to cratered pavement. Hustled around mountain roads, the Ghost feels almost sporty.
 The weakest links here are the optional 20-inch Goodyear run-flat tires, which can contribute a bit too much tread noise on certain surfaces.
 The cabin is otherwise library quiet. The biggest surprise is the degree of driver engagement; this is the first Rolls-Royce I've driven that is actually fun to operate. Especially entertaining are digital-age controls like the sensor bar, along which you slide a finger for access to menus for the climate control, stereo and navigation system. Ergonomically, the Ghost's cockpit is not overly complicated, despite a few tricky, transplanted BMW controls like a version of the iDrive system. 
 There are other high-tech gadgets like a night-vision system and heads-up display. (It projects the speed and other information on the windshield). But most of the BMW content (20 percent of the car, the company says) resides out of sight: inside systems like the air-conditioning, the electrical architecture and the powertrain components.
 Because of Rolls-Royce necessities such as thronelike front seating, reverse-opening rear doors, a distinctive suspension and the large wheels and tires, the long-wheelbase 7 Series platform has been extensively re-engineered. A subtly sculptured body gives the Ghost a dynamic, almost athletic stance, especially compared with the monumental presence of the Phantom.
 My test car, in an unusual shade of sable -- one of 12 hand-rubbed paint colors initially available -- exuded the rich luster of a mink coat. Inside, eight hues of hand-stitched leather and five hardwoods are offered. A ''bespoke'' department, able to fulfill the most fanciful custom orders, will offer more variety later this year.
 Still, those choices seemed more than adequate -- for now -- to mollify even the most persnickety ''ultra-high-net-worth individuals,'' to borrow a term that purveyors of very costly automobiles use to describe their customers. Initial reaction to the Ghost seems positive, although the sales forecast is quite modest.
 Early in its development, the Ghost was nicknamed the ''baby Rolls.'' And while it is indeed smaller in scale than the grandiose Phantom (13 inches shorter, 3.5 inches lower), the Ghost is no compact car. It is actually longer than most of the standard Rolls-Royces built since World War II.Still, the introduction of a new Rolls-Royce is enough of a rarity to be an occasion. Since 1904, when the first car was made, fewer than 30 distinct models have worn the interlocking RR badge. So despite its full figure, the Ghost is in that regard Rolls-Royce's baby. 
 Company executives note that the Ghost has only the fourth new chassis and fourth new engine the brand has introduced over the last half-century. Expectations are high for this new heir to the famous name; the continuation of the blood line will depend heavily on its success.

HEADLINE: 'Here Comes Willis!'

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
Welcome, graying fans of the quote-unquote Old Knicks, to our 40th anniversary week, the celebration of our greatest and guiltiest sports pleasure. Four decades ago, while the city and country convulsed with war protests and violence, we were obsessed with the pursuit of New York's first professional basketball championship. 
 Payback is a teenager. Raise your hand if you now have one who makes you want to scream, ''When was the last time you read or watched something other than sports?'' (Communal answers: Harry Potter, a Facebook thread, a formulaic movie with the cast of ''Superbad.'') 
 But this week is as good as any to hum the tune of ''My Back Pages,'' to embrace the spirit of youthful preoccupation. For on the very day helmeted construction workers beat on war protesters in the canyons of Manhattan's financial district -- and just four days after the shooting deaths of four Kent State University students by National Guardsmen -- all we, as hard-core Knicks fans, wanted to hear about was the condition of Willis Reed's hip for Game 7.
 President Richard M. Nixon took to the airwaves on the night of May 8, 1970, to defend the movement of American troops into Cambodia and to promise that the incursion would shorten the Vietnam War. In New York, the speech brought small solace compared with the more concise declaration by the Knicks' radio voice, Marv Albert, who told his considerable audience a few minutes after 7:30, ''Here comes Willis!''
 Reed had torn a muscle in his right hip early in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals against the Los Angeles Lakers -- which was played at Madison Square Garden hours after the Kent State shootings. Without their center and captain, the Knicks rallied to win and take a 3-2 series lead. After sitting out Game 6, which the Lakers won to even the series, Reed made his famous solo and stiff-legged walk from the tunnel to join his teammates and jump center against Wilt Chamberlain, spreading immeasurable joy around the city. 
 In the context of the week's horrific news, how do we explain to our children that a basketball game meant so much? We don't have to. They get it. With two wars being fought and unemployment at or near double digits, young and old settled in front of the television to watch multimillionaires pile on top of one another last fall after the Yankees won the World Series. 
 Again and again, sports history repeats itself and all we learn from it is that each seminal event creates its own dimensional space and a viewing experience that is more futuristic than the last. 
 This being the era of television entitlement, what today's young fan would find unacceptable and utterly preposterous about 1970 is that there was no free network access to Game 7 in the home-team market. The Knicks' 113-99 victory was tape-delayed in the New York City area, per an agreement that ABC had with the N.B.A. 
 Hence, most of us only heard of Reed's classic appearance and his two early jump shots that fueled the rout. I recently spoke to some old friends about that splendid Friday night. With one exception -- a guy whose cousin lived on the East Side and had early cable -- those memories all centered on a radio, like early 20th-century snapshots.
 In a living room with a father and a brother; in a basement with lights dimmed and a couple of carefully rolled marijuana joints; in a Chinese restaurant during a family dinner out with a transistor pressed to an ear. One poor sap was afraid to break a date with his girlfriend but escaped to the popcorn stand to press the attendant for a first-half score. 
 I was a high school senior, nine days from my 18th birthday and too nervous to risk some infuriating family interruption. I went across the street to the grocery store, bought a bag of chips and a bottle of Royal Crown Cola and locked myself in my 1961 Mercury Comet -- purchased for me by my father the previous summer for $500 and parked in the lot of our Staten Island housing development.
 My tactical mistake was refusing to waste the little gas I had -- as usual -- in my tank. I didn't start the engine and the battery died just before halftime. Fortunately, by that point, the Lakers had more or less expired, as well, trailing, 69-42. 
 Much later that night, after Walt Frazier had taken the baton from Reed and fashioned one of the great title-clinching performances, 36 points and 19 assists, I settled in to watch the replay. Shorn of tension, the telecast was enjoyable. But given a chance to relive the night, I wouldn't think of trading Albert's vivid play-by-play for the ABC team of Chris Schenkel, Jack Twyman and Howard Cosell.
 Nor would I want 24-hour ''SportsCenter'' and talk radio providing Reed injury updates every 20 minutes for the 48 hours between Games 6 and 7. I wouldn't want reporters tweeting sourced news bites from the Garden corridors. Less was more. Ignorance begat bliss. I would want that historic night to remain as it was: me in my car with Marv, except with a full tank of gas.

HEADLINE: How to Fix the Cancer Trials Program

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Faltering Cancer Trials'' (editorial, April 25):
 It is clear that the National Cancer Institute's clinical cancer research program is in urgent need of repair. The institute and the cooperative research groups it finances are taking action to address costly inefficiencies and burdensome regulations, but they cannot do it alone. Equally important is the need to reverse the systematic underfinancing of the program.
 Virtually every important scientific advance in cancer prevention, treatment and quality of life in the last half-century has come from the N.C.I.'s cooperative group program. Yet the program receives less than 5 percent of N.C.I.'s budget. Adjusted for inflation, it actually receives less financing than it did a decade ago. 
 A recent survey by our organization found that because of inadequate financing, one-third of research centers plan to limit their participation in these trials. And 40 percent of those centers plan to increase their participation in better-financed industry trials, which may be less likely to examine the big, important questions in cancer research.
 We support rapid implementation of the Institute of Medicine's recent recommendations to improve the system and urge the N.C.I. to double financing for the cooperative group program within five years. This will require not only an internal reallocation of resources within the N.C.I., but also an infusion of new dollars to support the program.
 Fixing the crown jewel of the nation's cancer research system is essential to ensuring continued progress against cancer.
 Douglas W. Blayney Allen S. Lichter Alexandria, Va., April 27, 2010
 The writers, both doctors, are president and chief executive, respectively, of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial correctly calls attention to the underfinanced and often unfinished trials of the cooperative groups financed by the National Cancer Institute. But you do not mention that industry-sponsored trials, performed in collaboration with academic health centers, represent a much larger segment of the cancer drug evaluation effort, and are thriving.
 The rapid growth of the biotechnology industry has produced more than 800 new drugs for cancer currently in clinical trials, with positive results in melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer and other tumors. The N.C.I.-sponsored trials, while important in refining the use of new and established cancer drugs, are no longer the dominant vehicle for cancer drug development.
 The point remains that N.C.I. should make maximal use of the cooperative group program, but it is no longer the exclusive route to drug development.
 Bruce Chabner Boston, April 27, 2010
 The writer, a doctor, is director of clinical research at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center.
 To the Editor:
 As a clinical investigator for more than 20 years, I have personally experienced the successes and frustrations associated with the publicly financed clinical trials system.
 It is well recognized that clinical trials are critical to improving cancer care. But an important point not mentioned in your editorial is that cancer patient participation in clinical trials is abysmally low. In fact, only a small percentage of all adult cancer patients takes part in clinical trials. This low participation rate comes at a time when scientific discoveries and technologies are providing the opportunity to test an unprecedented number of promising new treatments.
 There are many reasons for this low participation rate. As you note, operational inefficiencies in the nation's clinical trials infrastructure and inadequate financial support for clinical investigation are certainly partly to blame. But as a society we have done a poor job emphasizing the importance of clinical research as an integral component of high-quality cancer care.
 Taking part in a clinical trial offers the opportunity to advance cancer treatment, while gaining access to the latest innovations under the careful watch of an infrastructure designed to ensure patient safety. It is time that we take note of the marketing skills that have contributed to the adoption of so many unhealthy behaviors (smoking, fast food), and apply them to a more healthful goal: widespread recognition that cancer clinical trials represent the best treatments we have to offer.
 Neal J. Meropol Cleveland, April 27, 2010
 The writer is chief, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospitals Ireland Cancer Center at Case Western Reserve University.
 To the Editor:
 Research financed by the National Cancer Institute continues to fail because it is locked into one fruitless approach: detailed study of the tumor process that afflicts patients with cancer. This ignores a critical area.
 The immune system is our most powerful protection against cancer. Without its ability to handle carcinogenic cells, mankind would not be around today. Yet research on how to strengthen deficient immune responses is seldom reported -- and medications that safely strengthen immunity do exist.
 Consider this hypothetical: In a city police department, all members are given total protection using special bulletproof vests, yet each year several police officers die of bullet wounds anyway. Why should the police research the steps involved in how one dies of a bullet wound? Wouldn't it be more productive to examine the bulletproof vests and learn how to correct the deficient ones?
 David Gluck New York, April 26, 2010
 The writer, a retired internist, maintains a Web site that calls attention to the medical importance of existing generic medication that strengthens immunity.

HEADLINE: Who Knew Bankruptcy Paid So Well?

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
MORE than $263,000 for photocopies in four months. Over $2,100 in limousine rides by one partner in one month. And $48 just to leave a message. Explanations for these charges? Priceless.
 The lawyers, accountants and restructuring experts overseeing the remains of Lehman Brothers have already racked up more than $730 million in fees and expenses, with no end in sight. Anyone wondering why total fees doled out in the Lehman bankruptcy alone could easily touch the $1 billion mark merely has to look at the bills buried among the blizzard of court documents filed in the case.
 They're a Baedeker to the continuing bankruptcy bonanza, a world where the meter is always running -- sometimes literally: in the months after Lehman's collapse in September 2008, the New York law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges paid one car-service company alone more than $500 a day as limo drivers cooled their heels waiting for meetings to break (and this in a city overflowing with taxis).
 While most of corporate America may be just emerging from the Great Recession, bankruptcy specialists have spent the last two years enjoying an unprecedented boom. Ten of the 20 largest corporate bankruptcies in recent decades have occurred over the last three years, according to BankruptcyData.com, with Lehman snaring honors as the biggest corporate belly-flop in American history. 
 These megacases -- Lehman, General Motors, Chrysler and Washington Mutual, to name a few -- are orders of magnitude larger than most bankruptcies in the past, and their size and complexity have created a feeding frenzy of sorts for those asked to sort them out. To date, Weil, the lead law firm representing Lehman, has billed the Lehman estate for more than $164 million.
 Analysts, lawyers and others involved in the larger bankruptcy boom say that some fees are legitimate -- and that others are, at a minimum, highly questionable.
 ''There's clearly pressure on people to create more revenue,'' says Robert White, a former bankruptcy partner at O'Melveny & Myers who retired in 2006 after practicing for 35 years. At one deposition he attended last year, each law firm sent two or three lawyers when one would have sufficed. ''They were just sitting there on their BlackBerrys and talking to other people,'' he said.
 With first- and second-year associates charging more than $500 an hour in some of these bankruptcy cases, according to court records, that can amount to some pretty expensive downtime. At several firms, including Weil and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, partners now charge $1,000 an hour or more for their bankruptcy services. 
 But billable hours explain only part of the run-up in costs. In the seven months after the bankruptcy filing of G.M., which taxpayer dollars helped keep afloat, various law firms and other advisers received nearly $90 million. Lawyers from Weil, which has accounted for nearly $16 million of fees in that case, put in for $364.14 in dry cleaning as well as more than a week at the Sherry-Netherland hotel in Manhattan last summer, where one lawyer's room cost $685 a night. 
 In court documents, the firm responded that it could be tough to find hotel rooms in New York City for $400 or less and that dry-cleaning or laundry bills were appropriate for out-of-town lawyers required to stay in New York for 9 or 10 days. 
 THINK the lawyers are expensive? Meet the consultants. Alvarez & Marsal, a turnaround firm that is essentially running what remains of Lehman, has billed more than $262.1 million. 
 No charges have been too big, or too small. The Huron Consulting Group, a management consultancy involved in Lehman, charged $2.54 for ''gum in airport.'' In the G.M. case, Brownfield Partners has billed $230,209.55, including an $18 fitness-club charge at a hotel.
 A Brownfield partner said an employee didn't realize that there was a separate charge to use the fitness club and didn't notice it on the hotel bill. The firm agreed to remove the charge after the examiner brought it to the firm's attention.
 Analysts say that nickel-and-diming might be worth a laugh or two -- if some of the larger fees weren't snowballing so quickly as well. They say these bounteous fees reduce the money left for creditors in the bankruptcy cases. In the Lehman case, some unsecured creditors, including bondholders, banks and vendors, are likely to get just 14.7 cents on the dollar for their claims, according to Lehman's proposed reorganization plan. Nor will they get their money quickly -- some experts say they believe that the Lehman case could drag on for three to five more years.
 Lawyers and restructuring pros who are picking up the pieces of companies swamped by the bankruptcy wave say that their fees are well deserved and that their services help make the bankruptcy process more efficient. And they say the pay is more than made up for by a tidier resolution of a financial debacle -- or, as in G.M.'s case, the revivification of a wounded company.
 ''The legal skill we used to sell Lehman's North American capital markets business to Barclays saved 10,000 jobs and preserved the business itself, capturing value that otherwise would have been lost,'' said Harvey Miller, 77, a Weil partner who is considered the dean of the bankruptcy bar. 
 Many people in the industry agree that Lehman, in particular, is a huge case that tests even the most experienced lawyers. ''Lehman is a sufficiently complicated company that it would be safe to assume that if it weren't for equally sophisticated professionals running the Chapter 11 case, that the creditors would essentially receive nothing,'' says Stephen J. Lubben, a professor at the Seton Hall University School of Law. ''In those situations, it makes sense for sophisticated professionals to handle the case.''
 Others, however, have a distinctly different perception about the fees that advisers are harvesting in bankruptcies.
 ''It violates any sense of proportion,'' says Kenneth Feinberg, the Washington lawyer who serves as the ''pay czar'' for banks bailed out by the government and whom the court appointed last June to monitor fees associated with the Lehman bankruptcy. The court asked him to participate after concerns were raised in the news media about the soaring fees in the Lehman case.
 ''Unemployment is over 9 percent, and to be paying first-year associates $500 an hour angers the public,'' he observes. ''People read about all of this and say that lawyers and the legal system are one more example of Wall Street out of control.''
 Despite the rise in bankruptcy fees over the years, there was little or no public criticism or pushback until recently. Lawyers were reluctant to challenge their peers, fearing retaliation. Analysts say watchdogs from the United States Trustee's office, a part of the Justice Department that oversees bankruptcy cases and monitors billing practices and possible conflicts, were overworked and outgunned. Even as its workload has increased, the Trustee's office has seen its staffing fall to 1,323 in 2010 from 1,468 in 2007. 
 Meanwhile, judges, many of whom used to work at the firms now benefiting from the bankruptcy boom, were also reluctant to challenge the status quo. All of this, analysts say, has fed a legal culture with few restraints on billing for bankruptcies. 
 ''I don't think professionals cheat the client, but in a number of ways they can talk themselves into doing things that they wouldn't do for clients outside of bankruptcy,'' says Nancy B. Rapoport, a former bankruptcy lawyer at Morrison & Foerster who teaches law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ''If you send eight people to a hearing because there is an outside chance they might have to speak at that hearing and you try that outside of bankruptcy the client will go ballistic.''
 Now, however, a handful of fee examiners in several high-profile bankruptcies are taking a harder line on such charges, setting the stage for a confrontation with lawyers and consultants opposed to the moves. Both Mr. Feinberg and the examiner in the G.M. case, Brady C. Williamson, for instance, have suggested reductions in hourly fees charged by some firms.
 That's the kind of precedent that sets some of the bankruptcy industry leaders' teeth on edge. ''Mr. Feinberg doesn't know what he's talking about,'' says Mr. Miller. ''We don't generally give discounts. Just because bankruptcy has been the hot legal area for the last 19 months doesn't demand you cut fees.''
 If Mr. Feinberg and others succeed in reining in certain fees and expenses, the outcome could reverberate through the bankruptcy universe.
 ''This is a very important test case; it's bigger than just Lehman,'' observes Mr. Feinberg. ''The culture of bankruptcy is unique.''
 So what, asks Bryan Marsal, co-founder of the restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal. ''I don't care whether Feinberg or Moses comes into this case, you're not going to get me to apologize,'' he says. ''If you look at this case in the context of the billions of dollars that has been recovered and the billions of dollars in claims that have been managed, just because the case was big doesn't mean it was operated inefficiently.'' 
 ON the evening of Sunday, Sept. 14, 2008, Mr. Marsal was sitting in his study in Westchester County, N.Y., when the phone rang.
 Calling was Mark Shapiro, who ran Lehman's restructuring practice. He told him that Lehman's lawyers were preparing a bankruptcy filing and that the board wanted Mr. Marsal's firm to oversee the bankruptcy and eventual liquidation after Barclays and others bought pieces of the firm. 
 Since receiving that call, Mr. Marsal's firm has been billing $13 million to $18 million a month in fees and expenses for its work on Lehman, a 160-year-old name on Wall Street. 
 Mr. Marsal says the firm will most likely bill at $13 million a month through October, just after the second anniversary of Lehman's collapse. After that, rates will begin to decrease, although Alvarez & Marsal will also earn an incentive fee at the end of the case, which could total more than $50 million. 
 A jovial, self-deprecating man who points out a coffee stain on his shirt and, later, jokes that he wants to put on a blazer to hide a rotund midsection, Mr. Marsal is unapologetic about the fees that he and his staff are earning. Those fees pay for the salaries of the 150 people from Alvarez & Marsal now working inside Lehman (down from a peak of 185), including Mr. Marsal himself. He serves as Lehman's C.E.O., while John Suckow, an Alvarez & Marsal managing director, is Lehman's president and chief operating officer.
 ''The size of this case justifies the size of the fees,'' says Mr. Marsal, shrugging as he sits in a conference room at Lehman's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Marsal and Mr. Suckow estimate that they have increased the potential recovery value for Lehman creditors by $4 billion to $5 billion in the last year.
 Indeed, deciding whether these firms and their sky-high fees are justified is difficult because the bankruptcy trade is in uncharted territory. Several of the companies that went bankrupt in the last two years were significantly bigger than Enron, in terms of assets, when it collapsed in late 2001. 
 As if the magnitude of the bankruptcies weren't enough, there's also the matter of the complex financial instruments that some of the companies held. 
 ''There was commercial real estate, bank loans -- all of that stuff is pretty well known to our team, but derivatives? We hadn't had much experience in derivatives,'' acknowledges Mr. Marsal, who added that his firm hired two subcontractors to work through Lehman's derivatives book.
 Mr. Miller adds that those derivatives, even today, are taking up a lot of time and energy. ''We're still in the process of unwinding them,'' he says, ''which raises all sorts of difficult and novel legal issues.'' 
 In April, Lehman filed a plan with the court that would create an asset-management business, called Lamco, that would manage Lehman's real estate and private-equity assets for five years.
 By not selling some assets at fire-sale prices, the estate will be able to recoup much more money for creditors, notes Mr. Marsal.
 ''The money that's going to the creditors is my money,'' he says, pointing out that he's aligned with the creditors' goals. That's because, at the end of the case, Mr. Marsal's firm will receive an incentive fee that is based on a percentage of the money returned to creditors. 
 Mr. Marsal says critics should be careful about identifying where problems lurk in bankruptcy fees. He says the savings that result from making sure that no one is flying first class to Europe are ''peanuts.'' 
 ''You should be much more worried about the two or three lawyers who are overbilling and whether they should even be in attendance at a meeting,'' he says. ''I think the fee committee and the fee examiner is a lot of hooey.''
 IF anyone is a master of getting to yes, it's Kenneth Feinberg. As a mediator, he brokered settlements in long-running product liability suits brought by those who said they were victimized by Agent Orange, asbestos and the Dalkon Shield. More recently, he managed to win praise on delicate assignments like determining how much the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund should pay out -- or what is an appropriate salary for an executive at a financial institution that the government propped up with taxpayer funds.
 But he says that challenging bankruptcy lawyers is tougher in some ways. ''In the 9/11 case, the country was behind me; as pay czar, there was a lot of support for what I was doing,'' he says. ''This is more problematic.''
 In particular, Mr. Feinberg is perplexed by why fees keep rising in the Lehman case, even though it's no longer the chaotic affair it was in the weeks and months after the bankruptcy filing. ''Now the emergency is over; it is more like a traditional bankruptcy,'' he says. ''Yet the fees are higher than ever.'' 
 Mr. Feinberg has managed to get under the skin of the lawyers in the case. And he is equally frustrated. His voice rising and Boston accent thickening (think ''debt-ah'' and ''credit-ah''), he says that bankruptcy professionals ''still haven't gotten the message.''
 The four-member Lehman fee committee, of which Mr. Feinberg is chairman, has disagreed about how to rein in fees, he says. But he declines to elaborate. Mr. Miller says it's because creditors and debtors are willing to pay well so they can get ''the best representation possible.''
 On a rainy summer day last year, Mr. Feinberg journeyed to the plush offices of Mr. Miller in the General Motors building in Manhattan. His pitch was simple: Cut 10 percent to 15 percent right off the top of the fees being billed.
 Mr. Miller and Dennis Dunne, a partner at Milbank who represents creditors, told him, ''You don't know how complicated this is; you don't know how difficult it is,'' Mr. Feinberg recalls.
 Mr. Miller doesn't dispute Mr. Feinberg's account, and Mr. Dunne declined to comment for this article.
 Despite these frictions, a deal was eventually struck. 
 Among the new fee rules being enforced are these: Air travel must be in coach class only. Ground transportation is limited to $100 a day, and only after 8 p.m. Hotel rooms are capped at $500 a night. Photocopy charges are limited to 10 cents a page. Late meals can't be more than $20 each.
 ''If you continue to violate the very guidelines that are in place, 50 percent of the disputed amounts will be deducted,'' says Mr. Feinberg. After that, the full amount will automatically be deducted, he added. 
 The lawyers reserve the right to challenge the fee committee's decisions at the end of the case, but the ultimate call will be up to the bankruptcy judge, James Peck. He declined to comment. 
 Mr. Feinberg has so far challenged a very small percentage of the fees and expenses in the case. But he is intensifying his efforts. In March, the court increased his monthly budget to $250,000 from $75,000, giving Mr. Feinberg more accountants, examiners and others to pore over records and to zap overcharges. His firm and the fee committee have billed the Lehman estate $645,000 in fees for services through March.
 Already, he's called out Jones, Day, saying it charged $70,800 extra for photocopying and spent $2,856 too much on taxi rides last summer. According to court filings, a Jones, Day partner, William Hine, claimed more than $2,100 for late-night rides home in one month. Milbank, according to court filings, charged $148,426 just to compile its bills and time records -- a move akin to a doctor charging a patient to prepare a bill after expensive, complex surgery.
 ''Lawyers don't charge for invoice preparation except in bankruptcy,'' Mr. Feinberg says. ''I've prepared bills my entire professional life. You don't charge a fee. Most people would argue that charging anything is inappropriate.'' 
 Jones, Day and Milbank both declined to comment.
 Like the restructuring executives, bankruptcy lawyers seem defiant and want to make sure precedents aren't set that would make it easier to curb fees in the future.
 ''When people work late and they want to go home, we don't like to send people in the subway at midnight or thereafter,'' Mr. Miller says. ''I don't believe it's appropriate to require people to fly coach for 15 hours and then go to a meeting.''
 Nevertheless, Mr. Miller is going along with Mr. Feinberg's guidelines. 
 ''Those are the rules; we're going to abide by the rules and pick up the difference,'' Mr. Miller says. 
 FOR all his annoyance at Mr. Feinberg's role in the Lehman case, Mr. Miller saves his real vitriol for Mr. Williamson, the fee examiner in the G.M. bankruptcy, which Weil also worked on. In the case's first seven months, Weil accounted for $16.5 million of the $90 million in fees paid. Mr. Williamson objected to a small portion of the expenses. Weil, according to court documents, agreed to deduct $500 in expenses relating to the cancellation of a vacation, and said that any first-class travel charges were included ''inadvertently'' and reduced. It also agreed to pay for any meals in excess of $20.
 Mr. Williamson also recommended that a 5 percent cut in Weil's overall rates would be ''appropriate,'' especially given that several other large firms in the case already provided discounts. 
 ''Williamson is way off base,'' says Mr. Miller. ''He perceives himself to be a sage, giving advice to the world, and that is not his role.''
 Mr. Williamson wrote in an e-mail message: ''Courts appoint independent examiners to help ensure transparency and accountability, most recently where tax dollars and significant economic issues are at stake. Not everyone, unfortunately, always appreciates either the role or the rules the examiner is bound to apply.''
 Mr. Miller sees his own work as a battle between corporate life and death, with the money spent on photocopies and dry cleaning an insignificant detail.
 ''If you had cancer and you were going into an operation, while you were lying on the table, would you look at the surgeon and say, 'I'd like a 10 percent discount,' '' he explains. ''This is not a public, charitable event.''

HEADLINE: After the Mob, Scraping By

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH FLORIDA
 A SATURDAY, 11 a.m. Seniors' hour at the diner. 
 An old man with a hearing aid butters his toast. Two Jamaican nurses help a woman with a walker through the door. An elderly mother and her daughter share a stack of pancakes, the mother guiding her fork past the oxygen tube in her nose.
 Sitting in one booth with his wife, the former acting boss of the Luchese crime family tucks into his $4 plate of scrambled eggs. He wears a pink Hawaiian shirt, a gold medallion, a brand-new pair of therapeutic sneakers. He is talking about the old days: everything he had, everything he lost.
 ''How much money?'' he asks, responding to the question with a question. 
 ''Awww, tons of money,'' he answers. ''It's hard to say how much.''
 This is Joe DeFede, a retired New York gangster who oversaw the rackets in the city's garment district in the 1990s, a perch that provided him with a Cadillac, a driver, three horses stabled at Aqueduct and a home entertainment system columned in the style of ancient Greece. Like many mobsters, he walked through life with dignity and pride and, usually, with several thousand dollars in his pocket. 
 These days, though, he walks with a faltering step of age and with the weight of financial worry. After a five-year prison stint, legal fees and the crushing costs of creating a new identity -- he entered but then left the witness protection program -- the boss is almost broke. He and his second wife, Nancy, live on an annual income they said was not much more than $30,000: Social Security, a modest annuity and her pension from 20 years of working in a bank.
 ''That's the fear we got,'' said Mr. DeFede, 76, a slight man with a bookmaker's grin who is known as Little Joe. ''We try to keep our payments up'' -- for the car, the house, a recent hip replacement -- ''but sometimes we can't hack it.''
 Or as Mrs. DeFede, 74, explained, ''We're just scraping by.''
 It might be hard to muster sympathy -- especially in the midst of a recession -- for a guy who once earned his living shaking down businesses and taking illegal bets, even if he served his sentence and testified at several federal trials that helped put his former Mafia colleagues behind bars. But there is no such thing as a Gangster I.R.A., so the DeFedes are living check to check (and under assumed names) on the hard edge of a sharp financial knife.
 They are hardly the first to struggle in their golden years when the years that went before were lived outside the law. Before the film ''American Gangster'' revived his finances, Frank Lucas, who earned -- then lost -- millions as a heroin dealer, was living in a public housing project in New Jersey. (He is now trying to start his own fashion line.) Henry Hill, a Luchese family associate whose story formed the basis for the movie ''Goodfellas,'' sells signed posters as well as his memoirs and cookbooks at the Web site goodfellahenry.com. 
 ''These people wind up as desperadoes in a sense,'' said Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote, among other things, the screenplay for ''Goodfellas.'' ''They come up with different schemes to survive without a 401(k). Don't forget, they were hustlers to begin with.'' 
 The DeFedes fit that mold: friendless, jobless and, faced with an uncertain future, living on their wits. Mrs. DeFede has sold jewelry -- a ruby necklace, an emerald bracelet -- to help support the household and has even written a book about her trials, ''Life With Little Joe.'' 
 It is a love story, sort of, opening with a startling scene of a young Mr. DeFede slapping her face. The manuscript encompasses their lives together: from obscurity to opulence, from the bulletproof vest she once found in her husband's closet to their nervous flight into the federal government's arms. While one might think a mob moll's tell-all would make for an easy sale, that has not been the case. Mrs. DeFede's agent spent an unsuccessful year shopping the book around. The couple still hopes the manuscript will provide them a nest egg. Publish or perish, Mafia style.
 Last year, Mrs. DeFede took a job as a cashier at a clothing store. It paid $7.50 an hour and required cleaning toilets. She lasted three days. 
 As for her husband, she is apt to say, ''There's not a lot of ads out there saying, 'Wanted: Ex-crime boss of a Mafia family. Ten years' experience required.' ''
 Not unlike their law-abiding counterparts, they are filled with rage and bitterness -- and violent apprehension -- at their economic prospects. Mr. DeFede is so suffused with anxiety he sleepwalks and, in that state, literally punches the walls. 
 ''Joe has fights in his sleep, cursing at some shadowy figure from the past,'' Mrs. DeFede wrote one evening, jotting down thoughts for a reporter. ''He has hit me several times during these episodes. Of course, he didn't mean to harm me, but after one really bad incident, I was trying to calm him down and I got punched in the face.''
 Mr. DeFede was nearing 70 when he got out of prison and discovered that a contract had been taken on his life. He was accused -- wrongly, he insists -- of stealing nearly a million dollars of Luchese family money. ''If I did what they said I did,'' he reasoned one night at the dismal bar of a chain restaurant, ''you think that I'd be here?''
 The DeFedes met in 1958 and married 12 years later, each with a divorce in the rear view. A couple of years ago, they settled here in a 55-and-older community-- they insisted its name be withheld for security reasons -- and have built a pleasant, albeit precarious, life. 
 Family is far away: Mrs. DeFede's son is in New York, in the throes of a recent divorce. Mr. DeFede's daughter is on Long Island, but visiting is difficult -- she lives with his former wife.
 They have grandchildren in San Diego but cannot afford the plane ticket. ''It's lonely living alone,'' said Mrs. DeFede, a classic tough cookie with an Irish-American wit. ''Holidays are the worst. You see other people with their families and it totally breaks your heart.''
 A few years ago, her oldest friend from Brooklyn moved into the neighborhood to be with her. But there was drinking, petty fights and eventually unkind words; part of the problem was the friend started dating a retired cop. The two have parted ways, potentially forever. How does one explain oneself to the neighbors, after all? 
 ''We don't have a life,'' Mrs. DeFede said.
 What they do have is each other. Mrs. DeFede carries her husband's glasses and double-checks his payments on the bar bill. Mr. DeFede cleans the gutters -- he did, at least, until his hip went bad. She makes suggestions of what he ought to order from the menu. He drives her to the beauty parlor and waits until she is done. She back-seat drives from the front seat of the car.
 When evening comes, they watch television together -- the History Channel, ''Divorce Court,'' ''Everybody Loves Raymond.'' Mr. DeFede plays solitaire. He visits the barbershop, not to have his hair cut, but for company. ''They're Cubans, so they don't speak too much English -- it's difficult,'' he said.
 One recent Saturday, they visited a flea market. Mr. DeFede pulled into a spot and hung his disabled parking permit from the mirror. He stepped outside and observed his front bumper, scratched like a scabbed shin. 
 ''Five years old,'' he said. ''I never drove a car five years old before.'' He put his hands together, palms up, and shook them back and forth in disbelief. ''Remember that song?'' he asked. '' 'If My Friends Could See Me Now'?''
 Inside the bazaar, Mrs. DeFede looked at several items she could not afford. A patterned blouse. A yellow purse. Shoes.
 ''You see what I've done to her?'' asked Mr. DeFede, looking on. ''You see this? She could've had anybody. Anybody. She ended up with me.''

HEADLINE: In Britain, Change You Can Bereave In

BYLINE: By A. A. GILL. 
A. A. Gill, a critic for the Sunday Times of London, is a contributing editor for Vanity Fair.

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
 ''WESTMINSTER, the mother of Parliaments,'' the candidates, commentators and columnists like to say, usually with an insouciant flourish toward Big Ben. It's such a trippingly familiar cliche, so Englishly replete with the hand-me-down vanity of tradition, the authority of history, the sonorous tic of convention. 
 It's also infuriatingly wrong. A dim misquotation. What John Bright, a radical Quaker politician, actually said in the election campaign of 1865 was, ''England is the mother of Parliaments.'' A very different proposition. Westminster is just one of Mother England's children, and now looks increasingly like an aged, intransigent delinquent, unfit for society or purpose. 
 When Americans come to London they usually say how much they love the history, the tradition, the splendid tumpty-tum of things whose very repetition has become their point. I think mostly they say it because they think the English like to hear it, and it's polite to compliment the odd customs of foreigners in their own homes. There is, though, something smugly comforting about the smoothness of conventions worn shiny with time; the sense that we do what our fathers did, that it is all O.K. because it has always been O.K. 
 Well, now it's not O.K. The conventions are strangling, suffocating and mugging us. They are inappropriate and incapable of accommodating events. The British election, which will be decided on Thursday, looks like the most destructive or creative -- depending on how big your house and your pension plan are -- since women got the vote in 1918. 
 Britain is chin-deep in the mire of the worst financial crisis for a generation, grasping at the straws of recovery, braced for the inevitable spending cuts and tax increases to pay off the gambling debts and avoid becoming the Greece of the North, albeit without the sleeveless T-shirts, mustaches and peasant break-dancing. We've already got the Elgin Marbles.
 Britain is fighting a mourned and resented war in Afghanistan, and the public service unions are winding up for a season of opportunistic strikes. The politicians are smeared with the shame of a scandal over personal expenses that has caused hangdog resignations and early retirements. They have never been held in greater contempt by the people who employ them. 
 And yet, this whole campaign has been dominated by Byzantine arguments about the process of politics. It's been monopolized by the politicians avoiding questions about their policies and finances as if they were being asked about their digestion. And we thought it was supposed to be all about the voters. Well, silly us. I have never covered an election in a democracy where candidates have been so reluctant to speak to the electorate through the press. 
 They have, however, spoken to -- or at least at -- one another. The high point, the big new idea of the campaign, has been the first American-style televised debates. Very American, seeing as the major-party leaders -- Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Labour, David Cameron of the Conservatives and Nick Clegg of the resurgent Liberal Democrats -- were allowed to pose and prose without the added confusion of any Scottish or Welsh candidates or those of smaller parties like the Greens and the assorted far-right xenophobes. 
 The debates have been seen not so much as breaking a tradition as starting a new one. They have been rigorously rehearsed and monitored: the audiences were forbidden to respond in any way, including clapping, sniggering or snoring. Still, they've added a dash of ''X Factor'' low entertainment. Voters who don't ''get'' politics do get Simon Cowell's version of democracy. 
 Even if we've remained uninformed, unenlightened and uninspired, we do like the fact that the leaders are so thoroughly humiliated by the spectacle of being judged on such minute and degrading qualities as their smiles, haircuts and sweatiness.
 In truth, humiliation came easily: these are not three of the most engaging or noble statesmen the nation has produced. Mr. Cameron, the Tory, is personable -- your mother would like him. A fresh-faced character who tries, and fails, with emotionally winning oratory. He always sounds like the coxswain urging the rowing team to pull together and straighten their straw boaters. 
 We look at Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat, and try in vain to imagine him going toe-to-toe with leaders like Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel or even the Queen of Tonga. In any other decade, the best he could have hoped for would have been a post as a junior minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, an ambassador's bag-carrier. He speaks five languages but can't say boo in any of them. His children all have Spanish names. 
 Gordon Brown is a character from a tragic opera, twisted by ambition and a Presbyterian sense of fateful destiny. He has waited 13 years, mostly in Tony Blair's shadow, for this poisoned chalice and has a pessimist's luck. He wrestles with an Old Testament temper, and it's said that he has no friends. Certainly, none of them have come out to contradict this. Last week he was recorded by an open microphone petulantly calling a respectable working-class woman he had just spoken to in the street a ''bigot.'' Off the record, his advisers say they are quite relieved -- it's usually so much worse.
 We can argue till we've turned blue, and have, about who ''won'' the debates, which concluded on Thursday. But the point is they've only emphasized that this election is not just between politicians, it's all about politicians. They changed nothing. 
 What has changed everything is the return of the Liberals. Like a soap opera character you thought was dead, they have shunted and shaken the binary nature of the ancient Parliament. All the talk is of coalition, but nobody knows how that's going to work, or even if it will work. Everything is up for grabs, and everyone's grabbing. 
 The childish building they do government in is designed for the tradition of back-and-forth, confrontational, two-party politics. But if nobody wins a straight majority, the Liberal Democrats will have to make an alliance with either the Labour government or the Conservative opposition. Their price will be that future elections will use a proportional representation system that closely matches the percentage of votes a party wins nationwide to its share of Parliament. It's a voting method popular in Europe and the newer sort of federated nations, but utterly alien to our ancient, hidebound, conventional system. 
 The one thing everyone knows for certain is that something needs to be done. We're in a fix, and we need something to fix it. We have, over centuries, arrived at a parliamentary system that is bad-tempered, deeply unfair and embarrassingly clumsy. For a start, the United Kingdom has more legislators than any country except China. The upper House of Lords has more than 700 peers -- not a single one of them elected, but more than 20 are bishops. The Labour government got rid of hundreds of hereditary Lords a decade ago, but the business has been left half-done.
 The Commons isn't much better; it has some 650 elected members. Everyone agrees that's too many. Members have little power or purpose -- they sit out their lives in tearooms, gossiping and making trouble. Two-thirds of them have seats that are so safe they barely need to turn up. 
 The nature of constituency boundaries heavily favors Labour. There is a doomsday prediction that Labour will come in third in the popular vote but will still have the most members elected, whereas the Liberals could come in second and yet have only a third as many seats as either Labour or the Tories. 
 And then there's members' pay, which needs to be re-evaluated realistically. The M.P.'s have consistently avoided giving themselves pay rises because it looks bad, but used their expense accounts as a bonus supplement. They are still expected to take a hands-on interest in their constituents' drains, potholes, traffic lights, arguments with the police and admissions to schools and hospitals, while they have no real power to do anything about any of it.
 It's a ridiculous amount of work, almost all of it pointless. The job description is one that Trollope would recognize if it were written down, which it's not, because it's all done by convention. The English don't have a written constitution, but rather a dusty stack of procedures and precedents, and everyone agrees that this needs changing. It's needed changing for 100 years. 
 Yet the worst possible way to start changing it would be precipitously, after an inconclusive election, on the heels of a global financial calamity when the markets are looking for stability and firm direction, and the voters need attention and hope. A lot of unsuccessful politicians competing in a scrabble of bribery and bullying for position is the worst option of all. 
 True, we may wake the day after the election to find the Conservatives have won outright, there will be no deal over proportional representation, and we can all breathe a sigh of relief. They're conservative: we won't have to change the traditions for another couple of hundred years. Should they win, it may mean that the electorate, for once, truly looked to the future, and recoiled in horror: proportional representation would mean that the Liberal Party could forever be the king-maker, and that every government for 1,000 years would be center-left. 
 ALL the tradition and history and precedent has left the most venerable and smug of parliaments in a parlous place. When you look at traditions closely, examine what they really are, you realize they're made up of layers and layers of deferrals, delays, indecisions, tomorrows and long lunches. Their very weight and awkwardness defy examination and smother change. They are the immovable object that sits with its back to the unstoppable force. 
 Other people's traditions look charming and decorative and exotic. They're nice places to visit on holiday, but you wouldn't want to live with one. They're like having a mad, invalid aunt in the attic. And while those of you with parliaments that make no claims to motherhood may smile with a certain self-satisfaction at the comeuppance of Westminster, be aware that the American system was also based on an adversarial two-party confrontation, borrowed from England. (At least, in place of tradition and convention, your founders added checks and balances.) 
 All too soon, the inertia of competing arguments can lead to a comfortable stasis. You find you do it this way because you've always done it this way, time flies and, before you know it, you've grown a tradition where there once was a view.

HEADLINE: Intimidation In Iran Keeps Protesters From Rally

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

 BODY:
A planned demonstration in which Iranian workers were to join reformists in an antigovernment protest failed to materialize on Saturday, apparently the result of intimidation and a large police presence.
 Two Iranian opposition leaders, Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, had called Thursday for workers and teachers to join the reformists in a broad-based coalition.
 The call went unheeded on Saturday, analysts said, largely because of government intimidation. 
 But the lack of action may also reflect a failure of the opposition leaders to win over workers and teachers, who have their own grievances, to the antigovernment cause. And it raised questions about the ability of the opposition to mobilize a mass protest planned for June 12, the anniversary of Iran's disputed presidential election.
 ''This was a strategic mistake for opposition leaders,'' said Mehdi Jalali, an Iran analyst in New York. ''They must first address the workers' demands and then expect them to join the movement. The leaders had not offered a plan, and people don't know why they should come to the streets and face brutality.'' 
 Across Tehran on Saturday, major intersections that had been filled with protesters last summer were filled instead with police officers in riot gear, witnesses said. Helicopters hovered over Azadi Square and Azadi Street, where the Ministry of Labor is located and workers had been expected to gather.
 ''There were groups of young men in military clothes at the corner of every alley standing next to black vans,'' said a Tehran resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The black vans are used by security forces to take protesters to detention centers. 
 In addition to the police presence, the government's recent moves to execute political dissidents may have scared off potential protesters. The Supreme Court upheld two death sentences last week while lower courts have ordered capital punishment for 11 protesters. Many demonstrators from earlier street protests remain in jail, and there have been reports of torture.
 An aide to Mr. Karroubi, however, said the government's clampdown indicated that it was the government that feared the protesters rather than the other way around.
 ''I don't think it matters if people stage a protest when the government takes extraordinary measures to put forces at every single corner in the capital,'' said the aide, Mojtaba Vahedi, who has been in exile in the United States since last summer. ''This shows that the government fears that without those forces there might be protests all over the capital. That is a demonstration of the dissent as well.''
 Workers had pledged to stage protests on Saturday, and teachers had said they would demonstrate on Teachers' Day on Sunday. Workers' and teachers' groups have often demonstrated on May 1, International Workers' Day, but apart from the reformists. 
 There were reports of protests in the cities of Qazvin, Shiraz and Tabriz on the opposition Web site Kaleme, but those reports could not be independently verified. A picture posted on several blogs showed a group of recently fired workers outside the governor's office of Shiraz holding a banner that said ''Congratulations on your unemployment.'' 
 Authorities had warned that they would prevent protests. The supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, cautioned workers in a meeting on Wednesday that they ''not to be used as a political leverage'' by ''the enemy.'' 
 Workers and teachers have long complained of low wages, lack of benefits and the effects of economic mismanagement on their lives. On the BBC Persian service on Saturday, workers called in during a live program to complain about lack of independent unions that could address their demands, like unemployment and inflation. 
 The official minimum wage is $300 a month, but those who called the BBC program on Saturday said the wage was too low.

HEADLINE: What the Walls Would Say

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
WITH the market for large older homes still slow and frail, a number of sellers are taking a more ''personal'' approach -- marketing a house's history right along with its physical attributes. 
 ''It is certainly more challenging to sell grand old homes in this kind of a market,'' said Sam Joseph, an agent at Re/Max Village Square in Montclair. ''But a juicy back story can always whip up buyer interest.''
 Mr. Joseph recently listed an 1870s Victorian set on a woodsy acre in the historic gated enclave of Llewellyn Park in West Orange. The house, known to locals as All Stairs, has five bedrooms and seven staircases on three floors -- because, as Mr. Joseph recounts in his promotional materials, it was owned long ago by sisters who had become estranged and wished to avoid passing each other in the halls. 
 ''The tale that has been passed down by the older residents of Llewellyn Park is that the sisters were interested in the same man when they were young, and became estranged over that,'' he said. ''Both sisters remained spinsters and continued to live together, but apparently they never spoke to each other again.'' 
 The current owners supplied a picture they found tucked away in the attic, which evidently depicts the sisters before hard feelings developed: two 1920s flapper girls, smiling brightly and kicking up their heels. ''That picture is a hoot,'' said Mr. Joseph, who listed All Stairs -- at 6 Edgehill Road -- for $839,000 last month. ''And everyone I tell the story about the sisters thinks it is hysterical; it makes people laugh, which is a good thing when selling a house.''
 In Montclair, a 1908 house by the architect Dudley Van Antwerp -- which has been owned by members of the same family since 1922 -- is on the market for $950,000. The current owner is Jean-Francis Perrot, whose grandfather, a banker, bought the 13-bedroom home at 205 Midland Avenue. The house is listed with Barbara Messenger of Coldwell Banker.
 But Ms. Messenger said Mr. Perrot was also effectively marketing the house himself, regaling visitors with tales of his family's history. ''Relationships were not always congenial'' in his house, either, according to Mr. Perrot, who described his grandmother, the doyenne of the manor until her death at 106, as ''fierce.''
 ''On the other hand, we had 13 bedrooms'' where people could retreat, he added with a laugh. 
 Mr. Perrot said he pointed out relics of family history to interested people at the open houses: the desk that belonged to his grandfather, who was named president of the Bank and Trust of New York at age 28, and shepherded it through the crash of 1929; the Steinway piano that belonged to his mother, who died last summer and also had an organ at the house for many years.
 The family that built the house left a relic, too, Mr. Perrot said: the names of the eight children of Robert George Hutchinson Jr., who was a dentist, written next to the numbers of their bedrooms on the fuse box in the basement. 
 Oak Cottage, a historic house for sale in Washington Township, once served as a hangout for teenagers, according to its current owners. 
 ''It used to be famous as a scary place that kids broke into and could spend the night,'' said Michele Pulis, who bought the dwelling on Route 22 with her husband, Robert, almost four years ago, and undertook restoration according to historic standards, with Mr. Pulis doing much of the work himself.
 Marketing the house now, the Pulises emphasize its more legitimately historic aspects: it was originally built around 1818, in the resort area around Schooley's Mountain that attracted eminences of the day, including Thomas Edison (whose Llewellyn Park home is now a national historic site) and General Ulysses S. Grant. 
 Earlier this year, their restoration project was featured in Preservation Magazine; also, the house was put on the market -- with an adjacent carriage house that was originally a cider mill -- for less than the Pulises say they put into it: $499,000. 
 ''This house's history is priceless,'' Ms. Pulis said. ''And that isn't even counting the years of labor my husband put in, or the new plumbing, heating, new kitchen and septic system. But with the economy the way it is, we need to sell. So somebody who gets all that is going to get an amazing bargain.'' 
 On Long Beach Island, a four-bedroom beach cottage built in 1890 is on the market for $850,000. The house sits on Spray Beach and, as Irene Vining, an agent at the G. Anderson Agency, notes in her listing materials, possesses a huge ''historical footprint.'' 
 In 1898, its owner, a lawyer named John Luther Long, sat outside on the porch and wrote a narrative about a geisha based on stories told to him by an acquaintance who visited the Far East. His tale was used as the basis for a play, which then evolved into the story line for the Puccini opera ''Madame Butterfly.''
 The geisha's story is woven into the history of the house, at least according to Ms. Vining. In this dicey real estate market, that unusual history might provide a critical sales hook. So she gets straight to the point at the top of her advertising copy: ''Madame Butterfly house for sale.''

HEADLINE: How, Exactly, Do You Follow Bill Moyers?

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
IT'S hard to imagine Bill Moyers bantering with a co-host. But the first thing that jumped out during a recent rehearsal of ''Need to Know,'' the new Friday night public affairs program on PBS replacing Mr. Moyers's, was the repartee between its co-hosts Alison Stewart and Jon Meacham, mixed with bits of irreverence in the script. ''Need to Know'' is no ''Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' by any means, or even the 11 p.m. local news, but there's no other PBS program likely to let its anchors riff on the name of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull. Could PBS, home to ''Frontline'' and ''NewsHour,'' be lightening up?
 Until ''Need to Know'' has its premiere on May 7, it's a work in progress, Shelley Lewis, the executive producer, cautioned, and the kibbitzing may well be trimmed. But the comedian Andy Borowitz will definitely close out each program, with ''Next Week's News'' (one rehearsal segment: ''Next week at the box office, here are the Top 5 Tyler Perry movies.'') Ms. Lewis said, ''To have wit in the show was important for all of us.'' 
 ''Need to Know,'' which will tape at a new studio at Lincoln Center, arrives to plenty of apprehension from PBS viewers, thousands of whom, riled up by the advocacy group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, have already protested. Their fear: the new hourlong show will fail to live up to the programs it is replacing: ''Bill Moyers Journal'' and ''Now on PBS,'' which ran a combined 90 minutes. Mr. Moyers, the lion of PBS, wanted, at 75, to step back from the grind of a weekly show, and was set to sign off on Friday, promising to return with specials. ''Now'' was cancelled.
 In a March 25 online column Michael Getler, the PBS ombudsman, called the new program ''a pretty big gamble for PBS'' given the ''fear, as expressed by many viewers in recent months, that PBS may be pulling in its horns and shying away from controversy.'' One letter writer said, ''I have the distinct impression that PBS is moving towards kinder, gentler documentary programming so as to avoid offending the powerful and upsetting the political right.'' Another complained of Mr. Meacham's ''right-of-center stance on world events,'' as evidenced in Newsweek, of which he is the editor. 
 Mr. Meacham, the winner of a 2009 Pulitzer Prize for his biography ''American Lion: Andrew Jackson and the White House,'' dismissed talk of his supposed partisan leanings: ''I'm a journalist and a biographer who calls them as I see them.'' Mr. Meacham, who is a regular on MSNBC -- where he mostly stays out of the fray when the partisan shouting gets too intense -- is a frequent target of conservatives, who decry what they say are Newsweek's ''liberal'' leanings. 
 ''I think it is a shame that people are already jumping to conclusions,'' said Neal Shapiro, the president and chief executive of WNET.org in New York, which is producing ''Need to Know'' for PBS. ''There's no replacing Bill Moyers,'' he added, but ''the issues that Bill raises'' will be among the show's topics. Maria Hinojosa, senior correspondent for ''Now,'' which took tough looks at issues like the Iraq war and maternal health in Haiti, is among those reporting for ''Need to Know.'' 
 The new program will feature an eclectic mix of reports and interviews, revolving mainly around the economy, health care, the environment and energy, national and international security, as well as high and low culture. Mr. Meacham has already recorded essays for the show on the history of anger and hate in American politics and the religious case for separation of church and state. Meanwhile Ms. Stewart has reported a history of the birth-control pill. She will be the face of the extensive Web site pbs.org/needtoknow, intended to be an integral part of the program, soliciting both input and feedback from the audience.
 Executives met with a half-dozen candidates before settling on Ms. Stewart, 43, and Mr. Meacham, 40, said Stephen Segaller, the vice president for content at WNET.org, who led the show's development. The unknown is whether Ms. Stewart's longtime fans -- she won a Peabody Award for her MTV ''Choose or Lose'' work covering the 1992 presidential election, then had stints at CBS, ABC and MSNBC before working for NPR's short-lived morning show ''The Bryant Park Project''-- will make the leap with her. On Friday nights, she said, ''you really have to give people a reason to watch.'' That's where the ad-libbing comes in, she said, adding, ''We want to let people get to know us.'' 
 Mr. Meacham, whose books have been best sellers, has his own fans, which PBS is also counting on. He calls the new program ''a parallel bet'' to the one made at Newsweek: ''that there is an audience for serious political and cultural coverage that feels -- despite all the programming options out there -- that feels underserved.''

HEADLINE: Narcos, No's And Nafta

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Mexico City 

 BODY:
 This is a strange time for U.S.-Mexico relations. The Mexican government just issued a travel advisory warning Mexicans about going to Arizona -- where they could get arrested by the police for no reason -- and the U.S. government just issued a travel advisory warning Americans about going to northern Mexico -- where they could get shot by drug dealers for no reason. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart de Mexico is expected to open 300 new stores in Mexico this year, thanks to growing Mexican demand for consumer goods. And Mexico's drug cartels will probably open just as many new smuggling routes into America thanks to our growing demand for marijuana, cocaine and crystal meth.
 We take the Mexican-American relationship for granted. But with the drug wars in Mexico turning into Wild West shootouts on city streets and with our own immigration politics turning more heated, what's happening in Mexico has become much more critical to American foreign policy and merits more of our attention. Mexico is not Afghanistan, but it also has not become all that it hoped to be by now. Something feels stalled here. 
 Three groups are now wrestling to shape Mexico's future. I'd call them ''the Narcos,'' ''the No's'' and ''the Naftas.'' Root for the Naftas.
 The Narcos are the drug cartels who are now brazenly attacking each other in turf wars and challenging the state for control of towns. The success of U.S. and Colombian efforts to interdict drug trafficking through the Caribbean and north from Colombia have pushed the cartels to relocate their main smuggling up through the spine of Mexico. President Felipe Calderon is bravely trying to take them on, but the Narcos have bigger guns than the Mexican Army -- most smuggled in from U.S. gun stores.
 The Mexican daily Reforma reported last week that ''the recent wave of insecurity in Mexico has made businesses related to public security, automobile armoring, insurance, satellite positioning systems and bulletproof vests grow at an unprecedented level.'' Companies in Mexico, it added, now invest between 1 percent and 3 percent of their sales in security. In 2006, it was just 0.5 percent.
 While the Narcos are the rising bad-news story here, the rising good-news story is Mexico's burgeoning middle class -- sort of. Mexico has two middle classes. One lives off the oil pumped and exported by the state oil company Pemex, which funds 40 percent of the government's budget. That budget sustains a web of salaries and subsidies to teachers' unions, national electricity company workers, farmers unions, state employees and Pemex workers.
 I call this group the No's because they are the primary force opposing any reform that would involve privatizing state-owned companies, like Pemex, opening the oil or electricity sectors to foreign investors or domestic competition, or bringing best-practices and accountability to Mexican schools, where union control has kept Mexico's public education among the worst in the world. 
 Fortunately, though, there is another rising middle class here, which the Mexican economist Luis de la Calle describes as the ''meritocratic middle class.'' It's people who came from the countryside to work in new industries spawned by Nafta. This rising middle class has a powerful aspiration to dig out of poverty. Mexico has standardized school achievement tests, so you can see how well schools in one neighborhood stack up against another. Some of the best results, said de la Calle, can now be found in small private schools in poor Mexico City neighborhoods where the Naftas reside. 
 What is also striking, he added, are the names of the private schools in some of these poor Mexico City districts -- like Iztapalapa: ''They are called John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, Carlos Marx, Van Gogh and Instituto Wisdom.'' Why such names? They are appealing to the aspirations of Mexicans, about 40 percent of whom live below the poverty line but 75 percent of whom identify themselves as ''middle class'' in polls.
 De la Calle also studied the top 50 Mexican baby names in 2008. The most popular for girls, he said, included ''Elizabeth, Evelyn, Abigail, Karen, Marilyn and Jaqueline, and for boys Alexander, Jonathan, Kevin, Christian and Bryan.'' Not only Juans. ''We have two middle classes,'' he said. ''One comes from teachers' unions and Pemex and power companies, who milk the Mexican government. These are the middle-class conservatives, and they want to preserve the status quo. But there is a rising and far larger Mexican middle class coming up from the bottom who send their kids to the Instituto Wisdom and who have a meritocratic view of the world.''
 So here's my prediction: When Mexico's steadily falling oil production meets its rising meritocratic middle class, you will see real political/economic reform here. That is when the No's will no longer have the resources to maintain the status quo, and that is when the Naftas from the Instituto Wisdom will demand the reforms that will enable them to realize their full potential.

HEADLINE: Texas Democrat Is Striving to Make His Name Known

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
MIDLAND, Tex. -- On the same day Newsweek magazine anointed Gov. Rick Perry on its cover as a conservative icon, his Democratic opponent, Bill White, was slogging through small-scale campaign stops here in a Republican stronghold, needling the governor, saying he paid more attention to his career than to bread-and-butter issues like schools.
 ''We need a governor more interested in the state's future than his political future,'' Mr. White said to about 100 curious oil company lawyers and executives at the Petroleum Club.
 But after the stump speech, a local lawyer, Mike Cunningham, piped up with the question on everyone's mind. How was Mr. White going to beat a well-known and well-financed Republican incumbent like Mr. Perry in a state where a Democrat has not won in 20 years? 
 ''I'm going to get more votes than he does,'' Mr. White answered in his habitual deadpan. There was no laughter. Then he added: ''He wins among people who don't know anything about me. So what's my strategy?''
 By all accounts, Mr. White, who is 55, has his work cut out for him. He has been campaigning hard in far-flung parts of the state like Midland, where Republicans and oil prices dominate affairs, trying to make his name better known and to define himself as a pro-business, fiscal conservative palatable to Republicans and independents. 
 The match-up between Mr. Perry and Mr. White this fall promises not only to test the depth of the conservative backlash against President Obama, but also to shed light on just how Republican the state has become and whether the slim signs of a Democratic resurgence in the 2008 election were chimerical.
 Conventional wisdom holds that this is a bad year to run as a Democrat in a state like Texas. Since the mid-1990s, Republican candidates have started off with a 10-point advantage just for being Republican. What's more, most political scientists and strategists say the pendulum is swinging back against the Democrats after Mr. Obama's victory in 2008. 
 The backlash among staunch conservatives, who are angry about the bailout of banks and deficit spending to create jobs, has given rightwing politicians like Mr. Perry a wind at their backs. Indeed, Mr. Perry has actively courted disaffected voters angry with Washington, appearing with Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck and building Mr. Perry's national profile.
 Yet Democrats are more hopeful this year than in any year since George W. Bush swept into the governor's office in 1994 and began an era of Republican dominance in statewide politics. Mr. White has credentials as a fiscal conservative, having cut property tax rates in Houston, where he was a three-term mayor. And in Houston, he proved that he can win over Republicans and independents. It is also difficult for an opponent to pigeonhole Mr. White on social issues -- he favors abortion rights but opposes gun control and supports the death penalty.
 And there is a feeling among some moderate Republicans and independents that Mr. Perry has moved too far to the right. Mr. Perry alienated some middle-of-the-road voters by expressing sympathy for secessionists last year; others fell out with him over his support of religious conservatives on the state school board.
 Mr. White has deftly identified those positions as chinks in Mr. Perry's armor, and he hits those notes often on the campaign trail. ''Perry is a career politician who uses wedge issues and name-calling and ideology -- he's a populist in the old George Wallace sense,'' Mr. White said. ''I appeal to people's common sense and decency and the deep reality that America's principal challenge in a competitive global economy is to prepare Americans to compete for good jobs.''
 Mr. White has made education a central theme, saying the governor did nothing to stop a third of Texas high school students from dropping out in the last decade and for allowing tuition at state universities to skyrocket.
 But mostly Mr. White has labored to introduce himself to voters in places like Midland, a Republican bastion that has a sign outside of town boasting that it is the home of George W. and Laura Bush. (The former first couple lives in Dallas now, though they once called Midland home.)
 ''He's not known at all out here,'' said Willie Barber, 56, a retired teacher who went to see Mr. White at a meeting with black leaders at a community center. ''He needs to get more publicity.''
 Mr. White, who was very popular as mayor of Houston from 2004 until he left office on Jan. 2 (barred by term limits from running again), could not be more different than Mr. Perry, the longest serving governor in Texas history. ''Someone told me when I was first running for office I would never get elected because my ears were too big,'' Mr. White said. ''I'm not the Marlboro Man. I don't know how to pose. I do know the difference between a speech and a solution.''
 Mr. Perry went to Texas A&M and became an Air Force pilot. Mr. White went to Harvard before becoming a lawyer and a successful businessman. Mr. Perry affects a boisterous, backslapping, cowboy-style bonhomie and favors grand rhetorical statements delivered in a ranch-hand's twang. Mr. White often speaks in a low monotone, but he has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of just about everything, from oil drilling techniques to the history of the Bible. 
 Some Republicans are giving Mr. White a look.
 Javier Joven, 44, the owner of a roofing company in Odessa, Tex., showed up at an event to meet Mr. White. He said that Mr. Perry had not taken the high school dropout rate and teenage-pregnancy problems seriously, and that Mr. White had. ''His opportunity to win is just as good as Perry's,'' Mr. Joven said. ''It's just an anti-incumbent year.''
 Mr. White has also caught the attention of independents who usually vote Republican, like Billy Munn, a close friend of Mr. Bush. Mr. Munn, who is in the oil business, helped host the event at the Petroleum Club. He said Mr. Perry's talk of secession had turned him off, and he was worried that the state's sorry schools were jeopardizing its economic future.
 Some former Republicans who left the party over differences with the socially conservative wing are also gravitating toward Mr. White. Robert Volkmann, 62, said Mr. Perry's decision to appoint a religious conservative as the head of the state school board was the last straw for him. ''That lead me to realize the Republican Party is not fit to govern in the state of Texas,'' he said as he listened to Mr. White in Odessa.
 But it is uncertain whether Mr. White can siphon enough conservative-leaning voters to pull off a victory, political scientists say. Some recent polls with small samples have him trailing Mr. Perry by much less than 10 percent, giving hope to his backers. 
 Still, most strategists agree that he will need enormous turnout among blacks and white liberals and among Hispanic voters in the Rio Grande Valley to pull off a win. At the same time, conservative white voters are highly motivated to vote this year.
 ''White is not out of it,'' said Cal Jillson, a professor at Southern Methodist University, ''but he has to run a good campaign in which he gets the kind of support that no Democrat has gotten in 15 or 20 years.''

HEADLINE: Buffett Offers Firm Support Of Goldman At Meeting

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting from Omaha.

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett became the highest-profile defender of Goldman Sachs on Saturday, offering staunch support of the firm as it combats fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Mr. Buffett also strongly defended the firm's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, saying he did not think Mr. Blankfein needed to be replaced. 
 His support for Goldman came in a question-and-answer session at the annual meeting in Omaha of Berkshire Hathaway, the giant insurance and investment firm Mr. Buffett runs. Berkshire owns $5 billion of preferred stock in Goldman. 
 The S.E.C. suit against Goldman stems from a complex investment deal the firm put together in 2007. The Justice Department has also begun a preliminary inquiry into Goldman's mortgage activities before the financial crisis, according to people briefed on the matter.
 Goldman denies any wrongdoing. Yet the firm has been battered by the S.E.C.'s charges, having lost about $21 billion in market value in the two weeks since the regulator filed its suit.
 Berkshire's annual meeting has become a sort of Woodstock for capitalists, drawing tens of thousands of investors each year. In a packed auditorium, Mr. Buffet was questioned for almost five hours by shareholders and a panel of journalists that included a reporter for The New York Times.
 In wide-ranging comments that spanned from Goldman to a proposed overhaul of financial regulation to Greece's debt crisis, Mr. Buffett said the global economy had largely improved. That was reflected in Berkshire's first-quarter results: $3.6 billion in net income, a sharp swing from the $1.5 billion loss it posted at the same time last year.
 Still, what drew the most attention was Mr. Buffett's full-throated support for Goldman. He drew upon some of the same points that Goldman has used in its own defense, including the sophistication of the investors the S.E.C. says were defrauded by Goldman's lack of adequate disclosure in the deal. He said those investors should have conducted better due diligence. Of one investor, he said, ''It's hard for me to get terribly sympathetic when a bank makes a dumb credit bet.'' 
 He also stood behind Mr. Blankfein. When asked whom he would select if Goldman needed to find a new leader, Mr. Buffett replied, ''If Lloyd had a twin brother, I would vote for him.''
 Mr. Buffett has a significant investment in Goldman. In 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis, Berkshire invested $5 billion in preferred shares. Those shares carry a 10 percent interest rate, meaning that Berkshire is earning about $500 million a year from its holdings. (Or as Mr. Buffett put it, $15 a second.)
 Though Mr. Buffett said the S.E.C. lawsuit had not yet negatively influenced his opinion of Goldman, he said he would revise his thinking if new evidence came to light.
 Mr. Buffett added that Goldman is a longtime adviser that ''helped build Berkshire Hathaway'' by selling them businesses for more than 50 years. 
 Mr. Buffett's longtime lieutenant, Charles Munger, tempered his boss's kind words. Mr. Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, said that there is a difference between behaving legally and behaving ethically -- and that a business should not simply follow the former. 
 Mr. Buffett also weighed in on the financial regulation overhaul bill that is pending in the Senate, which include provisions that may force investors in derivatives contracts to add more collateral to their holdings. (Berkshire has lobbied against such provisions.) Mr. Buffett said that Berkshire was unlikely to be forced to ''put up a dime'' in additional money on its existing contracts, though he added that the firm would do so if required.

HEADLINE: Mom the Mega-Star, Happily Balanced

BYLINE: By LEAH ROZEN

DATELINE: MALIBU, Calif. 

 BODY:
 TOM HANKS is on the line. ''What am I,'' he joked, ''just another in your long line of I Love Julia calls?'' 
 Well, yes, as it happens. Call around to movie industry associates about Julia Roberts and the love gushes forth. Mr. Hanks, who starred with her in ''Charlie Wilson's War'' (2007), said flat out: ''There's no professional I admire more than Julia. Working with her is like having a fabulous dinner conversation with somebody you really like and who really likes you and is loaded with energy and intelligence.'' Mike Nichols, who directed her in ''Closer'' (2004) and ''Charlie Wilson,'' unabashedly testified, ''Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep and my wife'' -- Diane Sawyer -- ''those are the three women I love.'' 
 Her newest admirer is Ryan Murphy, who directed her in ''Eat Pray Love,'' which opens Aug. 13. ''We laughed within 30 seconds of meeting each other and haven't stopped since,'' said Mr. Murphy, who is best known as one of the creators of ''Glee.'' ''She was a real collaborator on making the movie and a real leader on the set.'' Also a fan is Elizabeth Gilbert, author of ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' the best-selling 2006 memoir (200,000 copies in hardback and 6.2 million and counting in paperback) on which the movie is based. ''There's this luminousness to Julia,'' Ms. Gilbert said. ''It's almost as if she was always lit from behind. If she wasn't a movie star, the only other job she could have would be professional fairy.'' 
 The object of all this affection sits curled up in a comfy chair in her sewing room, upstairs in her sprawling but unpretentious, family-friendly house in Malibu. Her latest sewing project is whipping up personalized, oversize pillows for her three young children to loll upon while reading. Ms. Roberts has asked a reporter to meet her here at 9 a.m., an hour when moms are up, not movie stars. 
 At 8:59 a.m., Ms. Roberts, in worn jeans and a yellow cotton cardigan, was securing her 5-year-old twins, Phinnaeus and Hazel, into a car so that her husband, the cinematographer Daniel Moder, could drive them to school. ''Have fun,'' she told the kids, waving goodbye as the family's two dogs, Myrtle, a rescue mutt, and Louie, a Labrador, barked excitedly. 
 Fun is something Ms. Roberts is having a lot of these days. She is relishing marriage and motherhood -- ''We are happy as clams,'' she said -- and works only when she wants to. ''I am fulfilled by my own life on an hourly basis. Every little moment is amazing if you let yourself access it. I learn that all the time from my kids; children are so filled with wonder. My youngest son'' -- Henry, almost 3 -- ''woke up at 5 a.m. the other morning and said to me, 'It's a beautiful day, Mama!' What's more precious than that?'' 
 Ms. Roberts has been a major movie star -- the biggest female box office draw -- for 20 years, ever since she fetchingly guffawed her way through the romantic comedy ''Pretty Woman'' in 1990. She was 22 at the time, a slip of a girl with a gigantic smile and a boisterous laugh. ''She was young, but just fearless, and she was obviously popping off the screen,'' recalled Garry Marshall, who directed her in ''Pretty Woman,'' ''Runaway Bride'' (1999) and this year's ''Valentine's Day.'' ''Watching her grow up has been one of my pleasures.'' 
 Now 42, Ms. Roberts still has a smile as wide and a laugh as infectious, but a lot has happened in her life since ''Pretty Woman'': two marriages (the first to the singer Lyle Lovett, the second to Mr. Moder in 2002); motherhood to her brood of three; winning an Oscar as best actress for ''Erin Brockovich'' (2000); and roles in more than 30 movies, including crowd-pleasers like ''My Best Friend's Wedding'' (1997), ''Notting Hill'' (1999) and ''Ocean's Eleven'' (2001). 
 Along the way, she learned to handle fame -- gone are her days as a tabloid staple for broken engagements and romances with actors like Kiefer Sutherland, Jason Patric and Benjamin Bratt -- and blossomed as an actress. ''She's so beautiful, people don't completely realize that she's an actual great actress,'' Mr. Nichols said. 
 He said she has a probing intelligence, comes to a role preternaturally prepared and has such a crystal-clear understanding of the character she is portraying that she seemingly glides through scenes. As evidence, he recalled a particularly demanding scene in the corrosive romantic drama ''Closer'' in which Ms. Roberts's character is pressed by her husband (played by Clive Owen) to reveal intimate details about her adultery. ''We did it seven times and she blushed at the same exact point every time,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''Now, who can do that? Most actors have to do work to produce emotion; Julia has to do work to suppress it.'' 
 In ''Eat Pray Love,'' which also stars Javier Bardem, James Franco, Viola Davis and Richard Jenkins, Ms. Roberts gets to display bushels of emotion as a woman seeking answers to life's big questions. The role was the most taxing she has taken on -- she's in every scene and traveled the globe during the nearly four-month shoot -- since she had her children. 
 ''I was really exhausted when it was done,'' Ms. Roberts said, ''and I loved every second of it.''
 She first encountered ''Eat, Pray, Love'' when her agent sent her a copy upon publication. Thirty pages in, Ms. Roberts snapped the cover shut and put the book down. 
 It wasn't that the actress didn't like or relate to Ms. Gilbert's perspicacious memoir about how, after a divorce, she spent a year searching for balance and harmony in her life while traveling to Italy, India and Indonesia. 
 Quite the opposite: ''It cast a spell on me,'' Ms. Roberts said, sipping from a mug of herbal tea. ''I immediately got on Amazon.com and ordered a copy for my best friend in Chicago. I sent it to her with a note saying, 'I want to be reading this while someone I love is reading it at the same time.' '' 
 Ms. Roberts said the emotional and spiritual journey depicted in the book -- and now, she hopes, in the movie -- resonated with her. ''We all kind of have that moment in our lives,'' she said, ''sometimes it's just for a weekend, or a month, or even a year, when you think, 'There's no way out.' You have to learn to find peace within yourself, to exorcise that restlessness and judgment. You have to learn, 'Why can't I just be happy with my life?' '' 
 Among the things that make Ms. Roberts happy now is having her family with her when she's working. The Roberts-Moder clan moved en masse for ''Eat Pray Love,'' spending time on location in New York City (where Ms. Roberts maintains an apartment), Rome, India and Bali. 
 Her kids got to watch as Mom gained seven pounds in Italy eating her way through platefuls of pasta and pizza; suffered a fever of 102 in India but still insisted on being on the set for Mr. Jenkins's big scene; and endured humidity so intense in Bali that she was practically squeegeeing off the sweat. ''I've never changed clothes so many times in the course of a day,'' Ms. Roberts said. 
 With ''Eat Pray Love'' now behind her (except promoting it this summer), Ms. Roberts, next up, has a small but significant role in ''Larry Crowne,'' a comic drama in which Mr. Hanks, who co-wrote and is directing, plays a member of the nouveau unemployed who enrolls in a junior college. (''To be able to get her in your movie is a hail-Mary pass,'' Mr. Hanks said.) After that, there are films she is considering, and she'd like to give Broadway a go again, maybe improving next time upon the decidedly mixed reviews she received for her debut effort, ''Three Days of Rain,'' in 2006. 
 ''She has nothing to prove,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''She's doing what she enjoys. I think that her family is her life. She loves movies and making them. She'll do it whenever she feels like it, can find the time and, most of all, can bring her family with her.'' 
 Ms. Roberts confirmed that she is indeed choosy about roles these days, weighing the juiciness or challenge of a part against family considerations. ''I say you can call me, but I don't necessarily call everybody back now,'' she said, laughing. ''I'm not off the market, but my decision-making has more components than it used to.'' 
 She is getting within spitting distance of 45, an age when substantial movie roles tend to disappear for most actresses. There's always one gal, however, who successfully bucks the odds: in the late '60s and '70s, it was Katharine Hepburn; in the '80s and early '90s, Shirley MacLaine; currently, it's Ms. Streep. In terms of looks, talent and track record, Ms. Roberts would be a smart bet to fill that slot in coming years. 
 She name-checked Frances McDormand and Annette Bening as actresses she admires for successfully balancing formidable careers and family. ''And Meryl, of course, that goes without saying,'' she said. ''But, then again, we have no idea what it might have taken for Meryl Streep to get out the door some days.''

HEADLINE: Many Charter Schools, Varied Grades

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
In the world of education, it was the equivalent of the cool kids' table in the cafeteria. 
 Executives from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, McKinsey consultants and scholars from Stanford and Harvard mingled at an invitation-only meeting of the New Schools Venture Fund at a luxury hotel in Pasadena, Calif. Founded by investors who helped start Google and Amazon, this philanthropy seeks to raise the academic achievement of poor black and Hispanic students, largely through charter schools. 
 Many of those at the meeting last May had worried that the Obama administration would reflect the general hostility of teachers' unions toward charters, publicly financed schools that are independently run and free to experiment in classrooms. But all doubts were dispelled when the image of Arne Duncan, the new education secretary, filled a large video screen from Washington. He pledged to combine ''your ideas with our dollars'' from the federal government. ''What you have created,'' he said, ''is a real movement.'' 
 That movement includes a crowded clique of alpha girls and boys, including New York hedge fund managers, a Hollywood agent or two and the singers John Legend and Sting, who performed at a fund-raiser for Harlem charter schools last Wednesday at Lincoln Center. Charters have also become a pet cause of what one education historian calls a billionaires' club of philanthropists, including Mr. Gates, Eli Broad of Los Angeles and the Walton family of Wal-Mart. 
 But for all their support and cultural cachet, the majority of the 5,000 or so charter schools nationwide appear to be no better, and in many cases worse, than local public schools when measured by achievement on standardized tests, according to experts citing years of research. Last year one of the most comprehensive studies, by researchers from Stanford University, found that fewer than one-fifth of charter schools nationally offered a better education than comparable local schools, almost half offered an equivalent education and more than a third, 37 percent, were ''significantly worse.'' 
 Although ''charter schools have become a rallying cry for education reformers,'' the report, by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes, warned, ''this study reveals in unmistakable terms that, in the aggregate, charter students are not faring as well'' as students in traditional schools. 
 Researchers for this study and others pointed to a successful minority of charter schools -- numbering perhaps in the hundreds -- and these are the ones around which celebrities and philanthropists rally, energized by their narrowing of the achievement gap between poor minority students and white students.
 But with the Obama administration offering the most favorable climate yet for charter schools, the challenge of reproducing high-flying schools is giving even some advocates pause. Academically ambitious leaders of the school choice movement have come to a hard recognition: raising student achievement for poor urban children -- what the most fervent call a new civil rights campaign -- is enormously difficult and often expensive. 
 ''I think many people settle and tend to let themselves off the hook,'' said Perry White, a former social worker who founded the Citizens' Academy charter school in Cleveland in 1999 -- naively, he now recognizes -- and has overseen its climb from an F on its state report card in 2003 to an A last year. ''It took us a while to understand we needed a no-excuses culture,'' he said, one of ''really sweating the small stuff.''
 Visits to half a dozen charter schools in Cleveland and New York State show that high- and low-performing schools often seem to take pages from the same playbook. They require student uniforms, a longer day and academic year, frequent testing to measure learning, and tutoring for students who fall behind. They imitate one another in superficial ways, too, like hanging inspirational banners: ''This Is Where We're Headed. To College!'' say posters in the hall of the Williamsburg Collegiate Charter School in Brooklyn, with campus scenes of a chemistry lab and big-time college sports. 
 But the differences in how schools are run, the way classes are taught and how school culture is nourished are striking. It is like watching two couples dance a tango, one with poise and precision, the other stumbling to execute the intricate footwork.
 A High-Flying School
 At Williamsburg Collegiate, whose middle school students annually outscore the district and city averages on state tests, Jason Skeeter stood before his math students the other day as tightly coiled as a drill sergeant. He issued instructions in a loud, slightly fearsome voice, without an extra word or gesture. ''Five minutes on the clock,'' he told the 26 fifth graders, as they began a ''Do Now'' review sheet on least common denominators.
 On the whiteboard, an agenda told students precisely what to expect for the 60-minute period. Mr. Skeeter placed his digital Teach Timer on an overhead projector so the countdown was visible to all. When the buzzer sounded, he announced, ''Hold 'em up,'' and students raised their pencils. 
 ''Clap if you're with me,'' he said, clapping twice to snap students to attention. The class responded with a ritual double-stomp of the feet and a hand clap. 
 Mr. Skeeter, 30, a stocky man in a dark blue shirt and tie, moved swiftly to a second timed exercise, the ''Mad Minute,'' 60 multiplication problems in 60 seconds. 
 ''Pencils down,'' he ordered after the minute was up. ''Switch papers with your partner.'' 
 The teacher read aloud the 60 answers. ''Hands on your head when you're done counting'' correct answers, he told students. He started the timer again as he called students' names -- DeAndre, Alejandro, Nakeri, Lyric -- typing their scores into a laptop. He announced the class average: 37.86. 
 ''Brian Leventer,'' he said, making what the school calls a cold call to one student rather than looking for a raised hand, ''what does it round to?'' 
 ''Thirty-eight.''
 ''Thirty-eight is correct,'' Mr. Skeeter said. The class had fallen two points shy of fifth graders in a rival class. ''Close, close, close,'' the teacher said. 
 At Williamsburg Collegiate, everything is measured, everything is compared, graphed and displayed publicly. Besides academics, students compete for merit points for good behavior and receive demerits for absent homework or disrespect. The school drills students on posture and clear speaking, known as SLANT, shorthand for ''Sit up straight. Listen. Ask and answer questions. Nod for understanding. Track the speaker,'' meaning follow with your eyes. 
 ''I will give merits to the first group to stop what they're doing and track me,'' Mr. Skeeter said at one point.
 A rigidly structured environment is part of the formula the school believes produces success. Another is ''the use of data to inform everything we do,'' said Brett Peiser, the superintendent. If tests reveal that 70 percent of students do not know how to add fractions with like denominators, teachers reteach it. The curriculum is constantly adjusted. 
 Although half of Mr. Skeeter's fifth graders began the year, their first at the school, below grade level, his goal is for all to pass the state exam. It is a goal that eludes most schools statewide with populations like Williamsburg Collegiate's, which is 99 percent African-American and Hispanic, with 83 percent eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. 
 Yet last year all 78 of the school's fifth graders who took the math exam passed. ''If our goal is to close the achievement gap and prepare students for college, obviously we're trending in the right direction,'' Mr. Peiser said.
 A More Typical Case
 In Ohio, the Cleveland Arts and Social Sciences Academy is not the kind of charter school that celebrities visit. It is, however, close to the norm for urban Ohio, where 60 percent of charter school students in the eight largest districts attend a school that earned a D or F on its last state report card, according to an analysis by Catalyst Ohio, an independent publication supporting school improvement. 
 Alison Ellis, who is 27 and in her second year of full-time teaching, had the advantage of a small class of 14 the other day to teach sixth-grade math, in preparation for the state tests on which the all-important school report cards are based. 
 ''Yesterday we looked at the extended-responses part of your test,'' Ms. Ellis said, referring to practice exercises the students had done. ''We had a rough day.''
 She passed out a work sheet reviewing similar material, starting with a word problem calling for basic arithmetic. ''Jackie ate lunch at the Double D Diner,'' she read. ''Her check is shown below.''
 The students bent to their work sheets, six girls and eight boys, the boys ranging in size from a student with a faint mustache and an untucked extra-large polo shirt to another seemingly half his size. 
 The Arts and Social Sciences Academy, which Ohio says is in a state of ''academic emergency,'' might not strike a casual observer as a school that is failing its students, who are similar demographically to Williamsburg Collegiate's -- 98 percent African-American, 91 percent economically disadvantaged. 
 But the contrast with the Brooklyn school was apparent in many subtle ways. In Ms. Ellis's classroom, the whiteboard was empty except for the date -- no agenda to focus students. Although Ms. Ellis timed students on solving problems similar to those they would expect on the state test, she was imprecise about when time was up. 
 The pace was unhurried; there was little sense of the urgency to impart and absorb knowledge that lends an electricity to classrooms at Williamsburg Collegiate. At one point, a boy put his head on a desk and had to be wakened. 
 As fifth graders one year ago, only 20 percent of the school's students passed the state math exam, results that contributed to the school's overall grade of F. The principal, Debroah A. Mays, was disappointed by the results. She introduced a yearlong improvement plan that included Saturday tutoring and teacher training. 
 ''We are determined to become a school of excellence,'' Mrs. Mays said. 
 Even though the school did worse on the Ohio math and English exams than the average Cleveland public school, families did not flee Arts and Social Sciences Academy. On the contrary, enrollment has doubled in each of the past two years. It is a phenomenon often seen in academically failing charter schools when parents perceive them as having better discipline than district schools.
 ''Families love the feeling of community; they walk in and say they feel safe,'' Mrs. Mays said. ''They don't worry about bullying. My kids are just a bunch of marshmallows.''
 The Ideology
 Since the first one opened in Minnesota in 1992, charter schools have captivated school reformers, originally on the political right but increasingly from the center-left. Largely an urban phenomenon, charter schools in some 72 cities now enroll 10 percent or more of public school students, up from 45 cities three years ago, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. 
 Fifty-five percent of enrolled students nationwide are black or Hispanic, the alliance says, and more than a third qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, a common measure of poverty. 
 The movement sometimes makes for strange bedfellows. ''When I first got into this, I thought everyone interested in educating poor black kids would be a good lefty,'' said Lyman Millard, director of development at Citizens' Academy in Cleveland and a Democrat. ''We went to a state charter convention where they were debating which of two bumper stickers to have printed: 'Go With Bush' or 'God Wants Bush.' I thought, what did we get ourselves into?''
 In 2007, President George W. Bush visited a Harlem charter, but President Obama has done him one better, pledging to use the Harlem Children's Zone, a network of charter schools and social services, as a model for high-poverty urban areas. The administration's Race to the Top competition, which waves the carrot of $4.3 billion in education aid to states that comply with administration goals, has prompted three so far -- Illinois, Louisiana and Tennessee -- to lift limits on the number of charter schools. Advocates say there has never been more political momentum from Washington in favor of charter schools.
 The club of millionaires and billionaires who support them includes Mr. Gates; Mr. Broad, whose fortune is from home building and financial services; Michael Dell of Dell Computer; Doris Fisher, who, with her late husband, Donald, founded the Gap; and the Walton family. 
 Rather than starting their own schools, these philanthropists largely went looking for successful charters and provided money for expansion. Thus they can boast of mainly backing academic winners. 
 Celebrities who support charters have also picked carefully. In Los Angeles, a former writer for ''L. A. Law,'' Roger Lowenstein, founded the Los Angeles Leadership Academy, which ranks in the top 10 percent of schools statewide with similar disadvantaged populations. He has cultivated as donors the screenwriter James L. Brooks and the television agent Rick Rosen, who represents Conan O'Brien.
 In New York, Mr. Legend, the Grammy-winning soul singer, has used his visibility to debate political opponents of charter schools in the news media. ''What these people are proving who are running excellent schools is that poor black and brown kids can be successful,'' he said in an interview. ''Until recently a lot of Americans didn't even believe that was true, because they saw such persistent gaps in the education outcomes.''
 Mr. Legend is on an advisory board of Harlem Village Academies, three small schools that held a glittery fund-raiser at Lincoln Center last week. Katie Couric told the crowd that she was a mentor to students on Saturday mornings. Hugh Jackman, the host, announced a $500,000 gift from Rupert Murdoch. 
 Last year, 93 percent of eighth graders at the flagship Harlem Village Academy passed the state math, English, science and social studies exams, compared with 41 percent in its West Harlem school district, records show. 
 Some Have Doubts
 Critics of charter schools, often teachers' unions and their political allies, say the schools rely on a corps of young teachers who are willing to work 60-hour weeks, but who burn out quickly. In addition, as the United Federation of Teachers reported in January, charters in New York City enroll a smaller share of special education students and those still learning English. 
 An independent study recently backed the claims to high achievement made by New York City charters, which have benefited from the strong support of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein. Devised to address criticism that charters skim off the most motivated students, the study compared the state test scores of students in charter schools with those who had wanted to enroll but were not picked in lotteries that charters hold when they have too many applicants. 
 The study concluded that charter students made better progress in math and English than their counterparts who ended up in traditional schools. In math, students in charters from kindergarten through eighth grade came close to equaling the achievements of suburban students, nearly closing what the study's lead author, Caroline M. Hoxby, a Stanford economist, called the ''Scarsdale-Harlem'' gap. 
 Ms. Hoxby's study, released in September, followed by three months the much broader investigation by a Stanford colleague, at the Center for Research on Education Outcomes, which showed discouraging results for charters nationally. Drawing on data from the District of Columbia and 15 states (but not New York), that study's finding that 83 percent of charter schools are doing no better than local public schools shocked many advocates, all the more so because its author, Margaret E. Raymond, is a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a bastion of libertarianism. 
 Ms. Hoxby, also a fellow at the Hoover Institution, where she is a member of a pro-charter task force, and Ms. Raymond engaged in a sharp online exchange over research methodologies -- an echo of years of arguments over charter school data. (Ms. Raymond's study did show that learning improved the longer students were in charters.)
 What most experts can agree on is that charter school quality varies widely, and that it is often associated with the rigor of authorities that grant charters. New York, where oversight is strong, is known for higher performing schools. Ohio, Arizona and Texas, where accountability is minimal, showed up in Ms. Raymond's study with many poorly performing schools. 
 Perhaps the sharpest knock on charters -- one that even some proponents acknowledge -- is that mediocrity is widely tolerated. Authorities are reluctant to close poor schools. Some advocates concede that the intellectual premise behind school choice -- that in a free market for education, parents will remove students from bad schools in favor of good ones -- has not proved true. 
 ''If you look at the hopes and dreams from 1992, it didn't pan out that quality would rise because of marketplace accountability,'' said James Merriman, chief executive of the New York City Charter School Center. ''It turns out you need government accreditation to drive quality, and the human capital to make schools go. The hard lesson is, it is so dependent on human capital.'' 
 Can They Be Replicated?
 Mr. Skeeter of Williamsburg Collegiate is what advocates mean when they talk of human capital. A former public school teacher in the Bronx, where he lives, he works from 7 a.m. to 5:30, nearly three hours longer than his public school day. The charter school says it pays teachers about 15 percent above union scale, though there is no tenure. ''I have more say in what I teach and how I teach, which is important to me,'' Mr. Skeeter said, adding that in a traditional public school he felt ''handcuffed'' to the assigned curriculum. 
 As his students lined up after lunch outside his classroom, he popped questions before they could enter. ''Kayson, what is two-fifths as a percent?'' he asked. The boy hesitated before correctly answering 40. ''Next time,'' Mr. Skeeter said, ''quicker.'' 
 Mr. Peiser, who oversees Williamsburg Collegiate and nine other charter schools in Brooklyn for Uncommon Schools, a nonprofit management organization, frequently says ''there's not one big thing'' that his schools do differently that explains their success. ''There are 100 1-percent solutions,'' he said.
 Ninety-eight percent of some 1,000 students in grades three through eight in Uncommon Schools, almost all poor minority children, passed their New York State math exam last year, and 89 percent passed the English exam. ''Higher in both cases than the white average,'' Mr. Peiser pointed out.
 Such stellar results have attracted philanthropists, including those from the New Schools Venture Fund, which seeks to replicate top charter schools. Whether that is possible at a scale that could move the needle in American education may be the greatest challenge of all for the charter movement. 
 Nonprofit networks of charter operators with top-flight schools -- outfits like Uncommon, KIPP and Aspire Public Schools -- have created only about 350 in the past decade, and required $500 million in philanthropic support, according to Thomas Toch, author of a study last year on many of the groups underwritten by the New Schools Venture Fund. He questioned whether successful charters could be ''scaled up'' without sacrificing quality and without heavy subsidies from private donors. 
 ''It's easy to open schools, but it's very hard to open and sustain and to grow networks of very good schools,'' said Mr. Toch, a founder of Education Sector, a research group. 
 The education historian Diane Ravitch offers a parallel critique. ''Charters enroll 3 percent of the kids,'' she said. ''The system that educates 97 percent, no one's paying any attention to.''
 In a new book, Ms. Ravitch describes her about-face from supporter of the school-choice movement as a member of the first Bush administration to a critic. In an interview, she pointed to the Obama administration's oft-stated goal of turning around 5,000 public schools -- the bottom 5 percent -- which it is leveraging through $4 billion in School Improvement Grants to states that adopt one of four strategies, including giving failing schools to charter operators. ''What we're likely to get are lots of mediocre and very bad charters,'' Ms. Ravitch said. 
 Mr. Duncan, the education secretary, replied through a spokeswoman: ''We do not favor one kind of school over another. We favor educational quality and accountability for all schools.''
 The teachers and principal at the Arts and Social Sciences Academy, which has 230 students in temporary buildings, do not want to remain in the category of failing charter. They hope to expunge the F on their school's report card with this year's state exams. ''Soaring to Success!'' a banner in the hallway read the other day, exhorting one and all. ''There are 13 school days to the Ohio Achievement Assessment!!'' 
 In Ms. Ellis's math class, she patiently demonstrated how to answer the word problem of Jackie and her lunch at the Double D Diner. As she reread the problem, one boy interrupted: ''I thought it was a he,'' he said, meaning ''Jackie.'' 
 ''One thing I've noticed we get stuck on is names,'' Ms. Ellis said, gently correcting that Jackie is a she. ''They have the wackiest names,'' she told students named Devonere, Aja, Danisha and Caz'mier, who might be unfamiliar with some of the references of standardized tests. 
 She assigned a more challenging problem, and as she went from desk to desk offering advice, students worked without the familiar distractions of a more crowded classroom -- hands raised for a bathroom pass, students wandering over to backpacks. Disengagement here was expressed passively: after most of the time allotted to complete the problem had passed, one boy had drawn only a line dividing the work space in half. At a bank of computers in the back, where other students were working, one had his head on the keyboard. 
 The computers ran a learning program, A-Plus, with problems geared to a student's abilities. A boy was working his way through simple math. ''A glass of lemonade costs 25 cents,'' the computer screen told this sixth grader. ''A hot dog costs 5 cents. How much will it cost to buy both?''
 When he tapped the correct answer, the screen flashed, ''Way to Go.'' 
 Clearly, this school still has work to do.

HEADLINE: Slate of Nominees Is Clue to Obama's Plans for Fed

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In naming two economists and a lawyer to serve as governors of the Federal Reserve, President Obama and his top economic advisers are preparing the central bank for a new emphasis on the supervision of financial institutions.
 The financial crisis that led the Fed to hurl money at the economy and prop up the housing market also exposed a past inattention to regulation. The backgrounds and expertise of the nominees, announced on Thursday, suggest the Obama administration is trying to address that shortcoming. 
 Only one of the three, Janet L. Yellen, specializes in the setting of interest rates and the supply of credit, the Fed's traditional bailiwick. 
 The other economist, Peter A. Diamond, is an authority on Social Security and pensions who was a graduate school mentor of Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 The lawyer, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Maryland's commissioner of financial regulation, is an ally of consumer advocacy groups, which believe that the Fed's neglect abetted the subprime lending crisis that metastasized into the most damaging downturn since the Depression.
 ''It's a well-rounded group, and a reflection of the fact that given the events of recent history, the importance of the Fed's financial stability role, relative to its role in gauging traditional cyclical tradeoffs, is likely higher now,'' Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council, who oversaw the search, said in an interview. 
 Even as it continues to try to battle joblessness and hold down inflation, the Fed is poised to receive new duties from Congress for protecting the financial system and consumers. Mr. Obama's selections reflect these duties, but also are consistent with the mandate set out for the Fed at its creation in 1913, said Jon Faust, a former Fed official.
 ''The Federal Reserve Act envisioned that the board would represent a broad range of interests,'' said Mr. Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins. ''The emphasis on academic economists is a trend that's only been happening in central banks around the world over the last 15 to 20 years.'' 
 So far there has not been vocal criticism of the nominees, whose backgrounds were reviewed for a month and a half before the appointments were formally announced. If the three are confirmed, they will join Mr. Bernanke, whom Mr. Obama backed for a second term; Daniel K. Tarullo, a law professor and an authority on banking regulation, whom Mr. Obama named to the seven-member board last year; and two Republican governors named by President George W. Bush.
 ''We ran a careful and thoughtful selection process,'' Mr. Summers said. ''We considered a large number of people, and all of us on the economic team felt this slate would be very strong.''
 Daniel P. Carpenter, professor of government at Harvard, said that as an authority on fiscal matters, Mr. Diamond, who is close to Peter R. Orszag, Mr. Obama's budget director, ''can speak with greater credibility'' than Mr. Bernanke on taxation and spending.
 The fact that Mr. Bernanke, 56, has known and admired Mr. Diamond, who just turned 70, for more than three decades adds a wrinkle to the dynamics on the board. 
 ''In academic culture, no matter how advanced you are or how many awards you've won, people look up to their academic advisers,'' Mr. Carpenter said. ''This is going to be a vote on the board of governors that is going to have special weight.'' 
 Mr. Carpenter predicted that Ms. Raskin would elevate the prominence of consumer concerns at a time when Congress was considering housing a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the Fed. 
 ''There are at the root level a number of consumer capacities at the Fed, including bank examiners and regulators at the regional banks,'' Mr. Carpenter said. ''The problem is that a lot of these lower-level regulatory functionaries tend not to get the attention or status that the high-level monetary policy-making functionaries get.''
 J. Kevin Corder, a political scientist at Western Michigan University who studies Fed policy-making, agreed that the board needed to go beyond monetary policy.
 ''The monetary policy function has been so overwhelmed by the regulatory challenges and the extraordinary interventions that the board is drawing on different types of expertise than it has in the past,'' Mr. Corder said.
 For Ms. Yellen, who was a Fed governor from 1994 to 1997 and then chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton, the appointment amounts to a homecoming. 
 ''I am strongly committed to pursuing the dual goals that Congress has assigned us: maximum employment and price stability,'' Ms. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco since 2004, said on Thursday. ''And, if confirmed, I will work to ensure that policy promotes job creation and keeps inflation in check.'' 
 The positioning of employment before inflation in that statement might fuel a perception that Ms. Yellen is an inflation ''dove,'' more concerned about the 9.7 percent unemployment rate than the prospect of inflation jitters.
 But Laurence H. Meyer, an economist who served with Ms. Yellen on the board, called that depiction an exaggeration. 
 Before the Fed's policy-making arm met in September 1996, he recalled, he and Ms. Yellen paid an unusual visit to Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke's predecessor.
 ''Janet and I were both worried about inflation, even though it was very well contained at the time,'' Mr. Meyer wrote in a blog post last month. ''We told the chairman that we loved him but could not remain at his side much longer if he continued, as he had been doing for some time, to push the next tightening action into the next meeting, and then not follow through.'' 
 Mr. Meyer and Ms. Yellen ultimately stood by Mr. Greenspan, who had correctly predicted that technological change was fueling a boom in productivity and alleviating inflationary pressures. The Fed did not raise its benchmark interest rate until the following March.

HEADLINE: An Out-of-Office Message

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai writes about national politics for the magazine.

 BODY:
Some 30 months from the next presidential election, the field of potential challengers to Barack Obama is like a solar system in its infancy -- unformed, gaseous and lacking a dominant star. One characteristic, however, stands out. In a recent CNN poll that tested the strength of possible Republican hopefuls, only one of the seven most likely candidates (that would be Representative Ron Paul) will actually hold an elected office by the end of this year. The two leading candidates as of today, Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney, haven't held a political job in more than three years. 
Sarah Palin gave up her governorship when the vast Alaskan frontier became too confining for her ambition, and Newt Gingrich hasn't run for anything since the days before Google was a verb. Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota's governor, is leaving office at the end of the year. We've certainly had our share of presidents who ran as former officeholders of one kind or another: Jimmy Carter ran as an ex-governor in 1976, and Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were out of office by the time they finally won the presidency. Still, you have to go back almost three decades -- to the former vice president Walter Mondale in 1984 -- to find a major-party candidate who didn't hold an office on the day he clinched the nomination. Which makes it strange that a number of Republican aspirants seem to be hoping for their own version of a jobless recovery.
 There are reasons both practical and ethereal that some presidential candidates today might see an advantage in putting some distance between themselves and the obligations of office. One is the evolution of the sprawling presidential process itself, which now turns even an exploratory candidacy into a full-time fund-raising and networking job. And it probably isn't lost on anyone who is considering a presidential campaign in this political climate that all the trappings of government that have traditionally served to legitimize a lesser-known candidate -- security details, official planes, press conferences held on the Capitol steps -- may be about as helpful with primary voters now as a disfiguring rash. After all, in a Pew Research Center poll last month, only 22 percent of respondents said they could trust government most of the time, which is one of the lowest percentages in more than 50 years of asking the question. There has never been a worse time to be an incumbent anything. 
 It's true, too, that as a society we tend to view employment as a concept differently from the way we did 20 or 30 years ago. Our parents and grandparents defined themselves wholly by their day jobs. The answer to the age-old question of ''What do you do?'' was that they were doctors or steelworkers, mothers or teachers. Similarly, a broadcast-age politician was his office, plain and simple, and without it he lacked an identity. In the fractured, multidimensional world of the Web, however, we may be many more things to many more people at once. A bankruptcy lawyer by day may be a celebrated blogger by night; the guy who delivers your mail may attract a following as an amateur photographer or an armchair paleontologist. Titles mean less, passions mean more. A durable political persona has more currency in the modern age than any elected office, with all the rules that come with it.
 This move away from incumbency also tells us two things about the conflicts churning inside the Republican Party. The first has to do with the tides of modern conservatism, which have always surged and ebbed from a movement phase to a governing phase and back again. The Goldwater-era activists of the 1960s and '70s wrested control of their party over a period of years, until at last Reagan translated that uprising into a fiscal and moral governing vision that persuaded the country. Similarly, Reagan's ideological heirs mounted an assault on the more tepid Republican leadership of the late 1980s and early 1990s, building the momentum that enabled Gingrich to create his unlikely Republican majority. Now, in the moment after George W. Bush, conservatism again finds itself in the grass-roots movement phase, exiled and at war with the Washington establishment. Little wonder that those gravitating toward a 2012 race fashion themselves as free-agent leaders rather than as political insiders. 
 The second point is that the conservative ideology in its distilled form -- that is, the virile strain that animates the so-called Tea Party uprising -- is largely incompatible with the reality of governing in a recession. (This is apparent in Florida, where the governor, Charlie Crist, is on the verge of being stamped out of the party for having supported the president's stimulus plan.) Conservative activists want government in every instance to achieve more by doing drastically less, while those entrusted with public office must grapple with the effects of cutting health care for the elderly or aid to community colleges. In that kind of environment, can anyone who actually has to run a state hope to rally the Tea Party troops in Iowa and New Hampshire? Even for former officeholders, this kind of purity test can be a problem. Romney's candidacy is endangered because he put into effect an Obama-like health care reform in Massachusetts. Better to do like Palin, who stayed in office just long enough to earn national celebrity but not nearly long enough to have left any traceable residue of governance.
 The field of Republican formers will winnow and change, of course. Gingrich and Palin may decide that being thought of as a candidate is a lot more appealing than actually being one, and Romney may get past his stammering over health care in time to emerge as a genuine front-runner, if such a thing still exists in presidential-campaign politics. Still, it's hard to imagine that Democrats wouldn't be pleased to meet a bunch of Republican aspirants who could easily be caricatured as sideline hecklers, rather than as elected leaders who have had to confront the same crises as the president himself. 
 What must worry the current occupant of the White House more, as he watches his approval ratings dip to very human levels, is that there might be a serving Republican in the land who is thinking hard about the next phase of conservative governance. Somewhere out there is a younger, sitting senator (maybe a guy like South Dakota's John Thune) or a governor (someone like Pawlenty or Indiana's Mitch Daniels) who may aspire to something besides appeasing the discontent of a movement. From such less-intuitive candidacies, as Obama himself well knows, less intuitive outcomes are born.

HEADLINE: Much To Love, And Hate, In a VAT

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President George W. Bush.

 BODY:
THE policy world is abuzz with talk about whether a value-added tax should be part of the solution to our long-term fiscal problems. Most recently, Paul A. Volcker, head of President Obama's economic advisory board, said a VAT was ''not as toxic an idea'' as it used to be. 
 But is it actually a good idea? Regardless of whether your politics lean left or right, the VAT gives you some things to love and some to hate. 
 Let's start with the basics. Economists define a business's ''value added'' as the revenue it gets from the sale of goods and services, minus the amount it pays for goods and services. So, for example, if a farmer sells wheat to a miller for $1, the miller sells flour to a baker for $2, and the baker sells bread to a customer for $3, each of the three producers has a value-added of $1.
 (For simplicity, I am assuming that the farmer does not buy anything to grow the wheat.)
 Now let's invoke a piece of advanced mathematics: $1 + $1 + $1 = $3. That is, the value of the final product -- the $3 bread -- is the sum of the value-added along the chain of production. 
 This leads to the first and most important insight about a value-added tax: It is essentially the same as a retail sales tax. The government could impose, say, a 10 percent retail sales tax, causing the baker to add 30 cents to the price of bread. Or it could impose a 10 percent tax on value-added. In this case, the farmer raises the price of wheat to $1.10, the miller raises the price of flour to $2.20 (reflecting both the tax and the higher price of wheat), and the baker raises the price of bread to $3.30. Either way, the consumer pays 10 percent more for the final product.
 Although a value-added tax is just another form of a retail sales tax, a VAT has the advantage of being harder to evade. Tax experts believe that large retail sales taxes lead to compliance problems, which we can avoid by collecting the same tax along the chain of production.
 So that's what a VAT is. What is there to love and hate about it?
 For liberals, the main advantage of a VAT is that it would be a source of revenue to fund a robust, compassionate government. Over the past century in the United States, the federal government has expanded the social safety net, including programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and, most recently, the insurance subsidies in Mr. Obama's health care overhaul. Yet Congress has been more successful promising benefits than finding the revenue to pay for them. A VAT could solve that problem.
 Yet liberals balk at the distributional impact of a VAT. The tax has the same effect on rich and poor, as gauged by a proportion of their spending. But because high-income households save a higher fraction of their income, they will pay a lower fraction of their income.
 Whether this distribution of the tax burden is fair is open to debate. (What is indisputable is that adding it without subtracting something else would violate Mr. Obama's campaign pledge not to raise taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year.)
 CONSERVATIVES emphasize an altogether different set of concerns. For them, the main disadvantage of a VAT is that it would be a source of revenue to fund a large, intrusive government.
 Western Europe is a case in point. Many nations there have large governments financed in part by value-added taxes. Europeans also typically work less than Americans and, as a result, have lower income per person. While sorting out cause-and-effect among these international differences is hard, many conservatives agree with Edward C. Prescott, a Nobel laureate in economics whose research suggests that Europe's lower income is largely attributable to its higher tax rates.
 On the other hand, conservatives have long argued that the American tax system is grossly inefficient and impedes the economy's ability to reach its full potential. They contend that taxing consumption is better than taxing income, and a value-added tax does exactly that.
 Moreover, a VAT is the twin of the flat tax that conservatives sometimes advocate. To see why, imagine that we started with a VAT. Then we add a wrinkle: We allow businesses to deduct wages, in addition to the cost of goods and services. We also require households to pay a tax on their wage income.
 Other than shifting the responsibility for the tax on wages from the business to the household, it might seem that we haven't done anything significant. Indeed, we haven't. But the new tax system would no longer be a VAT. It would be the flat tax that Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka first proposed back in 1981.
 So why, if these two tax systems are really the same, are conservatives attracted to the flat tax and repelled by the VAT? It is because the flat tax is usually proposed as a substitute for our current tax system, whereas the VAT is often suggested as an addition to it.
 The bottom line, from both political perspectives, is that a VAT is neither blessed nor evil. It is a tool. We can use it to advance a larger government, a more efficient tax system or some combination of the two.
 That will be the key issue in the coming debate.

HEADLINE: The Real World 44

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER. 
Ashley Parker works for the editorial department in the Washington bureau of The Times. This is her first feature article for the magazine.

 BODY:
''This party,'' Herbie Ziskend announced, ''is in honor of John Quincy Adams.'' The dirty-blond, blue-eyed 24-year-old, who once handled luggage for Barack Obama's campaign and now works in the vice president's office as a staff assistant, stood in the living room of a red-brick row house in Washington and flung his arms in the air as if to pay tribute to America's sixth president. Then he paused, deflated: ''But the police are here.'' 
 Blue lights flashed through a window as Ziskend and a housemate, Jake Levine, went onto the porch to talk with the cops and promise to quiet things down. Levine, who is now 26, is a policy analyst in the energy-and-climate-change office of the White House. He and Ziskend, along with their other two housemates -- Eric Lesser, 25, and Josh Lipsky, 24, who were then both White House staff assistants -- were giving a party last July in their group house in Logan Circle, a neighborhood just east of Dupont Circle. People shifted nervously as they checked their BlackBerries and cellphones and talked about heading out. Ziskend reappeared. ''Everybody, it's O.K.,'' he said, grinning. ''Party is on.''
 ''Herbie, Herbie, Herbie,'' came the chant. As a joke, someone called out ''Eric Lesser,'' and the cheer shifted: ''Er-ic Les-ser! Er-ic Les-ser!'' The revelers, a cross section of young, political Washington, were shouting for David Axelrod's moon-faced, sweet-tempered special assistant, who also worked on the campaign as a baggage boy. Axelrod is Obama's senior adviser and alter-ego, and Lesser is usually running his life, deciding how much brown sugar he can have in his oatmeal to keep his waistline in check or making sure he is on time for meetings with the president. He plays Felix to Axelrod's messy, disorganized Oscar and is something of a sprightly West Wing mascot: neurotic and prepared but earnest and funny in a kid-brother way. In a muggy room to the right of the front door, Lesser danced to the Jay-Z remix of ''Beware of the Boys,'' by Panjabi MC, bounding up and down as a circle formed around him. Sweaty and beaming, he bounced with the energy that comes from being still fresh from college -- not too many years after he was elected high-school class president with a ''Lesser of Two Evils'' campaign slogan.
 Downstairs in the kitchen, a collection of young West Wing aides, former members of the advance staff on the campaign, newly minted press officers, White House softball regulars and the occasional journalist crowded in front of half a dozen bottles of cheap liquor, trying to get a drink. Obama's chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, a sloe-eyed 28-year-old, was politely letting a stream of people cut in front of him to refill their beer, only to step up to find a dwindling trickle of foam. The keg was kicked.
 Back by the front door, Ziskend's eyes widened. ''Look who just walked in!'' he said. ''The counsel.'' It was the principal deputy White House counsel, Daniel Meltzer, who is 58, in a pale green T-shirt and slacks. ''Looks like you're O.K. here,'' he said to Lesser, surveying the sweaty scene.
 ''You have to do a keg stand,'' Lesser said.
 Alejandra Campoverdi, the 30-year-old special assistant to the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, had just come with Meltzer from a different party, where Gregory Craig, then the 64-year-old White House counsel, was another unlikely ''adult'' guest. At the earlier get-together, Meltzer and Norman Eisen, the 49-year-old White House ethics adviser, offered a ride home to some of the young staff members, who instead urged them to come along to the next house. So Meltzer had given Campoverdi and a few other West Wing staff members a ride over to this party in his minivan. ''Dan Meltzer's minivan,'' she laughed, curled up on the stairs.
 President Obama's young staff and their senior counterparts mix seamlessly and often sweetly. During the primaries, Axelrod once dropped by a party at the Pad -- a group house in Chicago where seven campaign staff members lived, worked and played the video game Rock Band. The rumpled, over-50 ''Axe,'' as nearly everyone calls him, impressed the crowd by playing a game of beer pong. Now in Washington, he still makes the rare appearance at parties for junior staff members. When friends of the 31-year-old deputy communications director, Jen Psaki, gave her an afternoon engagement party at the Cork wine bar near Logan Circle, Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, and Axelrod came by, arriving with Lesser.
 When Barack Obama's presidential campaign began on a clear and frigid day in Springfield, Ill., in 2007, the young men and women who would shovel snow in Iowa, crash on couches in Pittsburgh and pass up grad school to join it could not quite grasp that two years later their journey would end at the Oval Office. They also could not imagine all of the unseen difficulties that would await them -- everything from a cratering economy and an attempt at a Christmas Day terrorist attack to plummeting poll numbers as their president fell to earth. Showing up to work each day at the most prestigious address in America can feel a bit like finals week in college. They are always on call, always working hard. To these mostly 20-something staff members, Obama is a strict father, one with high expectations, whom they don't want to disappoint. Michelle Obama is more of a big sister, tapping her toes about when that boyfriend is ever going to propose or playing Cupid by suggesting a match. She gives young, single White House staff members the kind of dating tips she offered in Glamour magazine's December issue, warning young women: ''Cute's good. But cute only lasts for so long.''
 ''What do you say to the first lady?'' one male staff member, dubious of the first lady's efforts to set him up, moaned to me during dinner at the J&G Steakhouse in the W Hotel last summer. '' 'I didn't like her? She wore a push-up bra?' ''
 As the months have gone by, the young staff members in Obama's White House have grown more comfortable and confident, reshaping the city around them in their image -- idealistic, earnest, geeky, understated, wise-cracking. They are walking and talking in the halls of the federal government, helping to shape the country in real ways, just as harried young aides did on ''The West Wing'' TV show they watched growing up. They may yet grow arrogant, but for now they have settled into the more quotidian realities of day-to-day governing. They are also growing wary and fatigued. They have learned that their president is not invincible, and they are less cocky in their once unshakable certainty that their guy always does just the right things in just the right ways. They are learning that Washington often changes you more than you change it. They have also become more circumspect, as they have learned how hard it is to stay in the public's good graces and how elusive bipartisan tranquility can be.
 ''I KNOW THERE ARE people planning parties who just sit back and scheme about how they can get a Jon Favreau,'' Al Hunt, the executive editor for Bloomberg News in Washington, told me not long after Obama took office. The young Obama crowd is polite and gracious, but they are uninterested in mingling with the old guard. They've taken their social network from the campaign trail and transplanted it to Washington. The young stars would rather spend a night hanging out together on the roof of the W Hotel or playing video games at someone's apartment than hobnob with traditional Washington. ''Who's Sally Quinn?'' Ziskend asked me, half earnest, half confused, on a Sunday afternoon in February when I mentioned the longtime Washington Post writer and Georgetown dinner-party hostess.
 ''I feel weird about D.C.,'' Favreau, a native of North Reading, Mass., said a year ago while sitting in a hotel bar across Lafayette Square from the White House. ''If I left D.C. I don't think I'd say I miss this or that about D.C. I'd miss the people that I have here.'' The young Obama staff members brought with them the almost college-style friendships that came from celebrating New Year's in Sioux City together and riding Chicago's chilly L train an hour into headquarters each morning. They share a tendency to go everywhere in cliques that have been dubbed ''frat packs'' by a Washington gossip columnist. ''There is a group of us who went through this campaign, this very long and difficult campaign, in Chicago, away from Washington, and we forged ties there and worked as such a great team,'' Favreau said.
 After one of the blizzards this winter that left Washington white and glistening, Lesser and Ziskend were sitting by a sunny window in Cafe Dupont, paging through the paper and reflecting on their first year in the city. (Disclosure: Lesser is dating one of my housemates. They met while I was reporting this story and began seeing each other shortly thereafter.) Their tight campaign friendships, the two agreed, helped them to do their jobs. ''We're all part of a team, and it doesn't serve the team well to have one person taking credit for something,'' Lesser said. ''We're friends with our co-workers, so why would you want to take credit for something and not share it with your friends.''
 Ziskend, wearing jeans and winter boots, was nodding, but then he leaned forward in his seat and gestured to himself and Lesser with a self-deprecating laugh. ''Also, for us, we're 24,'' he said. ''There's obviously nothing we're taking credit for.''
 LESSER USUALLY DRAGS himself out of bed at 5:45 a.m. He scans the newspapers online -- The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post. He scrolls through that morning's press clippings and deals with the e-mail messages that are already glowing on his BlackBerry screen. Then he showers, puts on a suit and is out the door no later than 6:50 to meet Axelrod at his downtown apartment. The nearly inseparable pair ride to work together, and then the hyperorganized Lesser (Axelrod jokingly says he has ''O.C.D.'') spends the rest of his day nurturing and nagging his boss like an anxious mother. ''Rahm calls it the '7:45 a.m. tea,' '' Lesser said, referring to when he interrupts the senior staff meeting to deliver Axelrod his steaming cup of Earl Grey.
 Lesser, coming down with a cold, was sitting in Cork, the wine bar, a few months ago, nursing a tumbler of juice (a ''virgin orange juice,'' he told the bartender, earnestly) and talking about an average day in the White House. The rest of the morning, he says, rushes by in a blur -- an 8:30 a.m. department-head meeting in the Roosevelt Room, a 10:30 a.m. economic briefing with the president, a senior advisers' meeting, a working lunch for his boss, all while Lesser tweaks the schedule, fields calls from reporters and fits in urgent meetings with members of Congress and top advisers.
 At 2 p.m. or so, all of the speechwriters arrive for a 30-minute meeting with Axelrod. ''David's like a professor, and it's like office hours,'' Lesser joked. The speechwriters line up in the hall outside Axelrod's office to wait for him and, much to the amusement of other West Wing staff members who pass by, they can look like a gaggle of eager and overgrown schoolchildren. The president once strolled past and said, ''Oh, are you guys waiting to see the principal?''
 Axelrod often has an 8 p.m. working dinner, and Lesser leaves sometime after him, aiming to be out by 8:30 or 9 p.m. ''on a good day.'' He savors his 15-minute walk home -- down the asphalt driveway, out the northwest gate of the White House and into the night. But he's perpetually on call and checks his BlackBerry one last time before he eases into bed, typically around midnight.
 Lesser's long days are like those faced by many young, ambitious people in Washington and elsewhere -- the long hours, the late-night requests, the unforeseen surprises and stresses. The job -- serving the White House -- is their life, and everything else is squeezed in around that. Working for the administration means synching up with your boss's schedule, forgoing social niceties like showing up for dates on time and sometimes putting friends and family on the back burner. ''The singular focus you have here is to chip away bit by bit at these very big problems,'' Favreau told me. ''The small amount of time when you're not doing that, I just try to hang around with the friends I have, and that's about it.''
 The transition to governing has been tough for the group that first signed up with the skinny dude with the big ears and funny name. They were a mix of student-council members who grew up obsessed with politics and college grads who happened to be inspired, and they still speak of finding Obama in almost redemptive terms. Favreau, who ended up burned out and disillusioned after working on the unsuccessful 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign, recalls reading Obama's books and listening to his speeches for the first time. ''The only reason I'm still in politics is because of him,'' says Favreau, who adds that he doubts he will write speeches for another politician.
 Lesser says he remembers being a student at Harvard, feeling worried ''about the direction of our country'' and volunteering for Deval Patrick's 2006 campaign for governor of Massachusetts. He watched Obama speak at a rally for Patrick. ''People seemed so excited by him and so excited by what he had to say,'' Lesser says. ''It was so refreshing.'' The Obama campaign, one young West Wing staff member said, was a romantic ''crush'' full of jitters, firsts and ups and downs. Governing, on the other hand, ''is like the way you love your girlfriend'' -- meaningful, but often more taxing and frustrating.
 Losing Edward M. Kennedy's Massachusetts Senate seat to Scott Brown -- and with it, the Democrats' filibuster-proof majority -- was a blow. ''There was a big sense of loss when Massachusetts happened,'' Lesser says. ''Imagine working on a big project that you've immersed your entire life in, and anytime it flashes in front of you and looks like it's not happening, that's scary.'' Ziskend remembers being ''definitely down'' and asking his bosses, How are you guys feeling? ''They were just like, 'This comes with the territory, and sometimes in politics things don't work out,' '' he says. ''It was a good learning experience for me. Don't get your highs too high and your lows too low.''
 Here the lessons of the campaign also helped. David Plouffe, the Obama campaign manager, created a culture where everyone from the baggage handlers to the senior strategists felt that their role was crucial to the larger effort, and the White House staff members echo that now. ''This is the way I can make my small contribution,'' Lesser says. ''I'll be able to look my children in the eye and say, 'When I was in my 20s, I was a small part of something way bigger than myself.' ''
 The campaign, which included a nearly 50-state slog against Hillary Clinton, also taught them that politics, while inspiring, would not be easy. ''I never thought that we would come here and it would be just like -- '' Ziskend paused and snapped his fingers: ''change.''
 After joining an administration led by a fitness buff, Lesser joined a gym. ''Vida,'' he said, referring to Vida Fitness, a trendy, boutique chain in the city that is right down the street from his house in Logan Circle. Lesser and Ziskend joined together last summer. ''At 6 a.m. at Vida, you see like 5 to 10 colleagues,'' Ziskend says. But Lesser soon fell off the low-fat wagon. He didn't always scan menus for healthful options, and as far as the gym, he says, ''I've kind of stopped going.'' He quickly adds, ''I need to get back on it.''
 ''Part of the reason I joined the gym is because all these other people around me go,'' Lesser told me. ''They have just as demanding jobs as me. I have no excuse.'' In Obama's White House, concerns about health start at the top. George W. Bush was a zealous mountain biker who privately griped about a staff member who failed to exercise and even asked a potential Supreme Court nominee about his workout regimen. President Obama also expresses worry about the fitness level of his aides. When Pete Rouse, a longtime Capitol Hill sage who now is one of Obama's three senior advisers, put on some weight, Obama intervened, Rouse told me. The president, who brought his personal trainer with him to Washington from Chicago, offered to buy the 64-year-old Rouse some sessions with the trainer. (Rouse bought his own sessions instead and now works out twice a week.) Young aides with little body fat hit the gym before work at 5:30 a.m. ''It's the only 40 minutes in the day when I'm separated from my BlackBerry, cut off from the world,'' Ziskend says. ''It's freedom.'' It is also an acceptable pass for missing work. One aide, who described Obama as ''very health-conscious,'' told me the president isn't bothered when someone is out of the office on an exercise break.
 Basketball is another encouraged pastime. Obama played pickup basketball on primary days for good luck, and although he has since been criticized for hosting a men-only game of basketball and rarely inviting women to play golf, the hoops ritual has carried down to the younger staff members. Their basketball schedule includes three unofficial games: one on Tuesday night at the Department of Interior; another on Sundays that includes both White House and agency staff members; and a weekend league team.
 On Tuesdays, the secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar; the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Julius Genachowski; Senator Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania; and Senator Jon Tester of Montana used to have an early basketball game. Occasionally, Axelrod would join them. Once or twice, Casey and Tester stayed to play a game or two with the later-arriving junior staff members. Basketball is such an obsession that Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, has been known to jokingly admonish staff members to plan their travel around pickup games.
 Then there is Stotus -- the softball team of the United States (a word play on Potus, the acronym for president of the United States). Stotus, a team made up of White House staff members, gathered on humid summer evenings last year to take on rivals like the Democratic National Committee and then would sometimes celebrate with snacks and drinks afterward at local restaurants and bars. Nonplayers often came out to cheer, thumbing their BlackBerrys as they watched the game. The sports are all in good fun -- a chance to unwind after work and connect with friends -- but an undercurrent of personal fitness runs throughout.
 ''People are commenting on it,'' Ziskend teased Lesser at Cafe Dupont, referring to his housemate's new and improved physique.
 ''Really?'' Lesser asked, laughing. He looked up and added, a touch more seriously: ''Really? Like who?''
 THE OBAMAS ARE the first White House family in modern memory to treat Washington like an actual city. They moved from Chicago, another urban center with a large African-American population, and they invited inner-city children to help with the new garden and to trick-or-treat and hunt Easter eggs at the White House. According to the CBS Radio News correspondent Mark Knoller, the press corps' unofficial White House historian, George W. Bush ate dinner or lunch at a restaurant anywhere in the country only 21 times during his eight years in office; the Obamas dined out nearly a dozen times in their first year alone. In Washington they have gone to places like the French restaurant Citronelle in Georgetown on a date night and to the foodie mecca Blue Duck Tavern for their wedding anniversary. Obama has made a point of stopping by places with Washington street cred -- Five Guys for a cheeseburger and fries and, as president-elect, Ben's Chili Bowl, a D.C. institution known for serving black Washington and, among 20-somethings, for providing late-night hangover cures in the form of half-smokes (a local sausage similar to a hot dog) and chili cheese fries.
 The young White House staff members have formed an unofficial enclave in an area north of the White House, where many live within a 15-minute walk from one another, settling in group houses and apartments in Logan Circle, Dupont Circle, U Street and Columbia Heights. The tiny but distinct neighborhoods bleed into one another, with nightlife emanating out from the U Street corridor. The area, part of which was ravaged during the 1968 riots, is gentrifying but still has a gritty feel. Some of the staff members call it ''campus.'' Older journalists trying to impress their young sources sometimes suggest hip neighborhood places like Cork, the Gibson speak-easy and Marvin, a sleek bistro and bar that has a mural of the iconic Shepard Fairey ''Hope'' poster of Obama's face painted in blue and red on its outside brick wall. Rahm Emanuel was spotted at Marvin one Saturday night, wearing jeans and alternating between two cellphones, drinking a Belgian beer.
 It is hard to pinpoint which came first -- the young Obama crew or the rapidly growing roster of news outlets that now clamor to cover them. The stable of writers for Click, the gossip section of the Web site Politico, prowl parties with digital cameras and camcorders, ready to ask, for example, Jen Psaki, the deputy communications director, what's in her purse, or to write up a sighting of Reggie Love, the president's 6-foot-5 personal aide, at the opening of the Kennedy Center's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' starring Cate Blanchett. In an interview on the campaign trail, Jon Favreau told me that sometimes when he would tell women that he was Obama's speechwriter, they wouldn't believe him. ''To which I reply,'' he says, '' 'if I really wanted to hit on you, don't you think I'd come up with something more outlandish?' '' But now being Obama's anything is glamorous. ''There have been a ton of A-list celebrities coming here, unlike under the Bush administration -- they're getting behind a cause, because it's cooler now to be political,'' Kiki Ryan, a nightlife reporter for Click, says. ''When they come here, they sometimes get a White House tour, and they Twitter about it.'' MTV's ''Real World: Washington, D.C.'' began in December; Bravo will set its next ''Real Housewives'' and ''Top Chef'' in D.C.; and Arianna Huffington is reworking ''Three's Company'' into a show for ABC about three freshman members of Congress who live together.
 For decades, young Washington staff members had to worry about steering clear of the gossip pages and not embarrassing their high-profile bosses. Edward McNally, a lawyer who worked as a 21-year-old press intern in Ronald Reagan's White House and as a speechwriter in Bush senior's West Wing, said he and his young colleagues always feared ''the personality column in The Washington Post.'' McNally told me, ''When we slipped, when we misstepped in public, we were scared to death that it would enter the media and that it would mean not only the end of our job but the end of our life.''
 But the cacophonous world of blogs and 24-hour news coverage has added a layer of difficulty for the newest White House staff members. Gordon Johndroe, who joined George W. Bush's White House as a 26-year-old assistant press secretary, says: ''In '01 when we got here, no one had BlackBerries, no one texted, no Twitter, and there were a lot less digital cameras. Now, before you know it, you're texting someone at 3 a.m. -- never a good idea -- and the next day a picture of you doing God only knows what is up on someone's Facebook page.''
 McNally remembers being part of a group of ''kids in their 20s with no money'' who co-opted a Chinese restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue during the Reagan years and transformed it into their own makeshift disco. ''We brought boom boxes and pushed all the tables out of the way and danced until 2 a.m. on Monday night, and no one wore their own shoes home because no one could find them,'' he said. ''Today that scene would have camera phones, texting, video. But we couldn't have felt more safe. You could dance on the tables and not worry.''
 Even so, Obama's young aides offer a contrast to the ones who worked in George W. Bush's administration only a few years ago. Bush promised to ''restore dignity to the White House,'' and the mood inside the administration was subdued from the start, with a reinstated dress code that encouraged women to wear pantyhose. As Matt Latimer observed in his account of his years as a Bush speechwriter, ''Speech-Less,'' there was no hint of Aaron Sorkin's ''West Wing'' sexiness. ''We were more like Rob Lowe's cousins,'' he wrote, ''the ones who didn't go out much.'' When they did go out, Johndroe says, they stuck to creaky haunts close to the White House like Old Ebbitt Grill or bars in the historically preppy enclave of Georgetown. ''The Daily Grill was the place to go on Thursday nights, in Georgetown, and then people would go to Smith Point,'' Johndroe said, referring to the basement bar known for sightings of the Bush twins and its unofficial uniform of popped collars, boat shoes (no socks) and salmon-colored khakis for the men, pearls and Lilly Pulitzer for the women. The president's daughters were perhaps the city's most visible revelers, and their late-night escapades around town became tabloid fodder. (Johndroe, for the record, says he now spends more time on the U Street corridor.)
 The young staff members in the Obama White House have not only helped create a new social scene but also nonchalantly reign over it. Washington, always known as ''Hollywood for Ugly People,'' is now Hollywood, period. Jon Favreau landed on People magazine's most-beautiful-people list and Time magazine's Top 100 most-influential-people list in the same week. Other staff members found themselves ranked in GQ and Maxim, and in fashion spreads in Vanity Fair and Elle. Sam Kass, a 30-year-old White House assistant chef with movie-star looks, was also named one of People magazine's 100 most-beautiful people in 2009. He sometimes is teased by his co-workers with the nickname ''100.'' The actress Rashida Jones came to Washington for the White House Correspondents Dinner and left romantically linked to Favreau. Kal Penn, who is 33, traded his Hollywood career in the ''Harold and Kumar'' movies and in Fox's ''House'' for a comparatively low-paying job as associate director of the White House Office of Public Engagement.
 Still, Rahm Emanuel told me dryly, ''It's not like Larry Summers and Tim Geithner go clubbing with these guys.''
 The staff members are quick to play down their lives as characters on an inside-the-Beltway reality-TV show. ''Do you really think Rahm Emanuel cares if his assistant ends up on Click?'' one staff member asked. ''He has so much more to worry about. And we work for the most visible guy in the world, so who cares about us?''
 ''You have to remember, inside the building nobody cares,'' Lesser said, and Ziskend finished his sentence: ''And that's where you spend most of your time -- inside the building or living with them.''
 Darienne Page, the receptionist in the West Wing, is an Iraq-war veteran whom the president jokingly calls ''Rotus,'' for receptionist of the United States. Page, who is 28, has greeted everyone from Tony Blair to Tiger Woods, but she tells people she works at a drugstore in order to deflect attention from her job title.
 ''In D.C. when you go out, everyone asks you, 'What do you do?' '' Page says. ''My answer? 'I work at Walgreens.' Because no one asks, 'Oh, what do you do at Walgreens?' And if you want to be my friend, it's not going to matter that I work at Walgreens. Just like it's not going to matter that I work at the White House.''
 ALEJANDRA CAMPOVERDI glided around the rooftop lounge of the W Hotel. Wearing a slouchy backless black dress and fingering her champagne flute, she slipped among the crowd who had gathered on a Saturday night in September to celebrate her 30th birthday. Her boss, Mona Sutphen, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, was there. So were Jon Favreau and some of his colleagues from the White House speechwriting and press offices. They mixed with Campoverdi's friends from California and some of her former classmates from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. The assistants for Norman Eisen, the White House ethics adviser; Jim Messina, a deputy chief of staff; and Larry Summers, the director of the National Economic Council, took a group picture with Campoverdi when the lights came on. And over by the bar? ''There's Secret Service and World Bank,'' Campoverdi said, pausing to consider. ''You have a little bit of everything.''
 Campoverdi had just started her job in the West Wing after the inauguration when Gawker, the gossip blog, posted old pictures of her posing in Maxim and offered an equally tantalizing piece of gossip: The ''Maxim babe'' was dating the ''hottie'' speechwriter Jon Favreau. Gawker and other blogs turned the benign tidbit into a story and began speculating on her personal life. (She and Favreau remain friends, though the two are no longer dating.) Campoverdi had modeled to pay for college -- print campaigns for Paul Mitchell and Kasil Jeans, a commercial for Pepsi, a 2004 shoot for Maxim -- and after the Gawker posts went viral, the men's magazine included her on its ''Hot 100'' list for 2009, along with Michelle Obama.
 In person, with her glossy brown hair, Campoverdi looks like a cuter, less sultry version of the woman in the Maxim spread. Like most young Obama staff members, she's wary of the spotlight, more likely to enthuse on the causes she's passionate about (health care, immigration reform) than to talk about her ''boring'' social life. Even now, with the slightly more relaxed mood in Washington compared to the grind of the campaign trail, young staff members are nervous about upholding the Obama creed of modesty and discretion. One aide, by way of explaining to me his discomfort at seeing his name in print, referred to the belief that government assistants should have a fierce ''passion for anonymity.''
 Junior staff members carefully guard their images, as part of protecting ''the Obama brand,'' as Desiree Rogers, now the former social secretary, impoliticly said in an interview last year with The Wall Street Journal. Kiki Ryan, the Politico nightlife reporter, says: ''I was at an event with a White House staffer who is very well known. I took a picture of him, and he asked me after would I please not print it, because he didn't want to be associated with parties.'' Another staff member asked a GQ writer to cut a social detail from a story, e-mailing that he was worried he would come off as ''a frat boy.''
 Obama's personal assistant, Reggie Love, can be guarded, a friend of his told me one August night in Love's kitchen, ''because he can't trust people at face value,'' before Love shot him a silencing look. Love, paraphrasing Jay-Z, told me that he is ''just trying to fade to black.'' He added, ''Everything you do represents not only yourself but the office of the president,'' echoing a familiar concern among young staff members.
 This is the uneasy territory of the young Obama aides -- they inhabit a world where they are minicelebrities, enjoying the perks of recognition while simultaneously seeming to shun the spotlight. They say they don't want the attention, that they're here to do a job, and it's hard not to believe them. No matter how low-key they try to be, they are bound to excite envy. But envy is not an emotion that gets the Obama seal of approval. The young aides are quick to say how much they like their jobs and how well they all get along, but jealousy does pop up. There is real tension between those who joined the campaign on Day 1 and the perceived interlopers who came later, especially among the people who felt that they worked hard on the trail and weren't rewarded with top posts. Jobs in the West Wing, with their close proximity to the Oval Office and ''the action,'' are considered the best. ''They don't make TV shows about the Department of Energy,'' a young aide said.
 People gripe about staff assistants who, they feel, have received undeserved press coverage, the ones who didn't start out in Iowa but still landed a plum job, like the person in the next cubicle who has the same portfolio but makes more money. They are careful, however, not to complain too loudly. They have already learned lessons the hard way. When a Washington Post reporter first e-mailed Favreau about a Facebook picture of him groping a cardboard cutout of Hillary Clinton, he couldn't believe it; he never even put the picture up online (a friend from home had naively posted it). But the story became a silly blog sensation during the 2008 campaign, and Favreau had to apologize to Clinton. The incident was a psychological turning point for Obama's staff. Several of them started defriending reporters from their Facebook accounts and internalized the lesson that everyone in Washington eventually learns: nothing is private; everything is on the record.
 Obama doesn't yell, his aides say. He's calm even when he's angry. But his stern glance is far worse than any tirade. To many of his acolytes, the president is a role model. ''This is a person who beat the odds to be a United States senator and who has offered you a job,'' Reggie Love says. ''This was a moment in time where things will only be this way for a little bit, and they were, and I was proud to take the opportunity.''
 More than anything, they repeat, over and over, they don't want to embarrass the president.
 ERIC LESSER LOOKED out over the containers of Thai carryout, the bottles of wine and the Shabbat candles. ''Should we do Shalom Aleichem?'' he asked, and the whole table began singing a warbled but hearty version of the song that welcomes Shabbat. In Lesser's group house of Obama staff assistants, Friday-night Shabbat dinners have become something of a ritual, a chance to relax and spend a few hours with friends, reflecting on the week. Sometimes it's just the four housemates, sometimes it's a large group from the campaign trail or the White House, sometimes it's friends from college and people who happen to be in town.
 Once it was even their bosses -- ''the Bosses Dinner,'' they still call it. David Axelrod, Lesser's boss, was out of town, but others came: Jake Levine's boss, Carol Browner, the White House coordinator of energy-and-climate policy; her husband and her sister; and Ziskend's boss, Jared Bernstein, the vice president's chief economist, along with his wife and their two young kids. Linda Douglass, then the director of communications for the White House office of health reform, was also there.
 Around the table on a late September night, the weekend of Yom Kippur, were the four housemates along with Samantha Tubman, a 30-year-old associate director to the social secretary who helps plan nearly every White House event, and Sam Wilson, 27, the deputy director of broadcast media for the White House office of communications. On the campaign trail, Tubman was a press wrangler, one of the most difficult and least glamorous jobs. She had to make sure the press corps was fed and on time, all while dealing with lost luggage and hotel mishaps. Tubman, who is petite and has a quick, engaging smile, was also an older-sister figure to a lot of the young staff members. ''Do you remember when we met at a coffee shop in Keene, N.H., when I was still a college student?'' Ziskend asked, turning to Tubman.
 At the end of every Friday dinner, the tradition is that everyone goes around the table and says something from the past week for which they're grateful. Over Whole Foods gingerbread and brownies, Lesser looked at his watch and announced, ''O.K., we've got to do this and then get out of here.'' They all had other friends they were trying to see that night.
 Tubman started. She talked about her past week in Pittsburgh at the G-20. It was crazy, chaotic and sleepless -- a bit like life on the trail, she said, and she was appreciative that she got to know some new colleagues in an intimate, campaignlike way. Lesser talked about going home for Rosh Hashanah and how it was nice to be reminded that ''there are people there who I care about and who care about me and who don't care about the stimulus package in Washington.''
 Finally, they all finished saying what they were grateful for, and the group filed out of the house into the misty night. Tubman was going home, but the five men hailed a cab to Columbia Heights, scrambling over one another to squeeze into the back seat, shouting and pointing and laughing. ''They're such boys,'' Tubman said, turning to walk to her Logan Circle apartment just around the corner. ''I love them.''
 Earlier at dinner, Lesser mentioned one of his favorite quotes: ''The best quote is from General Patton,'' he said, referring to the movie about the World War II commander George S. Patton. '' 'All glory is fleeting.'
 ''It's the only thing that's true,'' he said. ''Glory is always fleeting. ''
 LESSER WAS WORKING at the White House on a Sunday evening in ratty jeans and a black polo shirt -- his good luck outfit from Obama's presidential campaign -- when he received the e-mail message. When she received hers, Campoverdi was lounging on her couch in a faded Kennedy School T-shirt and gray pajama shorts, monitoring the health care vote on C-Span and chatting on the phone with her mother, a cancer survivor who recently lost her health coverage when she was laid off as a kindergarten teacher at an inner-city school in Los Angeles. Campoverdi threw on a black dress and hailed the first cab she saw to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In a nearby neighborhood, Favreau saw the message flash across his BlackBerry, so he hopped in his car and drove down 16th Street toward the White House.
 The e-mail message, from the president's personal secretary, summoned a group of about 120 people to the Truman Balcony at the White House residence to celebrate the passage of the health care reform bill with a Champagne toast. The group included all of the top administration officials behind health care reform -- Axelrod, Joe Biden, Nancy-Ann DeParle, Rahm Emanuel, Robert Gibbs, Phil Schiliro, Kathleen Sebelius. But the president wanted a close-knit cadre of young aides to attend as well.
 An emotional Axelrod said that the night health care passed was a bigger deal than election night, because it was what the campaign had been about -- the opportunity to reshape the country and to help average Americans. Obama wanted his young staff to understand that they were part of this moment. So they found themselves in March overlooking the South Lawn of the White House, gazing at the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial in jeans and T-shirts, suits and ties, raising champagne flutes with their president.
 ''It was as excited as I'd seen anyone since election night, since inauguration,'' Favreau later told me. At one point, he saw Axelrod and Gibbs telling Obama some jokes. ''He was laughing so hard,'' Favreau said. ''I'd never seen the president laugh that hard.'' Adam Frankel -- the history buff of the speechwriting staff -- asked if perhaps he could see the Lincoln Bedroom. ''Before I knew it, the president was like, 'Who's coming on the Lincoln Bedroom tour?' '' Favreau recalled. Obama showed off the handwritten Gettysburg Address and said, ''I'm just here by myself tonight, so you can come in, check everything out.''

HEADLINE: Oakland's Journey From Seedy to Sizzling

BYLINE: By CHLOE VELTMAN

 BODY:
Just a few years ago, the Uptown Oakland neighborhood was mostly a dead zone after business hours: an intimidating landscape of gaping doorways, barren sidewalks and abandoned storefronts. Then, in 2006, eight local gallery owners began Art Murmur, a monthly evening tour of their spaces, to showcase the work of clients and promote their businesses. Before long, the Friday tours were attracting so many people that the organizers decided to apply for permits to close off a stretch of 23rd Street so that visitors could wander freely without blocking traffic. 
 Today Art Murmur is a bazaar of cultural activity. The gallery tours have grown to accommodate some 20 art spaces and hundreds of people, and D.J.'s and V.J.'s perform as visitors view the works on display. On the street, musicians, dancers and performance artists entertain passersby while vendors sell hotdogs with sizzling onions. What began as a predominantly hipster local crowd now includes visitors from around the Bay and beyond. Serious art buyers from as far away as New York, Miami and Rio de Janeiro have also begun turning up. 
Art Murmur is just one sign of the recent emergence of Oakland's cultural scene. In February 2009, the Fox Theater joined another grand old theater, the Paramount, in being restored to its former luster. The two auditoriums now attract audiences in the thousands to performances by local arts organizations like the Oakland East Bay Symphony and the Oakland Ballet, as well as by well-known pop music acts like Mary J. Blige, Green Day and Jeff Beck.
 There are now 30 arts festivals that take place in Oakland, up from 2 in the mid-'80s, and about 50 art galleries where there were only a handful a decade ago. Industrial-arts organizations like the Crucible, founded in 1999, have been instrumental in supplying the Burning Man Festival with eye-popping installations.
 This weekend's reopening of the Oakland Museum of California, dedicated to exploring the state's historical, artistic and natural heritage, will be another major step in the city's cultural renaissance. The event will feature 31 continuous hours of free public programming, including gallery tours, performances by local artists, yoga classes and an overnight pajama party. 
 Once regarded as a seedy, crime-ridden port city, Oakland is coming into its own as a cultural destination, and the arts are having a significant economic effect. According to research by the Oakland Cultural Trust, an arts advocacy group, for every dollar that Oakland invests in culture, it gets back four dollars in fees, licenses and taxes. Nonprofit arts in Oakland generate more than $103 million in gross annual economic activity and provide around 5,000 jobs, the trust found.
 Much of the current activity can be traced to Jerry Brown, who served as the city's mayor from 1999 to 2006. Like political leaders elsewhere, Mr. Brown viewed the arts as a way to boost the city's image. Samee Roberts, cultural arts and marketing manager for the City of Oakland, said that Mr. Brown spurred the Fox Theater's restoration and paved the way for the Art and Soul festival, the city's flagship annual community event, featuring art, music, dance, children's activities and food. 
 Real estate has also played a role in the development of Oakland's arts world, as it has in areas like Brooklyn. Faced with increasing rents in San Francisco, many artists and arts organizations have relocated across the Bay since the mid-1990s, finding less expensive quarters in Oakland's many abandoned warehouses and low-income neighborhoods. Ms. Roberts noted that there were around 3,000 artists living in Oakland today, up 30 percent from 10 years ago. 
 Private investment has played a role too. Mr. Brown helped bring in $60 million in redevelopment funds to jump-start the construction of more than 600 residential units in Uptown Oakland. The $75 million rehabilitation of the Fox Theater was largely made possible by the fund-raising efforts of the real estate developer and philanthropist Philip Tagami. Such public and private investment, in turn, has catalyzed the growth of restaurants, clubs and galleries in the area. 
 As local government struggles with its finances during the economic downturn, the role of private investment has become even more central to Oakland's cultural development. The current $42 million shortfall in the city's $400 million budget has led to further proposed cuts in cultural funds. Recent plans by city officials to halve the arts budget, which currently stands at just under $1 million, have recently been dropped because of stiff opposition from the community. Nevertheless, arts funds are expected to fall below $950,000 in the next year. 
 Arts groups here have responded by taking more control over their finances. The Crucible covers most of its $3 million budget by charging for classes, space rental and other programs, said Michael Sturtz, its founder and creative director. The Kinetic Arts Center, which opened in November and offers programs in circus skills, physical theater and fitness, operates mainly as a for-profit entity called a limited liability company. 
 ''Being an LLC provides us with flexibility when it comes to funding,'' said Jennifer Wong, its administrative and marketing director. ''For example, we can apply for small-business loans.'' 
 Despite the challenges of sustaining themselves financially, Oakland's arts groups are cautiously optimistic about the city's cultural prospects.
 ''Oakland is experiencing a wonderful artistic renaissance,'' Mr. Sturtz said. ''But it needs the city to help seed it and grow it.''

ILL FARES THE LAND
 By Tony Judt
237 pp. The Penguin Press. $25.95
 This little book is a cri de coeur -- an outburst of rage and sorrow in equal parts. The language of ''Ill Fares the Land'' is felicitous and polished, as befits such an intelligent and erudite author. But unless the reader belongs to the choir to which Tony Judt preaches -- call it the Europhile liberal left, who would rather sell their Prius than forgo their New York Review of Books -- he or she may ask: Where have we heard this before? A pugnacious reader might stab a felt pen at every other paragraph and scribble: ''Caricature!'' or ''What about . . . ?'' 
 Cries of the heart like Judt's have been common since Jeremiah and the lesser prophets. This time it is not, as according to Amos, the ''virgin of Israel'' who ''is fallen'' because of pride and sinfulness. It is the United States and Britain that have succumbed to the worst of the West: capitalism, greed, egotism -- to the false gods Reagan, Thatcher and Milton Friedman. The wages of sin are the loss of community, trust, equality and social justice. And the true god, according to Judt, a transplanted Briton, is European-style social democracy a la Scandinavia.
 Ever since the Republic was born, Europeans like Talleyrand, Hegel and Heine have loved to finger the United States as the perverted child of the Enlightenment -- while millions of others bolted for the new Promised Land. In 1797, the French thinker Joseph de Maistre found ugly ''symptoms of weakness and decay.'' Europeans will nod enthusiastically when reading Judt's mantra: ''broken highways, bankrupt cities, collapsing bridges, failed schools, the unemployed, the underpaid.'' But as I write this, I read the daily diatribes in the local papers about Hamburg's pothole plague. And I wonder about bridge failures in such properly run countries as Germany, Finland and Switzerland.
 Like the prophets, Judt likes to resort to homily: ''We know what things cost but have no idea what they are worth.'' He also approvingly quotes Tocqueville, who laments that people fear ''every new theory as a danger, every innovation as a toilsome trouble.'' But after delivering his broadsides against ''market radicals'' from Mandeville to Hayek, Judt offers a very old idea: the ''virtue of collective action for the collective good.''
 To get there, Judt has to shoot a goodly number of straw men. Not even manic market radicals believe, as Judt avers, that private interest will produce enough public goods -- like public education or an interstate highway system. Who in the United States (except on the fringes of thought) insists that ''any one person could be completely 'self-made'?'' Certainly not Europe's favorite Beelzebub, George W. Bush, who pushed No Child Left Behind and a prescription drug program for the elderly. What is the land-grant university of the 19th century, what is Head Start, what is federal tuition assistance, what is affirmative action, if not testimony to the belief that the state must level the playing field? 
 Judt doesn't hawk socialism, since he rightly recognizes that it requires ''perfect knowledge (of present and future alike) that is never vouchsafed to ordinary mortals.'' But then he goes overboard: ''The same is true for market theorists: they don't know everything,'' and so ''they don't really know anything.'' Who ever touted their omniscience? What these theorists correctly assert is that the market is the best information system known to man: it has millions broadcasting in real time what is offered and what is wanted at what price. This is why capitalism learns from its crises, whereas the Soviet Union just accumulated them until it collapsed.
 Remember Sweden in the 1990s, until then the emblem of democratic socialism, where the state grabbed more than one-half of G.D.P.? It pumped up a real-estate bubble in the late 1980s, which burst in the early 1990s, driving G.D.P. down by 5 percent and unemployment up to 12 percent. In 1994, the budget deficit soared to 13 percent. This was not America in 2008, but a statist country that fits Judt's dream to a T.
 ''Private wealth and public squalor'' -- the famous line by John Kenneth Galbraith is also Judt's. Guess what: United States government spending at all levels was over 40 percent of G.D.P. last year, which puts it in the neighborhood of such nice bastions of social justice as Norway (41 percent) and Germany (45 percent). Does income inequality cause crime and a host of other pathologies? Judt seeks to prove the point by extracting causation from correlations, a no-no even in his own historian's profession. Crime has plummeted since the early 1990s, while income inequality has risen. As Goldman Sachs shoveled bonuses by the billions, crime kept falling in New York City, as well as nationwide; this has been true even in the current recession. This is not to exculpate Wall Street, but to caution against drawing too much proof from too little evidence. 
 But enough of the fact-slinging. The central problem with ''Ill Fares the Land'' is a classic fallacy of the liberal-left intelligentsia, more in Europe than in the United States. Call it the ''Doctor State Syndrome.'' The individual is greedy, misguided or blind. The state is the Hegelian embodiment of the right and the good that floats above the fray. But the state does not. It is a party to the conflict over ''who gets what, when and how,'' to recall Harold Lasswell's definition of politics. It makes its own pitch for power; it creates privileges, franchises and clienteles. This is why it is so hard to rein in, let alone cut back. The modern welfare state creates a new vested interest with each new entitlement. It corrupts as it does good. 
 It also invites corruption of itself because the more the state distributes and regulates, the more it tempts its citizens to outflank the market and manipulate public power for private gain. The founding fathers grasped this hard truth, and hence they hemmed in government. Even the most moderate of social democrats tend to ignore this insight, and so does Tony Judt. 
 The all-providing state does not expand trust, as Judt claims; it renders trust moot and so, weakens society because it promises to protect its members from their own mistakes. Such a false sense of security explains why Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must share the blame with Lehman and Goldman Sachs. Iceland's and Germany's state banks were hardly more circumspect.
 Sometimes, as in 2008, markets are not self-correcting, which is why government must step in. But let's hope it will pull out again; officials are not wiser or nobler because they come with a government title. They need to be checked and balanced, just like General Motors, Google and Goldman. This is why America has lived with the same constitution since 1787. And why the country's vitality has always overwhelmed its pathologies, as, throughout its history, it has opened itself up to myriad newcomers of all creeds and origins. Judt, the immigrant, should know. He has done better in America in terms of access and fame than an American of the same caliber would have done in Sweden or Germany. It is still easier to escape from the slums of America than from the banlieues of France.

INSECTOPEDIA
 By Hugh Raffles
 Illustrated. 465 pp. Pantheon Books. $29.95
 Hugh Raffles's beautifully written ''Insectopedia'' -- part reference, part narrative and wholly engrossing -- begins with an evocative image. On Aug. 10, 1926, a small monoplane began flying missions from Tallulah, La., to assess the population of insects in a vertical column of air. It was the first time insects had been collected by plane, and the results were astounding. In a square mile, rising to 14,000 feet, there were as many as 36 million insects.
 The amazed researchers began to realize that the atmosphere was unbelievably alive for all our notions of its emptiness: another world, filled with an ever moving, airy regiment. ''They found ladybugs at 6,000 feet during the daytime, striped cucumber beetles at 3,000 feet during the night,'' Raffles writes. ''They collected three scorpion flies at 5,000 feet, 31 fruit flies between 200 and 3,000, a fungus gnat at 7,000 and another at 10,000.'' And at the exalted altitude of 15,000, possibly the highest elevation at which any specimen had yet been taken, a lone ballooning spider was floating on its filaments, its body borne up on unseen currents. It was evidence of an aerial plankton, an ocean over our heads. 
 Insects are all around us. They are the most numerous animals on earth, yet we pay them scant attention. Few of us attend to their innate beauty. More often than not, they are seen as pests sent to plague us (with the notable exception of the now threatened honey bee). ''We simply cannot find ourselves in these creatures,'' Raffles writes. ''The more we look, the less we know. They are not like us. They do not respond to acts of love or mercy or remorse. It is worse than indifference. It is a deep, dead space without reciprocity, recognition or redemption.''
 Insects are faceless, multilegged and compound-eyed aliens, regarded with distrust and disgust. It is such speciesism that Raffles, who teaches anthropology at the New School, seeks to redress in his eccentric encyclopedia. For too long the limelight has been hogged by ''charismatic megafauna'' (in the biologists' dismissive phrase), all those lions and tigers, wolves and whales. It is time insects had their day.
 Raffles's approach is almost perversely eclectic. His alphabetical entries range in subject matter from the personal disgust he feels when he discovers a cockroach sharing the shower in his Manhattan apartment to epic journeys into Asia and Africa and observing cricket-betting in Shanghai and locust-eating in Niger. His essays may take up 20 pages or a mere two paragraphs. But the most satisfying ones illuminate his subject via potted biographies of men and women who are passionate about insects.
 In ''Chernobyl,'' for instance, Raffles offers a cameo of Cornelia Hesse-Honegger, a contemporary artist dedicated to creating near-perfect watercolors of insects deformed by nuclear fallout. This is sci-fi stuff: flies with legs growing out of their eyes, the kind of mutations that in any other animal would elicit our horrified response, yet which, because they occur in such small creatures, seem almost excusable because almost invisible. In the act of depicting them so exactingly, Hesse-Honegger, whose own child, we are told in an upsetting aside, was born with a club foot, ''discovers that the insect is deformed in ways she hadn't noticed before.'' Her aesthetic is that of concrete art, isolated images placed in a grid; her intent is a silent rebuke, a solemn challenge to a world that, even now, is turning again to nuclear power to solve its problems.
 Six entries later -- one is tempted to see this book in musical movements -- Raffles returns to the refrain in ''The Ineffable,'' one of his most wonderful chapters. Here, he describes the work of Joris Hoefnagel, a Flemish miniaturist whose compendium of the world's animals, ''The Four Elements,'' appeared in 1582. Hoefnagel's equally accurate gouaches are a historical counterpoint to Hesse-Honegger's implicitly politicized aesthetic. In his effort to render nature through art, Hoefnagel paints even the shadows beneath his beetles and flies, a surreal effect that, paradoxically, imparts a sense of transcendence. As Raffles writes, ''I began to understand that he wanted me eye to eye with these insects, as close as could be, in direct and transformative confrontation.'' It is the equivalent of the child lying on the lawn on a dreamy summer day, watching earwigs and ants in the grass as they act out another, entirely microscopic existence.
 Raffles's particular gift is to draw the reader into that world, to see it with childish wonder. Yet his is also a darker world. In an intensely affecting entry, starkly titled ''Jews,'' he descends into the depths to which our fear of the Other has taken us. Even before the Holocaust, Jews were configured as vermin, as lice to be destroyed. ''Parasites drain the lifeblood from the body politic,'' Raffles writes. ''But in order for this commonplace to sustain violence, a decisive metamorphosis has to take place: a people must become vermin in fact as well as in metaphor. . . . It is the final collapse of distinction between human and insect; the collapse that allows for extermination.'' In this deathly mutation, the victims of Auschwitz were herded into showers and promised a purification, a delousing; instead they fell to Zyklon B, a powerful insecticide.
 Raffles's entry on ''queer'' insect sex is more life-affirming, and comic, sparked off by an image of a butterfly probing the anus of a rove beetle, ''just two little animals enjoying a little action . . . and feeling pretty good about it,'' as Raffles writes, exhorting, ''We need more queerness!''
 ''Insectopedia'' is nothing if not experimental. In one stream-of-consciousness riff, Raffles recalls nightmares about slithering, sliding, sucking insects, their stick limbs liable to make a lurking attack from any angle, from the air or the ground or even the toilet rim. This is illustrated by a hilarious graphic of a frantic figure assailed by bugs. Throughout the book, Raffles's use of photographs, reminiscent of the German author W. G. Sebald, is matched by the often deadpan tone of his text -- a sense of sly humor of which Sebald would surely have approved.
 Sebald would also have appreciated the book's accumulated effect. As Raffles moves insidiously toward his deft and subtle conclusions, the apparent looseness of his approach falls into sharp focus. What he is telling us about insects and their natural history reveals just as much about us and our human history. In an essay set in Africa, he notes that the span of locust recession -- that is, the area where they breed and aggregate between invasions -- almost exactly coincides with the all too familiar area of human dispute and resource antagonism that cuts a swath from North Africa to the Middle East. Thus the biblical swarm becomes a carrier of contemporary discontent.
 Impossible to categorize, wildly allusive and always stimulating, ''Insectopedia'' suggests an Enlightenment amateur wandering around the world stocking his cabinet of curiosities, unrestricted by notions of disciplines or specializations. Its author is at one moment a scientist in the field, the next an art critic, then an acute historian. His is a disconcerting, fantastical, (multi-)eye-opening journey into another existence, and one thing is for sure: You will neverlook at a cockroach the same way again, even if it is sharing your morning shower.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Fees

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Our $48 Billion Credit Card Bill,'' by Albert A. Foer (Op-Ed, April 21): 
 I was surprised to see Mr. Foer side with the giant retailers who are asking Congress to exempt them from antitrust laws so they can avoid paying market price for the use of credit card transactions -- transactions that make them tens of billions of dollars in additional profits each year.
 The real truth: while everyone loves to grandstand when it comes to the credit card industry, its vast central nervous system drives much of today's economy, allowing for efficient noncash transactions, better safety and recordkeeping, and convenience for consumers and retailers alike. The ''interchange fee'' charged to retailers helps finance this global system.
 The Government Accountability Office recently found that if giant retailers like Costco and Target are successful with this campaign, consumers could be hurt. Families would pay an estimated $400 a year that would otherwise be paid by the retailers. The retailers even opposed a Congressional proposal that would ensure consumer benefit from any reduction in interchange fees.
 Further, contrary to Mr. Foer's implication, the G.A.O. found that retailers likely pocketed the $1 billion in ''savings'' in Australia when the government there mandated lower interchange fees.
 Financial reform should not be about backroom deals for special interests and hidden taxes on consumers. Nor should it be about ''fixing'' parts of the system -- like interchange -- that actually serve consumer interests.

HEADLINE: In Broadway Lights: No Vacancy

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
AFTER opening in November to some of the best reviews of the theater season, the Off Broadway production of ''The Orphans' Home Cycle'' seemed on a fast track for Broadway. Three of New York's most prominent play producers began trying to raise $2.5 million to move the show, even though its length (nine hours, broken into three parts) and lack of star performers made it an iffy investment for commercial Broadway. But the producers thought the show, the final opus of the acclaimed writer Horton Foote, had a good shot at Tony Awards -- which go only to Broadway productions -- and they believed that a wide audience would want to see the work, given the huge demand for tickets at its 160-seat Off Broadway house. 
 Yet ''Orphans'' did not go to Broadway this winter; the obstacle ended up not being money, the show's running time or its cast of no-names. ''We couldn't get the right theater,'' one of its producers, Daryl Roth, said in January when the decision was made. (Her team is now aiming for the fall.) ''Real estate is really difficult to come by on Broadway these days. And it's too bad, because some great shows aren't being seen.''
Broadway has 40 theaters, and hunting for an available one has become an increasingly competitive sport. For starters, 15 or so are routinely locked up with long-running shows like ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' which has kept the Majestic Theater off the market for 22 years. For the remaining theaters the edge goes to shows that have the makings of a smash hit because of their pedigree, their stars or their originality, like ''Billy Elliot: The Musical'' and ''A Steady Rain,'' which starred Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig. Those productions were both hotly pursued by Philip J. Smith, chairman of the Shubert Organization, Broadway's biggest theater owner, who said in a recent interview that he shuffled around other shows to secure prime theaters for ''Billy'' and ''Steady Rain'' because he sensed they would be huge moneymakers -- as proved true.
 In a twist, some theaters have to go vacant for long stretches while they wait for these presumed blockbusters to come in. The Hilton Theater has been empty since January 2009 waiting for ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,'' the much-delayed musical that is now expected late this year. The Neil Simon Theater has been dark since this past January, when ''Ragtime'' closed earlier than hoped due to poor ticket sales; that theater is now waiting for ''Love Never Dies,'' the sequel to ''Phantom'' that has been delayed until the spring of 2011.
 A result, according to theater producers as well as owners, is an uphill climb for plays like ''Orphans'' and some musicals seeking an open Broadway stage -- which, in turn, determines the shows and actors that audiences have a chance to see.
 ''I've never seen it more competitive, or the supply-and-demand imbalance more stark,'' said Mr. Smith, whose Shubert group owns 17 theaters. ''For the next Broadway season, which begins after Labor Day 2010, we don't have a single theater available. Not one. Everything is committed, and several theaters already have one or two backup shows if a commitment falls through.''
 Tom Hulce, a lead producer of the new musical ''American Idiot,'' echoed Mr. Smith as he described the waiting process to see if the St. James Theater -- his first choice -- would be available this spring. The revival of the musical ''Finian's Rainbow'' opened there in October to strong reviews but struggled to sell tickets and ended up closing in mid-January. ''None of us wanted 'Finian's' to fail, but we were also really hoping for the St. James,'' Mr. Hulce said; ''American Idiot'' opened at the St. James two weeks ago. ''Whether you can get your first-, second-, third-choice theater -- or any theater -- has just become totally unpredictable.''
 Among the factors on the supply side is the lack of new space. Thirty-one Broadway theaters were built between 1910 and 1930, but only five theaters opened between 1930 and 1990; and five were either built or reopened since. Two decades ago plenty of theaters went dark for long stretches, while others started to host blockbuster musicals: ''Cats,'' ''Les Miserables'' and ''Phantom'' in the 1980s; ''Miss Saigon,'' ''Beauty and the Beast,'' ''Chicago'' and ''The Lion King'' in the '90s; and ''Mamma Mia!,'' ''Wicked'' and ''Jersey Boys'' in the last decade.
 On the demand side there is greater investor interest in Broadway, where box office revenues topped $1 billion for the first time last year, and has been remarkably resilient even during the Great Recession. This season celebrities like Elton John (''Next Fall''), Will Smith (''Fela!'') and Candy Spelling (''Promises, Promises'') are producing on Broadway; far more people with lower profiles are looking to produce or be hands-off major investors as well. The high costs of producing Off Broadway and at regional theaters have only reduced out-of-town tryouts for shows; ultimately it's Broadway where art, critical adulation, awards and profits mix to maximum effect.
 ''So many people want their shows on Broadway these days, and some shows want to get there quickly, even though it takes time to really develop a great show,'' said Barry Weissler, the longtime producer of musical revivals like ''Chicago'' and the new ''Cage Aux Folles.''
 He is also among the lead producers of ''The Scottsboro Boys,'' the new John Kander-Fred Ebb musical which played Off Broadway this spring; Mr. Weissler ruled out a quick move to Broadway this season because he could not find a suitable theater. Instead the show will go to the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis this summer for further development as the producers wait for an intimate-feeling Broadway house for next season. Other shows that considered Broadway moves this season but could not find theaters include the Off Broadway hits ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' and ''Venus in Fur.'' 
 Finding the right house is its own tall order, full of variables. Producers say they look first for a theater that will complement the particular show, from atmospherics and intimacy, sightlines and acoustics, to the preferences of the given director or star. ''It's a magical, almost impossible-to-describe vibe that producers look for in houses,'' said Jordan Roth, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway houses. (The other major Broadway owner is the Nederlander Organization, with nine houses.) ''Finding the right theater for the art and for the number of seats and tickets you need to sell, and then having the theater be available, is the best scenario on Broadway.''
 Mr. Weissler, for instance, seeks a theater for next season for his planned revival of the musical ''Zorba'' that would suit not only a bucolic Mediterranean set design but also the desire of his star, Antonio Banderas, to avoid performing in one of Broadway's bigger theaters. (Houses range in size from about 600 seats to about 1,900, with 15 having more than 1,300 seats.) ''We'd like to build the set out into the audience somewhat, and we have Antonio's wish to keep the production intimate, so that the audience feels they are on a journey across the cliffs of Crete,'' he said.
 Another producer, Jeffrey Richards, said he put in for the Cort Theater for ''You're Welcome America,'' Will Ferrell's show about George W. Bush, last season, and the Ethel Barrymore Theater for David Mamet's play ''Race'' this season, because Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Mamet preferred those theaters. ''I frequently consult with the director, author, sometimes the star, because of course you want them to be where they feel they can do their best work,'' Mr. Richards said.
 Along with artistic needs there's also the question of the right number of seats to sell to cover a show's weekly running costs, start paying back investors and earn a profit down the road.
 Few factors can be as consequential to a show's success as a theater's seating capacity. Too many seats, for instance, can be a mood killer if some go empty and audience members feel they are at a show no one else wants to see. It can also be a financial headache because bigger theaters tend to charge more rent. On the other hand, a relatively small number of seats can cut both ways: producers may lose out on theatergoers and profits if the show is a hit, but they may also be able to sell more seats at premium prices of up to $350.
 As a case study in the complex calculus of theater size, consider the fortunes of David Stone, the lead producer of the musical ''Next to Normal'' and a producer of the runaway hit ''Wicked.'' According to associates of Mr. Stone, he was originally lukewarm on the Gershwin Theater for ''Wicked'' because he was concerned it was too big -- with 1,933 seats, it's the largest on Broadway -- and because other shows have had a tough track record there. But the size proved to be a gold mine. Last winter ''Wicked'' became the first show in Broadway history to bring in more than $2 million in a week. (Mr. Stone declined to comment for this article.)
 With ''Next to Normal,'' meanwhile, Mr. Stone was bound for the Longacre Theater until his first choice, the Booth Theater, became available. Associates said he decided to move to the Booth because it has a more intimate feel than the Longacre, with 300 fewer seats, and roughly the same number of orchestra seats (500) that charge the highest prices. 
 The Booth also enjoys more foot traffic on 45th Street compared to the Longacre three blocks north; many theater producers believe that being in a house on 44th or 45th Street in itself translates into more box-office business, as much as 5 percent more for a well-known show. No theater owners or producers had data to support that theory, but in an interview in March Mr. Stone credited foot traffic as one factor in helping ''Next to Normal'' earn back its $4 million capitalization.
 Mr. Smith of the Shubert Organization, which owns both the Booth and the Longacre, said: ''David was very, very happy when I called him to say that the Booth was suddenly available, because it was his first-choice theater all along. Every producer comes in looking for a theater on 44th and 45th Streets, because of the old tradition of people walking from theater to theater to theater to theater on those crowded streets at 7:30 p.m. asking the box offices, 'Do you have any tickets left?' ''
 Among those prime theaters is the Golden, on 45th Street; producers of ''Orphans,'' ''Red'' and the musicals ''All About Me'' and ''Everyday Rapture'' were competing for it this winter. The Shubert group initially gave the house to ''All About Me,'' considering the money-making potential of its stars, Michael Feinstein and Barry Humphries (better known as Dame Edna Everage), but the producers decided that, at 804 seats, it was too small to make their financial numbers work. 
 The lead producer of ''Red,'' Arielle Tepper Madover, was next in line because she had made the clearest, earliest commitment to the Shubert Organization, Mr. Smith said; for good measure, she charmed him and his colleagues by sending them bags with paint brushes and red paint. The theater went to ''Red.''

Some producers believe that simply being on those streets helps generate more ticket sales than being at other theaters. But available Broadway theaters are so scarce these days that some producers are taking the best houses they can get anywhere in the theater district
the Cort, for instance, has had several commercial hits recently, like ''A View from the Bridge'' and ''Fences,'' in spite of its location on 48th Street off Seventh Avenue. (Sources: Reporting by Patrick Healy

HEADLINE: A New Jobs Initiative Gains Converts

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
Amid the hum of a South Side commercial laundry, two young women fed newly cleaned aprons into a machine that had eight rollers rotating slowly over a large metal plate. 
 At the other end were colleagues who accepted and folded the ironed linens to be delivered to hotels, restaurants and banquet halls. For the two women, Kiana Miles and Elana Williams, the machine and its unceasing routine are engines for a fresh start in life.
Ms. Miles, 19 and a single mother, and Ms. Williams, 24 and recently homeless, just finished a second week at the DeNormandie Towel and Linen Supply Company. They're delighted to be employed, with Ms. Miles willing to rise at 5:15 a.m. and take two long bus rides to start work at 7. 
 They benefit from Put Illinois to Work, a program announced by Gov. Patrick J. Quinn last week amid skimpy news media coverage at odds with the state's economic travail. The effort, which started April 1, involves $215 million in federal stimulus dollars funneled through the existing Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Emergency Fund. 
 So far, it suggests efficiency and creativity by a much-maligned state administration. You can chide Governor Quinn for not getting any traction for his tax program, but you've got to give him credit for getting some people back to work. 
 The state fulfilled a 20-percent match requirement by having employers provide in-kind contributions in training. In return for the federal government's picking up the $10-an-hour salary, employers provide oversight and instruction in ''soft skills'' like timeliness and collegiality. 
 It's not the traditional work force training program -- aimed at creating higher-skilled workers -- which has an uneven history. This one deals narrowly with an economic emergency and singles out those dependent on child care; seeks to employ 20,000 people statewide by mid-June; plans active outreach, including through churches; and uses subcontractor groups to provide site visits. 
 The money runs out on Sept. 30. Then tax credits kick in for employers who keep the new workers full-time. Even if the workers are cut loose, the hope is that they will have gained new skills. 
 ''I've been in this field for 32 years, and this is unprecedented,'' said Joseph A. Antolin, executive director of the Heartland Alliance. The group is a service-based nonprofit that focuses on economic, housing, health and legal issues for the needy and is the central administrative coordinator of the program. 
 ''There's little bureaucracy, and this gets people back to work quickly,'' Mr. Antolin said of the program.
 It is meant for parents of children under 18, and whose income is less than 200 percent of the poverty line. For a family of four, that's $3,676 or less a month. 
 John Dernis, co-owner of the family-run Michael's Fresh Market, appreciates the overriding need. In February, Mr. Dernis received 2,500 applications for 80 jobs at a new store in Downers Grove. He will hire five to seven workers under the needy families program, to stock shelves and work as cashiers. 
 ''I think this is a great idea,'' he said, and praised the state's performance so far.
 Mr. Dernis raised the prospect that some of the hires could work out so well that ''we'll train them to be butchers, managers, whatever.'' 
 At DeNormandie Towel and Linen Supply, a family-owned company dating to 1903, the training program melds with a tradition of community giving, especially through summer employment programs. And though the company has 65 employees and didn't have obvious openings -- business is down for restaurants and hotels because of fewer customers -- it decided that it couldn't spurn the Heartland Alliance's entreaty to assist. 
 The first hires did fizzle, said Rich Normandie, 28, the general manager and the fifth generation to work at the company. But he's delighted with the six women who followed and said they had already shown potential for advancement. 
 Ms. Miles did not finish high school, and her last job was in 2007, as a hair stylist. Ms. Williams has both a high school diploma and a college associates degree in administration. But she wound up in a shelter, before connecting with the Heartland Alliance to find an apartment and, now, a job. 
 ''It helps pay the rent and gives me a chance to add to my resume,'' she said. 
 That the governor's formal announcement in Chicago elicited few news stories was deflating, if predictable. Local news media preferred to interrogate Mr. Quinn ad nauseam about that day's fleeting obsession: whether the National Guard should quell Chicago violence. 
 Fortunately, getting the state back to work might just be easier than getting the news media to care.

HEADLINE: The Real World 44

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER. 
Ashley Parker works for the editorial department in the Washington bureau of The Times. This is her first feature article for the magazine.

 BODY:
''This party,'' Herbie Ziskend announced, ''is in honor of John Quincy Adams.'' The dirty-blond, blue-eyed 24-year-old, who once handled luggage for Barack Obama's campaign and now works in the vice president's office as a staff assistant, stood in the living room of a red-brick row house in Washington and flung his arms in the air as if to pay tribute to America's sixth president. Then he paused, deflated: ''But the police are here.'' 
 Blue lights flashed through a window as Ziskend and a housemate, Jake Levine, went onto the porch to talk with the cops and promise to quiet things down. Levine, who is now 26, is a policy analyst in the energy-and-climate-change office of the White House. He and Ziskend, along with their other two housemates -- Eric Lesser, 25, and Josh Lipsky, 24, who were then both White House staff assistants -- were giving a party last July in their group house in Logan Circle, a neighborhood just east of Dupont Circle. People shifted nervously as they checked their BlackBerries and cellphones and talked about heading out. Ziskend reappeared. ''Everybody, it's O.K.,'' he said, grinning. ''Party is on.''
 ''Herbie, Herbie, Herbie,'' came the chant. As a joke, someone called out ''Eric Lesser,'' and the cheer shifted: ''Er-ic Les-ser! Er-ic Les-ser!'' The revelers, a cross section of young, political Washington, were shouting for David Axelrod's moon-faced, sweet-tempered special assistant, who also worked on the campaign as a baggage boy. Axelrod is Obama's senior adviser and alter-ego, and Lesser is usually running his life, deciding how much brown sugar he can have in his oatmeal to keep his waistline in check or making sure he is on time for meetings with the president. He plays Felix to Axelrod's messy, disorganized Oscar and is something of a sprightly West Wing mascot: neurotic and prepared but earnest and funny in a kid-brother way. In a muggy room to the right of the front door, Lesser danced to the Jay-Z remix of ''Beware of the Boys,'' by Panjabi MC, bounding up and down as a circle formed around him. Sweaty and beaming, he bounced with the energy that comes from being still fresh from college -- not too many years after he was elected high-school class president with a ''Lesser of Two Evils'' campaign slogan.
 Downstairs in the kitchen, a collection of young West Wing aides, former members of the advance staff on the campaign, newly minted press officers, White House softball regulars and the occasional journalist crowded in front of half a dozen bottles of cheap liquor, trying to get a drink. Obama's chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, a sloe-eyed 28-year-old, was politely letting a stream of people cut in front of him to refill their beer, only to step up to find a dwindling trickle of foam. The keg was kicked.
 Back by the front door, Ziskend's eyes widened. ''Look who just walked in!'' he said. ''The counsel.'' It was the principal deputy White House counsel, Daniel Meltzer, who is 58, in a pale green T-shirt and slacks. ''Looks like you're O.K. here,'' he said to Lesser, surveying the sweaty scene.
 ''You have to do a keg stand,'' Lesser said.
 Alejandra Campoverdi, the 30-year-old special assistant to the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, had just come with Meltzer from a different party, where Gregory Craig, then the 64-year-old White House counsel, was another unlikely ''adult'' guest. At the earlier get-together, Meltzer and Norman Eisen, the 49-year-old White House ethics adviser, offered a ride home to some of the young staff members, who instead urged them to come along to the next house. So Meltzer had given Campoverdi and a few other West Wing staff members a ride over to this party in his minivan. ''Dan Meltzer's minivan,'' she laughed, curled up on the stairs.
 President Obama's young staff and their senior counterparts mix seamlessly and often sweetly. During the primaries, Axelrod once dropped by a party at the Pad -- a group house in Chicago where seven campaign staff members lived, worked and played the video game Rock Band. The rumpled, over-50 ''Axe,'' as nearly everyone calls him, impressed the crowd by playing a game of beer pong. Now in Washington, he still makes the rare appearance at parties for junior staff members. When friends of the 31-year-old deputy communications director, Jen Psaki, gave her an afternoon engagement party at the Cork wine bar near Logan Circle, Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, and Axelrod came by, arriving with Lesser.
 When Barack Obama's presidential campaign began on a clear and frigid day in Springfield, Ill., in 2007, the young men and women who would shovel snow in Iowa, crash on couches in Pittsburgh and pass up grad school to join it could not quite grasp that two years later their journey would end at the Oval Office. They also could not imagine all of the unseen difficulties that would await them -- everything from a cratering economy and an attempt at a Christmas Day terrorist attack to plummeting poll numbers as their president fell to earth. Showing up to work each day at the most prestigious address in America can feel a bit like finals week in college. They are always on call, always working hard. To these mostly 20-something staff members, Obama is a strict father, one with high expectations, whom they don't want to disappoint. Michelle Obama is more of a big sister, tapping her toes about when that boyfriend is ever going to propose or playing Cupid by suggesting a match. She gives young, single White House staff members the kind of dating tips she offered in Glamour magazine's December issue, warning young women: ''Cute's good. But cute only lasts for so long.''
 ''What do you say to the first lady?'' one male staff member, dubious of the first lady's efforts to set him up, moaned to me during dinner at the J&G Steakhouse in the W Hotel last summer. '' 'I didn't like her? She wore a push-up bra?' ''
 As the months have gone by, the young staff members in Obama's White House have grown more comfortable and confident, reshaping the city around them in their image -- idealistic, earnest, geeky, understated, wise-cracking. They are walking and talking in the halls of the federal government, helping to shape the country in real ways, just as harried young aides did on ''The West Wing'' TV show they watched growing up. They may yet grow arrogant, but for now they have settled into the more quotidian realities of day-to-day governing. They are also growing wary and fatigued. They have learned that their president is not invincible, and they are less cocky in their once unshakable certainty that their guy always does just the right things in just the right ways. They are learning that Washington often changes you more than you change it. They have also become more circumspect, as they have learned how hard it is to stay in the public's good graces and how elusive bipartisan tranquility can be.
 ''I KNOW THERE ARE people planning parties who just sit back and scheme about how they can get a Jon Favreau,'' Al Hunt, the executive editor for Bloomberg News in Washington, told me not long after Obama took office. The young Obama crowd is polite and gracious, but they are uninterested in mingling with the old guard. They've taken their social network from the campaign trail and transplanted it to Washington. The young stars would rather spend a night hanging out together on the roof of the W Hotel or playing video games at someone's apartment than hobnob with traditional Washington. ''Who's Sally Quinn?'' Ziskend asked me, half earnest, half confused, on a Sunday afternoon in February when I mentioned the longtime Washington Post writer and Georgetown dinner-party hostess.
 ''I feel weird about D.C.,'' Favreau, a native of North Reading, Mass., said a year ago while sitting in a hotel bar across Lafayette Square from the White House. ''If I left D.C. I don't think I'd say I miss this or that about D.C. I'd miss the people that I have here.'' The young Obama staff members brought with them the almost college-style friendships that came from celebrating New Year's in Sioux City together and riding Chicago's chilly L train an hour into headquarters each morning. They share a tendency to go everywhere in cliques that have been dubbed ''frat packs'' by a Washington gossip columnist. ''There is a group of us who went through this campaign, this very long and difficult campaign, in Chicago, away from Washington, and we forged ties there and worked as such a great team,'' Favreau said.
 After one of the blizzards this winter that left Washington white and glistening, Lesser and Ziskend were sitting by a sunny window in Cafe Dupont, paging through the paper and reflecting on their first year in the city. (Disclosure: Lesser is dating one of my housemates. They met while I was reporting this story and began seeing each other shortly thereafter.) Their tight campaign friendships, the two agreed, helped them to do their jobs. ''We're all part of a team, and it doesn't serve the team well to have one person taking credit for something,'' Lesser said. ''We're friends with our co-workers, so why would you want to take credit for something and not share it with your friends.''
 Ziskend, wearing jeans and winter boots, was nodding, but then he leaned forward in his seat and gestured to himself and Lesser with a self-deprecating laugh. ''Also, for us, we're 24,'' he said. ''There's obviously nothing we're taking credit for.''
 LESSER USUALLY DRAGS himself out of bed at 5:45 a.m. He scans the newspapers online -- The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post. He scrolls through that morning's press clippings and deals with the e-mail messages that are already glowing on his BlackBerry screen. Then he showers, puts on a suit and is out the door no later than 6:50 to meet Axelrod at his downtown apartment. The nearly inseparable pair ride to work together, and then the hyperorganized Lesser (Axelrod jokingly says he has ''O.C.D.'') spends the rest of his day nurturing and nagging his boss like an anxious mother. ''Rahm calls it the '7:45 a.m. tea,' '' Lesser said, referring to when he interrupts the senior staff meeting to deliver Axelrod his steaming cup of Earl Grey.
 Lesser, coming down with a cold, was sitting in Cork, the wine bar, a few months ago, nursing a tumbler of juice (a ''virgin orange juice,'' he told the bartender, earnestly) and talking about an average day in the White House. The rest of the morning, he says, rushes by in a blur -- an 8:30 a.m. department-head meeting in the Roosevelt Room, a 10:30 a.m. economic briefing with the president, a senior advisers' meeting, a working lunch for his boss, all while Lesser tweaks the schedule, fields calls from reporters and fits in urgent meetings with members of Congress and top advisers.
 At 2 p.m. or so, all of the speechwriters arrive for a 30-minute meeting with Axelrod. ''David's like a professor, and it's like office hours,'' Lesser joked. The speechwriters line up in the hall outside Axelrod's office to wait for him and, much to the amusement of other West Wing staff members who pass by, they can look like a gaggle of eager and overgrown schoolchildren. The president once strolled past and said, ''Oh, are you guys waiting to see the principal?''
 Axelrod often has an 8 p.m. working dinner, and Lesser leaves sometime after him, aiming to be out by 8:30 or 9 p.m. ''on a good day.'' He savors his 15-minute walk home -- down the asphalt driveway, out the northwest gate of the White House and into the night. But he's perpetually on call and checks his BlackBerry one last time before he eases into bed, typically around midnight.
 Lesser's long days are like those faced by many young, ambitious people in Washington and elsewhere -- the long hours, the late-night requests, the unforeseen surprises and stresses. The job -- serving the White House -- is their life, and everything else is squeezed in around that. Working for the administration means synching up with your boss's schedule, forgoing social niceties like showing up for dates on time and sometimes putting friends and family on the back burner. ''The singular focus you have here is to chip away bit by bit at these very big problems,'' Favreau told me. ''The small amount of time when you're not doing that, I just try to hang around with the friends I have, and that's about it.''
 The transition to governing has been tough for the group that first signed up with the skinny dude with the big ears and funny name. They were a mix of student-council members who grew up obsessed with politics and college grads who happened to be inspired, and they still speak of finding Obama in almost redemptive terms. Favreau, who ended up burned out and disillusioned after working on the unsuccessful 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign, recalls reading Obama's books and listening to his speeches for the first time. ''The only reason I'm still in politics is because of him,'' says Favreau, who adds that he doubts he will write speeches for another politician.
 Lesser says he remembers being a student at Harvard, feeling worried ''about the direction of our country'' and volunteering for Deval Patrick's 2006 campaign for governor of Massachusetts. He watched Obama speak at a rally for Patrick. ''People seemed so excited by him and so excited by what he had to say,'' Lesser says. ''It was so refreshing.'' The Obama campaign, one young West Wing staff member said, was a romantic ''crush'' full of jitters, firsts and ups and downs. Governing, on the other hand, ''is like the way you love your girlfriend'' -- meaningful, but often more taxing and frustrating.
 Losing Edward M. Kennedy's Massachusetts Senate seat to Scott Brown -- and with it, the Democrats' filibuster-proof majority -- was a blow. ''There was a big sense of loss when Massachusetts happened,'' Lesser says. ''Imagine working on a big project that you've immersed your entire life in, and anytime it flashes in front of you and looks like it's not happening, that's scary.'' Ziskend remembers being ''definitely down'' and asking his bosses, How are you guys feeling? ''They were just like, 'This comes with the territory, and sometimes in politics things don't work out,' '' he says. ''It was a good learning experience for me. Don't get your highs too high and your lows too low.''
 Here the lessons of the campaign also helped. David Plouffe, the Obama campaign manager, created a culture where everyone from the baggage handlers to the senior strategists felt that their role was crucial to the larger effort, and the White House staff members echo that now. ''This is the way I can make my small contribution,'' Lesser says. ''I'll be able to look my children in the eye and say, 'When I was in my 20s, I was a small part of something way bigger than myself.' ''
 The campaign, which included a nearly 50-state slog against Hillary Clinton, also taught them that politics, while inspiring, would not be easy. ''I never thought that we would come here and it would be just like -- '' Ziskend paused and snapped his fingers: ''change.''
 After joining an administration led by a fitness buff, Lesser joined a gym. ''Vida,'' he said, referring to Vida Fitness, a trendy, boutique chain in the city that is right down the street from his house in Logan Circle. Lesser and Ziskend joined together last summer. ''At 6 a.m. at Vida, you see like 5 to 10 colleagues,'' Ziskend says. But Lesser soon fell off the low-fat wagon. He didn't always scan menus for healthful options, and as far as the gym, he says, ''I've kind of stopped going.'' He quickly adds, ''I need to get back on it.''
 ''Part of the reason I joined the gym is because all these other people around me go,'' Lesser told me. ''They have just as demanding jobs as me. I have no excuse.'' In Obama's White House, concerns about health start at the top. George W. Bush was a zealous mountain biker who privately griped about a staff member who failed to exercise and even asked a potential Supreme Court nominee about his workout regimen. President Obama also expresses worry about the fitness level of his aides. When Pete Rouse, a longtime Capitol Hill sage who now is one of Obama's three senior advisers, put on some weight, Obama intervened, Rouse told me. The president, who brought his personal trainer with him to Washington from Chicago, offered to buy the 64-year-old Rouse some sessions with the trainer. (Rouse bought his own sessions instead and now works out twice a week.) Young aides with little body fat hit the gym before work at 5:30 a.m. ''It's the only 40 minutes in the day when I'm separated from my BlackBerry, cut off from the world,'' Ziskend says. ''It's freedom.'' It is also an acceptable pass for missing work. One aide, who described Obama as ''very health-conscious,'' told me the president isn't bothered when someone is out of the office on an exercise break.
 Basketball is another encouraged pastime. Obama played pickup basketball on primary days for good luck, and although he has since been criticized for hosting a men-only game of basketball and rarely inviting women to play golf, the hoops ritual has carried down to the younger staff members. Their basketball schedule includes three unofficial games: one on Tuesday night at the Department of Interior; another on Sundays that includes both White House and agency staff members; and a weekend league team.
 On Tuesdays, the secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar; the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Julius Genachowski; Senator Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania; and Senator Jon Tester of Montana used to have an early basketball game. Occasionally, Axelrod would join them. Once or twice, Casey and Tester stayed to play a game or two with the later-arriving junior staff members. Basketball is such an obsession that Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, has been known to jokingly admonish staff members to plan their travel around pickup games.
 Then there is Stotus -- the softball team of the United States (a word play on Potus, the acronym for president of the United States). Stotus, a team made up of White House staff members, gathered on humid summer evenings last year to take on rivals like the Democratic National Committee and then would sometimes celebrate with snacks and drinks afterward at local restaurants and bars. Nonplayers often came out to cheer, thumbing their BlackBerrys as they watched the game. The sports are all in good fun -- a chance to unwind after work and connect with friends -- but an undercurrent of personal fitness runs throughout.
 ''People are commenting on it,'' Ziskend teased Lesser at Cafe Dupont, referring to his housemate's new and improved physique.
 ''Really?'' Lesser asked, laughing. He looked up and added, a touch more seriously: ''Really? Like who?''
 THE OBAMAS ARE the first White House family in modern memory to treat Washington like an actual city. They moved from Chicago, another urban center with a large African-American population, and they invited inner-city children to help with the new garden and to trick-or-treat and hunt Easter eggs at the White House. According to the CBS Radio News correspondent Mark Knoller, the press corps' unofficial White House historian, George W. Bush ate dinner or lunch at a restaurant anywhere in the country only 21 times during his eight years in office; the Obamas dined out nearly a dozen times in their first year alone. In Washington they have gone to places like the French restaurant Citronelle in Georgetown on a date night and to the foodie mecca Blue Duck Tavern for their wedding anniversary. Obama has made a point of stopping by places with Washington street cred -- Five Guys for a cheeseburger and fries and, as president-elect, Ben's Chili Bowl, a D.C. institution known for serving black Washington and, among 20-somethings, for providing late-night hangover cures in the form of half-smokes (a local sausage similar to a hot dog) and chili cheese fries.
 The young White House staff members have formed an unofficial enclave in an area north of the White House, where many live within a 15-minute walk from one another, settling in group houses and apartments in Logan Circle, Dupont Circle, U Street and Columbia Heights. The tiny but distinct neighborhoods bleed into one another, with nightlife emanating out from the U Street corridor. The area, part of which was ravaged during the 1968 riots, is gentrifying but still has a gritty feel. Some of the staff members call it ''campus.'' Older journalists trying to impress their young sources sometimes suggest hip neighborhood places like Cork, the Gibson speak-easy and Marvin, a sleek bistro and bar that has a mural of the iconic Shepard Fairey ''Hope'' poster of Obama's face painted in blue and red on its outside brick wall. Rahm Emanuel was spotted at Marvin one Saturday night, wearing jeans and alternating between two cellphones, drinking a Belgian beer.
 It is hard to pinpoint which came first -- the young Obama crew or the rapidly growing roster of news outlets that now clamor to cover them. The stable of writers for Click, the gossip section of the Web site Politico, prowl parties with digital cameras and camcorders, ready to ask, for example, Jen Psaki, the deputy communications director, what's in her purse, or to write up a sighting of Reggie Love, the president's 6-foot-5 personal aide, at the opening of the Kennedy Center's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' starring Cate Blanchett. In an interview on the campaign trail, Jon Favreau told me that sometimes when he would tell women that he was Obama's speechwriter, they wouldn't believe him. ''To which I reply,'' he says, '' 'if I really wanted to hit on you, don't you think I'd come up with something more outlandish?' '' But now being Obama's anything is glamorous. ''There have been a ton of A-list celebrities coming here, unlike under the Bush administration -- they're getting behind a cause, because it's cooler now to be political,'' Kiki Ryan, a nightlife reporter for Click, says. ''When they come here, they sometimes get a White House tour, and they Twitter about it.'' MTV's ''Real World: Washington, D.C.'' began in December; Bravo will set its next ''Real Housewives'' and ''Top Chef'' in D.C.; and Arianna Huffington is reworking ''Three's Company'' into a show for ABC about three freshman members of Congress who live together.
 For decades, young Washington staff members had to worry about steering clear of the gossip pages and not embarrassing their high-profile bosses. Edward McNally, a lawyer who worked as a 21-year-old press intern in Ronald Reagan's White House and as a speechwriter in Bush senior's West Wing, said he and his young colleagues always feared ''the personality column in The Washington Post.'' McNally told me, ''When we slipped, when we misstepped in public, we were scared to death that it would enter the media and that it would mean not only the end of our job but the end of our life.''
 But the cacophonous world of blogs and 24-hour news coverage has added a layer of difficulty for the newest White House staff members. Gordon Johndroe, who joined George W. Bush's White House as a 26-year-old assistant press secretary, says: ''In '01 when we got here, no one had BlackBerries, no one texted, no Twitter, and there were a lot less digital cameras. Now, before you know it, you're texting someone at 3 a.m. -- never a good idea -- and the next day a picture of you doing God only knows what is up on someone's Facebook page.''
 McNally remembers being part of a group of ''kids in their 20s with no money'' who co-opted a Chinese restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue during the Reagan years and transformed it into their own makeshift disco. ''We brought boom boxes and pushed all the tables out of the way and danced until 2 a.m. on Monday night, and no one wore their own shoes home because no one could find them,'' he said. ''Today that scene would have camera phones, texting, video. But we couldn't have felt more safe. You could dance on the tables and not worry.''
 Even so, Obama's young aides offer a contrast to the ones who worked in George W. Bush's administration only a few years ago. Bush promised to ''restore dignity to the White House,'' and the mood inside the administration was subdued from the start, with a reinstated dress code that encouraged women to wear pantyhose. As Matt Latimer observed in his account of his years as a Bush speechwriter, ''Speech-Less,'' there was no hint of Aaron Sorkin's ''West Wing'' sexiness. ''We were more like Rob Lowe's cousins,'' he wrote, ''the ones who didn't go out much.'' When they did go out, Johndroe says, they stuck to creaky haunts close to the White House like Old Ebbitt Grill or bars in the historically preppy enclave of Georgetown. ''The Daily Grill was the place to go on Thursday nights, in Georgetown, and then people would go to Smith Point,'' Johndroe said, referring to the basement bar known for sightings of the Bush twins and its unofficial uniform of popped collars, boat shoes (no socks) and salmon-colored khakis for the men, pearls and Lilly Pulitzer for the women. The president's daughters were perhaps the city's most visible revelers, and their late-night escapades around town became tabloid fodder. (Johndroe, for the record, says he now spends more time on the U Street corridor.)
 The young staff members in the Obama White House have not only helped create a new social scene but also nonchalantly reign over it. Washington, always known as ''Hollywood for Ugly People,'' is now Hollywood, period. Jon Favreau landed on People magazine's most-beautiful-people list and Time magazine's Top 100 most-influential-people list in the same week. Other staff members found themselves ranked in GQ and Maxim, and in fashion spreads in Vanity Fair and Elle. Sam Kass, a 30-year-old White House assistant chef with movie-star looks, was also named one of People magazine's 100 most-beautiful people in 2009. He sometimes is teased by his co-workers with the nickname ''100.'' The actress Rashida Jones came to Washington for the White House Correspondents Dinner and left romantically linked to Favreau. Kal Penn, who is 33, traded his Hollywood career in the ''Harold and Kumar'' movies and in Fox's ''House'' for a comparatively low-paying job as associate director of the White House Office of Public Engagement.
 Still, Rahm Emanuel told me dryly, ''It's not like Larry Summers and Tim Geithner go clubbing with these guys.''
 The staff members are quick to play down their lives as characters on an inside-the-Beltway reality-TV show. ''Do you really think Rahm Emanuel cares if his assistant ends up on Click?'' one staff member asked. ''He has so much more to worry about. And we work for the most visible guy in the world, so who cares about us?''
 ''You have to remember, inside the building nobody cares,'' Lesser said, and Ziskend finished his sentence: ''And that's where you spend most of your time -- inside the building or living with them.''
 Darienne Page, the receptionist in the West Wing, is an Iraq-war veteran whom the president jokingly calls ''Rotus,'' for receptionist of the United States. Page, who is 28, has greeted everyone from Tony Blair to Tiger Woods, but she tells people she works at a drugstore in order to deflect attention from her job title.
 ''In D.C. when you go out, everyone asks you, 'What do you do?' '' Page says. ''My answer? 'I work at Walgreens.' Because no one asks, 'Oh, what do you do at Walgreens?' And if you want to be my friend, it's not going to matter that I work at Walgreens. Just like it's not going to matter that I work at the White House.''
 ALEJANDRA CAMPOVERDI glided around the rooftop lounge of the W Hotel. Wearing a slouchy backless black dress and fingering her champagne flute, she slipped among the crowd who had gathered on a Saturday night in September to celebrate her 30th birthday. Her boss, Mona Sutphen, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, was there. So were Jon Favreau and some of his colleagues from the White House speechwriting and press offices. They mixed with Campoverdi's friends from California and some of her former classmates from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. The assistants for Norman Eisen, the White House ethics adviser; Jim Messina, a deputy chief of staff; and Larry Summers, the director of the National Economic Council, took a group picture with Campoverdi when the lights came on. And over by the bar? ''There's Secret Service and World Bank,'' Campoverdi said, pausing to consider. ''You have a little bit of everything.''
 Campoverdi had just started her job in the West Wing after the inauguration when Gawker, the gossip blog, posted old pictures of her posing in Maxim and offered an equally tantalizing piece of gossip: The ''Maxim babe'' was dating the ''hottie'' speechwriter Jon Favreau. Gawker and other blogs turned the benign tidbit into a story and began speculating on her personal life. (She and Favreau remain friends, though the two are no longer dating.) Campoverdi had modeled to pay for college -- print campaigns for Paul Mitchell and Kasil Jeans, a commercial for Pepsi, a 2004 shoot for Maxim -- and after the Gawker posts went viral, the men's magazine included her on its ''Hot 100'' list for 2009, along with Michelle Obama.
 In person, with her glossy brown hair, Campoverdi looks like a cuter, less sultry version of the woman in the Maxim spread. Like most young Obama staff members, she's wary of the spotlight, more likely to enthuse on the causes she's passionate about (health care, immigration reform) than to talk about her ''boring'' social life. Even now, with the slightly more relaxed mood in Washington compared to the grind of the campaign trail, young staff members are nervous about upholding the Obama creed of modesty and discretion. One aide, by way of explaining to me his discomfort at seeing his name in print, referred to the belief that government assistants should have a fierce ''passion for anonymity.''
 Junior staff members carefully guard their images, as part of protecting ''the Obama brand,'' as Desiree Rogers, now the former social secretary, impoliticly said in an interview last year with The Wall Street Journal. Kiki Ryan, the Politico nightlife reporter, says: ''I was at an event with a White House staffer who is very well known. I took a picture of him, and he asked me after would I please not print it, because he didn't want to be associated with parties.'' Another staff member asked a GQ writer to cut a social detail from a story, e-mailing that he was worried he would come off as ''a frat boy.''
 Obama's personal assistant, Reggie Love, can be guarded, a friend of his told me one August night in Love's kitchen, ''because he can't trust people at face value,'' before Love shot him a silencing look. Love, paraphrasing Jay-Z, told me that he is ''just trying to fade to black.'' He added, ''Everything you do represents not only yourself but the office of the president,'' echoing a familiar concern among young staff members.
 This is the uneasy territory of the young Obama aides -- they inhabit a world where they are minicelebrities, enjoying the perks of recognition while simultaneously seeming to shun the spotlight. They say they don't want the attention, that they're here to do a job, and it's hard not to believe them. No matter how low-key they try to be, they are bound to excite envy. But envy is not an emotion that gets the Obama seal of approval. The young aides are quick to say how much they like their jobs and how well they all get along, but jealousy does pop up. There is real tension between those who joined the campaign on Day 1 and the perceived interlopers who came later, especially among the people who felt that they worked hard on the trail and weren't rewarded with top posts. Jobs in the West Wing, with their close proximity to the Oval Office and ''the action,'' are considered the best. ''They don't make TV shows about the Department of Energy,'' a young aide said.
 People gripe about staff assistants who, they feel, have received undeserved press coverage, the ones who didn't start out in Iowa but still landed a plum job, like the person in the next cubicle who has the same portfolio but makes more money. They are careful, however, not to complain too loudly. They have already learned lessons the hard way. When a Washington Post reporter first e-mailed Favreau about a Facebook picture of him groping a cardboard cutout of Hillary Clinton, he couldn't believe it; he never even put the picture up online (a friend from home had naively posted it). But the story became a silly blog sensation during the 2008 campaign, and Favreau had to apologize to Clinton. The incident was a psychological turning point for Obama's staff. Several of them started defriending reporters from their Facebook accounts and internalized the lesson that everyone in Washington eventually learns: nothing is private; everything is on the record.
 Obama doesn't yell, his aides say. He's calm even when he's angry. But his stern glance is far worse than any tirade. To many of his acolytes, the president is a role model. ''This is a person who beat the odds to be a United States senator and who has offered you a job,'' Reggie Love says. ''This was a moment in time where things will only be this way for a little bit, and they were, and I was proud to take the opportunity.''
 More than anything, they repeat, over and over, they don't want to embarrass the president.
 ERIC LESSER LOOKED out over the containers of Thai carryout, the bottles of wine and the Shabbat candles. ''Should we do Shalom Aleichem?'' he asked, and the whole table began singing a warbled but hearty version of the song that welcomes Shabbat. In Lesser's group house of Obama staff assistants, Friday-night Shabbat dinners have become something of a ritual, a chance to relax and spend a few hours with friends, reflecting on the week. Sometimes it's just the four housemates, sometimes it's a large group from the campaign trail or the White House, sometimes it's friends from college and people who happen to be in town.
 Once it was even their bosses -- ''the Bosses Dinner,'' they still call it. David Axelrod, Lesser's boss, was out of town, but others came: Jake Levine's boss, Carol Browner, the White House coordinator of energy-and-climate policy; her husband and her sister; and Ziskend's boss, Jared Bernstein, the vice president's chief economist, along with his wife and their two young kids. Linda Douglass, then the director of communications for the White House office of health reform, was also there.
 Around the table on a late September night, the weekend of Yom Kippur, were the four housemates along with Samantha Tubman, a 30-year-old associate director to the social secretary who helps plan nearly every White House event, and Sam Wilson, 27, the deputy director of broadcast media for the White House office of communications. On the campaign trail, Tubman was a press wrangler, one of the most difficult and least glamorous jobs. She had to make sure the press corps was fed and on time, all while dealing with lost luggage and hotel mishaps. Tubman, who is petite and has a quick, engaging smile, was also an older-sister figure to a lot of the young staff members. ''Do you remember when we met at a coffee shop in Keene, N.H., when I was still a college student?'' Ziskend asked, turning to Tubman.
 At the end of every Friday dinner, the tradition is that everyone goes around the table and says something from the past week for which they're grateful. Over Whole Foods gingerbread and brownies, Lesser looked at his watch and announced, ''O.K., we've got to do this and then get out of here.'' They all had other friends they were trying to see that night.
 Tubman started. She talked about her past week in Pittsburgh at the G-20. It was crazy, chaotic and sleepless -- a bit like life on the trail, she said, and she was appreciative that she got to know some new colleagues in an intimate, campaignlike way. Lesser talked about going home for Rosh Hashanah and how it was nice to be reminded that ''there are people there who I care about and who care about me and who don't care about the stimulus package in Washington.''
 Finally, they all finished saying what they were grateful for, and the group filed out of the house into the misty night. Tubman was going home, but the five men hailed a cab to Columbia Heights, scrambling over one another to squeeze into the back seat, shouting and pointing and laughing. ''They're such boys,'' Tubman said, turning to walk to her Logan Circle apartment just around the corner. ''I love them.''
 Earlier at dinner, Lesser mentioned one of his favorite quotes: ''The best quote is from General Patton,'' he said, referring to the movie about the World War II commander George S. Patton. '' 'All glory is fleeting.'
 ''It's the only thing that's true,'' he said. ''Glory is always fleeting. ''
 LESSER WAS WORKING at the White House on a Sunday evening in ratty jeans and a black polo shirt -- his good luck outfit from Obama's presidential campaign -- when he received the e-mail message. When she received hers, Campoverdi was lounging on her couch in a faded Kennedy School T-shirt and gray pajama shorts, monitoring the health care vote on C-Span and chatting on the phone with her mother, a cancer survivor who recently lost her health coverage when she was laid off as a kindergarten teacher at an inner-city school in Los Angeles. Campoverdi threw on a black dress and hailed the first cab she saw to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In a nearby neighborhood, Favreau saw the message flash across his BlackBerry, so he hopped in his car and drove down 16th Street toward the White House.
 The e-mail message, from the president's personal secretary, summoned a group of about 120 people to the Truman Balcony at the White House residence to celebrate the passage of the health care reform bill with a Champagne toast. The group included all of the top administration officials behind health care reform -- Axelrod, Joe Biden, Nancy-Ann DeParle, Rahm Emanuel, Robert Gibbs, Phil Schiliro, Kathleen Sebelius.But the president wanted a close-knit cadre of young aides to attend as well.
 An emotional Axelrod said that the night health care passed was a bigger deal than election night, because it was what the campaign had been about -- the opportunity to reshape the country and to help average Americans. Obama wanted his young staff to understand that they were part of this moment. So they found themselves in March overlooking the South Lawn of the White House, gazing at the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial in jeans and T-shirts, suits and ties, raising champagne flutes with their president.
 ''It was as excited as I'd seen anyone since election night, since inauguration,'' Favreau later told me. At one point, he saw Axelrod and Gibbs telling Obama some jokes. ''He was laughing so hard,'' Favreau said. ''I'd never seen the president laugh that hard.'' Adam Frankel -- the history buff of the speechwriting staff -- asked if perhaps he could see the Lincoln Bedroom. ''Before I knew it, the president was like, 'Who's coming on the Lincoln Bedroom tour?' '' Favreau recalled. Obama showed off the handwritten Gettysburg Address and said, ''I'm just here by myself tonight, so you can come in, check everything out.'' (Michelle and their two daughters were in New York for the weekend.)
 The night ended at close to 1:30 a.m. ''We finally realized we should probably let the president go to bed,'' Favreau said. Obama thanked them all again and they trickled from the White House residence and into the cool early morning.

HEADLINE: Making the Rating Agencies More Accountable

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Berating the Raters,'' by Paul Krugman (column, April 26):
 Two things are clear. First, Moody's and Standard & Poor's don't pay the salaries the big banks pay, so they don't get the top talent. So when bankers create bonds and derivatives that are highly complex and intended to confuse the raters and the public, it works. 
 Second, the rating agencies no longer have anything at stake in this process except their ''good name,'' which evidently has a price tag on it. Unfortunately, the rating agencies failed to exercise due diligence when analyzing derivatives that were too complex for mere investors to understand.
 That failure to exercise due diligence needs to be expensive; raters should be required to underwrite bonds and be subject to civil litigation and criminal action.
 Unless the agencies get some skin in this game, a Moody's or an S.&P. rating should have no more influence on an investment decision than a celebrity endorsement.
 David Solomon Troy, N.Y., April 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The investors who are buying the bonds in multimillion- or multibillion-dollar blocks are almost always sophisticated investors or paid fiduciaries. These fiduciaries are supposed to be experts at understanding risk, not just being able to read whether a bond is AAA-rated or not.
 The lack of sophisticated due diligence when investing large sums of pension fund money is shocking to say the least. Highly educated and compensated professionals need to do their own statistical analysis when committing to buy bonds on gargantuan scales. This is especially true when you know that the banks selling the bonds paid the rating agency to rate the bonds.
 If investors are not sophisticated enough to understand what they are buying, then they should not be buying it, regardless of the rating.
 Ryan Ade Wayne, Pa., April 26, 2010
 The writer is a vice president at Wachovia Maher Partners. 
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman appropriately identified the rating agencies as centrally culpable for the 2008 meltdown of the world financial system. Part of the explanation for their failure is incompetence.
 The more germane explanation for their failure lies in the powerful incentives created by the source of their fees: issuers and underwriters.
 To correct these perverse incentives, I have a modest proposal for financial reform: declare any payment to a rating agency by an issuer or underwriter to be illegal and akin to a bribe. The agencies would then be forced to figure out how to get paid for their service in the redefined free market in a way that does not morally compromise their objectivity.
 Peter M. Fahey Port Washington, N.Y., April 27, 2010
 The writer is a retired partner of Goldman Sachs.
 To the Editor:
 Lawmakers should seriously consider empowering an agency of the federal government with the authority to rate bonds and other debt instruments. We force producers of food to seek government approval, as we do producers of pharmaceuticals, automobiles, buildings and children's pajamas. Why are the health of our pension funds and nest eggs left purely to the vagaries of the marketplace?

HEADLINE: G. Douglas Pugh, 86, State Labor Official

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
G. Douglas Pugh, who started his career as a campaigner for civil rights and then ascended through the ranks of New York State government to hold major posts in labor relations, died on Wednesday in Sarasota, Fla., where he had a seasonal home. He was 86. 
 Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed Mr. Pugh to the New York State Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board in 1976, and reappointed him to another term in 1981. Governor Carey's successor, Mario M. Cuomo, named Mr. Pugh as chairman of the agency in 1987, making him the first African-American to hold the post. Mr. Pugh served until his retirement in the mid-1990s.
 Mr. Pugh previously had been the second-ranking executive of the State Labor Department, a job he held for about a year. He was responsible for day-to-day management of the agency.
 George Douglas Pugh was born on Dec. 14, 1923, in Harlem, where he went to school and worked in his father's candy store. He served in a black infantry regiment in the South Pacific during World War II, then used the G. I. Bill to attend Columbia, where he majored in music.
 After graduating, he helped his father manage the candy store, then entered Columbia Business School, where he earned an M.B.A. in 1957. Knocking on doors in search of a corporate job, he was turned down everywhere, said his wife, the former Clementine High.
 He went to work for the Urban League of New York and did reports on racial discrimination for jobs on the docks and in the hiring of musicians and for orchestras. Both reports were credited with increasing opportunities for blacks.
 In 1962, Mr. Pugh was appointed as a commissioner of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Except for a year's leave of absence to help straighten out the management of an antipoverty program in Harlem, he was at the service until 1967.
 He then worked for the Ford Foundation for almost three years, evaluating requests for financing antipoverty projects and other programs. In 1970, he managed Basil A. Paterson's unsuccessful campaign for lieutenant governor. (Mr. Paterson is the father of Gov. David A. Paterson.)
 From 1970 to 1975, Mr. Pugh was the director of labor relations and urban affairs for the State Dormitory Authority. During his tenure, the agency guaranteed that 25 percent of contracts would go to minority contractors.
 He edited a book with William F. Haddad, ''Black Economic Development.'' 
 Mr. Pugh also had homes in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and in Southampton, on Long Island. In addition to his wife, Mr. Pugh is survived by his daughter, Janet; his son, Douglas; his brother, Robert; and a grandson.

HEADLINE: The Burden and Boon of Lost Golf Balls

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
In a sonar search last year for the Loch Ness monster, scientists with a submersible device instead discovered more than 100,000 golf balls.
 Who knew the Loch Ness monster even played golf?
 In a logical conclusion, Scottish officials surmised that golfers along Loch Ness had been using its 21 square miles as an oversize driving range. As a local lawmaker said, ''Golf balls are humanity's litter in the most inaccessible locations.''
 No one knows for sure how many golf balls are lost each year worldwide, though the total in the United States is estimated at 300 million. Hundreds of thousands of golf balls are lost or abandoned every day in lakes, ponds, forests, wetlands, deserts, backyards, gardens, parking lots, cemeteries, on rooftops and at the bottom of woodchuck holes. 
 But in the last few years, the simple, seemingly inconsequential lost golf ball has stumbled upon a new international renown and import. Culturally, the lost golf ball has become conspicuous evidence of golf's negative ecological impact just as the game yearns to be viewed as more green. In a tough economic climate, the retrieval and discount repackaging of lost golf balls has mushroomed into a lucrative business expanding into global emerging markets. The arts have discovered the lost golf ball, too. Examining the fate and destiny of the wayward golf shot has been the subject of not one but two glossy coffee-table books.
 The lost golf ball, in its own way, has become a fatalistic metaphor not just for golf, but perhaps life: we are all lost, waiting to be found.
 ''For every lost ball, there was a forlorn search, perfunctory or thorough,'' John Updike wrote in the foreword to ''Lost Balls,'' a 2005 golf book. ''These questing ghosts haunt the course, hovering at the juncture of their interrupted game. 'Found it!' one wants to cry out in triumph, though the loser has been decades in his grave.''
 There has been no recognized study of what has happened or will happen to the millions, if not billions, of lost golf balls dotting the earth in little white, orange and pink orbs. There is no accepted wisdom on how long it takes a golf ball to decompose in soil or waterways, according to interviews with more than a dozen golf industry and environmental researchers. The informed guess is that most balls begin to break down somewhere between 50 and 500 years. Whether the great multitude of lost golf balls rotting under logs or slowly dissolving at the bottom of swampy estuaries pose an environment hazard is also apparently undetermined. But the mere presence of so many abandoned golf balls has made many uncomfortable and has caused others to hypothesize about possible effects.
 Torben Kastrup Petersen, the head of course management at the Danish Golf Union, was widely quoted after the Loch Ness discovery expressing some concern about zinc and other heavy metals in golf balls that might escape into waterways. Such contamination in other settings has proved to be harmful to vegetation at the bottom of lakes and ponds. Petersen helped conduct lab experiments to measure what golf ball materials leached into water, and found minor amounts of zinc, among other things. He conceded that his test had limitations because it could not replicate the volume of water in a typical pond or lake.
 But Dr. Anne Mette Dahl Jensen, a senior adviser on forest and landscape at the University of Copenhagen, noted that while the concentrations of zinc leaving the golf ball in Petersen's experiment may have been small, those results justified additional testing. Jensen, who plays golf regularly, plans to seek money for field tests on the degradation of golf balls at a wide range of temperatures, soil and water conditions to simulate the vastly different natural environments where golf is played.
 ''We must be careful not to create a problem before it is properly investigated,'' Jensen wrote in an e-mail message last week. ''Maybe this is a potential problem and the sport cannot live with the speculation. However, we have to remember that we are not observing any dead fish in our lakes on golf courses - at least not in Denmark.''
 Robert Weiss, a professor of polymer engineering at the University of Akron, which has conducted extensive research of multipart products like golf balls, stressed that the zinc in a golf ball is present as an ion strongly bound to the compound and would not be displaced by water. Weiss conceded that an acid could displace the zinc in the ball but doubted that any waterway is acidic enough to do so.
 Weiss did not want to dismiss environmental concerns, but he made what he called worst-case scenario calculations involving a million golf balls in Loch Ness that lost all of their zinc. He estimated that dumping five bottles (10 pounds) of antiseptic mouthwash would deposit more zinc ions into Loch Ness than a million golf balls.
 Biodegradable, water-soluble golf balls are available, though they are primarily one-use balls bought by cruise ship operators so that guests can practice their swings next to the Lido Deck. There are golf balls that are 100 percent recyclable and made from renewable materials, but they have not penetrated the mainstream market. You won't find them at a neighborhood Target or the local pro shop.
 If the lost-golf-ball-retrieval entrepreneurs have their way - and they are hard at work wherever North American golfers are spraying their shots hither and yon - no lost golf ball will remain in water for long. They reclaim millions of golf balls every week. It is a vast industry that ranges from teenagers, who wade into ponds after school to find and resell balls at 50 cents apiece, to someone like Gary Shienfield, whose Toronto-area company will sell more than 20 million reclaimed golf balls this year. Sales at Shienfield's Knetgolf.com jumped 25 percent last year.
 ''In the recession, people are still playing golf, but they're not so quick to pay $40 for a dozen new, high-end golf balls,'' said Shienfield, who has partnerships with 2,200 golf courses to recover lost balls. ''Instead, they come to us on the Internet for that ball at $20 a dozen. They are preowned golf balls. They probably bought a preowned BMW, too.''
 Also driving Shienfield's profits are sales to India, Vietnam and much of Southeast Asia.
 ''Those countries are really taking to golf and they want value, but they also want brand names,'' Shienfield said. ''We ship them anywhere and get plenty more ready. We don't sell balls, we rent them and they come back.''
 Charles Lindsay wrote ''Lost Balls,'' and his second volume more or less on the same subject is ''Bad Lies,'' which goes on sale May 15.
 ''Golf is a shared experience and so is losing a ball,'' Lindsay said last week. ''One of the great universal things about the game is that even the world's best players lose golf balls.
 ''Every lost golf ball was once a shot of hope and aspiration that then became a plop in the water.''
 Lindsay, who has become something of an expert in lost golf balls, said he laughed when he read the reports of 100,000 golf balls in Loch Ness. Having wandered upon hundreds of golf balls in difficult to reach places around the world, he did not seem surprised, or worried.
 ''I doubt they would have bothered the Loch Ness monster,'' he said. ''What would you expect? It's Scotland.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Stage to Sell What Soccer Has to Offer

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In less than six weeks, dozens of teams, hundreds of television crews and thousands of journalists will travel to South Africa for the World Cup, perhaps the most popular sporting event in the world, and the biggest global sports event ever held in Africa.
 For South Africa, the pivotal question is: how will this event change and enhance the brand of a nation once defined by apartheid, then by Nelson Mandela? 
 For the United States, the big question is almost exclusively tied to soccer: will this World Cup be the one to inject the game into the bloodstream of a vibrant United States sports culture? More to the point: will a World Cup in Africa be the magnet for attracting African-American athletes to the sport?
 Last week, Danny Jordaan, the chief executive of the World Cup organizing committee, visited the Hugo Newman School in Harlem to promote soccer and the tournament.
 Jordaan spoke about the significance of Africa's hosting a sports event on the scale of the World Cup for the first time. Then he issued a call to arms. He encouraged the largely African-American student body to embrace soccer.
 Jordaan said he told the students that ''the only Africans in this world who are not playing soccer are the African-Americans, so if you want to be true Africans, you must play the sport of Africa.''
 Jordaan was reminded that young African-Americans are often pushed, pulled and drafted in all sorts of athletic directions. They are staples of football and basketball recruiting pools, and Major League Baseball has established an initiative to help the sport grow in urban areas. Soccer, on the other hand, has been slow to follow suit.
 But Jordaan was unmoved. 
 ''The primary sport on the continent is football,'' Jordaan said of Africa. ''Go wherever on the continent, the sport is soccer. So, we want to bring you home.''
 Soccer in the United States continues to fight for attention with the N.B.A., the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball.
 Soccer in the rest of the world draws heavily from the working class and the poor. For the better players, the game offers an opportunity to earn a good living.
 But in the United States, the rise of travel teams and training camps and the decrease in available free space have made the game more expensive to play. The increasing costs are limiting the potential pool of players.
 Soccer's challenge in the United States is how to expand the pool from which to pull and develop talent, not only among African-Americans but across the board. 
 Jordaan said he hoped that Africa's hosting the World Cup would encourage African-Americans to visit South Africa and perhaps in some way boost their participation in the game.
 ''This World Cup has opened up new spaces, and into those spaces you see economic spaces,'' Jordaan said. ''I hope as the U.S. moves towards finalizing a bid for 2022 that we see a significant number of African-Americans into the sport by 2022. I think this may be the trigger.''
 Not everyone believes it will.
 Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer, has said in the past that he did not see a link between a World Cup in Africa and a boost in African-Americans' interest in the game.
 ''I think it's probably putting too much into it,'' Garber said. ''I think at the end of the day, the World Cup in South Africa is going to be one of the great moments in world history.
 ''The fact that the world of sports will be shining on that country and providing great economic possibilities for the people who live there. Just a great chance for everybody to see how far that country has come.
 ''I don't believe that our support of what's going on in Harlem or in other cities across the country is related to the World Cup, but certainly it has people paying more attention to what's going on in underserved communities.''
 Indeed, the World Cup has already attracted the attention of Americans.
 Jordaan pointed out that the performance of the United States national team in June in the Confederations Cup in South Africa, where it surprised Egypt and Spain before losing to Brazil in the final, helped establish the Americans as a credible team, one that could compete.
 ''They left our country with a lot of supporters and admirers,'' Jordaan said.
 Jordaan said 160,000 World Cup tickets had been sold in the United States.
 ''Maybe it's because people believe in the team, maybe it's because many of the people in the U.S. want to be part of Africa's first World Cup -- they want to celebrate good news on the continent,'' Jordaan said. ''To move away from the idea that the continent is about disease, is about desperation, is about war, is about famine. The other side of the story never gets told.''
 Beginning next month, a multitude of stories will be told. One will be about a country, South Africa, hosting one of the world's most important sporting events for the first time. Another will be about a country, the United States, attempting to attain unprecedented heights in that event.

HEADLINE: 'Fantasticks' Pays Back for 50 Years

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
The American economy was in recession, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was yo-yo-ing in the 600s when Marjorie and Malcolm Gray found a new investment to offset a battering in the stock market. It was the spring of 1960, and after dropping by a neighbor's home on Long Island to hear a couple of hopeful musicians play songs from their new Off Broadway musical, ''The Fantasticks,'' the Grays bought a stake in the show for $330.
 The other day, 50 years later, Ms. Gray. now a widow, received her latest dividend from the musical, a $200 check in return for that stake. She has earned about $80,000 so far on the original $330 investment, or an average of $1,600 a year since 1960. And she will continue to receive money until 2020 because of the investment terms for the original production, which ran a record-setting 42 years at the Sullivan Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village. 
 Investors or their heirs will make money from all ''Fantasticks'' shows -- including a current revival Off Broadway and a forthcoming run in London -- for 18 years following the final performance of the original show, which took place in 2002. The 18-year period is not unusual (though 10 years is more typical today). What has turned ''The Fantasticks'' into an extraordinary legacy for the investors, many of whom are now in their 80s and 90s, was the longevity of the 1960 production, the 50th anniversary of which will be celebrated by the surviving investors on Monday. 
 ''We would've just been happy to earn our $330 back and get free tickets to a couple of performances,'' said Ms. Gray, who is 80. ''But the 'Fantasticks' money helped put our three children through college and paid for trips to Guatemala, Costa Rica, Israel. It's certainly been handy to have around for 50 years.''
 While these investors will never earn as many dollars as those who made much bigger bets on blockbuster musicals like ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and ''Wicked'' with much higher ticket prices, ''Fantasticks'' backers will still most likely enjoy a more sizable profit in percentage terms: accountants for the show estimated their total return at about 24,000 percent since 1960. 
 Requiring only a two-member band and the barest of sets, the musical is inexpensive to produce, and ''The Fantasticks'' is one of the most widely produced in the world, with more than 11,000 productions to date in 3,000 cities and town in all 50 states, as well as in 67 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. The original investors make money off of each of these productions.
 ''These investors hit a gusher,'' said Charles H. Googe Jr., the chairman of the entertainment department at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, who often works on theater contracts but is not involved with ''The Fantasticks.''
 ''A lot of money is being made on 'Phantom' and 'Wicked,' but it may never reach the profit margin of 'The Fantasticks' because they are such big and expensive productions whose costs eat up profits,'' Mr. Googe said. '' 'Wicked' could run as long as 'The Fantasticks' and pay its investors back handsomely, but it's hard to imagine a rate of return ever again like this. Inexpensive, popular shows like 'The Fantasticks,' 'Stomp' and 'Nunsense' have proved to be unexpectedly good investments.''
 Over the 50 years an investor in the S&P 500 who reinvested dividends (and did not pay brokerage or other fees) would have earned 9.8 percent a year before taxes. On a $330 investment, that would amount to almost $35,000. A ''Fantasticks'' investor who simply cashed every check and put the money in a mattress would now have $80,000, a return of 11.6 percent a year. But if you assume that the money paid out $1,600 a year over 50 years, and that the investor did not spend the cash, but instead invested it in Treasury bills, the safest investment around, that backer would now have about $422,000, a return of 15.4 percent a year. 
 If $1,600 a year hardly seems like much of a windfall, several of the original investors said in interviews that their ''Fantasticks'' money went a longer way in, say, 1970, by which time profits from the show were steadily increasing. That year the New York City subway fare was 30 cents; the average ticket price to a Broadway show was $8; the best suit at Brooks Brothers cost about $200; a Harvard undergraduate education cost $4,070; and the median American income was $8,734. 
 ''Money has never been incidental, especially earlier in our careers, but I certainly didn't expect to have a steady lifetime stream of income from 'The Fantasticks,' '' said Donald Farber, 86, who handled legal matters for the 1960 production and helped recruit investors. (He and his wife Anne, 85, invested as well.)
 ''A lot of times during that first summer of the show, there would only be two or three people sitting in the audience. People kept telling us to close. Annie and I would go to the playhouse and drink five scotches apiece just to deal with our nerves about this show that we fell in love with,'' said Mr. Farber, who had never invested in theater before.
 The tale of young lovers torn apart by warring families, perhaps most identified with the bittersweet song ''Try to Remember,'' ''The Fantasticks'' opened on May 3, 1960, and ran for a record-setting 17,162 performances before closing in 2002. With music by Harvey Schmidt and a book and lyrics by Tom Jones, the show remains the longest-running musical in the world; the New York production of ''Phantom'' is not quite half its age.
 Many of the original investors in the show were not experienced theater hands but rather friends and neighbors of some of the artists and executives involved in the show. (Neither Mr. Farber, the lawyer, nor the show's accountants could say precisely how many of the show's 52 original investors are still alive.) 
 It was a struggle for those ''Fantasticks'' executives to recruit investors for the no-name show. They held several ''backer's auditions'' in New York City and on Long Island (including at the Farbers' former home in Merrick) to raise money for the show's $16,500 budget. A typical Off Broadway musical today, by contrast, costs more than $1 million to mount.
 Ira Kapp, 86, said he became an investor out of guilt: he attended a late-night run-through rehearsal in 1960 and quickly fell asleep. The next day he told his wife, June, that he felt bad for nodding off and that the least they could do was invest.
 ''That's the luckiest investment I ever made in my life,'' said Mr. Kapp, who receives three checks of ''Fantasticks'' money each year. ''I've made more money overall from stocks, certainly, but no investment return of ours has ever approached 'The Fantasticks' percentage-wise.''
 Those returns have helped investors pay for first and second homes, medical emergencies and decades of gifts, they said. And the show forged a special bond between some of them and their children and even grandchildren, as the investors take them to the show -- which is now in its fourth year of revival Off Broadway -- and they listen to the CD soundtrack together.
 ''My three grandkids love the show, they can hum or sing a few bars of 'Try to Remember' like so many people can,'' said Muriel Neufeld, 90, who, with her husband, Stanley, went in on a share with three other couples for $82.50 a piece. ''I've heard that the show has played all over the world, but it's also a show that will run in its little way through all of the generations in my family.''

HEADLINE: New Political Test May Emerge For Father-Son Bond

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
On a recent night at City College, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo spoke with characteristic eloquence of the national economy and the forgotten poor, and of President Obama and the challenge ahead. He was self-deprecating and witty and earned a long ovation.
 Afterward, a gaggle of reporters trailed him, a single question on their lips: What do you think of your son's chances in the governor's race?
 The elder Cuomo sidestepped it. ''I guess you didn't like the speech,'' he said. Then he smiled faintly and continued out the door.
 For decades, Mario Cuomo's relationship with his son has been close, intense and dominated by the former governor, who is a lover of ideas and argument, and is an often overpowering presence. Across three elections for governor, young Andrew stood at the campaign helm for him, yelling at the deckhands, trying to steer his father to victory. In return, his father put his team of advisers and his own political talents at his son's disposal, helping him gain a Clinton administration appointment and embark on a political career. 
 Now 52, Andrew M. Cuomo has his eyes fixed on claiming his father's old job in Albany, and, perhaps, finally emerging from his considerable shadow. Mario Cuomo is edging toward his 78th birthday and is no longer the most influential voice in his son's circle. 
 But the relationship between father and son is as loving, tangled and laced with competitiveness as it ever was. And Andrew's race for governor looms as a new test of this most intriguing hybrid of a political and familial bond. 
 Mention one to the other these days, and the Cuomos' eyes roll and their voices slide sardonic; they rely on friends and reporters to convey their (mostly loving) jabs at each other.
 ''I am a huge fan of the Cuomo family, but they are very challenging,'' says Michael Dowling, who served as Mario Cuomo's chief health adviser. ''The intonation, the Jesuitical style of questioning; you close your eyes and one sounds like the other. The closer you are, the more they love to debate.''
 Father and son talk multiple times each week, kibitzing, arguing, conspiring, and the former governor still calls old associates in Albany on his son's behalf. ''He asks, 'How do you think Andrew is doing? What do you hear?' '' says a lobbyist and a longtime Cuomo associate. ''You can hear his concern.''
 Mario Cuomo agreed to be interviewed for this article and offered a reporter a strategy for persuading his son to do the same. (''Andrew likes to be in control,'' the former governor said. ''So you call his office and say, 'Look, I know Andrew doesn't want to talk. But The Times, you know The Times, we are going to do this piece with or without you. You don't want that to happen. You want to have your say.' '')
 Andrew Cuomo, after talking it over with advisers, declined to discuss his relationship. Then his father stopped talking, too.
 'Albany's Odd Couple'
 To peer at the grainy photograph from September 1977 of a glum Mario Cuomo, surrounded by his family, conceding a Democratic mayoral primary to Edward I. Koch is to be struck twice over: by how heartbroken Andrew appeared and by how young he was -- not yet 20.
 ''He was an adolescent and took more responsibility for the defeat than he had to,'' said Norman Adler, then a top labor official and now a lobbyist. ''He was trying to live up to his father's expectations.''
 Mario and Matilda Cuomo raised their family, three daughters and two sons, in Hollis, Queens. They were, and remain, a tight-knit bunch.
 ''We live very close and are close, and it's a mixed blessing,'' said the elder Cuomo lightheartedly. ''There are weddings, christenings, bar mitzvahs all the time.''
 Matilda Cuomo knows her politics, and the daughters have volunteered in campaigns. But only Andrew entered the family business. His first task, Mario Cuomo has recalled, was ''putting my posters up and pulling the other guy's down.'' 
 In the early 1980s, father and son became roommates, sharing an apartment in Albany while Andrew attended law school there and his father served as lieutenant governor. A New York Times article from that period described them as ''Albany's odd couple,'' sharing care packages of food from Matilda.
 ''We'd come home, one of us would burn something for dinner, and we'd talk,'' Andrew recalled in that article.
 In 1982, Mario appointed Andrew, 24, to manage his long-shot run for governor. That partnership revealed two men possessed of different talents. Mario Cuomo was the boss, a reader and a thinker, a perfectionist who viewed competition as vocation and avocation. Andrew Cuomo shared the competitive bloodlust, but he was as much his mother's son, more practical and with an acute emotional antenna. Talk to the father and maybe he listens and maybe not; talk to the son and the focus is laserlike. 
 The elder Cuomo spared no one the lash in that campaign, not the least his son. He was so tough on him that Mr. Adler, who was deputy campaign manager, once walked into the candidate's office.
 ''I told him, 'Mario, you've got to ease up on him,' '' Mr. Adler remembered. '' 'He's taking this to heart enormously.' ''
 The elder Cuomo appeared puzzled. ''He was surprised,'' Mr. Adler recalled. ''I honestly don't think it crossed his mind.''
 Father and son described their relationship during that campaign as ''businesslike.'' The younger Cuomo, determined to play down his familial connection, addressed the candidate as ''Mario.'' (He still does.)
 The crucible of that race shaped Andrew Cuomo's enduring image: intensity cubed, a devious fellow. There is some truth there. (''He was very aggressive, to put it gently,'' said former Representative Herman Badillo, who worked on that campaign.) But as a verdict it is too facile.
 William Stern, who was campaign treasurer, shared a cramped office with Andrew. ''Mario was Italian opera, all highs and lows,'' he said. ''Andrew just stayed focused.''
 As the election neared, and the race appeared tight to the point of asphyxiation, Andrew began to worry that something might go wrong, just as in 1977. ''He tried to hijack the field operation at the last minute, sending in his college classmates,'' Mr. Adler said. ''He just didn't want it to be his fault that Mario lost. He was blood; this election was on him.''
 After a narrow victory, Mario appointed Andrew to oversee his transition in Albany. The younger Cuomo displayed an impressive memory, particularly for the names of those Democrats who had opposed his father. 
 He served on his father's staff as a 2-cent-a-week adviser. He did not remain long, but he never lost his father's ear on questions of strategy and politics. The former governor describes those years as painful and instructive, for his son.
 ''The governorship gave him an opportunity to experience the mistakes I made for 12 years,'' Mr. Cuomo said this year. ''He bled every time I was hurt, and I think that makes it less likely that he's going to make the same mistakes.''
 The governor's indecision about his presidential ambitions became a sore point between them. In 1992, Mr. Cuomo kept an airplane waiting on the tarmac, ready to fly to New Hampshire to declare his candidacy. 
 ''He never pulled the trigger, and that's been on Andrew's mind ever since,'' said a political kingmaker who has known the Cuomos for three decades and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of offending them. ''It made Andrew more ready togo on his gut.''
 In 1992, the elder Cuomo pushed to get his son on the transition committee for the new Democratic administration in Washington. Then he lobbied hard to persuade President Bill Clinton to appoint Andrew as deputy secretary at HUD, according to Henry G. Cisneros, the former HUD secretary.
 In 1997, Andrew became chief at HUD. He kept a high profile and pulled close to the Clintons. His office circulated a memo, former employees say, instructing staff members to refer to him not as Andrew but as ''Mr. Secretary,'' and he told friends that he was the nation's housing czar, as opposed, say, to the governor of a single state.
 ''There was this sense of rivalry -- Andrew seemed to feel that his dad talked a good game but that he, Andrew, got things done,'' said a former official who served under Mr. Cuomo at HUD and spoke anonymously out of concern he would offend a possible future governor. ''Andrew was trying to play catch up fast.''
 The Son's Rebirth
 Andrew Cuomo's re-entry into New York politics amounted to a near-death experience. He galloped into the 2002 race for governor as the front-runner, faltered and withdrew days before the primary. The next year, he suffered through a War of the Roses dynastic divorce from Kerry Kennedy.
 Afterward, the elder Mr. Cuomo took his son in hand and slowly restored his luster. He dialed old donors and talked up his son, and helped lay the groundwork for his son's next political race. If you wanted Mario's endorsement, you had to take Andrew's as well.
 In 2006, with his son running for attorney general, Mario approached George Arzt, a former press secretary to Mr. Koch, at the Regency Hotel in New York and told him, '' 'I'd like to patch things up with Ed,' '' Mr. Arzt recalled. ''I asked him what he had in mind. And he said, 'Could Ed endorse Andrew?' ''
 None of this could have been easy. A former governor in his 70s squiring around his son the former cabinet secretary is a good definition of tense. At a breakfast with an operative, Mario nodded his head at his son and said: ''He's thick skulled; he won't listen to me. Tell him what to do.'' The operative, who spoke anonymously in order to preserve access to the two men, recalled that Andrew interjected: ''Oh, Mario, give me a break. I've been in politics for 20 years.''
 The restoration worked. Andrew ran a near-flawless campaign for state attorney general and beat the favorite, Mark Green. Since taking office in 2007, he has been a muscular attorney general, taking on Wall Street and the mortgage industry, with few of the histrionics favored by his predecessor, Eliot Spitzer. And he has carefully positioned himself to run for governor, although he has been coy about declaring himself.
 The elder Cuomo's role is different now. Some liken him to an eminence grise.
 ''Mario now hears about decisions long after they have been made,'' said a family adviser, who did not want to be identified because he was breaking a confidence. ''That does not mean Andrew does not call. But there's a difference between giving Dad a heads up and asking him to sign off.''
 Still, the younger Cuomo's political inner circle is stocked with old advisers to his father, and they talk to Mario. ''Mario has the same wisdom as ever,'' said William B. Eimicke, who was Mr. Cuomo's housing czar and is a professor at Columbia University. ''Why wouldn't you use it?''
 Mario Cuomo's challenge now is to temper his impulse to speak his mind and refrain from his trademark conversational jujitsu. (In 1996, a reporter inquired about Andrew's possible run for the Senate, and Mario replied, ''How do you know I'm not going to run?'')
 For now, Mario Cuomo acknowledges only that he is ready to saddle up. ''If audiences are willing to take a sad second, I will go out and talk for him,'' he said.
 As to their changing relationship, father and son express frustration with the endless literary allusions and amateur psychoanalysis. To the elder Cuomo, the Shakespeare this and the Freudian that is silliness. Yes, he is a strong-willed and loving father, and, yes, he has a strong-willed and loving son.
 ''People say, 'Oh, they have such a complicated relationship,' '' Mario Cuomo said. ''Do you know any father who doesn't have a complicated relationship with his son?''
 He paused, and added, ''Incidentally, it doesn't get less complicated as it goes on.''

HEADLINE: Stolen Facebook Accounts for Sale

BYLINE: By RIVA RICHMOND

 BODY:
Researchers at VeriSign's iDefense division tracking the digital underworld say bogus and stolen accounts on the Facebook are now on sale in high volume on the black market.
 During several weeks in February, iDefense tracked an effort to sell log-in data for 1.5 million Facebook accounts on several online criminal marketplaces, including one called Carder.su.
 That hacker, who used the screen name ''kirllos'' and appears to deal only in Facebook accounts, offered to sell bundles of 1,000 accounts with 10 or fewer friends for $25 and with more than 10 friends for $45, says Rick Howard, iDefense's director of cyber intelligence. 
 The case points to a significant expansion in the illicit market for social networking accounts from Eastern Europe to the United States, he said.
 Criminals steal log-in data for Facebook accounts, typically with ''phishing'' techniques that tricks users into disclosing their passwords or with malware that logs keystrokes. They then use the accounts to send spam, distribute malicious programs and run identity and other fraud.
 Facebook says it believes that the hacker's claims to control large numbers of Facebook accounts are bogus. The company attempted to purchase accounts as part of its investigation into the incident, said a spokesman, Barry Schnitt. However, ''the hacker was unable to produce anything for our buyer,'' he said.
 Facebook's investigators also discovered that ''kirllos'' has a reputation ''for wild claims,'' he said.
 ''We would expect iDefense or anyone presenting themselves as a security expert to do this kind of verification (or any verification) rather than just reading a forum post and accepting the claims as fact and publicizing them,'' Mr. Schnitt said in an e-mail message.
 IDefense could not be immediately reached for comment on the legitimacy of the hacker's offer. However, it previously said that it did not purchase any of the accounts as part of its study because that would violate its corporate policy.
 Criminals steal log-in data for Facebook accounts, typically with ''phishing'' techniques that tricks users into disclosing their passwords or with malware that logs keystrokes. They then use the accounts to send spam, distribute malicious programs and run identity and other fraud.
 Facebook accounts are attractive because of the higher level of trust on the site than exists in the broader Internet. People are required to use their real names and tend to connect primarily with people they know.
 As a result, they are more likely to believe a fraudulent message or click on a dubious link on a friend's wall or an e-mail message. Moreover, the accounts allow criminals to mine profiles of victims and their friends for personal information like birth dates, addresses, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names, pets' names and other tidbits that can be used in identity theft.
 Last summer, Eileen Sheldon's Facebook account was hacked and used to send messages to about 20 friends claiming she was stranded in Britain without a passport and needed money. Ms. Sheldon, who lives in California, had recently been living in London, and one friend, believing the ruse, wired about $100 to the thieves.
 Other friends smelled a fraud and warned Ms. Sheldon, who quickly reported the problem to Facebook. She does not know how her password was stolen.
 While the accounts that were compromised and offered for sale could be legitimate ones like Ms. Sheldon's, they most likely also included bogus accounts, Mr. Howard said. IDefense did not see the accounts themselves, but the inclusion of many accounts with small numbers of friends suggests the seller could have created fake accounts, perhaps using an automated tool, and sent out blind friend requests.
 Many users are eager to amass friends and accept friend requests from people they do not know, even though Facebook discourages it.
 Facebook says it has sophisticated systems to defeat fake accounts, including tools for flagging them when they are created so they can be investigated. This allows Facebook to ''disable them before the bad guys get very far,'' a spokesman, Simon Axten, said.
 Facebook also monitors for unusual activity that is associated with fake accounts, like many friend requests in a short period of time and high rates of friend requests that are ignored. It also investigates reports of suspicious users .
 The relatively low asking prices for the Facebook accounts points to the fact that Facebook accounts do not translate into instant profit. ''The people that buy these things are going to have to do more work to make money,'' Mr. Axten said.

HEADLINE: United-Continental Merger Said to Create Largest Airline

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
United Airlines and Continental Airlines agreed Sunday to a $3 billion merger that would create the world's biggest airline, according to people briefed on the negotiations.
 The deal, to be announced officially on Monday, would form a coast-to-coast behemoth with a leading presence in the top domestic markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, along with an extended network to Asia, Latin America and Europe. The deal was completed in a remarkably swift three weeks, and would give the airlines the muscle to fend off low-cost rivals at home and to take on foreign carriers abroad.
 United is buying Continental, and the combined company will keep the United name and be based in Chicago. Jeffery A. Smisek, Continental's chief executive, would run the company. If the deal wins antitrust approval, the merged airline would replace Delta Air Lines as the top carrier.
 The boards of both companies met Sunday to approve the all-stock deal, according to people familiar with the companies who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were delicate. The UAL Corporation, United's parent company, would issue 1.05 shares for each Continental share, valuing the acquisition at $3.17 billion, based on Friday's closing price. The merger is expected to be completed before the end of the year. 
 For consumers, the merger could eventually result in higher prices. Though the new company does not intend to raise fares, according to the people briefed on the matter, one of the rationales for airline mergers is to cut capacity. That reduces the number of seats in the industry and allows airlines to increase fares.
 In addition, United and Continental will no longer be competing against each other on some routes, allowing them to save money but offering travelers fewer options.
 ''Airlines are struggling to find a business model that makes sense,'' said Scott Sonenshein, an assistant professor at the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University. ''Consolidation gives them more leverage. As a consumer, you will have less choices, fewer routes, higher prices and more fees.''
 Still, in the last decade fares have declined because of pressure from low-fare airlines like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, as well as lower passenger demand. As a result, previous mergers have had a muted effect on ticket prices, especially on routes served by low-fare carriers.
 Even with the steep cuts made in the last two years, airlines are still losing money, with too many seats chasing too few passengers. For much of the last decade they have suffered a succession of powerful blows -- from the terrorist attacks of 9/11 to rapidly rising fuel costs and the recession. They have also been straining to keep up with low-fare competition.
 But with the economy starting to improve and passenger traffic picking up, the industry is generally healthier now, with more cash and less debt. Credit markets have also thawed, allowing access to capital.
 Combined, United and Continental have 21 percent of domestic capacity, in terms of so-called available seat miles, or one seat flown one mile. Delta has a market share of 20 percent. Globally, the merged companies would have a 7 percent market share.
 The merger would put pressure on American Airlines, which was once the market leader, but which would drop to third place. While American's executives say they do not feel threatened by industry mergers, Wall Street analysts have been displeased by the company's performance.
 US Airways, which three weeks ago began its own merger talks with United, is now left on the sidelines, raising questions about its ability to survive as a stand-alone carrier.
 The United-Continental deal has some major hurdles to clear. The airlines need to win approval from the Justice Department's antitrust division, a challenge given the renewed regulatory zeal in Washington. Unlike the Bush administration's six-month review of the Delta-Northwest deal, analysts expect a lengthier and more complex review of this merger.
 The merger also needs the backing of employee unions, whose opposition to mergers in the past has undone many of the proposed savings. One factor in favor of the deal is that United's pilots' union indicated last month it would not oppose a deal with Continental, whose own pilots have so far remained silent.
 The board approvals end nearly a month of intrigue after United initiated talks to combine with US Airways. Those negotiations caught Continental executives by surprise, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Many analysts said United's talks with US Airways were intended all along to lure Continental to the table.
 United and Continental were close to a merger two years ago, but Continental walked away because of United's poor financial health.
 The earlier talks allowed for swift negotiations this time. United and Continental executives quickly settled some potentially divisive issues, like the name of the combined company, where its headquarters would be and who would run it. United's chairman, Glenn F. Tilton, would remain for two years. After that, Mr. Smisek of Continental would become the executive chairman.
 The Chicago connection could provide additional benefits. Mr. Tilton has been courting local politicians, and the city is eager to retain a major business. United now could use that leverage with the Obama administration, whose ties to Chicago run deep.
 United shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined company, with Continental shareholders owning the rest. Management would be roughly split between the sides. The new entity would expect annual cost savings of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and would still fly to 370 cities in 59 countries.
 The combined airlines would have a 40 percent market share at San Francisco International and 35 percent at Chicago O'Hare International, according to data compiled by Cambridge Aviation Research, a consulting company. At Houston Intercontinental, one of the city's two airports, they would have 64 percent of the market and at Newark Liberty International, 55 percent.
 A merger could yield more than $2 billion in additional revenue and cost savings, according to estimates by Vicki Bryan, an analyst at Gimme Credit.
 The deal is a personal success for Mr. Tilton, a former oil executive who ran the Texaco Corporation until it was acquired by Chevron. He took over United in 2002 as it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and has since pushed relentlessly for a merger.
 It also vindicates the work of Kathryn A. Mikells, United's chief financial officer since November 2008, who is the highest-ranking woman in an industry dominated by men. Analysts have praised her for United's cost-cutting efforts in the last year, Jeff Straebler, a strategist at RBS Securities, said.
 United's improved finances have allowed for a major turnaround in its fortunes. In 2008, it was Continental that was close to buying United. But as that deal was being negotiated, United reported steeper-than-expected losses, leading to doubts about the company's health even as soaring oil prices were crippling the entire industry. Just hours before a deal was to be announced, Continental executives walked away.
 But in the last two years, United has improved its cash position, aggressively reduced capacity, raised new revenue from bag and other fees, and cut costs. It now has $4.5 billion in cash.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 4, 2010 Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about a merger agreement between United Airlines and Continental Airlines misstated the amount of time it took to negotiate the deal. It was done in three weeks, not two. (While the first news reports of a possible merger appeared on April 16, Jeffery A. Smisek, Continental's chief executive, said talks began on April 9.)

HEADLINE: In New York, a Tech Incubator Becomes a Hub of Collaboration

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
In 2008, before most people knew what a tweet was, Iain Dodsworth, a programmer in London, cobbled together a software tool that reorganized his jumbled Twitter stream into neat columns. He named it TweetDeck. 
 Within a few months, it gained the kind of momentum most entrepreneurs only dream about. Tech bloggers praised it, and users flocked to it. Ashton Kutcher posted a video online showing him and his wife, Demi Moore, using the service.
 It wasn't long before inquiries from investors began pouring in. 
 ''It was fairly scary,'' he said. ''I was a one-man company being thrown offers left, right and center from people I didn't know.''
 But then Mr. Dodsworth received a message from a company he did recognize: Betaworks, a New York City technology firm known for its eye for emerging Web services.
 ''Money is nice, but I actually needed expertise more than anything else,'' he said. ''Betaworks had a track record in this field back when no one had a track record in this field.'' 
 In the two years since then, Betaworks has become prominent in New York technology circles for helping entrepreneurs fine-tune and expand their companies. The company has guided some entrepreneurs to lucrative sales and helped others raise cash from notable New York and Silicon Valley investment firms. 
 Such incubators are familiar in more established tech hubs. Silicon Valley, for example, has the technology incubator Y Combinator, and Pasadena has Idealab. 
 ''Historically, there have been more biotech incubators in New York than other technology incubators,'' said Jonathan Bowles, the director of the Center for an Urban Future, which has studied the economic development of New York and other cities. ''New York has long lacked local investors who are also rooted here and committed to building a sustainable technology community. Betaworks is starting to fill a void that's been lacking in New York since the '90s.''
 The company was founded by John Borthwick and Andrew Weissman, who worked at AOL in the '90s. 
 ''I was there when AOL bought CompuServe and Netscape and did the first content deal with Amazon,'' said Mr. Weissman, chief operating officer. ''You could start to see these new ways pieces of the Internet were coming together.''
 He said he watched as one AOL project, MapQuest, gradually lost market share. Google Maps grew faster because it allowed other companies to add information to a map or use the service in other tools. ''You could just see that model was going to be big,'' ''We said, 'We think this is it, and we want to invest in these kinds of companies.' ''
 A little over three years ago, the two decided they wanted to create their own company aimed at that very idea. Thanks to tools like Amazon Web Services, Twitter and Google Apps, developers could more easily build and scale Web tools.
 ''We knew there was a big fundamental change happening on the Internet,'' said Mr. Borthwick, Betaworks' chief executive. ''And we knew it was going to be social.''
 They spent nine months deliberating over how to structure their company before settling on a hybrid of an investment firm and an incubator. 
 ''The venture capital structure is banking on finding that one super-duper winner, and there's nothing wrong with that,'' said Mr. Borthwick. ''But our goal is to create a network of companies with lots of connections between them that increases the likelihood of success between all of them.''
 It's not hard to see that spirit at work. The two dozen companies under Betaworks' umbrella make a point of using one another's creations and often incorporate them into their own services. At a recent meeting at Betaworks, about three dozen employees of Betaworks and its portfolio of companies crowded into a room, trading feedback, updates and the occasional good-natured zinger about their various products. 
 Betaworks has developed some Web tools from scratch, like Bit.ly, a URL shortener, and Chartbeat, a real-time Web analytics service. But the company is looking for entrepreneurs who have more than a vision.
 ''Anyone who shows up with an idea on a napkin, we're going to tell them, 'Thanks, but go build a prototype,' '' Mr. Weissman said. 
 Betaworks, he said, will focus on five to 10 companies a year. The company has taken on some investors, most recently raising $20 million. The New York Times Company invested in that round of financing. 
 Investors rely on the keen eye of Betaworks to provide a window into the next wave of promising Web companies, said Jim Robinson, a partner at RRE Ventures, a technology investment firm. ''It's a great sifter and feeder system for us,'' he said. ''We're able to see these interesting companies when they're young and track them as they develop.''
 The best marker of Betaworks' success is Summize, a small start-up that allowed users to search through Twitter's ever-flowing stream of posts. Betaworks first invested in the company in December 2007 and continued helping to develop it. Twitter bought the service in July 2008 for a reported $15 million. 
 Betaworks created Bit.ly at the request of its portfolio of companies that wanted a secure, reliable way to shorten unwieldy Web addresses. 
 As the service quickly ballooned beyond the network of Betaworks companies, Mr. Borthwick and Mr. Weissman raised $3.5 million in venture financing for the company and spun out into a stand-alone business, although its team still works in Betaworks' office. ''It may look like the incubators of yesteryear in here,'' said Mr. Borthwick, gesturing to the scribbled-on chalkboards, the cushy lounge chairs and the fishtank shaped like the MTV logo. 
 ''We don't operate anything like a factory,'' he said. ''There's no production line, and we're not trying to blow out 40 companies this year.''

HEADLINE: Can Ghosts Bring Life To Old Cult Compound?

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
JONESTOWN, Guyana -- Carlton Daniels was sweating as he sliced through the jungle with his cutlass. He pointed at some bushes and said a chimpanzee named Mr. Muggs had once lived there in a cage. Then he emerged in a clearing, proclaiming, ''Welcome to the People's Temple Agricultural Project.''
 Better known as Jonestown, where more than 900 Americans committed suicide or were murdered one night in 1978 at the behest of the cult leader Jim Jones, the site yields few signs of remembrance. Rains, termites and scavengers have laid waste to its buildings. Vines camouflage its rusting vehicles, including an old flatbed truck and a tractor.
 But while nature seems intent on erasing the utopian experiment that went tragically awry here, some enterprising souls in Guyana, South America's only English-speaking nation, have another idea. They want Jonestown reborn as a tourist destination and are even getting some tepid help from the government, which spent more than 30 years largely trying to live it down. 
 Indranauth Haralsingh, director of the Guyana Tourism Authority, came here late last year to put up a plaque saying, ''In memory of the victims of the Jonestown tragedy, November 18, 1978, Jonestown, Guyana.'' 
 Some who live on Jonestown's edge, in the squalid mining town of Port Kaituma, could not be happier.
 ''Something more ambitious, a full-blown memorial of sorts, should have been founded years ago,'' said Mr. Daniels, 64, a wiry shopkeeper who ranks among Port Kaituma's top authorities on Jonestown, having met Mr. Jones on different occasions as a postal agent here in the 1970s. 
 ''Imagine,'' Mr. Daniels said in a lilting West Indian accent while relating how Mr. Jones's pet chimpanzee, Mr. Muggs, was used to terrorize disobedient followers, ''Jonestown could become a world-renowned center for the study of cults and what makes them tick.''
 Poverty offers another motivation for those trying to move ahead with tourism at Jonestown. Despite recent economic growth, the country, whose official name remains the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, is still recovering from the doctrinaire isolationism that made it the ideal place for Mr. Jones to establish his remote utopian enclave. 
 ''Jonestown was actually a wonderful place,'' said Gerald Gouveia, 54, who as a young army pilot would fly senior Jonestown members to Port Kaituma. ''They were hard-working idealists who wanted a community free from nuclear destruction, but their dream got twisted when they placed their leader in such reverence that it got to his brain.''
 Mr. Gouveia, now one of Guyana's top businessmen, wants to take visitors to Jonestown on his small airline. He flies his own planes, and on a trip to Port Kaituma he pointed out the spot on the airstrip where Leo J. Ryan, a congressman from California who came to investigate abuse claims in Jonestown, was shot dead by cult gunmen. Three journalists and a defector were also killed in the encounter.
 Those killings put into motion the exhortation by Mr. Jones that culminated in his night of mass suicide and murder. 
 ''I myself placed the American congressman's corpse in the body bag,'' Mr. Gouveia said. ''We can't just erase from our consciousness the events that transpired here, as that would be an insult to all the victims who perished in this place.''
 Talk first surfaced a few years ago about promoting Jonestown, a strategy that people here call ''dark tourism.'' One New York investor even drew up an investment plan with a Jonestown survivor to create a 10-acre project including a museum, a restaurant, a cafe, a souvenir shop and living quarters for employees. 
 But the project, which would require government approval, has not materialized. Some Guyanese ascribe this to Jonestown's remoteness. Officials are also reluctant to draw attention to Jonestown, trying instead to retool Guyana's image as a responsible environmental steward, most recently through a deal in which Norway pays Guyana to preserve forests. 
 ''The government's green initiatives,'' said David Dabydeen, Guyana's delegate to Unesco, ''redeem us from a crime which was overwhelmingly committed by Americans on Americans.'' 
 Asked about plans for tourism at Jonestown during an interview in Georgetown, Samuel Hinds, Guyana's prime minister, said, ''It's something I could live with.'' He added, ''I know there are people talking about restoration, but it would probably have to be a total recreation from pictures.'' 
 Some scholars who are trying to explain Jonestown to new generations say commercial tourism at the site would constitute disrespect for its victims. 
 ''Jim Jones was a master manipulator who created a siege mentality,'' said Julia Scheeres, a California author who is writing a history of Jonestown. ''Let the place be a peaceful field covered with flowers.'' 
 For now, Jonestown seems plucked from Alan Weisman's ''The World Without Us,'' a book that imagines how the remnants of civilization would crumble as nature reclaimed land freed from man's grasp. The forbidding bush stands in contrast to the muddy roads of Port Kaituma, about seven miles away, bustling with pork-knockers (miners, in Guyanese English), gold-buying shops, flophouses and brothels. 
 ''We'd like some diversification, and that's where tourism would fit in,'' said Dane Peters, 46, owner of Port Kaituma's Beacon's Hotel. He said he built the plaque at Jonestown last year to attract visitors. ''We need to start somewhere, with something small,'' he said. 
 At another boarding house, the Triple-R Sky View International Hotel, the owner, Rio Cadorna, agreed about Jonestown's potential. ''What this area really needs is a casino,'' said Mr. Cadorna, 64, an immigrant from the Philippines. ''We could justify it if we had some high-quality foreign visitors flowing in.''
 Yet while Port Kaituma's merchants dream of riches, the task of memorializing Jonestown still falls largely on Mr. Daniels, the former postal agent. 
 He witnessed Jonestown's rise and fall, arriving here in 1962 as a servant at the country club for British engineers who once mined manganese in the area. The British, along with their grounds for playing badminton and lawn tennis, are long gone now, too, Mr. Daniels pointed out. 
 ''The bush swallows everything,'' he said, swinging his cutlass at a barbed plant he called iguana's tail. He delved into Jonestown minutiae, explaining that it was not actually Kool-Aid used to mix Mr. Jones's cyanide potion but a knockoff called Flavor Aid. 
 At one spot, Mr. Daniels stopped and seemed to have a chill run down his spine, despite the blistering heat. He said that was where a sign once hung, above Mr. Jones's throne, in Jonestown's pavilion. It read, ''Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.''

HEADLINE: In Bitter Pill, No Sure Cure

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Nadim Audi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Greece, effectively bankrupt and with a European gun to its head, committed itself to years of austerity on Sunday when it signed a financial bailout deal with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. 
 But there are serious questions about whether the deep cuts in salaries and benefits the agreement calls for are politically sustainable over time, even as deflation will make it impossible for Greece to grow its way out of debt.
 There is a consensus that the Greek economy is broken and needs major structural reform, and the deal done on Sunday is intended to give Athens a couple of years of breathing room to change the fundamental pattern of Greek behavior.
 The government is now committed to whack back the public sector, including pensions and popular social benefits; to raise consumption taxes to record highs; and to promote tax reform, in an effort to shrink the enormous black market, reduce tax evasion and increase government receipts. 
 Some influential economists, however, fear that such harsh measures risk killing the patient, even as they see the intensity of Greek pain as a serious warning to other countries that use the euro to get their own economies in order before the currency union itself is undermined by rampaging market speculation.
 This new wave of austerity also risks pushing the entire European Union into a period of artificially low growth just as economies are trying to recover from the recession of last year, caused by the huge housing and banking crisis that started in the United States. Negative or low growth will increase already sizable unemployment and put new pressure on government spending, as well as on the banks themselves, and make it harder for everybody to reduce their debts. 
 ''How can Greece grow out of its debt if there is deflation?'' asked Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a professor of economics at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. ''Deflation increases the debt burden, so we are following this virtuous circle that is bringing us toward hell. Economics has nothing to do with virtue, which can kill an economy.''
 There is also some doubt whether this latest package of 110 billion euros over three years will be enough to calm the markets, which may then turn on other vulnerable countries, like Portugal or Spain. 
 Some countries that use the euro -- Germany, in particular -- need to pass legislation to come up with the money, although European Union officials said Sunday night that funding would be in place before May 19, when the next major tranche of Greek debt must be rolled over.
 Embedded in the euro and thus no longer in control of its own currency, Greece cannot take the easy way out of its debt by devaluing. So Greece must either cut its spending sharply or default on its loans -- which would badly damage German and French banks carrying a lot of Greek debt.
 That is considered one reason President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has been so quiet on the Greek crisis, Mr. Fitoussi said. The Greek deal ''is an indirect way of bailing out French and German banks,'' he said. ''The French understood this from the start, but Germany didn't seem to.''
 Katinka Barysch, an economist and deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London, said that that realization had hit home in Germany. ''It might be unpopular for the Germans and Europeans to bail out Greece, but it will be even more unpopular for them to bail out the banks that owned Greek bonds,'' she said.
 Thomas Piketty, the founder of the Paris School of Economics and a professor there, thinks that the demands on Greece, driven by a market frenzy, are simply too high. 
 ''Austerity can be justified, but 8 percent interest rates on a debt that amounts to more than 100 percent of gross domestic product is just crazy,'' he said. ''They will have to restore their public finances and then pay back this huge debt at the same time -- and Greek debt amounts to so little when you compare it to what was needed to bail out the banks'' last year.
 ''Not only is this not going to help growth, it's going to end very badly, politically speaking,'' Mr. Piketty said, referring to Greece. ''Taxpayers cannot accept this in the long run.''
 On Sunday, the Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, forecast a deeper than expected recession of 4 percent for 2010 and 2.6 percent in 2011, before the economy supposedly returns to growth of 1.1 percent in 2012. ''We will be in recession for the next few years, which means that we have to run faster to reduce the deficit,'' he said.
 But no one really knows what will happen in 2012, or if the Socialist government of Prime Minister George A. Papandreou, elected on a platform of increased prosperity, will still be in office. Standard & Poor's suggested last week that the euro value of Greece's gross domestic product may not return to last year's level until 2017.
 ''Unfortunately for economists, there is democracy,'' Mr. Fitoussi said. ''If you impose too strict a program, the population will refuse.'' Some countries, he acknowledged, have responded quietly so far to deep cuts, like Ireland and Latvia. ''But Greeks are not Latvians,'' he said, citing serious worker demonstrations already this weekend.
 Yet the problem is deeper for Greece than for other vulnerable and relatively uncompetitive countries, like Portugal and Spain, where the budget situation before the crisis was fairly good, even if overly reliant on a housing bubble. ''If growth stays negative or low in Greece, the fiscal debt will continue to increase, whatever they do,'' Ms. Barysch said, while difficult structural reforms to liberalize the economy will take time.
 The economists she speaks to ''don't really see a solution for Greece in the longer run,'' she said. Some argue that Greece should stop using the euro, as Argentina dissociated itself from a peg to the dollar in 2002, devaluing its currency and soon returning to growth, although with high inflation. But others say that since Greek debt is denominated in euros, leaving the euro zone will be too expensive and disruptive for a society in crisis. 
 Greece is functionally bankrupt, Ms. Barysch said. ''For most European officials and experts, it's not about fostering Greek growth, it's about the stability of the euro zone.''
 For Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, an economic policy research organization in Brussels, Greece is paying for its past sins of easy credit and false statistics, and has no choice now but to restore the health of its public finances. 
 ''I don't think there is an economic debate on this, because restoring fiscal sustainability must be the first step,'' he said. ''They can focus on growth afterward. But at this point, there is no way for Greece to escape this very painful process.''
 Still, Mr. Fitoussi warns that the crisis is not over -- that the market will move against other countries, to see if the Europeans have the will and the funds to protect them, and that the Greek government will not survive the painful adjustment.
 ''There will always be another government,'' he said. ''But in the process Europe will have lost its credibility, by imposing on a country an unbearable program.''

HEADLINE: Deciding How to Grade the Teachers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''With Teacher Layoffs Coming, Battle Turns to Seniority Rules'' (front page, April 25):
 While it would be ideal to have schools with the most effective teachers, it is clear that so far the best thinking has not come up with a universally acceptable method of assessment.
 One then has to consider layoffs from a social point of view. Teachers, like other academics, often give up more lucrative jobs in favor of the security and social benefits of a teaching position. To take this away, and break an agreement, when someone is middle-aged and less likely to find other employment is not only unfair but perhaps also immoral. 
 One alternative to layoffs is to offer two young teachers one position and pay them accordingly. This arrangement was used successfully in New York City in the 1970s as part of a new-teacher training program with which I was involved.
 There are sensible and sensitive ways to solve this problem without brutality.
 Alfred S. Posamentier Brooklyn, April 25, 2010
 The writer was dean of the school of education at City College of New York, CUNY, and is now a lecturer at the New York City College of Technology, CUNY.
 To the Editor:
 Your article's analysis of the city's teacher evaluations implies that basing layoffs on seniority is not a bad approach. Experienced teachers, on average, are more effective than newer teachers, you say. But these averages will be cold comfort to the thousands of children who will lose great junior teachers who beat the odds by getting results that are as good or better than their more experienced peers.
 The stakes are highest for the neediest students, who are more likely to have newer teachers. By forcing schools to ignore such teachers' achievements, the current layoff system threatens to rob many of these students of extraordinary educators.
 It doesn't have to be this way. Recently, in Indianapolis, the school district and local teachers' union agreed to use teacher performance factors in layoffs. In Albany, Assemblyman Jonathan Bing and State Senator Ruben Diaz Sr. introduced a promising bill that would rewrite the rules on teacher seniority.
 Some say it would be premature to create new rules without first instituting a better evaluation system. New York City has been waiting for such a system since early in the last century, but it has the information needed to make smarter layoff decisions now. We should not wait another day for a more rational policy.
 Ariela Rozman Brooklyn, April 25, 2010
 The writer is chief executive of the New Teacher Project, a national nonprofit organization that operates the N.Y.C. Teaching Fellows under a contract with the New York City Department of Education.
 To the Editor:
 It is not surprising that, according to The Times's analysis, teachers with a year or two of experience did not perform as well as those with 6 or 10 years, based upon student scores on standardized state exams.
 The best teachers have mastered the content and best current practices in their subject, figured out how to connect with students and have faith in their students' ability to learn. Honing these skills takes time. It is a lifelong process and should serve as a guide for decisions about which teachers to retain, regardless of how many years they have taught.
 Jeffrey H. Toney Union, N.J., April 26, 2010
 The writer is dean of the College of Natural, Applied and Health Sciences at Kean University.
 To the Editor:
 Our government still doesn't get it. Education is always a bottom priority. We can't afford to lay off teachers when the skills and knowledge of eighth graders in the United States lag behind those of students in other advanced economies.
 Why do the banks get bailouts, and not the Board of Education? We cannot compete in our global economy without raising our educational standards. Laying off teachers puts more children at risk for dropping out of school and joining the ranks of the unemployed.
 If we can't bail out our schools, here's another solution for Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein and the teachers' union to consider: In 1976, when a round of teacher cuts was announced in the special education school where I was teaching, I had seniority but wanted to pursue graduate work. I volunteered to go -- saving another teacher her job.
 Candy Schulman New York, April 25, 2010
 The writer is a part-time associate professor at the New School for General Studies.
 To the Editor:
 Teachers' unions, according to your article, argue that ''no one has figured out an accurate way to determine'' who the best teachers are.
 This is ridiculous. My son and daughter each attended 13 years of public school. The parents always knew who the best teachers were. If the parents can figure it out, certainly the education bureaucracy could do the same if it really wanted to.

HEADLINE: As Nuclear Conference Opens, U.S. Is Pushing to Deter a Mideast Arms Race

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
The opening Monday of a monthlong United Nations conference to strengthen the main treaty meant to halt the spread of nuclear arms is likely to be dominated by Iran's president denouncing the West and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warning that if Tehran gets the bomb, the rest of the Middle East will soon follow.
 But far less visibly, the Obama administration has been mounting a country-by-country campaign to go beyond the treaty and ensure that Iran's push toward atomic mastery does not ignite a regional nuclear arms race. In recent months, diplomats have been holding meetings in Washington and shuttling to the Middle East in pursuit of agreements that will let countries develop nuclear power while relinquishing the right to make atomic fuel that could be turned into bombs.
 Since the 189 signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty last gathered in New York five years ago, many of the world's oil-rich nations have begun thinking about or ordering nuclear power plants, arguing that the reserves that made them rich will not last forever. But the United States worries that their fear of an Iranian bomb could lead them to use the same nuclear-fuel technology to develop weapons of their own. 
 The American strategy, begun during the Bush administration, is to pre-empt that possibility. ''We think that's the right formula for the Middle East,'' Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, said in an interview on Friday.
 Late last year, the Obama administration closed the first deal, with the United Arab Emirates, which is preparing to build a $20 billion reactor complex on its Persian Gulf coast. Diplomats are negotiating similar agreements with Jordan and Bahrain and have the outlines of a deal with Saudi Arabia.
 Most everyone, including President Obama's aides, agrees that the United Nations conference will not fix the glaring weaknesses in the nonproliferation treaty, which have let Iran move to the edge of a nuclear-weapons capability. Rewriting the treaty is ''harder than changing the U.S. Constitution,'' Gary Samore, Mr. Obama's top adviser on nuclear arms, said last week.
 Instead, the administration is trying to entice Middle Eastern states out of enriching uranium for reactor fuel and later scavenging spent fuel for plutonium, a step known as reprocessing. Both are allowed by the treaty, and both can become clandestine means of making atom-bomb fuel. Instead, the countries would buy the fuel from international suppliers, reducing the chance of conversion to bomb-grade material.
 ''The less enrichment and reprocessing the better,'' Ms. Tauscher said.
 David A. Kay, a nuclear specialist who led the fruitless search for unconventional arms in Iraq, applauded the strategy. ''It's an attempt to close up the holes in the N.P.T.,'' he said in an interview. ''Equally, if not more so, it's an attempt to isolate the Iranians.''
 Iran and some other nations at the United Nations conference, including Egypt, have a different agenda: to force the region's one nuclear-weapons state, Israel, to acknowledge its atomic arsenal and sign on to the nonproliferation treaty.
 Egypt has championed a proposal to make the Middle East a zone free of nuclear arms, a goal that the Obama administration says it supports, but only in the context of a broader regional peace.
 Egypt, which has announced plans for several nuclear power reactors, is pressing for a conference on the nuclear-free zone next year. Its president, Hosni Mubarak, has spoken out bluntly about the alternatives, implying that his country might feel the need to develop nuclear weapons. ''We don't want nuclear arms in the area, but we are obligated to defense ourselves,'' he said in 2007 after discussing the Iranian nuclear program with Israel's prime minister then, Ehud Olmert. ''We will have to have the appropriate weapons.''
 Today, of the world's 430 operating nuclear power reactors, none are in the Middle East. One reason is that the area's oil reserves led many countries to consider nuclear power superfluous. But there is another reason: when countries began to build reactors, suspicions ran so high that they usually got bombed.
 In 1981, Israeli jets bombed an Iraqi reactor at Osirak. Twenty-six years later, in September 2007, they destroyed a reactor secretly under construction in Syria.
 In both cases, Israel feared the purpose of the reactors was to produce plutonium that could fuel bombs.
 But Israel was not alone. During the Iran-Iraq war in the mid-1980s, Saddam Hussein repeatedly ordered the bombing of an Iranian reactor project at Bushehr. Later, Iraq also fired missiles at a reactor that Israel built in the 1950s at Dimona to make plutonium for warheads. The Iraqi missiles missed.
 Only now is Iran preparing to switch on a reactor at Bushehr. Under an agreement worked out during the Bush administration, Russia is providing the fuel, and all the spent fuel is to be shipped back to Russia. Few believe Bushehr will provide Iran a path to a bomb, as long as the deal with Russia remains in force.
 But beyond Bushehr, the history of Iran's nuclear program underscores the weaknesses of the nonproliferation treaty. It also explains the rationale behind the American effort to persuade countries to renounce the making of atomic fuel.
 While the treaty puts no limits on the making of atomic fuel, it requires countries to forswear all military goals and submit to a range of international inspections. Cheating, though, has proved difficult to detect and almost impossible to punish. What has provoked demands for Iran to halt enrichment -- along with three rounds of United Nations sanctions and the threat of another -- is its history of deception and continuing refusal to answer central questions about its nuclear program.
 Iran is enriching uranium at two plants at Natanz, is building a third near the city of Qum and has announced its intention to build 10 more. Iran says it needs them to fuel 20 future reactors.
 It would be far cheaper, though, for Iran to buy the fuel on open markets. Iran has also admitted to experiments in reprocessing and scavenging plutonium. Its intent, it says, is not to make weapons but to acquire radioisotopes for nuclear medicine.
 For these and other reasons, many of Iran's Arab neighbors, along with Israel and the West, believe that its true goal is having a weapons ability. And so to many analysts, the growing interest among Persian Gulf nations for nuclear programs reflects a desire for a military edge.
 Still, there is another motivating factor: the economics of oil.
 When prices are high, gulf countries would prefer to sell their oil at great profit rather than burn it for power. A study done by the International Atomic Energy Agency and a group of gulf states concluded that nuclear power made sense for the region when the price of oil exceeded $50 a barrel. Today it is above $80, and with the world economy gradually recovering, many expect it to go higher.
 Every country in the region except Lebanon is planning to build nuclear reactors or has declared an interest in doing so.
 This year, Turkey signed deals with Russia and South Korea for preliminary studies of a complex on the Black Sea and another on the Mediterranean, with total power of up to 10,000 megawatts -- equal to 10 large reactors.
 Last month Jordan announced a competition between three bidders for a 1,100-megawatt reactor. And Saudi Arabia announced the establishment of an atomic city, named after the king, to promote nuclear power.
 The gulf nation furthest down the atomic road -- and the one that the United States calls the ''gold standard'' for nonproliferation -- is the United Arab Emirates.
 In April 2008, the Emirates signed a tentative agreement with the Bush administration to give up enrichment and reprocessing in exchange for access to the global market in nuclear technologies. A year later, the Emirates signed an accord that gave the International Atomic Energy Agency the right to search nuclear-related facilities throughout the country. Iran has withdrawn its agreement to the same accord.
 The Obama White House endorsed the Bush administration accord and sent it to Congress, which approved it last summer. On Dec. 17, the Emirates and the United States signed an agreement that made it legal to sell advanced nuclear technology to the country.
 Ten days later, the Emirates awarded a South Korean company the contract to build four 1,400-megawatt reactors -- quite large by industry standards. They are to begin making power between 2017 and 2020.
 The reactors are to be hardened against military and terrorist strikes. The Emirates has said nothing publicly, though, about whether it plans to set up antiaircraft or antimissile batteries, as Israel has done around its Dimona reactor and Iran around Bushehr.
 The Obama administration has been taking its case to academics and other Middle East specialists. In January, Ms. Tauscher spoke at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. And in March, the deputy energy secretary, Daniel B. Poneman, told the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, ''As countries in the Middle East look at developing civil nuclear programs, the United States can promote the highest standards for safety, security and nonproliferation.''

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT WARNS OF WIDE DAMAGE FROM GULF SPILL

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and HENRY FOUNTAIN; Campbell Robertson reported from New Orleans, and Henry Fountain from New York. Reporting was also contributed by Helene Cooper in Washington and Sam Dolnick in Baton Rouge, La. .

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- President Obama visited Louisiana on Sunday afternoon for a firsthand look at the response effort to an oil spill that he called a ''potentially unprecedented environmental disaster,'' while officials for BP described in detail their desperate efforts to seal the gushing well.
 ''The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our gulf states and it could extend for a long time,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home.'' 
 Over the next two days, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, the slick appears likely to move toward the Alabama and Florida coasts and engulf the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana's southeast tip. 
 BP was leasing the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that exploded on April 20. Two days later, it collapsed into the gulf, and the oil began leaking. BP, working with an array of government agencies and private companies, has been unable to stop the flow of crude from the well.
 Bob Fryar, the company's senior vice president for operations in Angola, who was brought to a command center in Houston for the engineering effort, said that on Monday, BP hoped to install a shut-off valve on one of the three leaks. That may stop some of the oil flow, Mr. Fryar said. 
 But the biggest leak, at the end of the riser pipe, which Mr. Fryar said was the source of most of the spewing oil, cannot be shut off this way. The company intends to address that leak by lowering a containment dome over it and then pumping the oil to the surface. That effort is still at least six days away, Mr. Fryar said. Another containment dome, for the third leak, which is on the riser near the wellhead, would follow two to four days after the first.
 The root of the problem appears to be a towering stack of heavy equipment 5,000 feet below the surface of the gulf known as a blowout preventer. It is a steel-framed stack of valves, rams, housings, tanks and hydraulic tubing that is designed to seal the well quickly in the event of a burst of pressure. It did not work when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded.
 Mr. Fryar and Charlie Holt, BP's drilling operations manager for the gulf, described an audacious plan to confront the blowout preventer problem. In this approach, they would seal the well by cutting the riser at the wellhead, sliding a huge piece of equipment called the riser package out of the way and bolting a second blowout preventer atop the first one. 
 The risk in attempting such a maneuver -- which would be performed, as all the undersea work has been, by robotic submersibles tethered to support ships 5,000 feet above -- is that the pressure of the oil rising from the well could be overwhelming, and the well could gush oil at a far higher rate. Mr. Fryar said a pressure gauge would be installed soon to determine if it was safe to attempt the operation.
 Speaking of the accident, Mr. Fryar said the blowout preventer ''has lots of redundancies, there are lots of opportunities to shut these off. None of these worked.''
 Whether the equipment was faulty or it was damaged in the accident was unclear. 
 Officials still plan to drill relief wells, which would allow crews to plug the gushing cavity with heavy liquid. Drilling of a first relief well was set to begin ''as soon as the weather clears,'' Mr. Fryar said. Drilling for a second well was expected to begin in two weeks. The relief wells, however, will take months to execute.
 Cleanup efforts were hampered again Sunday by bad weather and 7- to 10-foot swells, which prevented planes from dropping chemical dispersants and oil skimmers from corralling the slick on the surface. 
 Mr. Fryar said that for a second day, crews were injecting chemical dispersant into the oil as it flowed from the main leak. Dispersant, which is more conventionally used on the water surface, breaks the oil into small droplets and reduces its buoyancy, so it will sink to the bottom. 
 Mr. Fryar said technicians were trying to determine whether it would be possible to inject the dispersant directly into the riser deep under the water so that it would mix better with the flowing oil. ''We think this dispersant is highly effective,'' he said. ''We're hoping the oil won't make it to the surface.'' 
 The impact of chemical dispersants on deepwater ecology is unclear.
 Closer to land, crews continued to put out booms to stop the oil and were training volunteers in Mississippi and Florida to help minimize the impact if the slick reaches the beach, said John Curry, head of external affairs at BP. 
 Speaking to reporters in the rain in Venice, La., after talking with response teams that have amassed on the coast to try to stem the tide of oil lapping the shoreline, Mr. Obama vowed that the government would keep up the pressure on BP.
 While he did not criticize the company in his public remarks, Mr. Obama's comments reflected increased frustration in the administration with BP's inability to plug the oil leak. The president again reiterated that American taxpayers would not foot the bill.
 ''BP is responsible for this leak -- BP will be paying the bill,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Mr. Obama had initially not planned to visit the region until later this week at the earliest, White House officials said Friday afternoon. But by late Friday night, with criticism mounting that the government's response was too slow, White House officials decided that the president needed to make the trip to the gulf on Sunday.
 White House officials sent two Cabinet officials to appear on the Sunday television talk shows with the message that the administration was doing everything it could to take control of the spill and that it had been involved from the beginning. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Fox News Sunday that the government had an ''all hands on deck'' approach to the disaster.
 For Mr. Obama, the widening environmental calamity in the gulf is made even more complicated, politically, by the fact that the spill occurred just a month after he announced he was expanding offshore drilling. He now says that no new leases will be approved until a thorough review of the causes of the BP leak is complete. 
 ''Every American affected by this spill should know this: Your government will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes to stop this crisis,'' Mr. Obama said after his briefing by federal and state officials. He said the spill endangered the ''heartbeat of the region's economic life.'' 
 Mr. Obama met with Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana upon the arrival of Air Force One in New Orleans. Then he went to Venice for two hours -- by road, rather than helicopter, because of inclement weather -- to look at the response.
 He stopped to speak to several fishermen, assuring them that BP would reimburse them for lost earnings. But reimbursement may be one of the largest battles to come, given that federal law sets a limit of $75 million on BP's liability for damages, apart from the cleanup costs. 
 ''It's going to be extremely tricky'' to reimburse fishermen and others if economic damages tally above $75 million, said Stuart Smith, a New Orleans-based lawyer who is pushing for Congressional action to amend the law. ''They may not be obligated to pay more than that unless they agree to do it.''
 There is a federal fund, generated from a tax on oil, that may cover as much as $1 billion in damages.

HEADLINE: It's the Show, Not the Screen

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER; Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It might be hard to imagine watching ''The Office'' on a screen no bigger than a business card. But tens of thousands of people -- by the most conservative estimate -- are already doing just that.
 As Hollywood shrinks its films and television shows for the small screens of cellphones, its assumptions about mobile viewing are being upended by surprisingly patient consumers.
 ''We all thought they'd be watching video clips in the checkout line or between classes,'' said Vivi Zigler, the president for digital entertainment at NBC Universal, summing up the industry's conventional wisdom. But owners of iPhones and other smartphones are actually watching long episodes and sometimes complete films, so a growing number of media companies are vying for people's mobile attention spans.
 Measured against TV ratings and box-office receipts, the mobile video audience is tiny today, but a range of companies, from Hollywood studios to local TV stations, all foresee an increasingly wireless world -- and they don't want to be cut out of the picture. 
 Some TV shows, like ''The Office'' on NBC.com, are streamed at no charge now, but there is a gnawing fear among media companies that they may be leaving money on the table by relying solely on revenue from advertising. And there is always the concern -- whether it be on the Internet or on phones -- that the new platforms could cannibalize the companies' core businesses. 
 Accordingly, much of the mobile TV experimentation is happening on the paid side, through packages sold by individual carriers like AT&T and Verizon and through subscription services that will be coming soon.
 ''The economics around this are exhausting,'' Ms. Zigler said.
 Joining the wireless equivalent of a land rush, last month some of the biggest local TV station owners in the United States announced a joint venture to transmit their content to viewers on the go. It is most likely years away from operation.
 The stations would transmit to phones over the airwaves, much like Flo TV, a unit of Qualcomm, which has invested about $1 billion in mobile video distribution. The service sends channels like ESPN, Fox News and MTV to phones.
 ''Putting the concepts of mobility and watching video together is a natural, and we're seeing it really grow right now,'' said Flo TV's president, Bill Stone.
 Mr. Stone says the average Flo user watches 30 minutes of video a day. So far, though, few people are ponying up $10 a month or more for the service.
 But that is not stopping other media companies from trying to charge for walled gardens of content. Beginning later this year, Bitbop, a product of the News Corporation's Fox Mobile Group, will stream TV episodes to smartphones for $9.99 a month. 
 The News Corporation declined an interview request, but Joe Bilman of Fox Mobile, who is described as the chief architect of Bitbop, said in a statement in March that ''the marriage of on-demand content and mobility has the power to ignite a fire in the smartphone space.'' 
 Along with all-you-can-watch plans like Bitbop, there are a la carte stores for mobile viewing popping up. Blockbuster, the beleaguered movie rental chain, started selling movies for phones in the last month. The Oscar winner ''The Hurt Locker'' costs $3.99 for a 24-hour rental period.
 But no one can say how big the market is for costly video delivered to phones. Most households already pay monthly cable or satellite TV bills. And those distributors are already starting to circle the mobile arena. 
 Mr. Stone would not say how many subscribers Flo has, citing relationships with its wireless carrier partners. But he acknowledged that the market was ''early,'' and would not say when Qualcomm expected Flo to turn profitable.
 On top of the paid services, there is perhaps the simplest one of all, which is free and supported by ads. When NBC.com is reached from a smartphone, it typically takes a few seconds for the episode to start playing, but the streaming is surprisingly reliable on a 3G network. Similarly, CBS gives away an iPhone application for TV viewing.
 Many media companies are distributing their wares several different ways, since as J. B. Perrette, the president for digital and affiliate distribution for NBC Universal, put it, ''we don't have an answer as to which one is going to win out.''
 From services like Flo, networks receive subscriber fees. From their own Web sites, networks may find it easier to customize ads to individual viewers. 
 While the audience for mobile TV is small at the moment, it is growing rapidly. Roughly 17.6 million people in the United States watched video on their phones in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the Nielsen Company, up from 11.2 million 12 months earlier. They watched an average of three hours and 37 minutes of mobile video a month.
 By way of comparison, Americans who watch television watch on average 153 hours of traditional TV a month.
 Eric Berger, the senior vice president for digital networks for Sony Pictures Television, said the increase in mobile-viewing minutes correlates to the surge in smartphone sales. Sony has found that mobile visitors to its online video site, Crackle, watch movies for an average of 26 minutes. About 20 percent of visitors finish the movies. Mr. Berger said he thinks that people tune in to movies that they have already seen and watch portions of them again.
 Many media researchers still maintain that viewers gravitate toward the best available screen, defending TV as the medium to beat. If a parent is watching on the living room TV set, a child may choose to watch something else on his or her phone.
 ''It's becoming more mass market than it was, say, two years ago,'' Mr. Berger said of mobile TV.
 Similarly, Ms. Zigler has found that 60 percent of mobile visitors to NBC.com are coming from home, indicating that some people do not mind watching comedies and dramas on a palm-size screen even when a big-screen TV is nearby. ''It's pretty remarkable,'' she said.
 But bandwidth constraints are a big concern. Blockbuster's streaming service, for instance, does not yet work on the iPhone, which is sold by Apple, with service by AT&T. 
 The iPhone is ''a little challenging,'' said Scott Levine, vice president for digital at Blockbuster, citing the heavy bandwidth demands the phone places on AT&T's strained network. ''We have to think about how to make 3G work with the carriers. Above all, we want it to be a good experience for users.''
 Carriers say they are gradually introducing next-generation networks that will be better suited for widespread video viewing. And Kay Johansson, the chief technology officer for MobiTV, said his company and others kept finding ways to squeeze more data through the existing lines.
 But in the meantime, ventures that rely on over-the-air spectrum -- like Flo and, someday, the one announced by local stations -- say they can deliver video to mobile customers much more efficiently. Both factions are confident that people will increasingly want to watch video on the go, whether live over the airwaves or on demand over a wireless carrier's network.
 ''The TV at home is just going to be a bigger screen,'' Mr. Johansson said.

HEADLINE: United and Continental Announce Merger

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: United Airlines and Continental Airlines on Monday announced a $3 billion merger that would create the world's biggest airline. 

 BODY:
United Airlines and Continental Airlines on Monday announced a $3 billion merger that would create the world's biggest airline, Jad Mouawad and Michael J. de la Merced report in The New York Times.
The all-stock deal would form a coast-to-coast American behemoth with a leading presence in the top domestic markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, along with an extended network to Asia, Latin America and Europe. The deal was completed in a remarkably swift two weeks, and would give the airlines the muscle to fend off low-cost rivals at home and to take on foreign carriers abroad.
United is buying Continental, and the combined company will keep the United name and be based in Chicago. Jeffery A. Smisek, Continental's chief executive, will run the company. Assuming the deal wins antitrust approval, the merged airline would replace Delta Air Lines as the top carrier.
The boards of both companies met Sunday to approve the all-stock deal. The UAL Corporation, United's parent company, will issue 1.05 shares for each Continental share, valuing the acquisition at $3.17 billion, based on Friday's closing price. The merger is expected to be completed before the end of the year.
For consumers, the merger could eventually result in higher prices. Though the new company does not intend to raise fares, according to people briefed on the matter, one of the rationales for airline mergers is to cut capacity. That reduces the number of seats in the industry and allows airlines to increase fares.
In addition, United and Continental will no longer be competing against each other on some routes, allowing them to save money but offering travelers fewer options.
"Airlines are struggling to find a business model that makes sense," said Scott Sonenshein, an assistant professor at the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University. "Consolidation gives them more leverage. As a consumer, you will have less choices, fewer routes, higher prices and more fees."
Still, in the last decade fares in the United States have declined because of pressure from low-fare airlines like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, as well as lower passenger demand. As a result, previous mergers have had a muted effect on ticket prices, especially on routes served by low-fare carriers.
Even with the steep cuts made in the last two years, airlines are still losing money, with too many seats chasing too few passengers. For much of the last decade they have suffered a succession of powerful blows - from the terrorist attacks of 9/11 to rapidly rising fuel costs and the recession. They have also been straining to keep up with low-fare competition.
But with the economy starting to improve and passenger traffic picking up, the industry is generally healthier now, with more cash and less debt. Credit markets have also thawed, allowing access to capital.
Combined, United and Continental have 21 percent of domestic capacity, in terms of so-called available seat miles, or one seat flown one mile. Delta has a market share of 20 percent. Globally, the merged companies would have a 7 percent market share.
The merger would put pressure on American Airlines, which was once the market leader, but which would drop to third place. While American's executives say they do not feel threatened by industry mergers, Wall Street analysts have been displeased by the company's performance.
US Airways, which three weeks ago began its own merger talks with United, is now left on the sidelines, raising questions about its ability to survive as a stand-alone carrier.
The United-Continental deal has some major hurdles to clear. The airlines need to win approval from the Justice Department's antitrust division, a challenge given the renewed regulatory zeal in Washington. Unlike the Bush administration's six-month review of the Delta-Northwest deal, analysts expect a lengthier and more complex review of this merger.
The merger also needs the backing of employee unions, whose opposition to mergers in the past has undone many of the proposed savings. One factor in favor of the deal is that United's pilots' union indicated last month it would not oppose a deal with Continental, whose own pilots have so far remained silent.
The board approvals end nearly a month of intrigue after United initiated talks to combine with US Airways. Those negotiations caught Continental executives by surprise, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Many analysts said United's talks with US Airways were intended all along to lure Continental to the table.
United and Continental were close to a merger two years ago, but Continental walked away because of United's poor financial health.
The earlier talks allowed for swift negotiations this time. United and Continental executives quickly settled some potentially divisive issues, like the name of the combined company, where its headquarters would be and who would run it. United's chairman, Glenn F. Tilton, would remain for two years. After that, Mr. Smisek of Continental would become the executive chairman.
The Chicago connection could provide additional benefits. Mr. Tilton has been courting local politicians, and the city is eager to retain a major business. United now could use that leverage with the Obama administration, whose ties to Chicago run deep.
United shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined company, with Continental shareholders owning the rest. Management would be roughly split between the sides. The new entity would expect annual cost savings of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and would still fly to 370 cities in 59 countries.
The combined airlines would have a 40 percent market share at San Francisco International and 35 percent at Chicago O'Hare International, according to data compiled by Cambridge Aviation Research, a consulting company. At Houston Intercontinental, one of the city's two airports, they would have 64 percent of the market and at Newark Liberty International, 55 percent.
A merger could yield more than $2 billion in additional revenue and cost savings, according to estimates by Vicki Bryan, an analyst at Gimme Credit.
The deal is a personal success for Mr. Tilton, a former oil executive who ran the Texaco Corporation until it was acquired by Chevron. He took over United in 2002 as it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and has since pushed relentlessly for a merger.
It also vindicates the work of Kathryn A. Mikells, United's chief financial officer since November 2008, who is the highest-ranking woman in an industry dominated by men. Analysts have praised her for United's cost-cutting efforts in the last year, Jeff Straebler, a strategist at RBS Securities, said.
United's improved finances have allowed for a major turnaround in its fortunes. In 2008, it was Continental that was close to buying United. But as that deal was being negotiated, United reported steeper-than-expected losses, leading to doubts about the company's health even as soaring oil prices were crippling the entire industry. Just hours before a deal was to be announced, Continental executives walked away.
But in the last two years, United has improved its cash position, aggressively reduced capacity, raised new revenue from bag and other fees, and cut costs. It now has $4.5 billion in cash.
United was advised by JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Continental was advised by Lazard, Morgan Stanley and the law firms Jones Day, Vinson & Elkins, and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.

HEADLINE: Early Childhood Programs Expanded

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Despite the recession, states continued to expand early childhood programs in the 2008-9 school year, according to an annual survey by the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. Nationwide enrollment in state-financed prekindergarten programs grew by 82,000, to more than 1.2 million children, the institute said. But average state spending per child dropped, to $4,143 from $4,179 the previous year. Oklahoma has the best early childhood program, based on the percentage of children enrolled, program quality and other factors, the institute said. Other states in the institute's top 10 ranking were Arkansas, West Virginia, New Jersey, Maryland, Georgia, North Carolina, Illinois, Louisiana and Tennessee.

HEADLINE: Top New York Judge Urges Greater Legal Rights for the Poor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
New York's chief judge called on Monday for a new guarantee of a lawyer for poor people in civil cases, like suits over eviction and other disputes where basic needs are at stake, pushing the state to the forefront of a national effort to expand the right to representation for the indigent.
 In a speech in Albany, the chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, said his proposal, the first such plan by a top court official in New York, reflected a commitment by the state's courts ''to bring us closer to the ideal of equal access to civil justice'' that he described as one of the foundations of the legal system. 
 ''I am not talking about a single initiative, pilot project or temporary program,'' Judge Lippman said, ''but what I believe must be a comprehensive, multifaceted, systemic approach to providing counsel to the indigent in civil cases.''
 There was no price tag on the proposal, which could cost many millions of dollars. But Judge Lippman sought to avoid having it fall victim to the politics of the recession by announcing that he would hold hearings before pushing a detailed plan forward next year.
 The government has been required to provide lawyers for people facing jail because of criminal charges since a landmark ruling by the United States Supreme Court in 1963, Gideon v. Wainwright.
 But that protection has never included civil cases. Lawyers for the poor argue that it should because civil courts are where people who cannot afford lawyers often face the loss of the necessities of life in lopsided legal battles. Opponents say more government-paid lawyers for the poor will paralyze the courts with needless disputes. 
 Some Democratic legislators said they were interested in Judge Lippman's idea. In a statement, Speaker Sheldon Silver said the Assembly had been a strong supporter of civil legal services for nearly 20 years.
 Austin Shafran, a spokesman for the State Senate Democratic leader, John L. Sampson, said the senator had always supported programs that provided lawyers for indigent New Yorkers and was looking carefully at what Judge Lippman had put forward.
 Judge Lippman, a longtime court administrator, has set an unabashedly liberal course as chief judge, a position he assumed last year after he was nominated by Gov. David A. Paterson. In addition to a seat on the highest court in New York, the chief judge also has a broad role as the top administrative official of the state's sprawling court system. 
 The speech may well give Judge Lippman national prominence in efforts in recent years by lawyers for the poor, consumer advocates and some legislators around the country to expand the right to a lawyer. California passed a law in 2009 intended to expand legal counsel in civil cases. 
 There have been local bills elsewhere, including in New York City, and lawsuits in several states arguing that the protections of the legal system are often meaningless to people too poor to hire lawyers. In 2006, the American Bar Association said there should be a right to a lawyer in civil cases where basic human needs were at stake, like those dealing with shelter, sustenance, safety, health or child custody.
 Advocates for the right to a lawyer in civil cases -- some of them call it a ''civil Gideon'' right, referring to the 1963 ruling for criminal cases -- said Monday that Judge Lippman's speech was one of the most notable steps in their efforts. 
 ''It is a very important statement, both in New York and nationally, about the need for access to justice. I don't know that any stronger voice has come forward,'' said Donald Saunders, a vice president of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, the largest national group of lawyers for the poor. 
 In his speech, Judge Lippman said the recession had swelled the ranks of New Yorkers who could not afford lawyers facing civil legal problems to more than two million a year. 
 Judge Lippman said he would hold hearings beginning this fall in every part of the state to assess the extent and nature of the unmet need for civil legal representation. He said the hearings would end with recommendations to the Legislature of the kinds of civil cases in which legal representation should be required and what financing would meet those needs. 
 Legal Aid and other providers of civil legal representation to poor people in New York State operate on about $200 million a year, officials say, a combination of federal, state, local and privately raised money. Those organizations said that they were unable to meet the needs but that the extent of the shortfall was not known. 
 Steven Banks, the attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society in the city, called it ''a huge step'' for the leader of the court system to endorse the idea that poor people had a right to a lawyer, whether they found themselves in criminal or civil court.

HEADLINE: From Queens Roots, Cuomo Clan Branched Out

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
The Cuomos may be New York political royalty, but Andrew M. Cuomo and his father have always made note of their humble Queens roots. 
 Mario M. Cuomo, the former governor, would often weave into conversations some reference to how his mother had arrived from Tramonti, Italy, and how he was a Queens man whose father's ''very special dream'' had been to have a ''house with a yard and a tree to call our own.'' Andrew Cuomo's campaign Web site -- it says ''Attorney General 2010,'' as he has not officially declared an intention to run for governor -- mentions his childhood in Hollis and his grandmother's grocery store in South Jamaica. Andrew Cuomo said in an interview that he still considered Queens his first home.
 ''That's where we grew up,'' he said. ''I lived in Queens. I went to school in Queens. I worked in Queens. I have a lot of friends there.'' 
 But like many prosperous New Yorkers, the Cuomos have largely left Queens behind, at least in real estate terms. Mario and his brood have dispersed through Manhattan and parts of Westchester, to some of the metropolitan region's most coveted towns and addresses.
 Andrew left Queens in 1993 when he sold his six-bedroom house at Grosvenor Street in Douglas Manor to Brian and Pascale Hainline, according to data provided by the Web site Property Shark. Dr. Brian Hainline, a neurologist, remembered that Mr. Cuomo's wife at the time, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, baked chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies for his children and brought the Hainlines to a second-floor wall covered with letters that her father, Robert F. Kennedy, and her Uncle John had written to her. 
 Dr. Hainline recalled that the Cuomos had done extensive renovation work on the house and had not expected to leave. But from 1993 until 2001, Mr. Cuomo was based in Washington, first as an assistant secretary in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, then as secretary. In 2001, Mr. Cuomo returned to the New York area, primed to run for governor. 
 He and his wife bought a $965,000 house in the wealthy Westchester town of Bedford. But they tried to play that down by saying that it was in its less exclusive neighbor, Mount Kisco. (The property had a Mount Kisco postal address).
 After his divorce in 2003, he lived for a few years at the Ocean, a 500-unit rental building at 1 West Street in the financial district. But to be closer to his three daughters, Mr. Cuomo is now living in Westchester with his companion, Sandra Lee, the Food Network star, who owns a four-bedroom colonial-style house on three acres in Newcastle that she bought in 2008 for $1.22 million.
 The rest of the family lives in Manhattan. Mario and Matilda Cuomo live on Sutton Place South, in a seven-room co-op they paid $595,000 for in 1995, according to a Newsday report at the time. ''It's a perfectly respectable building,'' said Michele Kleier, president of the brokerage Gumley Haft Kleier. ''But it's a typical postwar high-rise.''
 Ms. Kleier is more impressed with the nearby residence of Andrew's sister Maria Cuomo Cole and her husband, the designer Kenneth Cole. In 2008, the Coles bought a five-bedroom, $14.5 million apartment, also on Sutton Place South. The Sotheby's listing made much of the apartment's ''sweeping river views'' along with a private elevator, a corner drawing room and a wood-paneled library. 
 The building is described as a ''cloud palace'' and a ''high society bastion'' built as a family compound for Henry Phipps, according to the book ''High Rise Low Down'' by Denise Lefrak Calicchio. 
 ''That's a gorgeous building,'' Ms. Kleier said. ''It has beautiful, very big apartments.''
 Ms. Cole also has ties to Westchester. Property records show that she and her husband still have the home they bought in Purchase in 1991 for $2.8 million. 
 Andrew's younger brother Christopher, a television journalist for ABC, may have the most modest digs. He lives in a prewar co-op on West End Avenue with his wife, Cristina Greeven Cuomo.
 ''It's not like a 15 Central Park West or an Apthorp,'' said Jordan Hoch, a Prudential Douglas Elliman broker selling a one-bedroom apartment in the building for $489,000. ''It's a nice, normal building.''
 Despite the fancier addresses that members of the family now call home, the Cuomo name still echoes in their ancestral borough. In 1995, Mario Cuomo sold the Holliswood home where he grew up, but neighbors still call it the Cuomo house, said Michael Cavounis, who bought the three-bedroom center-hall-colonial-style home in 2000 for $400,000. 
 The state still sends Mr. Cuomo some mail there, Mr. Cavounis said, and visitors still stop by to see, hug and take photographs of the spruce tree in the front yard that Mr. Cuomo described in his children's book ''The Blue Spruce.''
 Mario Cuomo's father, Andrea Cuomo, had chiseled castle-shaped statues out of stone for his children and grandchildren, and at least a couple of the statues remained behind after the Cuomos left Queens. In 2009, Mr. Cavounis called the former governor to offer him the last one left on the property.
 The next day, Mr. Cavounis received a call from his wife that a man was digging in the garden with a shovel. After Mr. Cavounis rushed home, he realized that the man was Andrew Cuomo. 
 The attorney general recalled last week that the statue was ''very hard to dig up,'' but that it meant a lot to him. Mr. Cuomo was named after his grandfather, and he recalled him doing masonry as a hobby. 
 ''I enjoy telling my kids about my grandfather through the castle,'' he said. ''It was a nice thing to remember him by.''

HEADLINE: Fast Start Surprises Even The Red Bulls

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
The play and decision-making of Red Bulls midfielder Dane Richards often can run hot and cold -- but he always runs fast.
 The play of Richards in Saturday afternoon's 2-0 win at D.C. United helped the first-place Red Bulls continue the best start in team history (5-1, 15 points).
 A Jamaican international by way of Clemson, Richards has always offered speed on the right side of the field, but often when it comes to making that final killing pass, Richards has failed. That was not the case Saturday, when he played a role in the Red Bulls' goals.
 With Saturday's win, their third straight, the Red Bulls equaled their victory total from the 2009 season, when they posted their fifth win on the final day of the regular season, Oct. 24. Saturday's victory also broke the team's 10-game winless streak at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium dating to October 2005 and ended a 20-game road victory drought against Eastern Conference opponents. With a 7-point lead over second place Chicago and Columbus -- not to mention a 15-point lead over last-place D.C., and a 12-point edge over expansion Philadelphia -- the Red Bulls are in an unfamiliar comfort zone six games into the season. 
 ''I can't get over the fact that we have five wins,'' defender Mike Petke said Saturday. ''Maybe we'll sit down tonight and think about it. To be 5-1 after six games really puts ourselves in a good situation for the rest of the season. It's unbelievable.''
 Coach Hans Backe, who was concerned that many scoring opportunities were emanating from the midfield, had to be pleased that both goals against D.C. United came from strikers: Salou Ibrahim (off a low crossing ball from Richards) and Juan Pablo Angel (on a header from a free kick awarded for a foul on Richards). Ibrahim and Angel, who scored in the second half, each found the back of the net for the second game in a row.
 ''Mentally we're very, very strong,'' Ibrahim said. ''It comes also from the head coach; he is very strong and very relaxed and doesn't put too much pressure on the players.''
 AROUND THE LEAGUE Of the 19 penalty kicks awarded in M.L.S. so far this season, Real Salt Lake has had four called against it in six games and has lost three of those four games by one goal. ... Philadelphia's 17-year-old forward Jay McInerney scored his first M.L.S. goal in the Union's 3-1 loss at Los Angeles on Saturday. Arizona
 Glendale, Ariz., is one of the 18 cites included in the United States' bid to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cup, but the new immigration law passed recently in Arizona could have an effect.
 The spokesman for the committee running the United States' bid, Jurgen Mainka, said the group would not comment on the new law. FIFA will name the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments in December, with the United States expected to use 12 cities if it secures a bid.
 The United States Soccer Federation, through a spokesman, Neil Buethe, also declined to comment when asked about the potential ramifications of the new immigration law.
 Glendale's University of Phoenix Stadium has emerged as a destination for Soccer United Marketing, the marketing arm of Major League Soccer that owns the promotional rights to the Mexican national team in the United States. Soccer United Marketing and M.L.S. have cultivated an increasingly close relationship with the top Mexican league and have staged the InterLiga, a tournament that sends Mexican teams to the South American club championship, and the SuperLiga, a tournament among M.L.S. and Mexican clubs. An exhibition between the United States and Mexico in Glendale drew more than 62,000 fans in February 2007. A doubleheader of the Concacaf Gold Cup last summer, which also included Mexico, drew about 25,000 fans.
 ''We will continue to look at Phoenix as an option to bring top-flight soccer events,'' Marisabel Munoz, the director of international communications for M.L.S. and Soccer United Marketing, said. ''But the economic downturn in some markets, and especially in Arizona real estate, has affected some games. Last November, we had Mexico-Ecuador in Glendale, and it drew 25,587 in a depressed market.''
 The union that represents M.L.S. players has not taken a position on the immigration law.
 ''I certainly have a strong personal opinion on the law, but as an organization we have not taken a position or made any statement,'' the union's executive director, Bob Foose, said in an e-mail message.
 Notes
 Iain Dowie, the manager of relegated Hull City, said that Jozy Altidore, the American striker who spent the season on loan to the English Premier League club, needed to improve his training habits. ''You've got to stretch yourself every day in training,'' Dowie told Sky Sports. ''If Jozy can train the way he plays, I think he's got a great opportunity, but he needs to understand that it's day in, day out.''
 A top FIFA official, the secretary general Jerome Valcke, was critical of Brazil's stadium preparations for the 2014 World Cup on Monday before a ceremony in Johannesburg. ''There are a number with red lights already, which is amazing,'' Valcke told The Associated Press. ''It is amazing how Brazil is already late.'' FIFA accepted 12 host cities for the 2014 tournament. Brazil has hosted one World Cup, in 1950.
 Chivas Guadalajara, one of the favorites to win the Clausura playoffs in Mexico, lost at Morelia last Saturday, 4-2. The quarterfinal return match will be Saturday in Guadalajara but not before the Goats travel to Argentina for Tuesday's return match in the Copa Libertadores knockout round against Velez Sarsfield. Chivas beat Velez in the first match, 3-0.
 The former England Coach Steve McLaren led F.C. Twente to its first Eredivisie title in the Netherlands and became the first English coach to win a continental title since Bobby Robson won the Portuguese league with Porto in 1996. F.C. Twente edged Ajax by a point.

HEADLINE: By the Architects, for the People: A Trend for the 2010s

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
NEWARK -- Last week, when the city planning board here voted to approve construction of a four-block-long mixed-use development, the decision was barely noticed outside a small circle of civic boosters. But it was a turning point in the career of the project's architect, Richard Meier. 
 For decades Mr. Meier, with his trademark dark suits and leonine white hair, has been a fixture on the New York social scene, where he often rubs elbows with his moneyed clients. And his designs, from second homes in the Hamptons to international art museums, have become known for an almost unbearable, and expensive, refinement. He is the Martha Stewart of the Modernists.
 But the Newark development, a complex for middle- and lower-income tenants to be known as Teachers Village, takes Mr. Meier, 75, back to his roots, to a time more than 40 years ago when he devoted as much energy to subsidized housing as to beach houses. Despite the project's modest budget of $120 million, its tautly composed and thoughtfully laid out forms reflect the same intelligence and care found in most of Mr. Meier's work. City officials are hoping its design -- along with its location, a dilapidated neighborhood between City Hall and a cluster of college campuses -- will help contribute to a much wider urban revival. 
 Teachers Village is not only the most impressive of several new initiatives in Newark, but also the most dramatic example yet of what is shaping up to be a significant and hopeful trend in architecture. After a long period in which America's greatest talents seemed to work almost exclusively at the service of the wealthy, there are signs that their efforts are trickling down to other segments of society. In New York, for example, Annabelle Selldorf, best known for the exacting precision of her gallery designs and loft renovations -- and for revamping the Oak Room at the Plaza Hotel -- is about to break ground on a recycling plant on the Brooklyn waterfront; she may soon start work on another in the Bronx. Michael Maltzan, the architect behind the Museum of Modern Art's temporary home in Queens during its last renovation, as well as homes for major art collectors, recently completed his second housing project for the homeless in six years, and is now working on his third.
 If things continue this way, it may actually mean a renewal of architecture's onetime commitment to elevating the lives of ordinary people. Such a renewal is not likely to be as ambitious -- some would say naive -- in its social aims as President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty and the Modernist architecture that was dominant at the time. But it could lead to a fresh engagement with some of the challenges those movements took on, an engagement informed by the lessons of their failings.
 Mr. Meier's career in particular neatly reflects the historical ups and downs of the past half century. In the late 1960s, he was approached by the newly created Urban Development Corporation of New York State to design a 523-unit project in the Bronx. As an alternative to the conventional tower-in-the-park model, he created three midrise buildings that were lifted up on columns to invite the neighborhood into their central courtyard. 
 Photos of that project, called Twin Parks, were published in Architectural Forum and The New York Times, and the state went on to hire Mr. Meier to design a vast developmental center for the mentally handicapped in the Bronx. 
 But by then the backlash against large-scale Modernist housing -- and the government programs that paid for it -- was in full swing, as even progressive projects like Mr. Meier's failed to deliver on their promises. Modernism of every stripe was condemned, sometimes unfairly, for a tabula rasa approach to planning and insensitivity to local contexts. By the Reagan era, ''inner-city'' housing projects had given way, as the dominant symbols of urban design, to festival marketplaces and corporate towers. 
 ''It's always about the clients,'' the architect Steven Holl said in a recent interview. ''Without good clients you can't have good architecture.'' When he first came to New York in 1977, he said, the Urban Development Corporation was working with some of the profession's most adventurous thinkers. Jose Luis Sert, a former dean of Harvard's graduate school of architecture, had just designed a high-density housing development for Roosevelt Island, and Peter Eisenman, a radical thinker, had recently completed a housing project in Brownsville, Brooklyn.
 The building surge of the '80s produced little serious architecture, and when it began to return in the 1990s and 2000s, it was generally in the form of cultural institutions and corporate towers. Any trickling that occurred, in terms of architectural talent, tended to be up, as mainstream developers discovered that a recognizable design name could be a valuable tool in marketing luxury high-rises. 
 When Nicolas Berggruen, a co-developer of the Newark project and one of its main investors, first approached Mr. Meier in 2006, it was to design a luxury tower for some property he owned in Tel Aviv. The Newark project, which was begun a year later, began as a mix of condos and low- and middle-income housing anchored at one end by twin 77-story condo and office towers. But the towers, especially, turned out to be impossible to finance, and Ron Beit, Mr. Berggruen's local partner and the principal developer, began casting around for new ideas to develop the site. 
 ''When we started to look at the area again, we realized that the middle-income had really been left out,'' Mr. Beit said, and teachers in particular. ''There were already 1,000 charter schoolteachers here, and another 5,000 in public school,'' he said. ''They're highly educated and urban, so they were a natural fit.''
 The final version of the proposal is organized around two new charter-school buildings (one housing two schools) that are to be set on either side of Halsey Street, a strip of decaying and abandoned buildings. The apartment buildings, which will serve teachers working throughout the city and range in size from 17 to 66 units, will extend from each end of this central group, like limbs reaching out into the neighborhood. 
 Mr. Meier has gone to greater lengths than in the past to merge his design with its context, not just by breaking it down into several buildings, but also by using strategies like a pedestrian passageway cut between two of the charter schools. In an effort to diminish the monumentality of a building that houses two schools, part of it will be clad in white metal panels, part in brick. And the few existing buildings worth preserving, including an old red-brick factory and a two-story stucco building that houses Je's Restaurant, a local landmark, will be restored.
 The design incorporates some of the sensibilities that can be found in Mr. Meier's higher-end projects. The apartment buildings include small, open courtyards and outdoor terraces, bringing light deep into their interiors. In each building a ground-floor retail level is conceived as a glass band, imbuing the floors above with an air of weightlessness. This effect is reinforced by the irregular pattern of the apartment windows, which gives the facades a cubist feeling. 
 Mr. Meier has already completed a preliminary design for a second phase of development, with 15 additional apartment buildings that Mr. Beit said could go into construction as early as 2011. It would extend the project several blocks to the north and west, giving it the kind of critical mass that could begin to turn the area around. 
 If the project succeeds in revitalizing Newark's bleak downtown -- or even if it simply manages not to be swallowed up by the decay around it -- its most important impact may be to help open eyes again to architecture's potential role in addressing complex urban challenges.
 Mr. Meier, as much as anyone, is aware of how tenuous that role can be. Recently, I drove out to the Newark site with him, and we took a short detour to the Bronx, to visit Twin Parks. The complex, once so open to the neighborhood around it, is now walled off behind chain-link fencing, giving it the air of a minimum-security prison. A steel gate, flanked by a security booth, blocks off a street that used to run through it. In an attempt to make the place feel more homey, someone has decorated the entry to the manager's office with a white picket fence.
 When we left, Mr. Meier was uncharacteristically silent. ''You always hope what you build has arms, that they reach out and affect others,'' he finally said, with obvious pain in his voice. ''You want to feel you've done something that allows other positive things to happen.''

HEADLINE: Bad. But an Apocalypse?

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and TOM ZELLER Jr.; Leslie Kaufman contributed reporting from New Orleans.

 BODY:
EDITORS' NOTE APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is bad -- no one would dispute it. But just how bad?
 Some experts have been quick to predict apocalypse, painting grim pictures of 1,000 miles of irreplaceable wetlands and beaches at risk, fisheries damaged for seasons, fragile species wiped out and a region and an industry economically crippled for years.
 President Obama has called the spill ''a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.'' And some scientists have suggested that the oil might hitch a ride on the loop current in the gulf, bringing havoc to the Atlantic Coast.
 Yet the Deepwater Horizon blowout is not unprecedented, nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history. And its ultimate impact will depend on a long list of interlinked variables, including the weather, ocean currents, the properties of the oil involved and the success or failure of the frantic efforts to stanch the flow and remediate its effects. 
 As one expert put it, this is the first inning of a nine-inning game. No one knows the final score.
 The ruptured well, currently pouring an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil a day into the gulf, could flow for years and still not begin to approach the 36 billion gallons of oil spilled by retreating Iraqi forces when they left Kuwait in 1991. It is not yet close to the magnitude of the Ixtoc I blowout in the Bay of Campeche in Mexico in 1979, which spilled an estimated 140 million gallons of crude before the gusher could be stopped.
 And it will have to get much worse before it approaches the impact of the Exxon Valdez accident of 1989, which contaminated 1,300 miles of largely untouched shoreline and killed tens of thousands of seabirds, otters and seals along with 250 eagles and 22 killer whales.
 No one, not even the oil industry's most fervent apologists, is making light of this accident. The contaminated area of the gulf continues to spread, and oil has been found in some of the fragile marshes at the tip of Louisiana. The beaches and coral reefs of the Florida Keys could be hit if the slick is captured by the gulf's clockwise loop current.
 But on Monday, the wind was pushing the slick in the opposite direction, away from the current. The worst effects of the spill have yet to be felt. And if efforts to contain the oil are even partly successful and the weather cooperates, the worst could be avoided.
 ''Right now what people are fearing has not materialized,'' said Edward B. Overton, professor emeritus of environmental science at Louisiana State University and an expert on oil spills. ''People have the idea of an Exxon Valdez, with a gunky, smelly black tide looming over the horizon waiting to wash ashore. I do not anticipate this will happen down here unless things get a lot worse.''
 Dr. Overton said he was hopeful that efforts by BP to place containment structures over the leaking parts of the well will succeed, although he said it was a difficult task that could actually make things worse by damaging undersea pipes.
 Other experts said that while the potential for catastrophe remained, there were reasons to remain guardedly optimistic.
 ''The sky is not falling,'' said Quenton R. Dokken, a marine biologist and the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation, a conservation group in Corpus Christi, Tex. ''We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.''
 Engineers said the type of oil pouring out is lighter than the heavy crude spilled by the Exxon Valdez, evaporates more quickly and is easier to burn. It also appears to respond to the use of dispersants, which break up globs of oil and help them sink. The oil is still capable of significant damage, particularly when it is churned up with water and forms a sort of mousse that floats and can travel long distances.
 Jacqueline Savitz, a senior scientist at Oceana, a nonprofit environmental group, said that much of the damage was already taking place far offshore and out of sight of surveillance aircraft and research vessels.
 ''Some people are saying, It hasn't gotten to shore yet so it's all good,'' she said. ''But a lot of animals live in the ocean, and a spill like this becomes bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water. You have endangered sea turtles, the larvae of bluefin tuna, shrimp and crabs and oysters, grouper. A lot of these are already being affected and have been for 10 days. We're waiting to see how bad it is at the shore, but we may never fully understand the full impacts on ocean life.''
 The economic impact is as uncertain as the environmental damage. With several million gallons of medium crude in the water already, some experts are predicting wide economic harm. Experts at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies in Corpus Christi, for example, estimated that as much as $1.6 billion of annual economic activity and services -- including effects on tourism, fishing and even less tangible services like the storm protection provided by wetlands -- could be at risk.
 ''And that's really only the tip of the iceberg,'' said David Yoskowitz, who holds the endowed chair for socioeconomics at the institute. ''It's still early in the game, and there's a lot of potential downstream impacts, a lot of multiplier impacts.''
 But much of this damage could be avoided if the various tactics employed by BP and government technicians pay off in the coming days. The winds are dying down and the seas are calming, allowing for renewed skimming operations and possible new controlled burns of oil on the surface. BP technicians are trying to inject dispersants deep below the surface, which could reduce the impact on aquatic life. Winds and currents could move the globs of emulsified oil away from coastal shellfish breeding grounds.
 The gulf is not a pristine environment and has survived both chronic and acute pollution problems before. Thousands of gallons of oil flow into the gulf from natural undersea well seeps every day, engineers say, and the scores of refineries and chemical plants that line the shore from Mexico to Mississippi pour untold volumes of pollutants into the water.
 After the Ixtoc spill 31 years ago, the second-largest oil release in history, the gulf rebounded. Within three years, there was little visible trace of the spill off the Mexican coast, which was compounded by a tanker accident in the gulf a few months later that released 2.6 million additional gallons, experts said.
 ''The gulf is tremendously resilient,'' said Dr. Dokken, the marine biologist. ''But we've always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back. As a scientist, I have to say I just don't know.''
Editors' Note: May 5, 2010, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A front-page news analysis article on Tuesday discussed the uncertainty over the ultimate environmental impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. One expert quoted was Quenton R. Dokken, a marine biologist who is the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation. (He said the spill ''isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico,'' but also said that ''we've always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back.'') 
 The article described the Gulf of Mexico Foundation simply as a conservation group. It should have included more information about the organization, a nonprofit group that says its mission is ''to promote and facilitate conservation of the health and productivity of the Gulf of Mexico and its resources'' through research and other programs. While the group says the majority of its funding comes from federal and state grants, it also receives some money from the oil industry and other business interests in the gulf, and includes industry executives on its board.

HEADLINE: Trying to Move Up From a Fast-Talking, Buy-Now Approach

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE is a one-way street, but figuratively it goes two ways: for almost every trend in advertising, it seems, there is often a countertrend.
 For instance, as some marketers sign celebrities to endorse products, others prefer ''real'' people for their ads. Jingles are making a comeback in some commercials, but others use original music or popular songs.
 And as mainstream marketers like Philips and Procter & Gamble experiment with the tactics of direct-response advertising, a major marketer specializing in direct response and infomercials, the Guthy-Renker Corporation, is experimenting with the tactics of traditional advertising. 
 Guthy-Renker is testing a campaign for Proactiv, its popular line of acne products, that is far more like a campaign for a mainstream brand. It's in sharp contrast to its roots in fast-talking, hard-selling direct-response television like the Guthy-Renker spots for Malibu Pilates or ''The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts'' DVDs. 
 ''This is scary territory for direct-response marketers,'' said Greg Renker, co-chairman of Guthy-Renker in Santa Monica, Calif.
 The Proactiv campaign, which got under way last week, is being created with the help of an advertising agency, named Eleven, which is based in San Francisco. The campaign includes television commercials, magazine ads, billboards, signs and online ads, and they all resemble pitches for blue-chip brands in the skin care category. 
 That is, of course, a reason for the experiment: as Proactiv grows, it increasingly competes against such brands, sold by conventional marketers like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. Ads for those products get high visibility because they run during prime-time programs on broadcast networks and in top-tier magazines.
 By contrast, the direct-response ads that Guthy-Renker uses to peddle Proactiv are deemed not ready for prime time or the print limelight because of their frantic pace or cluttered look; they typically appear on cable or in less classy publications.
 ''We may have been in the back of Seventeen'' magazine, Mr. Renker said, with the direct-response ads for Proactiv. But the new campaign is being accepted by magazines like Elle, InStyle and People, he added, and will also run in better positions in Seventeen.
 On television, the commercials from the new campaign will be shown during network series like ''American Idol,'' ''Glee,'' ''90210,'' ''One Tree Hill'' and ''The View.''
 ''We're going to get the message in front of a whole new set of eyeballs,'' said Lenny Lieberman, chief executive of Lieberman Productions in San Francisco, a unit of Guthy-Renker that creates television commercials for the company.
 Another reason for the test was that the direct-response approach for Proactiv ''was getting fatigued,'' according to Mr. Renker, as consumers displayed ''a recession mentality for the last 18 months.''
 The cutbacks in discretionary spending affected demand for Proactiv and products like it, Mr. Renker said, and ''we found ourselves fighting on price'' too often to try wooing reluctant buyers.
 By comparison, the new campaign takes an image approach, and most of the ads do not even mention what Proactiv costs. ''We fight on quality,'' as Mr. Renker put it.
 The campaign introduces an upbeat theme, ''Be Proactiv,'' which is voiced by youthful female celebrities like Mandy Moore, Avril Lavigne, Katy Perry, Jenna Fischer and Julianne Hough. 
 Guthy-Renker, which introduced Proactiv 15 years ago, spends $110 million to $120 million a year on advertising. For the test, Mr. Renker said, 10 to 15 percent of the budget will be shifted to the new campaign for the calendar quarter. The rest of the money will be spent on the usual direct-response ads.
 In the usual commercials, an announcer is heard continuously, proclaiming, ''Order now'' and ''Call now,'' and enticing viewers with offers like ''a free upgrade to premium shipping'' if orders are placed ''in the next three minutes.''
 In the new commercials, the announcer is heard sparingly -- and in one spot, he is not heard at all. The celebrities do most if not all the talking, describing how Proactiv helps treat and prevent acne.
 The magazine ads present oversize, close-up photos of the celebrities. In one, Ms. Perry declares: ''I'm not polite. I'm Proactiv.'' In another ad, Ms. Lavigne asserts: ''I'm no pushover. I'm Proactiv.''
 The ''Be Proactiv'' campaign was one of several proposed to the Guthy-Renker executives, said Rob Price, executive creative director at Eleven, and all of them were squarely in the realm of brand image rather than direct response.
 ''Some of the things that would feel more egregious'' like constant repetition, limited-time offers or a cluttered look ''were never considered,'' Mr. Price said, adding, ''They did absolutely the right thing'' in striving for a mainstream style.
 ''They were so ready to step out and reach different customers in different ways in different channels,'' Mr. Price said, ''and the brand was ready for it.''
 ''I'm holding my breath and hoping it goes well,'' he added, referring to the test.
 As for the test orientation of Guthy-Renker, Mr. Lieberman joked that when the company began working with Eleven, Mr. Price was told that ''everything we do is 60-day trial offers.''
 Eleven was responsible for all the elements of the new campaign except the television commercials, which were handled by Lieberman Productions.
 The print ads will also run, Mr. Price said, in magazines like Allure, Glamour, Self and Vogue. The online ads are to appear on Web sites like aol.com, mtv.com and usmagazine.com, he added.
 The posters and signs are going up in a dozen large markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Washington.
 The experiment with traditional ads will be evaluated, Mr. Renker said, on criteria like brand recognition and awareness as well as on sales through the Proactiv Web site (proactiv.com), toll-free telephone numbers and retail kiosks.

HEADLINE: The Limits of Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Roughly a century ago, many Swedes immigrated to America. They've done very well here. Only about 6.7 percent of Swedish-Americans live in poverty. Also a century ago, many Swedes decided to remain in Sweden. They've done well there, too. When two economists calculated Swedish poverty rates according to the American standard, they found that 6.7 percent of the Swedes in Sweden were living in poverty.
 In other words, you had two groups with similar historical backgrounds living in entirely different political systems, and the poverty outcomes were the same. 
 A similar pattern applies to health care. In 1950, Swedes lived an average of 2.6 years longer than Americans. Over the next half-century, Sweden and the U.S. diverged politically. Sweden built a large welfare state with a national health service, while the U.S. did not. The result? There was basically no change in the life expectancy gap. Swedes now live 2.7 years longer.
 Again, huge policy differences. Not huge outcome differences.
 This is not to say that policy choices are meaningless. But we should be realistic about them. The influence of politics and policy is usually swamped by the influence of culture, ethnicity, psychology and a dozen other factors.
 You can observe the same phenomenon when looking within the U.S. Last week, the American Human Development Project came out with its ''A Century Apart'' survey of life in the United States. As you'd expect, ethnicity correlates to huge differences in how people live. Nationally, 50 percent of Asian-American adults have a college degree, compared with 31 percent of whites, 17 percent of African-Americans and 13 percent of Hispanics.
 Asian-Americans have a life expectancy of 87 years compared with 79 years for whites and 73 years for African-Americans.
 Even in struggling parts of the country, Asian-Americans do well. In Michigan, for example, the Asian-American life expectancy is 90, while for the average white person it's 79 and for the average African-American it's 73. Income and education levels are also much higher.
 The region you live in also makes a gigantic difference in how you will live. There are certain high-trust regions where highly educated people congregate, producing positive feedback loops of good culture and good human capital programs. This mostly happens in the northeastern states like New Jersey and Connecticut. There are other regions with low social trust, low education levels and negative feedback loops. This mostly happens in southern states like Arkansas and West Virginia.
 If you combine the influence of ethnicity and region, you get astounding lifestyle gaps. The average Asian-American in New Jersey lives an amazing 26 years longer and is 11 times more likely to have a graduate degree than the average American Indian in South Dakota.
 When you try to account for life outcome differences this gigantic, you find yourself beyond narrow economic incentives and in the murky world of social capital. What matters are historical experiences, cultural attitudes, child-rearing practices, family formation patterns, expectations about the future, work ethics and the quality of social bonds.
 Researchers have tried to disaggregate the influence of these soft factors and have found it nearly impossible. All we can say for sure is that different psychological, cultural and social factors combine in myriad ways to produce different viewpoints. As a result of these different viewpoints, the average behavior is different between different ethnic and geographic groups, leading to different life outcomes.
 It is very hard for policy makers to use money to directly alter these viewpoints. In her book, ''What Money Can't Buy,'' Susan E. Mayer of the University of Chicago calculated what would happen if you could double the income of the poorest Americans. The results would be disappointingly small. Doubling parental income would barely reduce dropout rates of the children. It would have a small effect on reducing teen pregnancy. It would barely improve child outcomes overall.
 So when we're arguing about politics, we should be aware of how policy fits into the larger scheme of cultural and social influences. Bad policy can decimate the social fabric, but good policy can only modestly improve it. 
 Therefore, the first rule of policy-making should be, don't promulgate a policy that will destroy social bonds. If you take tribes of people, exile them from their homelands and ship them to strange, arid lands, you're going to produce bad outcomes for generations. Second, try to establish basic security. If the government can establish a basic level of economic and physical security, people may create a culture of achievement -- if you're lucky. Third, try to use policy to strengthen relationships. The best policies, like good preschool and military service, fortify emotional bonds.
 Finally, we should all probably calm down about politics. Most of the proposals we argue about so ferociously will have only marginal effects on how we live, especially compared with the ethnic, regional and social differences that we so studiously ignore.

HEADLINE: Teaching Physicians The Price Of Care

BYLINE: By SUSAN OKIE; This article was produced in collaboration with Kaiser Health News -- an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research organization not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

 BODY:
When Dr. Ryan Thompson, an internist, was a medical resident at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston a few years ago, he worried that he and his fellow trainees weren't learning about the cost of medical treatments, the financing of health care and the impact of high medical bills on their patients.
 So, with the help of faculty members at Harvard Medical School and another resident, Dr. Thompson organized an elective course for residents on the topic. In one session, ''I made up a kind of 'Price Is Right' game,'' he recalled. ''I got the bill of a patient and actually went through it,'' asking colleagues to guess the cost of commonly ordered tests, like CT scans. Their answers ''were all over the map,'' he said. ''They had no idea.''
 Doctors in training have traditionally been insulated from information about the cost of the tests and treatments they order for patients -- in fact, for decades, the subject was virtually taboo when professors and trainees discussed treatment decisions during hospital rounds. During four years of medical school, students learn to order tests and treatments based on their knowledge of diseases and of scientific evidence. 
 Until recently, most schools included little information on financial factors, like how the insurance system works and how treatment costs affect patients' behavior. As a result, most physicians enter practice with little sense of how to make the most cost-effective choices for patients, or how their own decisions affect the patient's -- and the nation's -- medical bills.
 ''Medical schools have done a really terrible job over the years in educating students about the system that they're going to encounter,'' said Dr. Michael Whitcomb, former senior vice president for medical education at the American Association of Medical Colleges, or A.A.M.C., and former editor of the journal Academic Medicine.
 But escalating costs and the national debate over the health care overhaul are forcing medical schools and residency programs to grapple with teaching about the financial side of their profession. Accrediting organizations now require such teaching, and students and residents recognize that they need to understand finances as well as blood tests. 
 ''It's a very odd system where we make purchasing decisions on behalf of patients but we don't know what anything costs,'' said Dr. Neel Shah, a first-year resident in obstetrics-gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ''There's no disincentive to ordering tests -- all we have to do is click a button and we've ordered it.''
 To be accredited, medical schools and hospital residency programs, in which doctors spend three to five years learning a specialty, are supposed to be teaching future doctors about health care costs and cost-effective practices. The A.A.M.C., which does the accreditation of medical schools, made this clear in a 1998 report. And since 2007, residency programs in the United States have been required to teach doctors to ''incorporate considerations of cost awareness and risk-benefit analysis'' in caring for patients, according to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.
 A commentary in the April 8 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Molly Cooke, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and director of the school's Academy of Medical Educators, said it was ''a critical responsibility of medical schools and residency programs'' to educate physicians about cost issues. 
 ''Medical schools and residencies, in general, are taking this very seriously,'' said Dr. John Prescott, a physician and the medical college association's chief academic officer. 
 Nonetheless, the effort has not been universal. According to a recent A.A.M.C. survey, about 60 percent of 102 American and Canadian medical schools include some material on health care costs, although the time they devote to it varies widely. 
 Dr. Prescott said a separate survey of 155 large teaching hospitals that together sponsor more than two-thirds of accredited residency programs in the United States found that only 41 percent had made sure that all their residencies included material on health care costs. 
 Dr. Whitcomb, the former A.A.M.C. vice president, said one reason medical schools and residencies have been slow to tackle the subject is that most of their faculty members are academic doctors or researchers who know little about health care economics and don't feel comfortable teaching it. ''Trying to figure out how to do it and who's going to do it is a real challenge,'' he said.
 Some medical schools have met the challenge by creating courses for first- or second-year students on health policy or professional responsibility that include information about treatment costs and insurance. 
 A second-year student at the Yale School of Medicine, Alexandra Ristow, said, ''We discussed the fact that we have all this technology now that we can't necessarily afford to provide to every single patient -- and it's not necessary, either.'' She added that, in other classes, cost considerations are part of the discussion of how to treat hypothetical patients.
 Professors ask: ''What is this test going to tell you? Is it going to change the diagnosis, or change how you manage the patient's care?'' Ms. Ristow said. Concerns about treatment costs, she said, are ''just very pervasive.'' 
 But once students begin working on medical teams in hospitals, during their third year of medical school, they must focus on developing clinical skills and learning to care for patients -- and, according to students at several schools, the financial aspects of care are seldom discussed. 
 ''We all know that the cost of health care is high, but it's sort of fuzzy how doctors play into this,'' said Chitra Akileswaran, who has completed three years at Harvard Medical School and is enrolled in a joint degree program in medicine and business administration.
 At the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, students can get hands-on lessons about the impact of treatment costs on patients by volunteering Saturdays at the East Harlem Health Outreach Program, a student-run free clinic for uninsured residents of a low-income neighborhood nearby. 
 Medical students evaluate patients, choose which drugs are prescribed, arrange care for patients who need to see a surgeon or other specialist and collaborate with a social worker to help those who need social services or assistance paying for medicine. They also sit on the steering committee and are in charge of researching and updating the clinic's formulary, a stock of inexpensive, cost-effective drugs that are purchased from the hospital pharmacy. 
 Dr. Yasmin S. Meah, an assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai who directs the program, noted that medical students initially campaigned to establish the clinic, similar to others at several New York medical schools and an estimated 110 nationwide, as a service to the community. Since opening in 2004, it has become an invaluable setting for teaching future doctors to practice cost-effectively. Students come to ''understand what is necessary and what is not,'' Dr. Meah said. ''They're using the cheapest drugs to get the biggest bang for the buck.'' 
 During residency, trainees' heavy workloads and the need to care efficiently for very sick people make it hard for them to consider the cost of tests and treatments. ''You definitely try to think about it,'' said Dr. Ian Warrington, a first-year resident in emergency medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. ''All of us are aware that a CT scan is significantly more expensive than a chest X-ray, and an M.R.I. is significantly more than a CT scan.'' 
 Emergency-medicine residents memorize guidelines that help them determine when imaging studies are needed after certain kinds of injuries, and professors routinely ask trainees to defend their rationale for ordering certain tests. But sometimes, Dr. Warrington said, residents and the doctors supervising them will end up ordering an expensive test even when the probability of finding a fracture or a hemorrhage is low because they are worried about missing something serious, and about being sued if they do. 
 ''You're sort of working on not enough time and not always enough information, and you do the best you can,'' he said. Cost ''should be factored in, but realistically, with the environment that we practice in, you have to be very cautious how you do that.''

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Serious Concern Among Americans About Immigration

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Randal C. Archibold reported from Los Angeles, and Megan Thee-Brennan from New York. Marina Stefan contributed reporting from New York

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The overwhelming majority of Americans think the country's immigration policies need to be seriously overhauled. And despite protests against Arizona's stringent new immigration enforcement law, a majority of Americans support it, even though they say it may lead to racial profiling.
 These are the findings of the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 With the signing of the Arizona law on April 23 and reports of renewed efforts in Washington to rethink immigration, there has been an uptick in the number of Americans who describe illegal immigration as a serious problem.
 But the poll -- conducted April 28 through May 2 with 1,079 adults, and with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points -- suggests that Americans remain deeply divided about what to do.
 The public broadly agrees, across party lines, that the United States could be doing more along its border to keep illegal immigrants out. The view was shared by 78 percent of the respondents.
 That unity, however, fractures on the question of what to do with illegal immigrants who are already here and the role of states in enforcing immigration law, normally a federal responsibility.
 A majority of the people polled, 57 percent, said the federal government should determine the laws addressing illegal immigration. But 51 percent said the Arizona law was ''about right'' in its approach to the problem. Thirty-six percent said it went too far and 9 percent said it did not go far enough.
 The law has recharged the national debate over securing the border and what to do about the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants already in the country.
 The Arizona law gives local police officers broad power to detain people they suspect are in the country illegally and check their legal status. Lawsuits have already been filed on several grounds, including the argument that it will lead to the racial profiling of legal residents and that the state has unconstitutionally intruded on federal authority.
 Under a torrent of criticism, the Arizona Legislature and Gov. Jan Brewer made changes to the law on Friday that they say explicitly ban the police from racial profiling and allow officers to inquire about immigration status only of people they stop, detain or arrest in enforcing existing state law. But the new immigration law also now includes civil violations of municipal codes as grounds to check papers, and opponents were not mollified by the changes.
 In follow-up interviews, poll respondents who embraced the thrust of the Arizona law still called for a national solution.
 ''The Arizona law is fine, but the federal government has to step in and come up with something -- and they're not doing it,'' said Pat Turkos, 64, a library worker and Republican from Baltimore.
 She said: ''I don't think they should be stopped just walking down the street, only if they're stopped for speeding, for example. I believe everybody has the right to come here, but I think they have to be made legal citizens.''
 Although the respondents broadly agreed that the Arizona law would result in racial profiling, overburden local and state law enforcement agencies and decrease the willingness of illegal immigrants to report crimes for fear of deportation, large majorities said it would reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the state, deter illegal border crossings and, to a lesser extent, reduce crime.
 Some attitudes about immigration have remained stable among the public. Most still say illegal immigrants weaken the nation's economy rather than strengthen it, and public opinion remains divided over how the United States should handle illegal immigrants currently in the country.
 But American attitudes toward the law and whether illegal immigrants already here should have a path to citizenship differed markedly across regions and parties. Westerners and Northeasterners, for example, are significantly more likely than those in other regions to say the recent law in Arizona goes too far. And Democrats are much more likely than Republicans or independents to support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants now in the country. 
 Just 8 percent of Americans said the immigration system needed only minor changes. The vast majority said it needed reworking, including 44 percent who said it needed to be completely rebuilt and 45 percent who said it needed fundamental changes.
 Three quarters said that, over all, illegal immigrants were a drain on the economy because they did not all pay taxes but used public services like hospitals and schools. Nearly 2 in 10 said the immigrants strengthened the economy by providing low-cost labor and buying goods and services, a chief argument among many of their advocates. 
 ''I do think the federal government should deal with it, because illegal immigrants don't pay taxes and don't contribute to our government,'' said Deborah Adams, 53, a Democrat from Ephrata, Pa., and a paramedic who called the Arizona law a ''necessary evil.''
 ''They take jobs from American citizens who need to work and pay into Social Security,'' Ms. Adams said.
 In fact, many illegal immigrants do pay taxes into the Social Security system, but never see a return on their contributions.
 At immigration rallies in several cities on Saturday, demonstrators pressed the case for overhauling immigration law.
 So far no bill has been introduced in Congress. President Obama, while supportive of the idea of immigration reform, has questioned whether lawmakers have the appetite for a divisive battle over it after a year of other political fights and in the middle of a campaign.
 A delegation of Arizonans opposed to the law, including Mayor Phil Gordon of Phoenix, plans to meet with Justice Department officials on Tuesday to urge them to step into the brewing legal battle over the law.
 On Monday, one of the law's staunchest advocates, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County in the Phoenix area, announced that after toying with the idea, he would not run for governor.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Goldman In Omaha

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
Omaha
 Why is Warren Buffett sticking his neck out so far in defense of Goldman Sachs?
 That was the question so many Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, some in disbelief, kept asking here over the weekend, after Mr. Buffett offered his full-throated support of Goldman and its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, as they fight a civil fraud suit brought by regulators.
 Yet by the end of Berkshire's annual meeting, at least some of the 40,000 shareholders in attendance who had been skeptical of Goldman had come to the same conclusion: Mr. Buffett may actually be right.
 ''I don't have a problem with the Abacus transaction at all, and I think I understand it better than most,'' Mr. Buffett declared with nonchalance late Sunday afternoon, referring to the mortgage derivatives deal at the center of the lawsuit. He had just finished playing Ping-Pong with Ariel Hsing, a top-ranked 14-year-old junior table tennis player. (He lost 2 to 1.) 
 His comments echoed the strong view he had offered just the day before: ''For the life of me, I don't see whether it makes any difference whether it was John Paulson on the other side of the deal, or whether it was Goldman Sachs on the other side of the deal, or whether it was Berkshire Hathaway on the other side of the deal,'' Mr. Buffett said. 
 Have we all been thinking about this the wrong way? 
 Mr. Buffett's view -- conventional, perhaps, on Wall Street but contrarian on that mythical place called Main Street that Mr. Buffett usually occupies -- is worth considering for at least one reason: No one else of prominence has spoken out so publicly in support of Goldman. In his trademark way, he made a plain-spoken case that makes sense.
 Cynics might regard Mr. Buffett's statements as predictably self-serving. After all, his company owns about $5 billion in preferred stock in Goldman. What's more, ever since he made a big investment in Goldman during the thick of the financial crisis, his priceless reputation has been hitched to the firm.
 But remember that he has been a consistent and unapologetic critic of Wall Street, especially in the wake of the financial crisis. And besides, his stake in Goldman is more a loan than an investment, so he'll no doubt be paid no matter what happens with the Abacus suit.
 But on the facts of the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud case against Goldman, Mr. Buffett -- he was questioned on this topic over the weekend by shareholders and a panel of three journalists, including me -- was resolute. (He did not directly address reports that the Justice Department was conducting a criminal inquiry into Goldman's mortgage deals, but his positive view of the firm is obvious.)
 To him, investors should make their investment decisions based on the quality of the securities, not on who helped put them together or who else was betting for or against them. He suggested those factors were irrelevant.
 ''I don't care if John Paulson is shorting these bonds. I'm going to have no worries that he has superior knowledge,'' he said, adding: ''It's our job to assess the credit.'' The assets are the assets. The math either works or it doesn't.
 In its suit, the S.E.C. has accused Goldman of not disclosing that the Abacus instrument was devised in part by a short-seller, John Paulson, who stood to gain by betting against it. 
 IKB, one of the buyers, and ACA, which acted as the selection agent and insured the transaction, said they didn't know Mr. Paulson was on the other side of the deal and had influenced which mortgages were chosen. Together, IKB and ACA lost nearly $1 billion in the deal.
 Mr. Buffett, who has always approached investing as a dispassionate exercise based on his reading of the numbers, said IKB and ACA had all the relevant facts that any investor would need. They were able to see all the mortgages, which were referenced in full, and yet they made what turned out to be a very bad bet. 
 ''It's a little hard for me to get terribly sympathetic,'' he said. When he makes his investments for Berkshire, he said, ''we are in the business of making our own decisions. They do not owe us a divulgence of their position.''
 On Sunday, Mr. Buffett said that the case against Goldman seemed to be based only on hindsight. 
 ''It's very strange to say, at the end of the transaction, that if the other guy is smarter than you, that you have been defrauded,'' he said. ''It seems to me that that's what they are saying.''
 Indeed, many securities lawyers have said from the start that the case against Goldman might be hard for the S.E.C. to win, for many of the reasons spelled out by Mr. Buffett in his defense of Goldman. 
 One Berkshire shareholder who has been a regular in Omaha is Bill Ackman, an outspoken hedge fund manager who has made a career of railing against bad corporate practices. He spent years, for example, trying to get people to pay attention to the failures of the rating agencies before the crisis became full-blown. 
 In recent days, he has gone even further than Mr. Buffett in his defense of Goldman, suggesting it would have been unethical for the firm to disclose Mr. Paulson's position in the Abacus deal. He says that Goldman, as the market maker, had a duty to protect the identity of both sides of the transaction. 
 He agrees with Mr. Buffett that as an investor, he would not have considered it necessary to know that Mr. Paulson had helped select the securities.
 If that is really the case, it makes you question all of the outrage being directed at Goldman over this transaction. ''The country wants to hang somebody,'' one Berkshire board member told me. 
 With so many easy targets of the financial crisis -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, A.I.G., Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers -- it does seem odd that the government, and the public, has chosen to vilify one of only a couple of firms that made fewer mistakes than the rest.
 Still, the chorus of Goldman opponents has become so loud that, predictably, some people have called for Mr. Blankfein's head.
 On that subject, Charles Munger, Mr. Buffett's vocal sidekick and vice chairman, put it bluntly: ''There are plenty of C.E.O.'s I'd like to see gone in America. Lloyd Blankfein isn't one of them.''

HEADLINE: Iran Angrily Defends Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The United States and Iran used the United NationsGeneral Assembly's famous green marble podium on Monday to trade punches over the Islamic republic's nuclear program, adding sudden drama to the normally staid opening of the international conference to review the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the only head of state attending a meeting usually left to foreign ministers, defiantly sought to rebuff accusations that Iran was a nuclear outlaw by going on the offensive against the United States. 
 The United States, represented by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, accused Iran of trying to create a smokescreen to hide its own violations and said Tehran should not be allowed to try to undermine a broad international consensus to strengthen the 40-year-old treaty. 
 The treaty is viewed as successful over all in dissuading countries from developing nuclear weapons, but is seen as under threat as more nations express an interest in starting nuclear programs. 
 The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said that expanding interest as well as new problems like possible nuclear terrorism made the treaty more important than ever. ''The nuclear threat remains real,'' Mr. Ban said. ''It has evolved in new and varied forms.''
 In his speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad said that all nuclear powers tried to intimidate countries that had no nuclear weapons, but he called the United States the ''main suspect'' in fostering a nuclear arms race. It has engendered worldwide hatred for being the first and only state to use a nuclear bomb, he said 
 As Mr. Ahmadinejad spoke, members of delegations from a number of countries, including the United States and many European Union members, walked out of the General Assembly. The hall was about one-third full during his 35-minute address. 
 The Iranian president said the United States and its allies had failed to provide a ''single credible proof'' of allegations that Tehran was hiding an attempt to develop a nuclear bomb of its own,. The Islamic republic had already accepted a compromise deal over enriching uranium for a research reactor, he said. 
 In opening the conference, Mr. Ban urged Iran to prove that its nuclear program was solely for peaceful purposes and to accept a compromise deal offered to Tehran last fall. Iran is facing a fourth round of Security Council sanctions that are being negotiated separately. 
 Under the terms of last fall's deal, Iran would send 1,200 kilograms, or more than 2,600 pounds, of enriched uranium to Russia and then to France for refinement into fuel rods for its research reactor in Tehran, which is used for medical purposes.
 Though it would not resolve the issue of a suspected military program, the deal was seen as a confidence-building measure.
 Western nations negotiating with Iran say that it has demanded, at different times, that the refinement take place on Iranian soil, or that the uranium be refined in smaller increments. Their interest in the deal is waning as Iran enriches increasing amounts of uranium. Its supply is now thought to be more than 2,100 kilograms, or about 4,600 pounds, enough for two bombs. 
 Mrs. Clinton noted that Tehran had never signaled to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it was ready to accept any proposal involving its research reactor. ''Iran has a history of making confusing, contradictory and inaccurate statements designed to convey the impression that it has adopted a flexible attitude toward the proposal,'' she told a news conference. 
 In her speech, Mrs. Clinton accused Iran of jeopardizing the nonproliferation treaty by defying repeated calls from the Security Council and the atomic energy agency to be more transparent about its program. ''That is why it is facing increasing isolation and pressure from the international community,'' she said. 
 Canada's foreign minister, Lawrence Cannon, dismissed Mr. Ahmadinejad's speech as a ''publicity stunt.'' He and other foreign ministers stressed that they did not want the issue of Iran to hijack the conference. 
 Mr. Ban emphasized a few central issues that he said should be the focus of conference negotiations expected to last until the end of May: more nuclear weapons cuts, greater openness in national nuclear programs, an effort to get the three nations outside the treaty -- India, Pakistan and Israel -- to sign it, and the establishment of a zone in the Middle East free of nuclear weapons.
 Mrs. Clinton said the United States wanted to strengthen the measures facing any country that tries to withdraw from the treaty, as North Korea did in 2003. The country has since declare that it carried out two nuclear tests. 
 The conference should consider automatic penalties for violating agreements on safeguards, Mrs. Clinton said, like suspending international technical cooperation, and using of financial and legal tools ''to disrupt illicit proliferation networks.''
 To bolster President Obama's argument that the United States is fulfilling its obligations to reduce the American arsenal, the Pentagon on Monday declassified statistics showing that the United States now possesses 5,113 nuclear weapons, down 84 percent from its peak of 31,255 in 1967, at the height of the cold war. 
 The statistics' broad outlines have been known, in general terms, for many years. The Pentagon issued gross numbers on Monday, deliberately lumping together deployed weapons, those in storage and ''inactive''' warheads. The figures released for the current stockpile, a senior official said, do not include several thousand retired weapons awaiting complete dismantlement.
 American officials have been playing down prospects for any sweeping change emerging from the conference, suggesting that the greatest expected pressure on Tehran will be if a majority of countries endorse the treaty and there is some condemnation of Iran, even if it is rejected by a few ''outliers'' and does not make it into the final document. 
 Although Israel does not take part in the nonproliferation treaty, its arsenal, estimated at 100 to 200 warheads, has overshadowed the conferences in recent years. Egypt and other non-nuclear nations have refused to endorse stricter inspections and other global measures as long as Israel remains outside the treaty. 
 A compromise worked out in 1995 called for a special conference on creating a nuclear-weapons-free Middle East, but it has never been convened. Egypt is again demanding that gathering. The United States position has been that such a treaty can be worked out only after a comprehensive Middle East peace plan.

HEADLINE: Fed Transcripts Stoke Debate on Rates

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In 2004, the Federal Reserve began a slow and steady march toward higher interest rates, a quarter-point at a time. Many economists have questioned whether the Fed's deliberate approach to tightening monetary policy, from exceptionally low rates in the aftermath of the dot-com bust in 2000, allowed a dangerous housing bubble to develop. 
 On Friday, the Federal Reserve released 917 pages of transcripts of discussions among policy makers in 2004 that may provide new fodder for the debate on the Fed's role in the housing crisis, according to economists who have begun to study the materials. 
 The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has argued forcefully that lax regulation -- in particular, a failure to rein in the growth of exotic mortgages and the accompanying decline in underwriting standards -- was to blame for the bubble, not the Fed's short-term interest rates.
 Transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee's eight meetings in 2004 -- released on Friday under a Fed policy providing for annual release of the transcripts after five years -- have offered support to both camps' claims.
 The transcripts show that in early 2004, officials at the Fed, then led by Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, faced a situation similar to the one they confront today. 
 After the dot-com bust, the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate to an exceptionally low level -- 1 percent by June 2003 -- as the economy muddled through what turned out to be a brief recession. For months, the Fed said that interest rates would remain low for ''a considerable period.'' 
 In January 2004, members of the committee hinted that an interest-rate increase was on the horizon. In May, that hint became a strong signal and in June, the Fed began a series of steady, incremental rate increases -- 17 in total -- that brought the signature fed funds rate to 5.25 percent by June 2006.
 Mr. Bernanke, then a governor of the Fed, argued against dropping the ''considerable period'' language, but his argument did not prevail at first.
 ''A good rule of thumb is to try to look as if you know what you're doing even if you're not entirely sure,'' Mr. Bernanke said at the January meeting, adding that the bond markets were not convinced that economic conditions merited a rate increase. ''I would rather wait until March and the presumption that we will see at least one good payroll number by then,'' he said.
 At the March 2004 meeting, the transcripts show, several Fed officials expressed strong concerns about housing.
 ''A number of folks are expressing growing concern about potential overbuilding and worrisome speculation in the real estate markets, especially in Florida,'' said Jack Guynn, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. 
 ''Entire condo projects and upscale residential lots are being pre-sold before any construction, with buyers freely admitting that they have no intention of occupying the units or building on the land but rather are counting on 'flipping' the properties -- selling them quickly at higher prices.''
 Later in that meeting, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was ill-equipped to try to identify asset bubbles, much less prick them.
 ''The history of using the monetary policy instrument rate for correcting financial imbalances is a very checkered one, to say the least,'' he said. 
 In the June 2004 meeting, Stephen D. Oliner, a Fed researcher, cautioned that housing prices appeared to be out of line. 
 ''I don't want to leave the impression that we think there's a huge housing bubble,'' Mr. Oliner said. ''We believe a lot of the rise in house prices is rooted in fundamentals. But even after you account for the fundamentals, there's a part of the increase that is hard to explain.''
 At that meeting, Mr. Bernanke supported Mr. Greenspan, saying it was best for the Fed to be ''embarking on a program of gradual rate increases but remaining alert and ready to adjust in response to incoming information.''
 By November 2004, with the tightening several months under way, policy makers were still uncertain about how to interpret the run-up in the housing market. 
 Gary H. Stern, then president of the Minneapolis Fed, said that at a meeting the bank sponsored on housing activity, ''there was little overall concern about a bubble in house prices and little anticipation of a major correction in house prices in the near term.'' 
 Henry W. Chappell Jr., an economist at the University of South Carolina, said the transcripts demonstrated uncertainty above all. 
 ''I'm not one to blame too much of what happened with the panic, crisis and recession on monetary policy,'' Mr. Chappell said. ''My feeling is the Fed can't control the price of housing. What it controls, over a long time frame and somewhat indirectly, is the average level of prices in the economy.''

HEADLINE: Air Merger With a Note Of Urgency

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Jeffery A. Smisek has held the top job at Continental Airlines for just five months -- long enough to show he is not going to follow quietly in the steps of his predecessors.
 Already, he has started charging for exit-row seats, eliminated Continental's free food on domestic flights and quickly matched a bag fee increase that Delta Air Lines introduced. He has also criticized as ''inane'' the new federal rule imposing fines for tarmac delays of more than three hours and compared Continental's previous membership in the SkyTeam alliance, where Delta Air Lines was the dominant carrier, as ''a lot like being married to a woman who wants to poison your food.'' 
 If there was any doubt, Mr. Smisek, 55, put it to rest on Monday when he shared the stage of a Midtown Manhattan hotel with Glenn F. Tilton, the chairman of United Airlines, to announce United's purchase of Continental. 
 The announcement capped an expedited courtship with a long history. Continental and United were hours away from merging two years ago, but Continental walked away from that deal after seeing the weak state of United's finances, particularly amid soaring oil prices. 
 The fundamentals are different this time. First, United's fortunes have begun to turn around after deep cost and capacity cuts. And as the economy starts to improve, airlines are eager to position themselves for a rebound in air travel, particularly from lucrative business travelers. 
 So when Mr. Smisek saw reports that United was in talks to merge with US Airways in early April, he said he took just two days to make up his mind. Unwilling to let Continental be marginalized, he called Mr. Tilton and renewed talks with United, nudging US Airways out of the way. 
 Three weeks later, they had a deal. He will be the combined airline's chief executive, and take over the chairman role in two years from Mr. Tilton.
 ''I recognized that United was the best partner for Continental, and I didn't want to marry the ugly girl; I wanted to marry the pretty one,'' Mr. Smisek said. 
 The combination of United and Continental creates a coast-to-coast giant, with 10 national hubs, including a leading presence in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. It also merges United's strong routes to Asia with Continental's extended network in Latin America and Europe. The airline would replace Delta as the world's top carrier. 
 Still, the risks of a tie-up are significant. 
 Since Gordon M. Bethune revived Continental's fortunes in the mid-1990s, the company has thrived on a culture emphasizing customer service and peaceful employee relations. It is a culture Mr. Smisek knows well. He was hired by Mr. Bethune in 1995 as general counsel. 
 Both Mr. Smisek and Mr. Tilton took pains to say that the merger would have ''minimal'' effects on their front-line employees, with reductions in staff mainly from ''retirements, attrition and voluntary programs.'' But they said they expected that positions at the Chicago and Houston offices of the two airlines would be cut. 
 Both men insisted that the deal was a ''merger of equals,'' even though United's shareholders would end up with 55 percent of the combined company, and Continental's with 45 percent. 
 The new board will be equally split between the two companies, and include two employee representatives. 
 Philip Baggaley, an airline analyst with Standard & Poor's, said that Mr. Smisek did not want to let United run away with US Airways. ''He quickly judged that the train was leaving the station,'' said Mr. Baggaley. ''And he was more willing to move aggressively than his predecessors.''
 One potential snag could be opposition from employees. Unlike the Delta-Northwest transaction, where the airlines agreed to a new seniority list for pilots before the merger, there was not enough time to work out a similar list for United and Continental pilots, given the speed of the talks. 
 ''We came together very, very quickly, I think perhaps in an unprecedented abbreviated period of time,'' Mr. Tilton said in the joint interview with Mr. Smisek on Monday. ''Frankly, we were already familiar with each other.''
 Unions representing Continental and United pilots said Monday that they expected a ''fair and equitable'' seniority integration of the two groups, and threatened to oppose the transaction if a new collective bargaining agreement was not reached. 
 ''While there is potential for this transaction to create a truly great airline, there are also risks involved,'' the unions said in a joint statement. 
 The airline also needs to secure regulatory approval. Analysts expect a lengthy and complex review, but Mr. Smisek said he did not anticipate problems since the companies had few overlapping domestic routes and did not compete internationally. Through the Star Alliance, United and Continental already cooperate on foreign routes and have antitrust immunity on trans-Atlantic flights.
 ''From an antitrust perspective, I don't think there is any other airline merger with less concerns,'' Mr. Smisek said in an interview. 
 Mr. Tilton, too, gets what he wanted. Since taking the top position at United Airlines in 2002 after more than three decades in the oil business, Mr. Tilton has been ridiculed by many of his peers, scorned by employees, including flight attendants wearing orange bracelets proclaiming ''Glenn Must Go,'' and was described as ''clueless'' by Mr. Bethune in 2002, who at the time was also lobbying against United's bid for a federal bailout.
 But Mr. Tilton is now close to the goal he set when joining United: return the company to profitability and merge it with another airline. United is not profitable yet. But it reported narrower losses than analysts expected last week and is expected to turn a profit this year. 
 ''The industry and the pundits totally underestimated Glenn,'' said Mo Garfinkle, a veteran airline consultant who is close to Mr. Tilton and United.

HEADLINE: Leaving Early? It'll Cost You

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
The airlines have been doing it. Expect the hotels to follow suit.
 Over the last few years, the airlines have been adding and increasing fees on checked bags, exit row seats and more, much to the benefit of their bottom lines. And for similar reasons, hotels are likely to add more fees and more stringently enforce or even raise existing charges for cutting a stay short, for example, or for storing luggage.
 A new study by Bjorn Hanson, clinical professor at the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, found that while total fees and surcharges collected by hotels in the United States declined to $1.55 billion in last year's faltering economy, they will rise this year. Mr. Hanson said he expected hotel surcharges to climb back up to $1.7 billion this year as a result of an expected rise of 3 to 4 percent in occupied hotel rooms, broader adoption of fees and more aggressive enforcement of and increases in existing fees. 
 The fees and surcharges were initially charged by high-end hotel brands in the late 1990s for access to resort amenities like the swimming pool, putting greens and tennis courts. 
 Imposed generally today on a selective, property-by-property -- rather than chainwide -- basis, fees of $9.95 to $19.95 a day are now charged on Internet access, Mr. Hanson said. He said fees for room service and tray charges range from $2.50 to $5.95 (added to an automatic gratuity), and he estimated minibar restocking fees at $2.95 to $5.95 a day, once the first item is removed. In addition, he said, the fee for cutting short a stay or canceling a reservation without adequate notice is typically the cost of one night's accommodations. For storing your luggage, a hotel might charge $1 a bag or more, he said.
 Fees have ''become more accepted as part of the travel experience,'' Mr. Hanson said. With travel demand starting to rise, he added, ''this gives hotels greater confidence to apply and enforce fees.'' 
 Henry H. Harteveldt, travel analyst for Forrester Research, was not as optimistic as Mr. Hanson about the ability of hotels to collect fees in the near future. 
 ''While business travel is better than it has been, it's still being managed very carefully,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''And business travelers' brand loyalty has declined. They're open to changing hotels if they don't feel they're getting good value.'' 
 He noted the assertion by Gary C. Kelly, the chairman and chief executive of Southwest Airlines, that the carrier had increased its annual market share by $1 billion, mostly by not imposing baggage-checking fees. ''Business travelers don't like fees,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''Southwest has gained market share in part because it's perceived as not ripping customers off.''
 But Michael W. McCormick, executive director of the National Business Travel Association, a trade group for corporate travel managers and suppliers, said that he expected hotel surcharges would climb and proliferate over the next year or so.
 ''Hotels have a modest ability now to increase their average daily rate, but they can increase their bottom line by trying to institute more add-on, ancillary fees,'' he said. ''That seems to be where the travel industry is going.'' 
 Mr. Hanson noted that the fees and surcharges were highly profitable for hotels, as they were for airlines. He estimated the additional revenue from hotel fees and surcharges at typically 80 to 90 percent profit.
 Although all hotel chains contacted about Mr. Hanson's research either had no comment or declined to answer specific questions, executives of travel management companies -- including American Express, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, Hogg Robinson Group, Egencia and Ovation Travel Management -- generally agreed with his forecast of surcharge increases in 2010. All also said some fees, especially those for Internet access and early checkout, could be negotiated by corporate travel buyers with hotel companies.
 Margaret Bowler, the Britain-based director of global hotel relations for Hogg Robinson Group, said she expected this year to be better than last, as more people travel and spend more money. ''Because occupancies will go up, fees will naturally go up -- to what level, I couldn't tell you,'' she said. 
 But she argued that ''there's a big difference between hotels and airlines'' imposing surcharges. ''There's a hotel on every corner, but a limited number of airlines flying a limited number of routes,'' she said. ''If one of the big hotel guys does something, others may follow, but an independent hotel may not. And a corporation might choose the independent hotel because it wants the best price and savings.'' 
 Joseph A. McInerney, chief executive of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a hotel industry trade group, said Mr. Hanson's forecast was ''right on, but he's about six months ahead of himself.'' Mr. McInerney said he ''can see an increase in fees in 2011, when there's less new product coming on.''
 Jan-Philip Velders, an information technology specialist at the University of Amsterdam, said that as a business traveler he was turned off by hotel surcharges. An elite-level participant in the Hilton, Marriott and Starwood loyalty programs, he said he planned to attend a conference in June in Miami. Although the conference will be held at the Intercontinental Miami, he will stay at a Courtyard by Marriott a few blocks away, where the room rate is $50 cheaper a night and Internet access is free.
 ''The value for the dollar is higher at the Courtyard than at the Intercontinental,'' he said.
 One way to avoid Internet access fees is to participate in a loyalty program: Choice, Wyndham and Fairmont hotels offer free access to all participants in their programs, as does Hyatt to all elite participants in its program. Starwood and Hilton offer free access to select elite program members, as will Marriott as of Friday.
 ''There is some value to being a member of a loyalty program,'' said Tim Winship, publisher of FrequentFlier.com. ''But who thought airlines would charge for a seat in the exit row? Maybe there will be surcharges now for rooms according to how far they are from the ice machine or elevators. Creativity will be brought to bear.''

HEADLINE: Obama Renews Syria Sanctions

BYLINE: By AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Agence France-Presse) -- President Obama on Monday renewed sanctions against Syria for a year, accusing Damascus of supporting terrorist groups and pursuing missile programs and weapons of mass destruction. 
 There had been no expectation that Mr. Obama was ready to lift the measures, but the renewal comes at a delicate time in relations between the United States and Syria, despite efforts by the administration to return an ambassador to Damascus.
 The United States also recently expressed concerns after Israel accused Syria of arming Hezbollah with increasingly sophisticated rockets and missiles, which the United States says undermine stability in the region.
 Mr. Obama said in a message to Congress renewing the sanctions, first imposed by President George W. Bush in 2004, that the Syrian government had made ''some progress'' in suppressing the infiltration of foreign fighters into Iraq.
 But he added that Syria's ''continuing support for terrorist organizations and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.''

HEADLINE: In Greek Debt Crisis, a Window to the German Psyche

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD

 BODY:
PARIS -- A few weeks after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and the world plunged into a financial crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany offered some common-sense advice to reckless bankers, indebted consumers and profligate governments.
 ''One should simply have asked a Swabian housewife,'' Mrs. Merkel said during an address to fellow Christian Democrats in December 2008 in the southwest German region of Swabia, hub of the Protestant work ethic. ''She would have told us her worldly wisdom: in the long run, you can't live beyond your means.'' 
 Now, as Europe struggles to avoid its own Lehman experience -- saving Greece and thus the euro -- the episode says much about the Germans.
 Led by France, European neighbors have been pressing for months for Germany, which has the Continent's biggest economy, to throw its financial weight behind a bailout package and a new system of economic governance for the euro zone. In the process, a reluctant Berlin has been called irresponsible, selfish and even un-European.
 But if France wants Germany to be more European, Germany wants Europe to be more Swabian. To bring Europe to a compromise required a deal between Mrs. Merkel and a Frenchman, Dominique Strauss-Kahn of the International Monetary Fund, who met in Berlin last week to pull Greece and the euro zone back from the brink.
 The Greek episode has heated up the long culture clash between the European Union's traditional drivers: federal Germany with its Prussian attachment to rules and an instinctive frugality rooted in past economic traumas, and republican France with its tradition of state intervention and a more Mediterranean attitude toward public debt.
 Paris and Berlin have had many disagreements in the postwar world, but few are as deep-rooted as those on economic governance, said John C. Kornblum, a former United States ambassador to Germany.
 ''This comes from the gut, it's emotional,'' said Mr. Kornblum, who as assistant secretary of state for Europe in the 1990s watched successive French and German leaders spar over how to govern the future single currency.
 If there is no political structure in place to safeguard the euro -- a weakness exposed in the current debt crisis -- Mr. Kornblum said it was because Germany and France could never agree on one. ''There are profound philosophical differences between the two sides,'' he said.
 These differences are in many ways personified by Mrs. Merkel, daughter of a Lutheran pastor, and two flamboyant Frenchmen: President Nicolas Sarkozy, a conservative, and Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist.
 Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Strauss-Kahn are rivals and may even run against each other in the 2012 presidential election. But they share a belief in state intervention that unites most of the French political elite.
 Mr. Sarkozy, a Gaullist whose millionaire friends and taste for expensive brands have not gone unnoticed across the Rhine, first roused German suspicions as finance minister in 2004 when he prevented a takeover by Siemens of Alstom, the French maker of trains.
 As president, he allowed the budget deficit to rise above the 3 percent euro zone limit even before the economic crisis erupted, and he repeatedly criticized the European Central Bank's interest rate policy.
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a native of a suburb of Paris who speaks German, has been called ''Mr. Euro'' in France and is credited with steering his country into the euro zone as finance minister in 1997. In Germany, he is also remembered for serving under President Jacques Chirac, a staunch advocate of a political counterweight to the European Central Bank.
 So when the two men independently revived calls for an ''economic government'' of the 16 countries that share the euro, resistance in Germany was instinctive.
 In a country where many lost their savings twice in the 20th century -- once to hyperinflation in 1923 and again to currency reform after World War II -- central bank independence and budgetary discipline have become part of the German narrative.
 Fear of inflation and broad-based aversion to debt also help to explain a striking divergence in the perception of Germany's wealth at home and abroad. At 3.3 percent of gross domestic product, Germany's budget deficit is low by crisis standards and frequently cited as a justification to appeal to Berlin for solidarity with poorer countries.
 In contrast, the French budget deficit has widened to 7.5 percent of G.D.P. But Germans, who have absorbed East Germany and face a declining population, do not feel rich.
 ''Germans fear going bankrupt themselves,'' said Mr. Kornblum, now a consultant in Berlin.
 Jean-Pierre Jouyet, a former minister of European affairs who now leads the French stock market regulator, said: ''The fundamental difference between France and Germany is that, for the French, budgetary, financial and currency stability is a means to an end. For the Germans it is an end in itself.''
 Mrs. Merkel, a physicist raised in communist East Germany, has a hard-working, parsimonious lifestyle and an analytical, somewhat bland personality that in many ways reflect the national value system, said Gerd Langguth, author of a 2005 biography of her.
 While Mr. Sarkozy resides in the majestic Elysee Palace and has an army of staff members, Mrs. Merkel still lives in the central Berlin apartment she occupied before her election in 2005 and has been seen doing her own shopping.
 There are limits to national stereotyping. Mrs. Merkel's more outgoing predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, made common cause with the French in breaking the euro zone's budgetary limit.
 And no German could have defended the legacy of the Bundesbank more vigorously than the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, referred to by some in Paris as ''that Frenchman in Frankfurt.''
 But understanding the radically different contexts in which German and French positions are honed is crucial as Europe's two foremost powers grapple with the crisis, said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, a research institute based in Brussels.
 ''Ultimately this is about whether Germany is ready to lead,'' he said. ''And leading means compromising, rather than only insisting on red lines.''
Correction: May 7, 2010, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the cultural traits that divide Germany from some of its European neighbors in the Greek debt crisis misidentified the birthplace of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a Frenchman who is managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He was born in Neuilly, a suburb of Paris -- not in Alsace.

HEADLINE: THE NEW LANDSCAPE; Parsing the New Law on Long-Term Care

BYLINE: By PAULA SPAN

 BODY:
Call it Senator Edward M. Kennedy's final bequest. 
 The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or Class Act, the first national plan to help the great majority of Americans who have no insurance for long-term care, became law in March. Even though there was little fanfare -- the measure was just one piece of the broader health care overhaul -- the idea had been hugely important to Mr. Kennedy and his staff, who had been working on the current version of the plan since 2003. 
 The program underwent a number of changes during the health care debate, so some projections are now out of date. And many details have yet to be established by the secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, who is going to be one busy woman for the next couple of years. 
 But we do know enough to answer some basic questions. Four experts helped respond to some of the many queries from readers on the New Old Age blog. They are Howard Bedlin, vice president for advocacy at the National Council on Aging; Barbara Manard, a health economist with the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging; Jesse Slome, executive director of the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance; and Connie Garner, who after 17 years is about to leave her job on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
 WHO'S ELIGIBLE? The simplest answer: Working people. Not those who are already retired (unless they continue to work part time), or nonworking spouses, or the unemployed. Participants must pay premiums for a vesting period of five years before they can receive benefits, and they have to continue working for three of those years. 
 Part-time workers are eligible, though they must earn enough each year to pay Social Security taxes, a threshold that is now about $1,200. The self-employed and anyone whose employer declines to offer Class Act coverage will also be able to sign up through a mechanism yet to be determined. 
 WHAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE AN ILLNESS OR DISABILITY? You can still enroll, as long as you can work for three years and pay premiums for five. The law prohibits excluding people with pre-existing conditions like diabetes.
 WHEN DOES IT START? The act takes effect next Jan. 1, but the health and human services secretary has until October 2012 to present the full rules. Experts expect enrollment to begin in 2013.
 WHAT WILL IT COST? We're all waiting for Ms. Sebelius and a panel to tell us. In November, the Congressional Budget Office assumed an average monthly premium of $123 (less for young enrollees, more for older ones).
 That estimate is based on the assumption that only 5 to 6 percent of those eligible will participate. But that assumption may be conservative: Class is an ''opt out'' program, meaning that if your employer participates, you're automatically included unless you decline. Premiums will be lower if there are more people in the risk pool. 
 WHAT WILL IT PROVIDE? A cash benefit, to be determined by Ms. Sebelius. The Congressional Budget Office assumed a cash benefit of $75 a day, available once a participant needed help with two to three activities of daily living (eating, bathing, dressing, using the toilet, transferring from bed to chair to wheelchair, continence care) or the equivalent amount of assistance required because of cognitive impairment. The law says the average minimum benefit must be at least $50 a day. Once you qualify, those benefits continue as long as you need care. Remember that about 40 percent of the people receiving long-term care are not elderly; they're young people who have accidents or develop chronic illnesses, so a lifetime benefit can mean many years of payments. And yes, those benefits will rise with inflation. 
 Isn't that -- as Laurs2 from Florida commented in the blog -- a ''pitifully inadequate'' amount? 
 The Class Act was never intended to pay the full cost of 24-hour home care or a nursing home. But many disabled people can stay out of nursing homes, or delay admission, with moderate levels of assistance that supplement family care.
 Even $50 a day could bring in a home care aide for a few hours to help with bathing, laundry or meals. It would also pay most of the cost of an adult day program ($67 a day). Nationally, the average cost of an assisted-living facility was $37,572 last year, according to the annual MetLife Market Survey; a $75 daily benefit would pay almost three-quarters of that. 
 HOW WILL IT BE PAID FOR? WON'T PREMIUMS AND COSTS INEVITABLY SOAR? The law specifically states that no tax dollars shall be used to support it; the premiums it takes in must pay for the benefits it pays out. 
 Since this represents the country's first effort at public long-term-care insurance, we can't say with assurance whether the optimists who helped get the law passed or the pessimists who tried to derail it are correct.
 ''It hasn't been tried,'' said Ms. Manard, the economist. ''But what we have tried isn't working. We have to try something new.'' 
 WHAT IF SICK AND OLD PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE BUT YOUNG AND HEALTHY PEOPLE DON'T? This phenomenon, known as adverse selection, is a legitimate worry. People whom no private insurer would accept -- who already have diagnoses of, say, multiple sclerosis but can work part-time for three years -- are sure to jump in. They'd be foolish not to. But that is a problem only if too few others sign up and pay premiums. 
 So a marketing campaign for the Class Act will take aim at the young and the healthy -- many of whom will also unexpectedly need long-term care insurance. 
 Mr. Slome, who heads the insurance industry group, says that the law is a Trojan horse, that the government will eventually convert it into a tax-financed entitlement program. ''Inevitably, it will morph into Medicare Part E,'' he said. Though the law prohibits the use of tax dollars, Mr. Slome said, ''If you're 30 today and you think the rules aren't going to change in 50 years, you're living in a state that's legalized marijuana.''
 WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK? Long-term care insurance rarely comes cheap. Either you buy it earlier in life and pay less per year -- but for more years -- or you buy it later in life and pay much higher premiums. But it's far more expensive not to have it. Two-thirds of older Americans will need long-term care, the best projections indicate.
 In a way, the Class Act will give the country an option as appealing or as unattractive as we deserve. If we understand that paying for long-term care is largely a personal responsibility, then large numbers of people will buy insurance through the Class Act, which becomes a sustainable, affordable and helpful program. If too many people close their eyes and shrug their shoulders, trusting that their children or Medicare or God or someone else will provide, the Class Act will run into trouble. And so will they and their families.
 This is the fourth in a series of articles on how the health care overhaul will affect everyday lives. This week's author, Paula Span, writes the New Old Age blog, which can be found -- along with previous articles in the series -- at nytimes.com/health.

HEADLINE: For Obama, A Nonstop Juggling Act

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
President Obama's spokesman promised for a second day on Monday that the administration would ''keep our boot on the throat of BP'' to get the company to resolve the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet, hours later, the president was hosting dinner at the White House with executives of the Business Council. Among the companies represented by the corporate club: BP. 
 Those kinds of cross currents have become a hallmark of Mr. Obama's presidency. 
 Governing in a time of prolonged economic crisis, he seeks to balance his oft-professed regard for the free market and the job-creating potential of big business against the need to respond to the angry populism of voters on the left and right convinced that corporate America -- whether banks or mine owners or oil companies -- has only its own interests at heart. 
 From the time he took office, Mr. Obama's juggling has made for a shifting and sometimes inconsistent record of rhetoric and policy. He has mixed, for example, condemnation of ''Wall Street greed'' with opposition to government caps on financiers' bonuses, and criticism of oil companies' profits with a recent call (now in abeyance) to expand offshore drilling.
 It is enough to give rise to the equally contradictory criticisms he endures, from longtime enemies on the right crying socialism and from disillusioned supporters on the left who lament what they see as Mr. Obama's pro-business bias. 
 By his own reckoning, Mr. Obama has always been hard to peg ideologically. His Republican opponents charge that he is masking a left-wing agenda in centrist-sounding words. 
 His supporters, including those who work for him, say he is a pragmatist whose instincts are genuinely centrist, both as a matter of politics and style. The expression about a boot on BP's throat, for example, would be atypical of Mr. Obama; his spokesman, Robert Gibbs, expropriated the colorful imagery from Ken Salazar, the interior secretary. 
 ''The president calls it as he sees it,'' said the senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama's liaison to the business community. ''He's not calibrating his responses politically, seeking favor from the left or the right.'' 
 Ms. Jarrett as well as Mr. Obama and his economic team were dining Monday night at the White House with the Business Council's 13-member executive committee, which includes the chief executives of Exxon Mobil, JPMorgan Chase, Aetna, WellPoint, Dow Chemical, Boeing and Bechtel Group. BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, who is not on the executive committee but is a member of the council, did not attend, according to a White House official.
 While the economy is much improved from when Mr. Obama took office, his agenda and external events continue to demand engagement with big business even as he seeks to represent the interests and complaints of average Americans and small businesses. Yet as is often the case in striking a middle ground, those on either side remain unsatisfied.
 In swearing to recover every last dime the government spends on BP's spill, Mr. Obama is reflecting the pain of bailout-weary taxpayers. And fighting in recent weeks for Senate passage of a bill tightening regulation of the financial system, he has demanded a new overseer to protect consumers -- over banks' vehement opposition -- even as he has sought business support for the legislation by arguing that he has been warding off much more stringent regulations from his party's left.
 For all of Mr. Obama's differences with business leaders, ''they'll tell you they've never had a better direct relationship with any president,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff.
 For Mr. Emanuel and other veterans of the Clinton administration, Mr. Obama's tricky navigation between business and populism recalls the forces that buffeted Bill Clinton early in his administration, as the nation emerged from a much less severe recession. To the chagrin of the liberals who helped elect him, Mr. Clinton pursued a centrist agenda of deficit reduction and free trade -- though not always happily.
 ''Where are all the Democrats?'' he once lashed out at his advisers, angry at not being able to keep his promises for domestic investments. ''I hope you're all aware we're all Eisenhower Republicans.''
 ''Growing up in Arkansas, Clinton could do the antibusiness populism riff better than anybody,'' said William A. Galston, a former Clinton policy adviser. ''He had that in his bones. But he decided not to pursue that approach.''
 But, Mr. Galston added, ''he was able to do that in part because anger against business was not nearly as intense in that period as President Obama faces.''
 Mr. Clinton, too, took heat from his left. The failure of disillusioned liberals to vote in the 1994 midterm elections was a factor in Democrats' losing their Congressional majorities -- the fallout that Democrats fear now.
 But perhaps because Mr. Obama inherited the worst economic downturn since the Depression, he has drawn more complaints than Mr. Clinton ever did that he is no Franklin Roosevelt -- in policy or rhetoric.
 Roosevelt is celebrated by liberals for denouncing ''economic royalists'' and ''unscrupulous moneychangers.'' Yet his administration in 1933 also created an organization to attract businesses' advice on measures to pull out of the Depression. That group still exists: it has evolved into the Business Council.
 And just as Mr. Obama has ratcheted up his own populist attacks against corporate self-interest and Wall Street's return to business as usual, so did Roosevelt become more vocally populist as re-election neared and he faced demagogic opposition. That included the likes of Senator Huey Long of Louisiana, the radio broadcaster Father Charles Coughlin and a domestic Communist Party making inroads on the left, much like the Tea Party movement today on the far right.
 Still, Mr. Obama hardly seems likely to go as far as Roosevelt, who at one point swore to a top aide that he would ''steal Long's thunder.'' 
 In a recent interview, Mr. Obama acknowledged that Wall Street executives had not heeded his call to reform themselves ''as much as I'd like.'' But given an opening to excoriate them, he said instead, ''You don't want to paint with too broad a brush.''

HEADLINE: In Times Square, Terror Normally Steers Clear

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
My sister, Ellen Dominus Broude, has been working in Times Square for the past 17 years -- longer than she's been a mother, longer than she's been married. It's an unyielding fact of her life that she rarely contemplates.
 But when given the option to work from home one day a week, back in 2006, she didn't have to think long about which day to pick. ''I chose Wednesday -- matinee day,'' she told me Monday. ''If I was the bad guy, that's the day I'd choose to plant a bomb.'' 
 Every week, she goes happily to work in one of the busiest, densest, most famous tourist destinations of the world; and every day, lurking in some distant corner of her brain, vague anxiety that she's carefully sealed off waits for just the right key to set it free: an attempted car bombing, for example, on 45th Street near Seventh Avenue.
 After 9/11, everyone seemed to think that wherever he or she lived was clearly the next obvious terrorist target: if you were from Chicago, theories about the Sears Tower dominated; if you were in San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge was deemed an irresistible invitation to Al Qaeda.
 I remember, while vacationing in Nova Scotia in the summer of 2002, meeting someone who told me her part of the world had real reason for concern -- was it because salmon-canning was a major industry? What stayed with me was the universality of the thinking.
 But people who work or live in Times Square have always had, even before this Saturday, more plausible arguments than most to justify concern, if only for the potential efficiency of an attack in so dense a location -- a symbol of media might with the added bonus of a prominent military recruiting station (which was, in fact, attacked in 2008 by a bicyclist who set off an explosion that damaged the building).
 And yet to date, Times Square does not figure into any of the major stories of attacks on New York, of which there have been many, some of them all but unknown to people for whom the Sept. 11 attack still looms so large.
 Other than the 9/11 attack, the terrorist attack that took the most lives in New York occurred near the Stock Exchange in 1920, said the Columbia University historian Kenneth Jackson, with an explosion that took 38 lives (the source of the attack is still a mystery). In 1975, members of the F.A.L.N., a Puerto Rican nationalist group, killed four people at Fraunces Tavern in the financial district, injuring about 60. Eleven people died in an explosion at La Guardia Airport the same year, with 75 injured. No arrests were made.
 In 1994, Edward J. Leary, an unemployed computer analyst, injured scores of people (and himself) with firebombs on the New York subway -- one downtown, the other in Harlem).
 But even the so-called Mad Bomber of the 1940s and '50s, a disgruntled former Con Edison employee named George Metesky, was best known for placing his explosives in Grand Central Terminal, and at Radio City Music Hall -- not Times Square. (When German saboteurs annihilated Black Tom Island, an island adjacent to Liberty Island, in 1916, the explosion did blow out windows as far as Times Square, Kathleen Hulser of the New-York Historical Society offered.)
 Some people will find a near-explosion like Saturday's reassuring (the police knew what they were doing), and others will obsess over the could-have-beens (what if those street vendors hadn't noticed).
 The relatively safe history of Times Square can cut both ways, too: It's never happened before; it's only a matter of time.
 Living or working in Times Square, in other words, is not much different from living or working anywhere else in New York, a place where the slender but real possibility of dramatic violence exists against the backdrop of a sparkling record of safety.
 (Even with all terrorist attacks accounted for, Mr. Jackson pointed out, New York is still one of the safest cities in the country, because of its low crime rate, and more importantly, because driving fatalities are relatively rare.)
 In Times Square on Monday morning, several passers-by commented that the area looked surprisingly unchanged, except for some extra police officers and camera crews.
 What was harder to determine was how many people's thinking about their neighborhood had shifted.
 Sarah Falcon, 29, standing at 45th Street and Broadway, admitted that the news she'd read that morning about the Times Square attack wasn't sitting well with her.
 ''It is a big building,'' she said, looking nervously toward her workplace, 1515 Broadway. ''I'm a little reluctant to go in this morning.''
 She hovered for a moment; then she smiled, strode toward the building, and walked in the door.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 6, 2010 Thursday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Big City column on Tuesday, about the absence of terrorist attacks in Times Square, misstated the surname of an official from the New-York Historical Society who spoke about an attack in 1916 near Liberty Island that was felt in Times Square. She is Kathleen Hulser, not Hulsey.

HEADLINE: Warning Signs of a Fiscal Crisis: Missed or Ignored?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Brooks argues that greater regulation of financial markets by regulators in Washington is the wrong approach to financial reform, but I disagree with his premise that the clueless ''establishment'' can't be trusted to prevent the next financial crisis when even the best and the brightest on Wall Street missed warning signs of the last one (''The Goldman Drama,'' column, April 27).
 It is certainly Wall Street's position that the financial crisis was akin to a natural disaster that no one could have foreseen or prevented. But I find it inconceivable that ''smart and sleazy'' bankers, in Mr. Brooks's words, didn't comprehend that housing prices were grossly inflated, and that even a modest correction in housing prices would cause the default of a great many mortgage-backed securities and huge payouts by financial institutions that had agreed to insure such securities through ''derivative'' contracts. 
 Indeed, numerous risk managers inside Wall Street reportedly warned their institutions of these risks, but were ignored by bankers whose enormous bonuses depended on peddling mortgage-backed securities and derivatives. Government regulators, meanwhile, were either ideologically blinded or neutered by years of deregulation.
 If the fundamental problem is that bankers have every financial incentive to engage in risky transactions that place their firms and the nation's economy at risk, then the solution must be to eliminate the perverse incentives or regulate the risky transactions. The Democratic bill is a step in the right direction.
 Karl von Schriltz Washington, April 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks says of Fabrice Tourre, the only individual mentioned in the Securities and Exchange Commission case against Goldman Sachs, that ''he seems to be the product of the current amoral Wall Street culture in which impersonal trading is more important than personal service to clients, and in which any product you can sell to some poor sucker is deemed to be admirable and O.K.''
 To rail against an amoral Wall Street culture misdirects attention to one sector of a capitalist economy rather than the culture of the economy itself. After all, the primary objective of any capitalist enterprise -- be it a bank or a company manufacturing widgets -- is making a profit: the greater an enterprise's profit, the more successful the enterprise and its management are deemed to be.
 Then why is ''impersonal trading'' to be condemned over ''personal service to clients'' when it produces greater profits?
 If we want a more morally oriented economy -- one, for example, in which an opportunity for greater profit is sacrificed to service to clients -- then that can come only from a more strongly regulated capitalist economy.
 Murray Hausknecht Long Island City, Queens, April 27, 2010
 The writer is professor emeritus of sociology at Lehman College, CUNY.
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks perpetuates the ''everybody missed it'' myth about the housing bubble. He writes: ''Between 1997 and 2006, consumers, lenders and builders created a housing bubble, and pretty much the entire establishment missed it.''
 Not quite. They ignored it.
 On Nov. 17, 2004, The Economist featured one of its many early-warning articles, ''Home Truths,'' on the housing bubble over the last six years: ''Home prices now look significantly overvalued in America, Australia, Britain, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain. ... Two-thirds (weighted by G.D.P.) of the world tracked by The Economist's indices have a potential housing bubble.''
 Few publications are more ''establishment'' than The Economist and its nearly one million weekly readers.
 For years The Economist beat the ''housing bubble'' drum on its pages. Policy makers in the United States and elsewhere knew the housing bubble was developing years before it burst. They simply ignored it.
 Mr. Brooks fears that any new federal commission charged with heading off the next big financial crisis will be drawn from the very establishment figures that missed the last crisis because they ''are prone to groupthink.''
 To overcome that ''groupthink,'' any new federal regulatory panel should be required to maintain an early warning system: a subscription to The Economist.

HEADLINE: Bad. But an Apocalypse?

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and TOM ZELLER Jr.; Leslie Kaufman contributed reporting from New Orleans.

 BODY:
CORRECTION AND EDITORS' NOTE APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is bad -- no one would dispute it. But just how bad?
 Some experts have been quick to predict apocalypse, painting grim pictures of 1,000 miles of irreplaceable wetlands and beaches at risk, fisheries damaged for seasons, fragile species wiped out and a region and an industry economically crippled for years.
 President Obama has called the spill ''a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.'' And some scientists have suggested that the oil might hitch a ride on the loop current in the gulf, bringing havoc to the Atlantic Coast.
 Yet the Deepwater Horizon blowout is not unprecedented, nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history. And its ultimate impact will depend on a long list of interlinked variables, including the weather, ocean currents, the properties of the oil involved and the success or failure of the frantic efforts to stanch the flow and remediate its effects. 
 As one expert put it, this is the first inning of a nine-inning game. No one knows the final score.
 The ruptured well, currently pouring an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil a day into the gulf, could flow for years and still not begin to approach the 252 million to 336 million gallons of oil spilled by retreating Iraqi forces when they left Kuwait in 1991. It is not yet close to the magnitude of the Ixtoc I blowout in the Bay of Campeche in Mexico in 1979, which spilled an estimated 140 million gallons of crude before the gusher could be stopped.
 And it will have to get much worse before it approaches the impact of the Exxon Valdez accident of 1989, which contaminated 1,300 miles of largely untouched shoreline and killed tens of thousands of seabirds, otters and seals along with 250 eagles and 22 killer whales.
 No one, not even the oil industry's most fervent apologists, is making light of this accident. The contaminated area of the gulf continues to spread, and oil has been found in some of the fragile marshes at the tip of Louisiana. The beaches and coral reefs of the Florida Keys could be hit if the slick is captured by the gulf's clockwise loop current.
 But on Monday, the wind was pushing the slick in the opposite direction, away from the current. The worst effects of the spill have yet to be felt. And if efforts to contain the oil are even partly successful and the weather cooperates, the worst could be avoided.
 ''Right now what people are fearing has not materialized,'' said Edward B. Overton, professor emeritus of environmental science at Louisiana State University and an expert on oil spills. ''People have the idea of an Exxon Valdez, with a gunky, smelly black tide looming over the horizon waiting to wash ashore. I do not anticipate this will happen down here unless things get a lot worse.''
 Dr. Overton said he was hopeful that efforts by BP to place containment structures over the leaking parts of the well will succeed, although he said it was a difficult task that could actually make things worse by damaging undersea pipes.
 Other experts said that while the potential for catastrophe remained, there were reasons to remain guardedly optimistic.
 ''The sky is not falling,'' said Quenton R. Dokken, a marine biologist and the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation, a conservation group in Corpus Christi, Tex. ''We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.''
 Engineers said the type of oil pouring out is lighter than the heavy crude spilled by the Exxon Valdez, evaporates more quickly and is easier to burn. It also appears to respond to the use of dispersants, which break up globs of oil and help them sink. The oil is still capable of significant damage, particularly when it is churned up with water and forms a sort of mousse that floats and can travel long distances.
 Jacqueline Savitz, a senior scientist at Oceana, a nonprofit environmental group, said that much of the damage was already taking place far offshore and out of sight of surveillance aircraft and research vessels.
 ''Some people are saying, It hasn't gotten to shore yet so it's all good,'' she said. ''But a lot of animals live in the ocean, and a spill like this becomes bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water. You have endangered sea turtles, the larvae of bluefin tuna, shrimp and crabs and oysters, grouper. A lot of these are already being affected and have been for 10 days. We're waiting to see how bad it is at the shore, but we may never fully understand the full impacts on ocean life.''
 The economic impact is as uncertain as the environmental damage. With several million gallons of medium crude in the water already, some experts are predicting wide economic harm. Experts at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies in Corpus Christi, for example, estimated that as much as $1.6 billion of annual economic activity and services -- including effects on tourism, fishing and even less tangible services like the storm protection provided by wetlands -- could be at risk.
 ''And that's really only the tip of the iceberg,'' said David Yoskowitz, who holds the endowed chair for socioeconomics at the institute. ''It's still early in the game, and there's a lot of potential downstream impacts, a lot of multiplier impacts.''
 But much of this damage could be avoided if the various tactics employed by BP and government technicians pay off in the coming days. The winds are dying down and the seas are calming, allowing for renewed skimming operations and possible new controlled burns of oil on the surface. BP technicians are trying to inject dispersants deep below the surface, which could reduce the impact on aquatic life. Winds and currents could move the globs of emulsified oil away from coastal shellfish breeding grounds.
 The gulf is not a pristine environment and has survived both chronic and acute pollution problems before. Thousands of gallons of oil flow into the gulf from natural undersea well seeps every day, engineers say, and the scores of refineries and chemical plants that line the shore from Mexico to Mississippi pour untold volumes of pollutants into the water.
 After the Ixtoc spill 31 years ago, the second-largest oil release in history, the gulf rebounded. Within three years, there was little visible trace of the spill off the Mexican coast, which was compounded by a tanker accident in the gulf a few months later that released 2.6 million additional gallons, experts said.
 ''The gulf is tremendously resilient,'' said Dr. Dokken, the marine biologist. ''But we've always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back. As a scientist, I have to say I just don't know.''
Correction: May 20, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on May 4 about the severity of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, using information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, misstated the amount of oil that was spilled in 1991 into the Persian Gulf by Iraqi forces in Kuwait. The agency now puts the figure at 252 million to 336 million gallons -- not 36 billion gallons, as it initially estimated. 
Editors' Note: May 5, 2010, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A front-page news analysis article on Tuesday discussed the uncertainty over the ultimate environmental impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. One expert quoted was Quenton R. Dokken, a marine biologist who is the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation. (He said the spill ''isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico,'' but also said that ''we've always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back.'') 
 The article described the Gulf of Mexico Foundation simply as a conservation group. It should have included more information about the organization, a nonprofit group that says its mission is ''to promote and facilitate conservation of the health and productivity of the Gulf of Mexico and its resources'' through research and other programs. While the group says the majority of its funding comes from federal and state grants, it also receives some money from the oil industry and other business interests in the gulf, and includes industry executives on its board.

HEADLINE: The Hard Work on Financial Reform

 BODY:
The procedural vote in the Senate last week on financial reform did more than end a Republican filibuster. It set up the real test of the Democrats' resolve to enact the kind of change that the nation's financial system so badly needs.
 Achieving that requires passing amendments to strengthen the bill's weak areas and defeating efforts to weaken its strong parts. Senate leaders may try to bridge partisan divides by hampering or blocking amendments on divisive issues. That would enable reluctant reformers from both parties to avoid politically difficult votes and appease the banking lobby, but it would not serve the public interest. 
 By the time this bill passes, the public needs to know who stands where on the most important reform issues, starting with these two:
 TOO BIG TO FAIL Senators said Tuesday that they had reached an agreement on how to pay for seizing and dismantling big banks whose imminent failure could destabilize the system, but that doesn't confront the more difficult issue of how to cut big banks down to a less threatening size. The Senate bill calls on regulators to impose higher capital requirements on riskier institutions. The aim is to make size and complexity so expensive that banks opt to restrict their size, but the new rules are unlikely to be enough.
 The Senate bill also imposes needless delays on the enactment of the so-called Volcker rule, which would bar banks from making risky market trades for their own accounts and from owning hedge funds and private equity funds. Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, both Democrats, have an amendment to enact the Volcker rule without undue delays or tinkering.
 Even that may not be enough. Democrats Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Ted Kaufman of Delaware propose size caps on banks that include limiting nondeposit liabilities to no more than 2 percent of gross domestic product. That would provide a necessary backstop against bailouts and decrease the political power of banks.
 DERIVATIVES The central reform of the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market would move most derivative trades, currently executed as private contracts, onto fully regulated exchanges. Banks have fought the change because it would impair their profits -- and they have succeeded in carving out many exemptions. More proposed exemptions are expected, like for pension funds that use derivatives. The Senate needs to pare back the exemptions in the existing bill, not add more.
 The Senate also should adopt an amendment by Maria Cantwell, a Democrat of Washington, that would make it easier for regulators to crack down on market manipulation in derivatives. 
 One of the most divisive issues in the Senate bill is a provision that could force big banks to spin off their lucrative derivative dealings. The provision was added to the bill late in the game, without hearings. Opponents fear that it would push derivatives deals into hedge funds or other entities that would be harder to regulate. Supporters say that the bill would adequately regulate derivative dealers wherever they are. 
 The Senate debate, and hearings that can be scheduled before the House and Senate produce final legislation, can help settle the issue. One thing is already sure: Unless senators close loopholes in derivatives rules and give regulators more powers to police the markets, they should not even think about removing the provision.
 There are other big fights in store -- on consumer and investor protection, regulation of hedge funds, support for regulatory agencies and reform of credit rating agencies. Each of them will test how serious the Senate, particularly the Democrats, are about this reform effort.

HEADLINE: A Suspect Leaves Clues At Every Turn

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Here is a quest for the invisible life, rendered in less than 50 words.
 Buy a used Nissan Pathfinder with cash; decline a bill of sale or any other paperwork; communicate about the deal on a prepaid cellphone, registered to no one. Then strip the vehicle identification number, or VIN, from the dashboard. Add a stolen license plate. Tint the windows.
 And here, it seems, is the very definition of futility. 
 These were the tactics that prosecutors say were used by Faisal Shahzad, the man pulled off a plane late Monday night and charged with trying to blow up the Pathfinder in Times Square on Saturday evening, when tens of thousands of people were jammed into the streets.
 It was the precise map of the fanatic heart drawn by Yeats: Great hatred, little room. 
 At virtually every turn, the evasive steps Mr. Shahzad took left digital footprints, a trail that ultimately led to his seat on an Emirates flight that was bound for Dubai, the authorities say. Mr. Shahzad did not make it into court on Tuesday; he is said to be talking, and the authorities seemed unwilling to interrupt the stream of his consciousness.
 If Mr. Shahzad is indeed responsible, he would not be the first car-bombing suspect arrested in a matter of days because of the things he left behind. With every breath of modern life, people leave a vast series of markings that are unseen and, usually, unnoticed.
 Nearly two decades ago, the first -- and so far, only successful -- car bomb in the modern history of New York was planted in the basement garage of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993. Six people were killed. The explosion left an immense crater. 
 Climbing through the rubble a few days later, Joe Hanlin, a federal explosives investigator, and Donald Sadowy, a detective with the Police Department's bomb squad, found bits and pieces of a vehicle that had been torn apart, including a severely twisted section of the frame. That section appeared to have been quite close to the explosion. As they began to swab it for chemical residue, a series of raised dots emerged. They formed letters and numbers. 
 ''We couldn't read all the numbers,'' Mr. Hanlin testified later that year, ''but we knew they were numbers and could be used to trace the vehicle.''
 It turned out that particular fragment had been stamped with the vehicle's 17-digit VIN, the automotive equivalent of DNA. Each vehicle is assigned a unique series of numbers that shows where it was manufactured and when, and describes in code its body type, make, model, options. 
 The VIN showed that the demolished vehicle had been a Ford Econoline van, owned by the Ryder Truck and Rental Company, which reported that it had been rented a few weeks earlier in Jersey City by a man named Mohammed A. Salameh. 
 In fact, by the time the van was linked to the bombing, Mr. Salameh had already reported it stolen. While others who were part of the bomb plot had fled the country, Mr. Salameh was left behind, nearly penniless. As federal investigators descended on the rental company, Mr. Salameh was haggling with Ryder for the return of a $400 deposit. 
 ON Saturday, when police seized the Nissan Pathfinder left in Times Square, the VIN plate on the dashboard had been removed. But the VIN is also stamped on engine parts and on the frame, and these were intact. That identification quickly led to a 19-year-old Connecticut woman who had sold the Pathfinder a few weeks ago to a man for $1,300 in cash.
 The man who bought it had declined the offer of a bill of sale. He had, however, called the seller several times from the prepaid cellphone to arrange the purchase, according to a criminal complaint made public on Tuesday.
 That same phone had been used for calls to and from a ''Pakistani telephone number associated with Shahzad,'' the complaint said.
 With Mr. Shahzad's name, investigators searched his home in Connecticut on Monday, and solved another tiny mystery: The police had found keys in the Pathfinder, and one of them opened the door to Mr. Shahzad's home. In his garage, they found fertilizer and fireworks, similar to what had been left in the Pathfinder in Times Square. 
 Later that night, in a seat on board Emirates Flight 202, they found Faisal Shahzad.
 Another invisible man, thwarted by a VIN.

HEADLINE: A Suburban Father Who Gave No Warning Sign

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Reporting was contributed by Alison Leigh Cowan from New York, and Ray Rivera, Michael S. Schmidt and Karen Zraick from Connecticut.

 BODY:
They took their places in the wood-paneled courtroom, 58 people from 32 countries. They listened as a federal magistrate banged the gavel and said it was ''a wonderful day for the United States''-- the day they would become Americans.
 The magistrate talked about Thomas Jefferson and told the group that they could run for office -- only the presidency and the vice presidency were off limits, according to a tape recording of the proceedings in a Bridgeport, Conn., courtroom last year, on April 17. On her instructions, they raised their right hands and repeated the oath of citizenship.
 One man in the group was the Pakistani-born Faisal Shahzad, whose father or grandfather was a Pakistani military official and who, at 29, had spent a decade in the United States, collecting a bachelor's degree and a master's degree and landing a job with a Connecticut financial marketing company.
 He had obtained citizenship through marriage to a woman who was born in Colorado -- the authorities say she and their two young children are still in Pakistan, where they believe he was trained in making bombs last year in Waziristan, a tribal area that is a haven for militants. 
 On Saturday, the authorities said, Mr. Shahzad drove a Nissan Pathfinder packed with explosives and detonators, leaving it in Times Square.
 About 7 p.m., as a robot from the bomb squad was being summoned to the S.U.V., Mr. Shahzad called his landlord from the train to Connecticut and said he had lost his keys; in a criminal complaint filed on Tuesday, the authorities said the keys had been locked inside the Pathfinder.
 The landlord met him at the apartment that night to let him in. ''He looked nervous,'' said the landlord, Stanislaw Chomiak, who had rented him a two-bedroom apartment in Bridgeport since Feb. 15. ''But I thought, of course he's nervous, he just lost his keys.''
 In nearly a dozen years in this country, Mr. Shahzad had gone to school, held steady jobs, bought and sold real estate, and kept his immigration status in good order, giving no sign to those he interacted with that he had connections to terrorists in Pakistan. Nor was there any indication that he would try to wreak havoc in one of the world's most crowded places, Times Square. 
 His neighbors in Connecticut said the things neighbors always say about someone who suddenly turns up in the headlines -- he was quiet, he was polite, he went jogging late at night. Like so many others, he lost a house to foreclosure -- a real estate broker who helped him buy the house, in Shelton, Conn., in 2004 remembered that Mr. Shahzad did not like President George W. Bush or the Iraq war.
 ''I didn't take it for much,'' said the broker, Igor Djuric, ''because around that time not many people did.''
 George LaMonica, a 35-year-old computer consultant, said he bought his two-bedroom condominium in Norwalk, Conn., from Mr. Shahzad for $261,000 in May 2004. A few weeks after he moved in, Mr. LaMonica said, investigators from the national Joint Terrorism Task Force interviewed him, asking for details of the transaction and for information about Mr. Shahzad. It struck Mr. LaMonica as unusual, but he said detectives told him they were simply ''checking everything out.'' 
 Mr. Shahzad was born in Pakistan in 1979, though there is some confusion over where. Officials in Pakistan said it was in Nowshera, an area in northern Pakistan known for its Afghan refugee camps. But on a university application that Mr. Shahzad had filled out and that was found in the maggot-covered garbage outside the Shelton house on Tuesday, he listed Karachi. 
 Pakistani officials said Mr. Shahzad was either a son or a grandson of Baharul Haq, who retired as a vice air marshal in 1992 and then joined the Civil Aviation Authority.
 A Pakistani official said Mr. Shahzad might have had affiliations with Ilyas Kashmiri, a militant linked to Al Qaeda who was formerly associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, an anti-India militant group once nurtured by the Pakistani state. But friends said the family was well respected and nonpolitical. 
 ''Neither Faisal nor his family has ever had any links with any jihadist or religious organization,'' one friend said. Another, a lawyer, said that ''the family is in a state of shock,'' adding, ''They believe that their son has been implicated in a fake case.''
 Mr. Shahzad apparently went back and forth to Pakistan often, returning most recently in February after what he said was five months visiting his family, prosecutors said. A Pakistani intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr. Shahzad had traveled with three passports, two from Pakistan and one from the United States; he last secured a Pakistani passport in 2000, describing his nationality as ''Kashmiri.'' 
 Mr. Shahzad's generation grew up in a Pakistan where alcohol had been banned and Islam had been forced into schools and communities as a doctrine and a national glue. 
 ''It's not that they don't speak English or aren't skilled,'' a Pakistani official explained. ''But in their hearts and in their minds they reject the West. They can't see a world where they live together; there's only one way, one right way.''
 According to immigration officials, Mr. Shahzad arrived in the United States on Jan. 16, 1999, less than a month after he had been granted a student visa, which requires a criminal background check. 
 He had previously attended a program in Karachi affiliated with the now-defunct Southeastern University in Washington; a transcript from the spring of 1998, found in the garbage outside the Shelton house, showed that he got D's in English composition and microeconomics, B's in Introduction to Accounting and Introduction to Humanities, and a C in statistics. 
 He enrolled at the University of Bridgeport, where he received a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering in 2000, followed by a master's in business administration in 2005. 
 ''If this hadn't happened I would have long forgotten him,'' said William Greenspan, Mr. Shahzad's adviser as an undergraduate. ''There are a lot of students you get to know; they call you up once in awhile to say hello, they got a nice job. After he left U.B., I never heard anything from him.''
 In January 2002 Mr. Shahzad obtained an H1B visa, a coveted status meant for highly skilled workers and good for three years, with a possible extension. Records show that Elizabeth Arden, the cosmetics giant, applied for a visa around that time for a job similar to the one he had there in 2001, arranged through a temporary employment agency called Accountants Inc., according to a timecard found in his trash. Officials at the cosmetics company refused to comment.
 In 2006, Mr. Shahzad took a job as a junior financial analyst at Affinion Group in Norwalk, a financial marketing services company. Michael Bush, the company's director of public relations, said Mr. Shahzad resigned in mid-2009; government officials said he was unemployed and bankrupt by the time of his arrest.
 After his marriage, to Huma Mian, he petitioned the immigration agency in 2004 to change his status; he wanted to become a permanent resident, another step on the path to citizenship.
 Ms. Mian had just graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a business degree, according to Bronson Hilliard, a university spokesman. She lived in dormitories and in family housing, sharing her quarters with a sister or a cousin, Mr. Hilliard said. 
 Her parents lived in the Denver suburb of Aurora. A neighbor in their condominium complex, Johnny Wright, remembered that her new husband had visited the family only once before she joined him.
 ''He seemed educated,'' Mr. Wright said. ''Didn't make a lot of conversation.''
 The Mians moved out in 2008, leaving a post office box overseas as a forwarding address. Meanwhile, Mr. Shahzad applied for citizenship that October.
 Shortly after his naturalization ceremony in the Bridgeport courthouse, his name appeared on a case in another Connecticut court, a foreclosure action by Chase bank. 
 He and his wife had bought a newly built single-family house on Long Hill Avenue in Shelton in 2004 for $273,000, with a $218,400 mortgage, according to court papers. 
 They tried to cash in on the real estate boom, listing it for sale for $329,000 in 2006. It did not sell, said Frank DelVecchio, an agent who picked up the listing in 2008. The price then was $299,000. Later it was marked down to $285,000, and finally, $284,500.
 In Shelton, neighbors remembered Mr. Shahzad's walking early in the morning in sandals and loose-fitting shirts, and jogging late at night in black athletic clothes; his wife wore a long dress and a shawl covering her hair. They had toys in their garage and a little swimming pool in the back; last summer, friends went over for barbecues.
 ''He wasn't unfriendly,'' said Debbie Bussolari, a 55-year-old dental technician who lives across the street. ''He seemed a little different.''
 The family had several tag sales last summer, offering knickknacks and kid stuff, ''things that you would give to Goodwill,'' said Mary Ann Galich, 55, who lives behind the house. 
 ''She was outside dealing with the people, and he was dealing with the money,'' Ms. Galich recalled. 
 Davon Reid, 17, who lives next door, said the family moved in December: ''It seemed like they picked up everything very quickly.'' A few months later, a real estate broker let him in to check the place out, and it was a wreck.
 ''There was spoiled food and milk everywhere,'' he said. ''They just left everything. They left clothes in closets, the kids' shoes, the woman's shoes. And the kids' toys.''
 Three months ago, Mr. Shahzad signed a one-year lease on the two-bedroom apartment in Bridgeport. Mr. Chomiak, the landlord, said he usually saw Mr. Shahzad only when the rent was due, but he described him as a nice guy who furnished the apartment sparsely, and said he made a living selling jewelry in New Haven.
 Other details took on significance in light of the arrest. When Mr. Chomiak went looking for Mr. Shahzad on Monday, he noticed a distributor cap and two small bags of fertilizer in the garage.
 Mr. Shahzad, Mr. Chomiak said, mentioned that he wanted to grow tomatoes.

HEADLINE: Recovery In Trading Helps UBS Post Profit

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- While many governments struggle to get their debt under control, some banks are earning stronger profits because of a rebound in their debt-trading businesses.
 On Tuesday, UBS, the Swiss banking giant, surprised investors with better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. The bank had net income of 2.2 billion Swiss francs, or $2 billion, its highest quarterly profit in almost three years, mainly because of a recovery of debt trading. 
 UBS rivals like JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs all presented healthy earnings last month.
 Low interest rates are prompting clients to refinance their debt while sharpening investor desire for higher-yielding investments.
 ''It's undeniable that the shape of the yield curve is positive for investment banking revenue,'' Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London, said, referring to rising yields on debt instruments, reflecting the higher risk of holding these instruments. 
 ''These conditions would probably continue for the foreseeable future,'' Mr. Gordon added.
 But the speed of the recovery is raising questions among some investors about the sustainability of the rapid growth at trading divisions. Interest rates will not remain at record low levels forever, and financial regulation -- currently under discussion by the Group of 20 countries -- could curb income at the businesses.
 In its outlook, UBS acknowledged on Tuesday that there was ''some market uncertainty'' because of ''concerns relating to European sovereign debt.''
 The bank said it was ''credit in particular'' that led to increased revenue at its debt, currency and commodity business in the quarter. UBS's investment banking division quadrupled its pretax profit from the previous quarter. 
 The upbeat figures stand in contrast to the budget deficits across Europe and in the United States. 
 Some analysts said the European Central Bank could start buying government bonds to support debt markets.
 ''The E.C.B. could come in, in the absence of investors,'' said Harvinder Sian, a senior fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in London. Banks' ''trading books wouldn't be the primary concern,'' he added, but they might benefit.
 Gary Jenkins, head of credit research at Evolution Securities in London, said it was ''impossible to quantify'' how much banks had benefited while governments piled on more debt to rescue their economies and as they struggled to cut debt now.
 What is clear, he said, is that the ''recovery of banks has been so much better than we could have dreamt of.''

HEADLINE: Tearing Away the Veil

BYLINE: By JEAN-FRANCOIS COPE. 
Jean-Francois Cope is the majority leader in the French National Assembly and the mayor of Meaux.

DATELINE: Paris 

 BODY:
 MOMENTUM is building in Europe for laws forbidding the wearing of garments that cover the face, like the Islamic burqa and niqab, in public. Just last week, the lower house of the Belgian Parliament overwhelmingly passed a ban on face coverings. And next week, the French Assembly will most likely approve a resolution that my party, the Union for a Popular Movement, has introduced condemning such garments as against our republican principles, a step toward a similar ban. 
 Amnesty International condemned the Belgian law as ''an attack on religious freedom,'' while other critics have asserted that by prohibiting the burqa, France would impinge upon individual liberties and stigmatize Muslims, thereby aiding extremists worldwide. 
 This criticism is unjust. The debate on the full veil is complicated, and as one of the most prominent advocates in France of a ban on the burqa, I would like to explain why it is both a legitimate measure for public safety and a reaffirmation of our ideals of liberty and fraternity.
 First, the freedom to dress the way one wants is not what's at stake here. Our debate is not about a type of attire or the Islamic head scarf that covers the hair and forehead. The latter is obviously allowed in France. The ban would apply to the full-body veil known as the burqa or niqab. This is not an article of clothing -- it is a mask, a mask worn at all times, making identification or participation in economic and social life virtually impossible.
 This face covering poses a serious safety problem at a time when security cameras play an important role in the protection of public order. An armed robbery recently committed in the Paris suburbs by criminals dressed in burqas provided an unfortunate confirmation of this fact. As a mayor, I cannot guarantee the protection of the residents for whom I am responsible if masked people are allowed to run about. 
 The visibility of the face in the public sphere has always been a public safety requirement. It was so obvious that until now it did not need to be enshrined in law. But the increase in women wearing the niqab, like that of the ski mask favored by criminals, changes that. We must therefore adjust our law, without waiting for the phenomenon to spread.
 The permanent concealment of the face also raises the question of social interactions in our democracies. In the United States, there are very few limits on individual freedom, as exemplified by the guarantees of the First Amendment. In France, too, we are passionately attached to liberty. 
 But we also reaffirm our citizens' equality and fraternity. These values are the three inseparable components of our national motto. We are therefore constantly striving to achieve a delicate balance. Individual liberty is vital, but individuals, like communities, must accept compromises that are indispensable to living together, in the name of certain principles that are essential to the common good.
 Let's take one example: The fact that people are prohibited from strolling down Fifth Avenue in the nude does not constitute an attack on the fundamental rights of nudists. Likewise, wearing headgear that fully covers the face does not constitute a fundamental liberty. To the contrary, it is an insurmountable obstacle to the affirmation of a political community that unites citizens without regard to differences in sex, origin or religious faith. How can you establish a relationship with a person who, by hiding a smile or a glance -- those universal signs of our common humanity -- refuses to exist in the eyes of others?
 Finally, in both France and the United States, we recognize that individual liberties cannot exist without individual responsibilities. This acknowledgment is the basis of all our political rights. We are free as long as we are responsible individuals who can be held accountable for our actions before our peers. But the niqab and burqa represent a refusal to exist as a person in the eyes of others. The person who wears one is no longer identifiable; she is a shadow among others, lacking individuality, avoiding responsibility. 
 From this standpoint, banning the veil in the street is aimed at no particular religion and stigmatizes no particular community. Indeed, French Muslim leaders have noted that the Koran does not instruct women to cover their faces, while in Tunisia and Turkey, it is forbidden in public buildings; it is even prohibited during the pilgrimage to Mecca. Muslims are the first to suffer from the confusions engendered by this practice, which is a blow against the dignity of women. 
 Through a legal ban, French parliamentarians want to uphold a principle that should apply to all: the visibility of the face in the public sphere, which is essential to our security and is a condition for living together. A few extremists are contesting this obvious fact by using our democratic liberties as an instrument against democracy. We have to tell them no.

HEADLINE: Pfizer and Merck Beat Forecasts for Earnings

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The drug companies Pfizer and Merck posted better-than-expected first-quarter results Tuesday and stood by their long-term forecasts.
 Pfizer and Merck -- the world's top two drug manufacturers by 2009 sales, according to IMS Health -- are counting on huge cost savings in the next few years from acquisitions of rivals Wyeth (by Pfizer) and Schering-Plough (by Merck).
 ''It looks like both companies are already getting leverage from merger-related cost savings, and it's going right to the bottom line,'' Damien Conover, a Morningstar analyst, said. ''This is a trend that we'll see continue going forward.'' 
 Results of drug manufacturers in the quarter were hurt by the new health insurance overhaul legislation, which requires companies to provide larger price rebates to patients in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor.
 ''The results for Merck and Pfizer also complete that theme we've seen for other drug makers this quarter, that largely good results are offsetting the costs of health care reform,'' Mr. Conover said.
 Richard T. Clark, chairman and chief executive of Merck, told investors the health care overhaul should bolster his company's results over the long term.
 Merck earned $299 million, or 9 cents a share, in the first quarter. Results were hurt by special charges and a tax expense related to the health care law. That compared with $1.43 billion, or 67 cents a share a year ago.
 Excluding special items, Merck earned 83 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 75 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Merck's revenue more than doubled to $11.42 billion on the strength of the Schering deal. Analysts looked for $11.18 billion.
 Sales of the Januvia diabetes franchise jumped 32 percent to $712 million, including explosive growth outside the United States, well ahead of the estimate of $622.2 million by six analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., also said the quarterly results were helped by a $75 million to $100 million inventory buildup of its vaccines in the United States, and lower-than-expected research spending that should not continue in coming quarters.
 The company expects 2010 earnings of $3.27 to $3.41 a share, excluding special items. Analysts were expecting $3.41 a share. The forecast reflects flat earnings to a decline of 4.2 percent, largely because of plunging sales of its Cozaar blood pressure drug that began facing generic rivals last month.
 Pfizer earned $2.03 billion, or 25 cents a share in the quarter. That compared with $2.73 billion, or 40 cents a share, a year ago.
 Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 60 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 53 cents a share.
 Pfizer posted revenue of about $16.75 billion. Analysts looked for $16.58 billion.
 Sales of its Lipitorcholesterol drug inched up 1 percent to $2.76 billion, above the estimate of $2.64 billion of eight analysts.
 Pfizer backed its 2010 profit forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 a share, excluding items, despite a revenue hit from the new health care law. The forecast reflects growth of 4 percent to 9 percent.
 The company, which is based in New York, affirmed its 2012 profit forecast of $2.25 to $2.35 a share, excluding items. The outlook tracks Wall Street's expectations for 2011, suggesting the Wyeth merger will prevent Pfizer earnings from plunging once Lipitor gets generic competition as soon as late 2011.

HEADLINE: Pension Fund Cleared to Sue Ratings Firms

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
A lawsuit against the large ratings companies filed by the California Public Employees' Retirement System can proceed, a state court judge ruled. 
 The large pension fund, known as Calpers, had sued Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, saying that their faulty risk assessments on structured investment vehicles caused $1 billion in losses.
 Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for Calpers, said Tuesday that a state court judge in San Francisco had rejected the ratings firms' requests to dismiss Calpers' claims of negligent misrepresentation.
 Judge Richard Kramer, however, in a ruling last week, denied a claim of negligent interference. He said Calpers could renew that claim later, Mr. Pacheco said.
 Calpers sued the three major bond-rating companies for $1 billion in losses it said were caused by ''wildly inaccurate'' risk assessments. They used methods that were ''seriously flawed in conception and incompetently applied,'' Calpers said in its lawsuit filed on July 9.
 The companies all gave their highest ratings to several structured investment vehicles that collapsed in 2007 and 2008. The underlying assets of three firms Calpers invested in consisted primarily of risky subprime mortgages, the fund said.
 Moody's, S.& P. and Fitch face similar suits by institutional investors in federal court in Manhattan. The firms have denied wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: New Technology Generates Database on Spill Damage

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
A technology created to track political violence in Kenya with social media is now being used to log the effects of the oil spill on the Gulf Coast. 
 Witnesses' texts, tweets and e-mail messages generate the rainbow of dots on a map and database of spill-related damage at the Louisiana Bucket Brigade's Web site. 
 The crude oil has not actually hit Louisiana's bayous yet, so dispatches are limited to about several dozen. But the brigade, a New Orleans advocacy group, hopes that thousands will help populate the map over the coming weeks with reports of odors, unemployed oystermen and oily birds and other animals. 
 ''You hear one anecdote and then another anecdote, but hopefully this will give a more global perspective'' of the damage, said Anne Rolfes, the group's director. 
 The crowd-sourcing technology called Ushahidi, developed as an open-source platform by volunteers in 2008, has been put to versatile use, without charge, around the world. For some, it has been a tool for record-keeping and testimony -- the meaning of the word ''Ushahidi'' in Swahili -- from election irregularities in Sudan to crime in Atlanta. Its immediacy was on display in Haiti, where the map helped first responders, including the United States Coast Guard, find earthquake victims.
 The Louisiana Bucket Brigade expects to form similar relationships with the government during the spill cleanup. But its map is unique in its intention to track the long-term impact of unemployment in the commercial fishing industry. 
 ''We will have absolutely crystal-clear data about people affected,'' Ms. Rolfes said, ''and that should certainly inform policy makers.''

HEADLINE: Developers Bet on Cargo Traffic at J.F.K.

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
A revival in global trade has spurred the first speculative warehouse development at Kennedy International Airport in almost a decade.
 The industrial market around Kennedy Airport -- where tenants tend to be freight-forwarding businesses, trucking companies, United States Customs brokers, and other airline or aviation-related service businesses -- is one of the most robust in the world, according to the CoStar Group, a real estate information company in Bethesda, Md. 
 Because the area has virtually no land available to develop, inventory rarely grows and vacancy rates tend to hover at around 5 percent, while prices to lease space or buy it are among the highest in the nation's industrial markets, including its airports. 
 Even in 2008 and 2009, the vacancy rate still crept only as high as 10 percent. Vacancy rates at other American airports that handle large amounts of cargo, like those in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago, tend to hover around 10 percent or higher even in good economic times.
 ''Though global trade flows are down, it's almost impossible to build new space'' at Kennedy, said Hans Nordby, a director of advisory services at CoStar, ''and people who ship air freight are fairly price-insensitive, because they just have to be there.''
 The airport's air cargo volumes, particularly international ones, have been growing rapidly since November 2009, and airport officials and developers are preparing for an upswing in global trade over the next few years.
 Vista Realty Partners, a real estate development firm in Manhattan, will break ground in September on an air cargo warehouse, possibly with offices, of up to 110,000 square feet on five acres on Eastern Road, on the northern edge of the airport. 
 The last warehouse to be built near Kennedy was the four-building AMB JFK Logistics Center, which was begun in 2001 on Rockaway Boulevard. 
 To build even the most generic of warehouses, construction costs would be about $125 to $150 a square foot, said Marc Esrig, a principal with Vista. While Vista's principals would prefer to build for a specific tenant, they are comfortable enough with the reviving market to forge ahead without one, he said. 
 Asking rents in the Kennedy Airport industrial market are about $13 to $14 a square foot, according to the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation. ''It's a tremendous investment to build a building and not have a tenant to take the risk,'' Mr. Esrig said, ''but we're sensing that this economic freeze is starting to thaw.''
 While New York City owns all the property inside the airport, which is leased to and run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the largest property owner off the airport grounds is AMB Property, a real estate investment trust based in San Francisco that specializes in distribution facilities. 
 AMB owns about 1.5 million square feet of the six million-square-foot market surrounding Kennedy Airport, said Reid Berch, a senior director and partner at Corporate National Realty, a commercial brokerage, whose client is AMB. 
 ''In 2010, we've seen a steady, slow, positive increase in activity and leasing,'' Mr. Berch said. ''And the occupancy is increasing as well, so the market's looking stronger.''
 Besides those properties owned by AMB, other ownership consists of a few private companies, institutional owners and some local families. The second largest owner is Seagis Property Group of West Conshohocken, Pa., one of the leading owners of industrial real estate in the eastern United States, which owns 500,000 square feet.
 ''It's a pretty unique market to own property in,'' said Charles Lee, a principal at Seagis, ''because you've got what is in the neighborhood of the seventh-largest international cargo airport in terms of volume, but you have a pretty finite universe of buildings for that cargo to go into.'' 
 The additional 110,000 square feet of space coming with the Vista Management project, which will provide the only modern facilities other than the JFK Logistics Center, will have little effect on rents at existing warehouses, he said. ''Clearly new supply always dampens leasing velocity for a period of time, but 110,000 square feet isn't going to give anybody any broad concern for that marketplace over time,'' Mr. Lee said.
 In addition to the Vista project, the Port Authority said on April 29 that it would begin demolishing six obsolete cargo buildings and five underutilized hangars on the airport to expand its cargo and passenger businesses. 
 The $42.3 million program will free up about 109 acres for development of locations for future cargo growth, among other functions, said Michael J. Bednarz, the Port Authority's air cargo business manager.
 ''Right now, we are O.K. in terms of warehouse capacity versus the amount of cargo; however, we are in a growth pattern again,'' he said. For the months of November through March, international and domestic cargo volume grew almost 20 percent from the same month a year earlier.
 ''We are in a decent growth pattern, and we expect this return to growth to stay consistent,'' Mr. Bednarz said.
 The buildings and hangars are no longer used because many airlines are divesting their real estate and transferring cargo-handling duties to third-party operators. Kennedy Airport will be redeveloping some of the demolished buildings and hangars to consolidate them into a sort of ''cargo campus,'' said Susan M. Baer, aviation director for the Port Authority. 
 ''Airlines are interested in focusing on their core business -- flying airplanes and people -- and want to have others handle cargo for them,'' Ms. Baer said. ''And it can be done more efficiently for them by a third party, without having to have these long fixed leases and big structures to maintain themselves.''
 The plan is to request development proposals for the cargo campus from private developers in about a year, she said.

HEADLINE: No Fooling Mother Nature

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
There is only one meaningful response to the horrific oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and that is for America to stop messing around when it comes to designing its energy and environmental future. The only meaningful response to this man-made disaster is a man-made energy bill that would finally put in place an American clean-energy infrastructure that would set our country on a real, long-term path to ending our addiction to oil.
 That is so obviously the right thing for our environment, the right thing for our national security, the right thing for our economic security and the right thing to promote innovation. But it means that we have to stop messing around with idiotic ''drill, baby, drill'' nostrums, feel-good Earth Day concerts and the paralyzing notion that the American people are not prepared to do anything serious to change our energy mix. 
 This oil spill is to the environment what the subprime mortgage mess was to the markets -- both a wake-up call and an opportunity to galvanize a constituency for radical change that overcomes the powerful lobbies and vested interests that want to keep us addicted to oil.
 If President Obama wants to seize this moment, it is there for the taking. We have one of the worst environmental disasters in American history on our hands. We have a public deeply troubled by what they've seen already -- and they've probably seen only the first reel of this gulf horror show. And we have a bipartisan climate/energy/jobs bill ready to be introduced in the Senate -- produced by Senators John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham -- that would set a price on carbon and begin to shift us to a system of cleaner fuels, greater energy efficiency and unlock an avalanche of private capital to the clean energy market. 
 American industry is ready to act and is basically saying to Washington: ''Every major country in the world, starting with China, is putting in clear, long-term market rules to stimulate clean energy -- except America. Just give us some clear rules, and we'll do the rest.'' 
 The Kerry-Lieberman-Graham bill is an important step in that direction. It is far from perfect. It includes support for more off-shore drilling, nuclear power and concessions to coal companies. In light of the spill, we need to make this bill better. At a minimum, we need much tighter safeguards on off-shore drilling. There is going to be a lot of pressure to go even further, but we need to remember that even if we halted all off-shore drilling, all we would be doing is moving the production to other areas outside the U.S., probably with even weaker environmental laws. 
 Somehow a compromise has to be found to move forward on this bill -- or one like it. But even before the gulf oil spill, this bill was in limbo because the White House and Senate Democrats broke a promise to Senator Graham, the lone Republican supporting this effort, not to introduce a controversial immigration bill before energy. At the same time, President Obama has kept his support low-key, fearing that if he loudly endorses a price on carbon, Republicans will be screaming ''carbon tax'' and ''gasoline tax'' in the 2010 midterm elections.
 Bottom line: This bill has no chance to pass unless President Obama gets behind it with all his power, mobilizes the public and rounds up the votes. He has to lead from the front, not the rear. Responding to this oil spill could well become the most important leadership test of the Obama presidency. The president has always had the right instincts on energy, but he is going to have to decide just how much he wants to rise to this occasion -- whether to generate just an emergency response that over months ends the spill or a systemic response that over time ends our addiction. Needless to say, it would be a lot easier for the president to lead if more than one Republican in the Senate was ready to lift a finger to help him.
 Our dependence on crude oil is not just a national-security or climate problem. Some 40 percent of America's fish catch comes out of the gulf, whose states also depend heavily on coastal tourism. In addition, the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast are part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge. It was created by Teddy Roosevelt and is one of our richest cornucopias of biodiversity. 
 As the energy consultant David Rothkopf likes to say, sometimes a problem reaches a point of acuity where there are just two choices left: bold action or permanent crisis. This is such a moment for our energy system and environment. 
 If we settle for just an incremental response to this crisis -- a ''Hey, that's our democracy. What more can you expect?'' -- we'll be sorry. You can't fool Mother Nature. She knows when we're just messing around. Mother Nature operates by her own iron laws. And if we violate them, there is no lobby or big donor to get us off the hook. No, what's gone will be gone. What's ruined will be ruined. What's extinct will be extinct -- and later, when we're finally ready to stop messing around, it will be too late.

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Orders Are Stronger Than Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A surprisingly busy month for United States factories and a surge in home buying are the latest signs that the economic recovery is picking up.
 Orders to factories rose 1.3 percent in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was much better than the 0.1 percent decline that analysts had expected. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders gained 3.1 percent, the largest increase since August 2005. 
 Widespread activity in many industries offset a big drop in commercial aircraft. The increase offers further evidence that manufacturers are helping to drive the recovery.
 A separate report showed that more people signed contracts on previously owned homes in March than had been expected. The jump was in large part the result of tax incentives that have propelled the housing market this spring.
 The National Association of Realtors said its seasonally adjusted index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes rose 5.3 percent from a month earlier to a reading of 102.9. It was the highest level since October and a 21 percent increase from the month a year ago. The index provides an early measurement of sales activity because a one- to two-month lag is typical between a sales contract and a completed deal.
 The two reports offered more evidence that the recovery was strengthening. 
 At the moment, manufacturing is the leading star of the economic rebound and economists are predicting that will continue for the rest of the year, helping to offset weakness in other areas. Manufacturers are benefiting not only from the rebound in the United States but also from rising demand for exports as the global economy recovers faster than had been expected.
 For March, demand for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, fell 0.6 percent, a better showing than a preliminary report on April 23, which had put the decline at 1.3 percent.
 The overall durable goods number was heavily influenced by a big swing in commercial aircraft, a volatile category. Commercial aircraft plunged 66.9 percent in March after posting huge gains in the two previous months.
 Total transportation orders were down 12.3 percent. That was the largest drop since June 2009 as a 2.7 percent rise in demand for motor vehicles and parts only partly offset the plunge in aircraft.
 Excluding transportation, factory orders posted a 3.1 percent rise, the best showing since a 3.6 percent increase in August 2005.
 The strength in other industries was widespread. Orders for primary metals, including iron and steel, increased 4.7 percent while demand for machinery was up 8.6 percent, led by a 28.1 percent surge in construction machinery.
 Orders for computers and other electronics products increased 22.7 percent.
 The report showed that demand for nondurable goods, products like oil and chemicals, rose 2.9 percent in March. The strength in nondurables included strong increases in demand for petroleum, chemicals and tobacco.
 Home sales have received a boost from the federal government's tax credit of up to $8,000 for buyers.
 The incentives have stimulated the market, but the deadline to get a signed sales contract was April 30. Many analysts project sales will drop sharply in the second half of the year.

HEADLINE: From a Clan That Lives by Its Own Rules, a Tale Made for the Movies

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
The unruly extended family at the heart of ''The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia'' might have been the subject of an earnest, hand-wringing social-problem documentary. Or else an entire season of ''Cops,'' since the Whites' propensity for violence, drug use and general cussedness makes plenty of work for the authorities in Boone County, W.Va. 
 Various well-spoken local lawyers and policemen face the camera to express disapproval and offer sociological interpretations of this clan's wild behavior. But ''The Wild and Wonderful Whites,'' directed by Julien Nitzberg, is not principally about Appalachian poverty or highland folkways or the economic legacy of coal mining, even though it touches on all of those matters. Its governing spirit, captured in the raucous music that punctuates the story (including songs performed live by Hank Williams III), is one of outlaw celebration. ''Fuss and fight and party'' is more or less that family's motto -- though it has more profane variations -- and Mr. Nitzberg, in documenting the party, invites the audience to join right in. 
 Not that it's all fun and games. There is an undercurrent of desperate fatalism in the Whites' way of life, and also the omnipresent threat of deadly violence. The family patriarch, an accomplished mountain dancer known as D. Ray, was murdered on his way to a performance, a fate shared by several of his children. His son Jesco inherited D. Ray's nimble feet, and the family celebrity. ''Dancing Outlaw,'' a 1991 television documentary about Jesco (on which Mr. Nitzberg was an associate producer), made him something of a legend and the subject of several country-and-western songs.
 ''The Wild and Wonderful Whites,'' a sequel of sorts to ''Dancing Outlaw,'' spends a year with Jesco and his mother, sisters, nieces, nephews and other friends and relations, following them into and out of prisons, hospitals, rehab centers and a good many nights of drinking, pot-smoking and prescription drug abuse. A side trip is made to Minnesota, where Poney White, Jesco's only surviving brother, has escaped with his children into middle-class normalcy, making his living as a house painter and expressing relief to be far from Boone County.
 Back there, an anthology of country standards unfolds in real life and real time: murder ballads, cheating songs and rebel hollers, with an occasional pause for fatalistic spiritual meditation. The Whites -- in particular the three generations of women who are the movie's most compelling and complicated characters -- are not shy in front of the camera, and their forthrightness quiets, at least temporarily, the queasy sense of exploitation that hangs around the film. 
 It is hard to know just what to think of these people, whose unabashed recklessness might make you envious even as you shake your head in appalled amazement at their disregard for every conceivable societal norm. But one thing is certain, and is in a way the whole point of this fascinating and problematic documentary: The Whites don't care what you or anyone else thinks of them. 
 THE WILD AND WONDERFUL WHITES OF WEST VIRGINIA
 Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Julien Nitzberg; directors of photography, David Bird, Dominic Giordano and Michael Kenneth Sydenstricker II; edited by Ben Daughtrey; music by Deke Dickerson; produced by Storm Taylor and Mr. Nitzberg; released by Tribeca Film. At the Tribeca Cinemas , 54 Varick Street, at Laight Street. Running time: 1 hour 27 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Cash-Hungry States Are Putting Buildings on the Block

BYLINE: By PETER CARBONARA

 BODY:
Is it better to rent or to own? 
 The default answer for a long time -- when real estate's horizon seemed limitless -- was to own. Lately some individuals and businesses have decided that maybe owning is not always better, especially when you have other pressing needs for cash, like paying off your creditors. 
 Now the idea has spread to some states with serious debt problems. In January the state of Arizona concluded a deal to sell to investors ownership stakes worth a total of $735 million in several state-owned office buildings, arenas and other properties -- including the buildings housing both chambers of the State Legislature. Arizona will lease back the property from its new landlords, among them the mutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard, for 20 years, after which ownership will revert to the state. Arizona is planning another, smaller round of real estate sales in June. For fiscal 2011, which begins in July, the state is estimated to have a deficit of $3 billion. 
 Although it has been drowned out by hotter issues, like the uproar over the state's new immigration law, some Arizona politicians have sought to make an issue of the sale-leaseback. Dean Martin, the state's treasurer and a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor this fall, has derided the sale as a one-time gimmick used to circumvent the state's debt limit and avoid the hard choices he contends Arizona needs to make about what he calls ''unsupportable spending.'' 
 ''How many times can you sell the state capital?'' he said. 
 Mr. Martin said he wanted to repackage the state's debt as bonds and use some of the proceeds to buy back the buildings. 
 ''Who wants to make a long-term investment in a state that is renting its Capitol buildings?'' he has been asking on the campaign trail. 
 Last month California received sale-leaseback bids on a portfolio of 7.3 million square feet of office space in 11 state-owned buildings. The Golden State Portfolio includes buildings in Los Angeles and Sacramento, as well as the San Francisco Civic Center, where the state Supreme Court sits. The deal had been expected to yield about $660 million in revenue for the state, after $1.1 billion in expected proceeds were used to pay off construction bonds. California's deficit for 2010-11 is about $20 billion.
 Kevin Shannon, a vice chairman of the commercial real estate firm CB Richard Ellis, which is managing the auction for the state, said he believed the state would take in more than expected once it analyzed the bids and completed a deal, which is expected to happen by the middle of May. Mr. Shannon said the auction had produced more than 300 bids. 
 ''There's been a lot of press about this being a fire sale,'' he said, ''but we're in a competitive bidding situation.'' Mr. Shannon said demand for the properties had been greater than expected. 
 As with Arizona's leaseback, the California auction has become a political football. The state Legislature was almost unanimous in approving the plan a year ago. More recently, however, two members of state real estate boards whose approval was necessary for the sale to proceed say they were abruptly dismissed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger because they opposed the deal. They have told reporters they believe it would cost the state more in rent money than it would raise. A state Assembly committee is reviewing the matter. 
 The view that the deal does not make economic sense has been seconded by others, including the state's independent Legislative Analyst's Office, which has called the sale ''bad budgeting practice.'' 
 The leaseback continues to enjoy the support of the governor.
 ''The governor doesn't believe the state should be in the real estate business,'' said Erin Shaw, a spokeswoman for the California Department of General Services, which manages the state's property holdings. Governor Schwarzenegger said recently that he would not approve a sale if bids were too low. Previously the state shelved a proposed sale of the Orange County fairgrounds when bids came in lower than expected. 
 Besides Arizona and California, only Connecticut is conducting a sale of state office buildings.
 Connecticut, however, is seeking bids for straight-out purchases of buildings it regards as surplus rather than sale-leasebacks. The comparatively modest properties, which include the Litchfield Jail and the Bristol Armory, have attracted little attention. 
 Gordon F. DuGan, chief executive of W. P. Carey and Company, a real estate investment company that specializes in corporate sale-leaseback deals, said that if the California sale went well other states might follow. Mr. DuGan said, however, that he had not heard of any great interest in such future deals from either prospective buyers or sellers. W. P. Carey has made a bid for some of the California properties, which Mr. DuGan does not expect will be accepted. (The state has said it prefers bidders for the entire package.) 
 Mr. DuGan said bidding for the California property appeared stronger than he had expected, particularly considering that, unlike other sale-leasebacks, the California deal requires buyers to pick up the cost of services like waste hauling and security. He said that structure made the deal more appealing to bidders that, unlike his company, had big operations units. 
 The risk of drawing unwanted headlines by selling state property may be one reason the idea has yet to take hold in other states that are short on money. A few years ago a spurt in the sale of state- and city-owned infrastructure, like highways and bridges, ended amid outrage that some of these properties were being sold to foreign investors. 
 Another reason for the absence of a rush to such deals may be relatively modest proceeds for states. Dan Fasulo, chief of research at Real Capital Analytics, which tracks commercial real estate markets, said in an e-mail message, ''There are many states that look at things like this during a crisis, but at the end of the day the amount of money raised from such activities is a laughable amount when viewed from the context of the overall budget shortfalls.''

HEADLINE: Amount of Spill Could Escalate, Company Admits

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER, CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Campbell Robertson reported from New Orleans, John M. Broder from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston. Sewell Chan contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
This article is by John M. Broder, Campbell Robertson and Clifford Krauss.
 WASHINGTON -- In a closed-door briefing for members of Congress, a senior BP executive conceded Tuesday that the ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico could conceivably spill as much as 60,000 barrels a day of oil, more than 10 times the estimate of the current flow.
 The scope of the problem has grown drastically since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank into the gulf. Now, the discussion with BP on Capitol Hill is certain to intensify pressure on the company, which is facing a crisis similar to what the Toyota Motor Company had with uncontrolled acceleration -- despite its efforts to control the damage to its reputation as a corporate citizen, the problem may be worsening.
 Amid growing uncertainty about the extent of the leak, and when it might be stanched, pressure on BP intensified on multiple fronts Tuesday, from increasingly frustrated residents of the Gulf Coast to federal, state and local officials demanding more from the company. 
 The company considered a broad advertising campaign, but top BP executives rejected the idea before planning even started. ''In our view, the big glossy expressions of regret don't have a lot of credibility,'' said Andrew Gowers, a BP spokesman. 
 Instead, the company has dispatched executives to hold town meetings in the affected region, and it has turned to lower-profile social media outlets to trumpet its cleanup efforts and moves to organize volunteers.
 The Senate energy committee has summoned executives from BP and Transocean Ltd., the rig operator, as well as a number of oil industry technical experts to a hearing next week. The next day, the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing, to which top executives of BP, Transocean and Halliburton have been asked to appear, a committee spokeswoman said. 
 That panel, which will look at the possible problems leading to explosions on the rig as well as the adequacy of containment and cleanup measures, would probably be the first of several, Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan, the subcommittee chairman, said in a statement. 
 A separate federal investigation into the explosion is under way by the Coast Guard and the Minerals Management Service.
 At Tuesday's briefing, David Rainey, the BP vice president for Gulf of Mexico production, said the company was employing a variety of untried techniques to stanch the oil gushing from the well 5,000 feet below the surface.
 At the briefing, Mr. Rainey and officials from Transocean and from Halliburton, which was providing cementing services on the platform, also acknowledged that they did not know how likely it was that oil from the spill would be caught up in the so-called loop currents in the gulf and be carried through the Florida Keys into the Atlantic Ocean. ''What we heard today from BP, Halliburton and Transocean were a lot of worst-case scenarios without any best-case solutions,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who leads the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the House energy panel. 
 Federal officials have raised the possibility of a leak of more than 100,000 barrels a day if the well were to flow unchecked, but the chances of that situation occurring were unclear.
 Also on Tuesday, the company's chief executive, Tony Hayward, told Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, that the spill would clearly cause more than $75 million in economic damage, the current cap on liability for drilling accidents. 
 Mr. Nelson and the two Democratic senators from New Jersey, Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, have introduced legislation to raise that cap to $10 billion, and to make sure that the new limit applies to this spill.
 While BP continues to acknowledge its responsibility to shut off and clean up the oil, it is being barraged by government officials and civil lawyers who are redoubling efforts to ensure that the company's legal obligations are clearly defined and strictly enforced.
 Attorneys general from the five Gulf Coast states have been drafting a letter to BP that will lay out demands. In the letter, they are expected to urge BP specifically to define what is meant by its repeated statement that it intends to pay ''legitimate'' claims, a term Attorney General Troy King of Alabama said was unacceptably nebulous.
 They are also expected to press for a fund to begin paying out claims to state and local governments and to residents. 
 The attorneys general asked for the creation of such a fund in a meeting with BP officials on Sunday, and the next day BP announced that $25 million block grants were going to the four states most likely to be affected to help begin their efforts to prepare. But, Mr. King said, ''that's not going to be enough.''
 For now, weather patterns seem to be holding the giant oil slick offshore, and are expected to do so for several more days, temporarily sparing the coast -- and sparing BP the renewed criticism that would surely come with oil landfall. A containment dome is being readied to drop over the worst of the leaks.
 BP has significantly stepped up its lobbying on Capitol Hill, spending nearly $16 million in 2009, more than triple what it spent just two years before, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group.
 But that money does not sway public opinion.
 The company's top crisis managers have been dispatched to the gulf. Mr. Gowers, the BP spokesman, said the company was now ''considering some targeted advertising in the affected states'' to publicize how to make claims and how to sign up to help with the cleanup. 
 Mr. Hayward also gave a briefing on Tuesday for reporters from Gulf Coast newspapers and The Associated Press in which he said he wanted to ''win the hearts and minds'' of the people.
 Mr. Hayward has been a frequent guest on the morning news shows, with a consistent message: ''It wasn't our accident, but we are absolutely responsible for the oil, for cleaning it up.'' 
 It is a mixed message, advertising experts say.
 ''It's a situation laced with irony, and perceived hypocrisy,'' said Abbey Klaassen, executive editor of Advertising Age. ''It is a fine line between what they want to say for legal reasons and what consumers want to hear which is: 'Mea culpa. We accept responsibility, we will clean it up, and this will never happen again.' '' 
 BP is playing to a particularly skeptical and vigilant audience in the gulf, where people have become accustomed to frustrating clashes with insurance companies and government agencies in the five years since Hurricane Katrina.
 ''We're preparing for the worst,'' said Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, referring both to the spill itself and the possibility of fierce legal struggles. The state has been taking photos and video of coastal areas and counting fish and birds, he said, to have a record of what exists before the oil arrives.

HEADLINE: Ex-Senator Coats, Seeking a Return, Wins G.O.P. Primary in Indiana

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Former Senator Dan Coats won Indiana's Republican Senate primary on Tuesday, fending off a Tea Party-backed candidate in his effort to return to Capitol Hill as three states chose Congressional candidates in the intensifying 2010 primary season.
 In Ohio, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher defeated Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner for the Democratic nomination to face Rob Portman, a senior aide to President George W. Bush, in the race for an open seat now held by Republicans. The contest was so tough that Ms. Brunner said she would not campaign for Mr. Fisher if he was the party's candidate in the general election. 
 In North Carolina, Senator Richard M. Burr, a first-term Republican incumbent, easily beat back a primary challenge. The two top Democratic contenders, Secretary of State Elaine Marshall and Cal Cunningham, a former state legislator, were headed for a June 22 runoff. 
 With lawmakers in both parties bracing for anti-incumbent fervor, several House members were forced to contend with spirited preliminary challenges. But the incumbents prevailed, in what was reported to be very light turnout in the three states.
 In Indiana, Representative Dan Burton, a Republican who is in his 14th term, survived a close call. Another Indiana Republican incumbent, Mark Souder, secured his party's nomination after a tough race, as did incumbents of both parties in North Carolina. 
 The primary races were also being watched as a gauge of the influence of the Tea Party movement, which backed Senate and House candidates in several of the contests.
 In locking up the nomination, Mr. Coats, who served in the Senate from 1988 to 1998, defeated Marlin Stutzman, a businessman and state lawmaker who had strong Tea Party backing. Mr. Stutzman also received the endorsement of Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who has been anointing preferred conservative candidates. Former Representative John Hostettler finished third.
 Mr. Coats left the Senate in 1998 rather than face Evan Bayh, who was then governor, in that year's election.
 With Democrats facing a tough climate in the coming midterm elections, Mr. Coats was lured back into elected politics. He immediately came under fire for his lucrative career as a lobbyist as well as his residence away from Indiana. Mr. Bayh then made a surprising decision to retire, leaving an unexpected opening in the Democratic field.
 As a result, Mr. Coats is expected to face Representative Brad Ellsworth, who is in line to be named by the state Democratic committee as the replacement for Mr. Bayh, whose abrupt departure did not allow other Democrats time to get on Tuesday's ballot.
 In remarks after winning the primary, Mr. Coats made clear that he intended to strike very conservative themes on spending, the scope of government and national security while trying to tie Mr. Ellsworth to President Obama and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
 ''We are going to confront Congressman Ellsworth and his liberal Washington allies,'' Mr. Coats told a rally in Indianapolis..
 Democrats called Mr. Coats a flawed candidate. They plan to focus on his lobbying career and to try to portray him as a Washington insider in a year when that label is predicted to be a disadvantage. 
 In a statement, Mr. Ellsworth sought to drive the point home without naming Mr. Coats. ''I'll keep working for everyday Hoosiers and their priorities and not the big special interest lobbyists in Washington,'' he said.
 In Ohio, Democrats sought to remind voters of the role Mr. Portman, the Republican candidate for Senate, played in the Bush years.
 ''Rob Portman created the economic mess we are in,'' said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
 National Republicans accused Mr. Fisher, the Democratic candidate, of abandoning his state duties to campaign for the seat.
 Democrats consider Mr. Burr, the North Carolina Republican, to be among the Republicans incumbents they might be able to threaten in an election season predicted to be favorable to Republicans, as the party out of power. 
 The pace of primaries is accelerating as states move to establish their general election ballots. On May 18, high-profile Senate primaries will be held in Kentucky, Arkansas and Pennsylvania, along with some closely-watched House contests.

HEADLINE: On Hill, Geithner Makes The Case for a Bank Tax

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, urged Congress on Tuesday to impose a 10-year, $90 billion tax on the largest financial institutions to recoup the costs of the 2008 bailouts. But he faced skeptical questions from lawmakers on the structure and purpose of the fee.
 The Obama administration proposed the tax, which it calls the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, in January, amid public anger over the bank bailouts. The tax is not part of the overhaul of financial regulations being debated by the Senate. 
 At a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Tuesday, officials from the American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Roundtable sharply criticized the proposal. While lawmakers did not reject the idea outright, some questioned its impact on consumers and small businesses, as well as the timing. 
 ''This is a simple and fair principle: banks, not the taxpayer, should pay for bank failures,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''And this is a principle with ample historical precedent.'' 
 After the savings-and-loan crisis in the 1980s, Congress required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to recoup the costs of closing failed banks through assessments on other banks. And the Democratic regulatory bill in the Senate would require the largest financial institutions to finance government-sponsored dissolution if one of them failed. 
 Even so, the math of the new tax proposal is complicated. Banks have largely repaid their share of the bailouts, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and taxpayers are expected to actually make a profit from the federal rescue. In contrast, other recipients of aid from the program -- notably General Motors, Chrysler, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- might never be able to repay and would not be affected by the fee.
 ''It's no surprise that bank institutions are not enthusiastic about the proposal,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee. 
 ''We need to understand the best way to design the tax so that it's fair and achieves its purpose,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''We need to understand who should pay the tax, and we need to understand the impact the tax would have on small businesses and the economy.'' 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the committee, called the fee an excise tax, as he did in a previous hearing, and urged that the proceeds from a tax be used to reduce the deficit, suggesting that he was open to the notion. 
 ''I completely agree that taxpayers should be paid back every penny of TARP losses,'' Mr. Grassley said, while adding that the bailout legislation called for calculating those losses in 2013, not now. 
 Mr. Grassley added: ''If a TARP tax is imposed and the money is simply spent, that doesn't repay taxpayers one cent for TARP losses. It's just more tax-and-spend big government, while taxpayers foot the bill for Washington's out-of-control spending.'' 
 As proposed, the fee would apply to financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets and that were eligible for an array of emerging assistance programs, including the TARP and lending programs set up by the F.D.I.C. and the Federal Reserve. American subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks would also be covered. 
 The fee would be highest on those institutions that engage in risky activities and have less stable sources of financing. Companies would pay a fixed percentage of their risk-weighted assets, minus capital, insured deposits and certain insurance policy reserves. Derivatives and off-balance-sheet items not otherwise reflected in conventional accounting would be included. 
 Mr. Geithner said that more than 99 percent of American banks, which he said provide most small loans to businesses and farms, would not be covered by the tax. Indeed, he said that the Congressional Budget Office had noted that the proposal ''would improve the competitive position of small- and medium-size banks, probably leading to some increase in their share of the loan market.'' 
 Under questioning, Mr. Geithner said of the fee: ''You can think of it as a 'too big to fail' tax, a leverage tax, a tax on risk. But its purpose, of course, primary purpose, is to meet the legal obligation of law to cover the fiscal cost of TARP.'' 
 Last month, the International Monetary Fund called for the world's wealthiest nations to impose taxes on giant banks to recoup the costs of bailouts and to curb systemic risks. But at a meeting of finance ministers from the G-20 nations, there was no consensus on the taxes. 
 The Senate hearing elicited much suspicion of Wall Street, from both sides of the aisle. 
 ''The question I have is the degree to which banks could game this,'' Mr. Grassley said. ''I'm no banker, but bankers are pretty clever. We've seen that over the last couple of years.'' 
 Steve Bartlett, president and chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, said that the proposal was premature.
 The cost of TARP are not yet clear, Mr. Bartlett said, and the fee could harm the international competitiveness of American financial companies. In addition, he said, the tax code is not the best way to address financial risks.
 ''The fee would reduce the total supply of credit in the financial system,'' he said.
 James Chessen, chief economist for the American Bankers Association, told the committee: ''Large banks will clearly bear the brunt should any bank tax be applied, but the consequences go well beyond the largest banks and will likely affect community banks' funding costs and the ultimate borrowing costs for their customers.''

HEADLINE: Bill Drops Fund to Shut Failed Banks

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Leaders of the Senate Banking Committee said Tuesday that they had reached an agreement to limit the likelihood that big banks would be bailed out by taxpayers. But liberal Democrats said they also would push aggressively for an array of proposals that could force some of the nation's biggest banks to reduce their size.
 The tentative agreement to limit the chances of future bailouts came as the Senate delayed for another day its initial votes on amendments to legislation to address the causes of the 2008 financial crisis. 
 Aides to the committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and the panel's senior Republican, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, said the two senators had agreed to scuttle a $50 billion fund proposed by Democrats. 
 The fund, which was opposed by the Obama administration, drew criticism from Republicans who had warned that it would promote rather than prevent taxpayer bailouts of failed financial companies.
 Under the deal, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would finance the liquidation of failed financial companies, using a new credit line with the Treasury Department backed by the failed company's assets. The money would be recouped later through the sale of assets, with shareholders and creditors forced to take losses.
 Mr. Dodd said he was confident that some important disagreements had been resolved, and would perhaps put to rest any further debate on how to prevent companies from being branded too big to fail. 
 ''I'm satisfied, as I believe my colleague from Alabama is, that we've reached an agreement on the too-big-to-fail provisions,'' Mr. Dodd said on the floor.
 Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, has also proposed an amendment making clear that taxpayers should not pay for future bailouts of failing financial companies, and essentially requiring that the government liquidate assets and put such companies out of business. That amendment is also expected to win bipartisan support.
 But some liberal Democrats are still readying amendments that are intended to go much further than the agreement reached between Mr. Dodd and Mr. Shelby, including an amendment that would force some of the largest financial companies, including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, to substantially reduce their size.
 That amendment, proposed by Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator Ted Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware, would limit the size of banks holding federally insured deposits to no more than 10 percent of the nation's deposits. And it would limit nondeposit liabilities of banks to no more than 2 percent of gross domestic product.
 Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, voiced his support on Tuesday for the Brown-Kaufman proposal.
 While the deal between Mr. Dodd and Mr. Shelby seemed to put to rest a loud partisan dispute in recent weeks over whether the legislation might somehow perpetuate taxpayer bailouts, it also highlighted that the definition of a ''taxpayer bailout'' is in many ways a question of semantics.
 The proposed $50 billion fund, which was to be financed by a tax on big banks, was a means to avoid using taxpayer money to wind down failed financial companies. The F.D.I.C. similarly levies an assessment on banks, which it uses to help pay for bank failures.
 Some Republicans had objected to the creation of a new $50 billion fund; Mr. Shelby, for instance, repeatedly derided as a ''honey pot'' that might get misappropriated for other purposes.
 As Senate leaders worked to broker agreements that would allow for the first floor votes in the financial regulation debate, Mr. Dodd said that there were numerous amendments already put forward that could easily win bipartisan support.
 Among them was an amendment proposed by Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, to change the way the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation calculates how much banks must pay for deposit insurance.
 Assessments for the deposit insurance fund are currently calculated as a percentage of a bank's domestic deposits. Mr. Tester's amendment calls for the assessments to be based on a bank's liabilities -- essentially any insured deposits plus other borrowings by the bank.
 That would result in the biggest banks, which raise less of their capital from insured depositors, paying higher amounts into the insurance fund than they currently do.
 Mr. Dodd said he supported the amendment, which he said was ''fundamentally about fairness.''
 ''The change will help to ease the burden of F.D.I.C. assessments on our community banks by requiring the largest banks in the country to shoulder a little more of the responsibility to rebuild and maintain a sound deposit insurance fund,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Says New Sanctions May Ruin Relations With U.S.

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran said Tuesday that relations with the United States might never be repaired if new sanctions were imposed against his country, that the United Nations atomic agency had no authority to poke its nose into matters like missiles and that despite his contested re-election last year, Iran had not become a republic of fear. 
 While Tehran has been generally opposed to improving relations with Washington, maintaining its hostility as a cornerstone of the Islamic revolution of 1979, Mr. Ahmadinejad suggested that the Obama administration was the last hope for the United States. 
 ''Mr. Obama is the biggest and last opportunity that the United States has to improve its image in the world,'' he said in a 40-minute interview. ''If this opportunity is not used well, it will not present itself again.'' 
 Later in the day, he suggested that relations with Tehran might never recover from a United States push for new economic and military sanctions against Iran through the United Nations Security Council. New penalties would ''mean relations between Iran and the U.S. will never be improved again,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said at a news conference. 
 Iran faces a fourth round of Security Council sanctions being negotiated now over its lack of cooperation on its nuclear program, but Mr. Ahmadinejad maintained that his country would be able to withstand any new sanctions, as it had in the past. 
 He accused the International Atomic Energy Agency of wandering well outside its mandate in raising questions about missile design and other military matters.
 ''The agency has no right to intervene in the missile program of any country,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said in the interview. ''What does that have to do with the purview of the agency?'' he added, calling it another ''imperfection'' in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. 
 Yukiya Amano, the director general of the I.A.E.A., told the opening session of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty review conference here on Monday that his agency ''remains unable to confirm that all nuclear material is in peaceful activities because Iran has not provided the necessary cooperation.''
 A February report from his agency said that Iran needed to ''clarify the production of nuclear related equipment and components by companies related to the defense industry.'' Among the outstanding questions was one about engineering design and computer modeling of the payload chamber for missiles. 
 ''The N.P.T. does not mention missiles,'' said Mr. Ahmadinejad, making a rare appearance by a head of state at the nuclear treaty review conference held every five years. ''That is a separate subject.''
 Foreign ministers and other senior diplomats had voiced concern that the Iran issue would dominate the monthlong negotiations, but they said the conference was quickly focusing on the three main pillars of the 40-year-old treaty: arms cuts, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and the civilian uses of nuclear power. 
 Negotiators noted with satisfaction that Indonesia had announced that it would seek ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Indonesia is one of the key countries with a nuclear program needed for the treaty to go into affect. 
 On issues away from the conference, Mr. Ahmadinejad denied that a crackdown on anti-government protestors had engendered fear or that it had pushed Iranians to flee the country. 
 ''Who is afraid inside Iran?'' he said, calling support for the Islamic revolution stronger than it has been in a decade. 
 With regard to three young American hikers jailed in Iran, Mr. Ahmadinejad repeated his position that he would like to see them free, as well as some seven Iranians he said were incarcerated in the United States. ''We are working to release all of the prisoners,'' he said. The future of the Americans, he said, was up to the courts. 
 Family members of the three Americans -- Sarah E. Shourd, Shane M. Bauer and Joshua F. Fattal -- maintain that they crossed the Iranian frontier by accident while hiking in Kurdistan last summer. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad took a slightly harder line on the question of Robert Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent who disappeared while on a business trip to Iran three years ago. 
 ''We were told that he was an official representative of the U.S. government, that he was an F.B.I agent,'' said Mr. Ahmadinejad, raising the question of what Mr. Levinson might have been doing on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf while not confirming that Iran knew his whereabouts.
 ''It is generally hard to predict the activities and whereabouts of intelligence officers. They can be in a hundred different places in the world in a very short period of time.''

HEADLINE: Japanese Leader Backtracks On Revising Base Agreement

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and HIROKO TABUCHI; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Backtracking on a prominent campaign pledge, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama told angry residents of Okinawa on Tuesday that it was unrealistic to expect the United States to move its entire Marine Corps air base off the island. 
 Mr. Hatoyama's government could hang in the balance. He has pledged to come up with a plan by the end of this month to relocate the Marine air base and resolve a stubborn problem that has created months of discord with Washington. His delays and apparent flip-flopping on the issue have fed a growing feeling of disappointment in the prime minister's leadership, driving his approval ratings below 30 percent. 
 Visiting Okinawa for the first time since becoming prime minister, Mr. Hatoyama asked residents to entertain a compromise that would keep some of the functions of the base on the island while the government explored moving some facilities elsewhere. 
 ''Realistically speaking, it is impossible'' to move the entire base, called Futenma, off the island, he said. ''We're facing a situation that is realistically difficult to move everything out of the prefecture. We must ask the people of Okinawa to share the burden.''
 But Okinawans seemed in no mood for burden-sharing, heckling him after he met with local officials. ''Shame on you!'' one man shouted.
 During the campaign for last summer's election, in which his Democratic Party dislodged the Liberal Democrats who had ruled Japan almost continuously for more than 50 years, Mr. Hatoyama called for adjusting a 2006 agreement with the United States, which stations about 50,000 troops in Japan. Under that plan, Futenma was to be moved to a less crowded part of Okinawa to address local concerns over noise, air pollution and safety. 
 But the Obama administration pushed back, with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates apparently refusing to entertain any thought of reopening the agreement. The standoff threatened to open the first breach in the two countries' post-World War II security alliance. Later, during a trip to Japan, President Obama smoothed things over, reluctantly agreeing to consider Mr. Hatoyama's proposals. 
 While Mr. Hatoyama has tried to accommodate the competing desires of the Americans and local residents, he finally had to admit that it could not be done. On Tuesday, Mr. Hatoyama had the unpleasant task of delivering the bad news, acknowledging that moving the base off Okinawa was unrealistic.
 ''When we consider the presence of North Korea and the state of the wider region, it is clear that we must maintain the Japan-U.S. alliance as a deterrent force, and that we must ask Okinawa to bear some of that burden,'' he said after the meeting with local leaders.
 ''It has become clear from our negotiations with the Americans that we cannot ask them to relocate the base to too far-flung a location,'' he said.
 Mr. Hatoyama still has not divulged the specifics of his plan. But it is widely expected that it will involve the small island of Tokunoshima, where since January, when word got out, residents have marshaled their resources for a fight. 
 Tokunoshima, a small, semitropical island located between Okinawa and Japan's main islands and blanketed with fields of sugar cane, was mentioned as a possible site for training activities and up to 1,000 of Futenma's 2,500 Marines, said Takeshi Tokuda, the island's representative in the lower house of Parliament, who was briefed on the plan. 
 But enraged islanders vowed that the move would never happen. ''If he comes, our old people and mothers with children will sit in the street to block his way,'' Seiichi Yoshitama, 65, a coffee farmer, said of Mr. Hatoyama. ''We'll even use our fighting bulls to stop him.''
 They have held a series of increasingly large anti-base rallies, the largest on April 18, when more than half of the island's 26,000 residents gathered, organizers said. 
 The mood on Tokunoshima is now overwhelmingly against the plan. The main road along the coast is lined with hand-painted signs saying ''No Base!'' The mayors of the island's three towns agreed on Saturday to meet with the prime minister, but only to express their opposition in person, they say. 
 On Tokunoshima, as opposed to Okinawa, the opposition is driven by more than just a simple case of not-in-my-backyard syndrome, political experts and local residents say. The islanders say they do not want to end up like Okinawa, where there is widespread discontent over the American bases' crime and noise. Older residents also have bitter memories of the war and its aftermath, when islanders staged hunger strikes against the American occupiers. 
 Residents and experts say Mr. Hatoyama's troubles also reflect a weakening of Tokyo's ability to impose its will on Japan's regions. The Liberal Democratic Party relied on generous public works spending and back-room bargains to push through big projects like this one. Mr. Hatoyama, who rode to power with vows to cut wasteful spending and increase transparency in politics, may find his ability to make deals thwarted by such changes. 
 ''It's all more fluid now at the end of the L.D.P. era,'' said Akira Okubo, mayor of Isen, one of Tokunoshima's towns. ''The center is weakening in Japan, and that gives us more freedom at the fringes.'' 
 Not all islanders are against the base. A group of business owners led by Hidetada Maeda, an undertaker and former town council chairman in Amagi, another of Tokunoshima's towns, released a list last week of incentives for accepting the base. They included subsidies for tourism and forgiveness of the $250 million debt of the island's towns. 
 ''This is a one-in-a-thousand chance to revitalize our island,'' said Mr. Maeda, 62. 
 Most islanders, however, said they did not want economic incentives, which they said would only make their island dependent on Tokyo. ''Once you start accepting that development money, it becomes addictive, like a drug,'' said Koichi Tokuda, who owns a factory that makes vinegar from sugar cane. ''We are not rich, but we are self-sufficient. We want to stay that way.''

HEADLINE: Paterson Gives Albany a Choice: Furloughs or a Shutdown

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. David A. Paterson escalated his battle with the Legislature over the state's financial crisis on Tuesday, saying that lawmakers could give him the authority to furlough more than 100,000 state employees or face the prospect of shutting down New York's government. 
 Though Mr. Paterson is calling for workers to be furloughed for a single day, he warned that he would continue pressing for furloughs until the Legislature agrees to a deal on the state budget, which is more than a month late with no resolution in sight. 
 Mr. Paterson asked the Senate and the Assembly to approve furloughs in a bill he submitted last week. But because the Legislature has refused to put the measure to a vote, he said, he would include furloughs in the next emergency spending bill. Since the budget deadline expired on March 31, there have been five such bills passed to keep the government running.
 The governor's announced intention has raised the stakes considerably. Because the state's Constitution severely limits the ability of the Legislature to amend budget bills, lawmakers will face a choice between approving furloughs and rejecting the emergency bill. 
 ''We're taking an extreme effort now to make sure that we reach a resolution,'' Mr. Paterson said at a news conference, ''because we are more and more sinking into a deficit situation that we may not be able to ameliorate, and I'm not just going to sit around and let this situation overwhelm the taxpayers of New York.''
 The sixth emergency bill issued by Mr. Paterson would require one day of furlough for state employees during the work week beginning May 17, saving the state about $30 million. The Legislature is expected to vote on the bill on Monday. If the bill is rejected, state agencies would not be able to spend money after May 9. 
 Mr. Paterson's move places him on a collision course with unions representing public employees. Union leaders quickly assailed the proposal and said they did not believe that their collective bargaining agreements with the state could be modified through legislation. 
 Some lawmakers supported the union leaders.
 Danny Donohue, the president of the state's largest union of public employees, the Civil Service Employees Association, stopped short of threatening legal action but said in a statement that Mr. Paterson was ''mistaken in his belief that creating more chaos and crisis is leadership.''
 The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has previously said that he did not believe the furloughs would be legal. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, he did not say if the Assembly would pass the new emergency bill but argued that if Mr. Paterson, as manager of the state's work force, had the power to furlough employees, it did not matter what the Legislature did. 
 ''If it's not legal, we can't make it legal, and if it is legal, the governor does not need the Legislature to do it,'' Mr. Silver said.
 John L. Sampson, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said that although he believed the furloughs were illegal, he would vote for the bill and urge fellow Democrats to do so because there was no other choice. ''The bottom line is, I am not going to shut government down,'' Mr. Sampson said.
 Administration officials said they needed the Legislature's approval to rewrite the statute that details what government workers are paid, separate from any question over the state's contracts with the unions. 
 Even if the Legislature does approve the bill, however, Mr. Paterson's plan may face a court challenge. Courts in other states have said, in some cases, that furloughs were illegal, ruling that they violated collective bargaining agreements by unilaterally reducing wages and salaries.
 Mr. Paterson's push for furloughs reflects how protracted and fruitless the budget negotiations with the Legislature have become. 
 Senate Democrats, whose most vulnerable seats this fall are in districts where anger over property taxes is high, have balked at any budget deal that does not include hundreds of millions of dollars in property tax rebates for homeowners. Democrats in the Assembly want to restore significant portions of Mr. Paterson's cuts to education and health care, using billions in new state borrowing.
 But Mr. Paterson is also seeking to address a different, unresolved issue: the $250 million in unspecified state work force savings that the governor proposed in his executive budget but has been unable to wring from public employees' unions.
 Mr. Paterson's hands have been tied in part because he agreed last year not to lay off state workers through the end of 2010, in exchange for the Legislature's agreement to create a new pension tier that would save New York money over the long term.
 But that has also stripped him of the leverage that governors have traditionally used to pry concessions from public employees' unions during tight fiscal times. As a result, the unions have refused to embrace proposals from Mr. Paterson, including requests for workers to give up 4 percent raises scheduled for this year.

HEADLINE: As the Oil Slick Spreads a Stain on the Gulf

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Spill vs. a Need to Drill'' (Week in Review, May 2) asserts, ''The country needs the oil.'' It's a perversely comforting assumption. Surely we wouldn't tolerate oil spills and climate disruption if we had practical alternatives to fossil fuel dependence.
 But the comfort is false and dilatory. It diverts attention from America's chronic failure to adopt a serious energy and climate policy. 
 The writer cites an American Enterprise Institute fellow who contends that clean energy is ''decades away.'' Many alternatives to oil exploration -- especially greater fuel efficiency -- are available and economical today. Others await an affirmative national policy to accelerate their development.
 What stands between America and a clean energy transition is not ''decades''; it is the fossil fuel lobby's success in prolonging our oil and coal dependence by blocking policy reform. The Gulf disaster should eradicate any lingering doubt about the moral and economic imperative to overcome that obstacle.
 K. C. Golden Policy Director, Climate Solutions Seattle, May 2, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Recent coal mine accidents and the explosion on BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico deliver a message. It is the need to recognize modern society's insatiable demand for energy and the importance of setting a course toward an ample-energy future without increasingly technically difficult and even dangerous exploitation patterns.
 Accidents in ever-deeper coal mines and oil wells bored three miles into a seabed beneath a mile of Gulf water show how demand for energy pushes energy companies toward, and sometimes beyond, the frontiers of technical feasibility. Yet swaths of shallow continental shelf waters remain restricted from drilling, and coal remains the baseline electrical energy source of choice since the expansion of nuclear power seems caught in an endless political morass.
 The need for more nuclear power generation and the opening of more accessible areas to petroleum exploitation should be lessons from these accidents.
 John J. Kohout III Alexandria, Va., May 2, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Government Criticizes BP for Response to Oil Spill'' (front page, May 1):
 BP filed a 2009 plan that, according to your article, said ''it was highly unlikely that a spill or leak would ever result'' from the Deepwater Horizon rig.
 Did BP and government planners not learn, along with the rest of us, the merciless lesson of the ''black swan''? This term, popularized during the financial meltdown, signifies a high-impact event that is both rare and hard to predict -- for example, the collapse of a drilling rig and then the failure of its crucial blowout preventer.
 I learned in business school that a true strategy is a plan that accounts for every known possible outcome, including the rarest. If we plan only for ''likely'' events, we invite a rude comeuppance.
 Here is another black swan. And millions of other birds, animals, livelihoods and precious natural resources will get blackened as well.
 Peggy A. Willens Brooklyn, May 1, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''In Gulf Spill, Marshes Face a New Threat'' (front page, May 2):
 Birds have always had an extraordinary capacity to fire the human imagination. Their beauty and variety are remarkable, but it is the power of flight that humans have always found magical -- and enviable. That is why oil spills that devastate large bird populations are the most heartbreaking of all environmental catastrophes.
 To see creatures suddenly robbed of the freedom to fly is both an assault on the natural order and an assault on our most primal fantasies. If negligence and greed are found to be contributing factors to the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, our sadness and shame should be all the greater.
 David Hayden Wilton, Conn., May 2, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''A Spill of Our Own,'' by Lisa Margonelli (Op-Ed, May 2): I would like to suggest a few measures to reduce the risks inherent in petroleum production.
 Oil companies should not be allowed to drill for oil until they develop technology capable of cleaning up a worst-case spill. Imported oil should be taxed in accordance with the protective measures in place in the country of origin. Any oil spill anywhere should result in a proportional tax on all oil that would be spent on nonfossil sources of energy.
 And, of course, companies responsible for oil spills should be held liable for all losses to other industries as well as damage to the environment.

HEADLINE: After Day of Calm, Anxiety Returns to Europe's Markets

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Dan Bilefsky and David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Europe's nervous markets were calmed, at last, on Monday after the European Union and the International Monetary Fund broke their logjam and approved a long-delayed financial rescue package for Greece. But then Tuesday came, and that poise vanished.
 Instead of fixing Europe's problems, the deal seemed only to worsen them on Tuesday. Stock markets across Europe plunged and the euro was beaten down to its lowest level against the dollar in a year. 
 The tumbling markets were taken as a sign of worry among investors about whether the bailout package, worth 110 billion euros ($146 billion), would be enough to help Greece pay its debts, assuming the plan is approved by skeptical national legislatures.
 Anxiety persists, also, over whether the country's austerity measures might tip it into catastrophic recession and whether other indebted European nations might also need to be bailed out. The growing fear is that the loss of investor confidence plaguing Greece will spread, despite efforts by Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Washington to contain it.
 ''There is obviously ongoing uncertainty about the newly revised I.M.F.-E.U. rescue package for Greece and whether that can contain the contagion,'' said Ruth Stroppiana, chief international economist at Moody's.
 On Tuesday the rout was again centered on Greece, whose stock market fell 6.7 percent. Ominously, though, it spread around the heavily indebted fringes of the Continent, including Spain, where stocks plunged 5.4 percent. Even in Britain, which has a general election on Thursday, investors sold off stocks in droves.
 The jitters also jumped across the Atlantic to the United States, which until recently had been perceived as comfortably distant from the financial troubles in Europe. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.02 percent, to 10,926.77, on Tuesday, its lowest level in nearly a month.
 Investors battered the euro, the currency shared by 16 nations and often seen as a barometer of confidence in the European economy. At the end of trading it was worth just above $1.30, down considerably from its record high of $1.60 in July 2008 but still well off its low of 83 cents in 2000.
 There are growing concerns that the crisis could turn into a full-blown European banking disaster that could choke off credit to businesses and consumers at a time when the European economy is still fragile.
 For the first time since markets were jolted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, distress seemed to return to money markets, analysts said, where banks borrow short-term financing. The analysts pointed to a small but significant rise in interbank rates like Libor and in cross-currency basis swaps, which companies use to borrow in different currencies.
 ''There are some stress indicators, and one or two are flashing yellow,'' said Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura in New York. ''Relative to where we were post-Lehman, this is innocuous, but it is starting to happen.''
 Rating agencies are warning that European banks could come under pressure. The banks are big holders of government debt, and their loan losses could mount as economies stagnate.
 On Tuesday, the Greek finance ministry said it would dedicate $15 billion from the bailout program to a fund providing extra capital for its banks, Bloomberg News reported. Nevertheless, an index of the top 12 Greek banking stocks fell 10 percent.
 ''A lot of French and German banks have Greek bonds,'' said Kevin Chau, a currency analyst with IDEAglobal in New York. ''If they default it is not going to look good. So there is a fear that these banks may default. It starts a whole financial contagion. It will start to snowball.''
 Governments have built up mountains of debt rescuing their banks and providing stimulus money to their economies over the last two years. That has left financial markets questioning whether heavily indebted countries in Europe can meet their pressing debt obligations.
 Although Greece's problems have dominated the headlines, the crisis would take on another dimension if it were to spread to Spain, which has a much bigger economy. On Tuesday there were signs it was doing just that.
 At a news conference in Brussels, the Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, rejected the idea that his country -- which is headed into a second year of recession with a soaring budget deficit and an unemployment rate of 20 percent -- might require a Greek-style bailout.
 ''That's something I would not give any credit to,'' Mr. Zapatero said. ''It is complete madness.''
 But his statements did not seem to reassure the markets. As European stock markets erased the gains they had built up this year, European government bond yields rose -- in Portugal, for example, yields on two-year government notes rose to about 4.5 percent, up from less than 2 percent in January.
 As the problems in Europe rippled through United States stock markets, the crisis seemed to be entering a potentially more dangerous phase, one that could have ramifications for American businesses and consumers.
 Robert C. Hockett, a professor at the Cornell University Law School, said the European crisis could be good news for the United States in the short term as investors flee Europe, making credit more freely available for American borrowers.
 But further out, he said, it could spell trouble as a stronger dollar makes United States exports more expensive abroad. That could hamper the recovery here.
 ''If this turns into a classic contagion about sovereign debt rather than just Greek or European debt at some point American sovereign debt may be targeted,'' he said.
 Michael T. Darda, an economist at MKM Partners, said that so far equity markets rather than debt markets had borne the brunt of investor nervousness.
 ''Despite the recent rise, Libor and interest rate swap spreads remain well within normal levels and thus do not suggest to us an imminent problem in the corporate bond market,'' he wrote. ''However, the recent rise should not be ignored either, so we will continue to watch these indicators carefully.''

HEADLINE: Providing Loans Based on Cash Flow, Not Credit Score

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
With the recession having left many banks reluctant to lend, small businesses have struggled to find other sources of credit. One intriguing alternative is On Deck Capital, which promises to revolutionize lending to small businesses.
 Traditional banks, says Mitch Jacobs, On Deck's founder and chief executive, know so little about their small-business borrowers that it scares them off. 
 On Deck, by contrast, says it scours ''the cloud'' for the vast information trail that every business now leaves to develop a clear understanding of a potential client's creditworthiness. It seeks businesses with positive cash flow, ideally from a lot of small-ticket transactions. 
 It takes no collateral, and -- here's the biggest difference between On Deck and traditional lenders -- the loan is repaid automatically with daily deductions from the borrower's bank account. 
 The capital does not come cheap: the annualized interest rates can reach as high as 36 percent. Since opening in 2007, On Deck has made 2,000 short-term loans, putting $60 million in the hands of small-business owners, typically in increments of less than $30,000. A condensed version of a conversation with Mr. Jacobs follows.
 Q.If the credit markets were functioning the way they should, would there still be a place for On Deck?
 A. There's been trouble in credit on Main Streets for decades. In 2006, when we launched the company and liquidity was everywhere, over five million Main Street small businesses were declined for credit because of a low personal credit score. Several million of those have the cash-flow stability in their businesses to be able to service a loan, but the existing system doesn't detect that.
 Q.What information does On Deck look for?
 A. The full picture. What cash is coming in, what cash is going out? What is the pattern and stability of their customer activity? How diversified is their customer base? The fundamental building blocks are their online banking information, their payment processing information, and their accounting information -- 60 percent of our users today have QuickBooks. 
 Q.Do you continue to collect data about businesses after they have paid off their loans?
 A. If they ask us to. Because they then are credit-ready the next time they need capital.
 Q.Is this like revolving credit, then, or a credit card?
 A. No. It's very important that when a small business borrows for the purpose of some type of equipment replacement, inventory or marketing that they pay down the capital in the time period that they are using the money. Otherwise, they won't be able to borrow again the next time. 
 A lot of people think if you've purchased a refrigeration unit that has a five-year lifespan, then you should have a five-year loan. But that's the wrong way to look at it. The question is: what's the next big-ticket purchase and when is that going to come up? 
 Q.But the interest rate you charge is pretty high, right?
 A. The average right now is in the low 20s. It's consistently below 30 percent.
 Q.How much of that does On Deck keep?
 A. Actually, the way we designed the program, businesses pay us a fee of $500 and up to act as a virtual director of finance. One of the advantages that we have is that, since we validate all of the information electronically, we are able to share with the business owners where their strengths and weaknesses are and provide a significant amount of what would be called technical assistance. They pay us for the On Deck service, and then we pass through the cost of the capital from the market to the borrower.
 Q.What might a business learn from you?
 A. From a cash-flow standpoint, just as an example, we're providing them with ranking information -- where they stand in comparison to similar businesses in their industry. And also when it looks like the rate at which their cash is going out is greater than the rate at which the cash is coming in.
 Q.Couldn't they just look at their checking account to see whether the cash going out is greater than the cash coming in?
 A. The business owner may not have really studied, on an ongoing basis, the cash-flow trends in their business, and they're also not aware of at which point the cash-flow profile of their business might concern a source of capital.
 Q.Studies show that a business is more likely to fail if it has more credit card debt, owing to the high interest rate. But On Deck's interest rates are often higher still. What does that say about the outlook for your customers?
 A. Our businesses have on average a million dollars of revenue, and what you and I are talking about right now is a $2,000 difference, if that, at the max, on a $30,000 loan. So everyone needs to stop talking about optical interest rates on short-duration, small-dollar transactions, because it is resulting in businesses not getting access to capital that they can much more than afford.
 Q.But a lot of these businesses are going to be low-margin businesses, where every thousand dollars is a lot of money.
 A. We're working with businesses that have a significant amount of cash flow, and they wouldn't be qualified for our program if they didn't have it. 
 Q.How often do your borrowers default?
 A.. Toward the tail end of 2008, we had a peak in the loss performance of the portfolio. But it's never crossed 10 percent, and typically it operates well below that. 
 Q.Payday lenders and credit card lenders often say that their loans are expensive because the borrowers are risky, and the cost of their loans reflects that risk. Why are your loans so expensive?
 A. There is a misperception about the risk, but in order to dislodge capital from underlying capital sources, the pricing of the risk is in line with their requirements.
 Q.You clearly have a higher loss rate than banks do on commercial loans. What's the misperception?
 A. We've got large pockets of businesses that consistently show very low loss rates; we've got other business groups in the middle and others that show higher loss rates. The On Deck system is helping to parse out the different populations of businesses, and they will be able to access lower and lower-cost capital as there's more history and more businesses in the system. 
 Q.Presumably, if the loans weren't risky, you wouldn't need to collect a payment every day.
 A. The daily automated system of collection provides a few different benefits, one of which is to reduce the risk of serving this marketplace. It also makes it easier for the business, and it also helps the business get out of debt faster so that it can take on the next challenge.
 Q.Where do you get the capital to lend out?
 A. We have a series of family offices, institutions and hedge funds that provide capital. We've created the pipe for them to be able to reach the small borrowers that they've never been able to reach before.
 Q.It seems what you're talking about is a transfer of wealth from poor people to wealthy people. Isn't there a way to find different sources of capital?
 A. One of our objectives is to create a sustainable and scalable availability of capital for Main Street. If we had gone and gotten a $5 million grant, we'd have tapped out 1,700 small businesses ago. We didn't want to do that. We wanted to solve this problem once and for all.

HEADLINE: At Hotels, Making Wi-Fi as Standard as a Bed

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
FOR Yael Smadja and business travelers like her, a Wi-Fi connection in a hotel is nonnegotiable. 
 ''Reliable Wi-Fi service is absolutely critical for me. I have come to expect it as naturally as a telephone in the room,'' said Ms. Smadja, the president of Smadja & Associates USA, part of a Geneva-based family firm that manages worldwide economic seminars. 
 The demand for Wi-Fi was never more insistent than last month, when volcanic ash caused a six-day shutdown of air service in Europe and affected millions of business travelers around the world. Many of them, like Ms. Smadja, who was in Asia trying to get to Switzerland, used their hotel rooms as a base while they scrambled online to make alternate travel arrangements. 
 The days when business travelers routinely fretted about the availability of Internet connections in hotels are gone, or rapidly fading. Even business travelers who are bereft of Internet access know that Wi-Fi hot spots can be easily found on sites like the WiFi Alliance's hot spot finder (wi-fi.jiwire.com), which lists tens of thousands of free and pay access locations around the world.
 If a hotel connection is unsatisfactory or unavailable, and finding a nearby hot spot isn't feasible, there are other options. Business travelers going by car -- as many do on shorter trips -- can usually find high-speed connections for around $10 at Interstate truck stops, which often provide desktop work spaces as well. 
 Also, growing numbers of travelers carry smartphones that can use either Wi-Fi or cellular connections to reach the Internet. Others carry an AirCard, a small modem that can link laptops to the Internet using cellular networks and fills in when standard Wi-Fi isn't available. (Many cellular providers charge $40 to $60 for AirCard service plans.)
 Still, in recent years, most hotels have heeded the message that business travelers require Wi-Fi access -- no excuses accepted. While many convention and luxury hotels still impose a daily charge for access, most midlevel hotels and even many budget-price hotels now provide it free. And corporate travel managers are pushing hard for all hotels to provide free access, pointing out that customers, especially younger ones, live in a world where free Wi-Fi is expected.
 Moreover, despite the mild travel recovery under way, hotels no longer have the degree of pricing power that they had in years immediately preceding the recession. Corporate travel managers are in a strong bargaining position, even with big four-star-level convention hotels that have always charged for Wi-Fi access.
 ''When the recession occurred, it appeared that convention hotels were still dug in, seeing Wi-Fi charges as a continuing source of revenue,'' said Carl Schneider, the founder of GuestRights, an online membership program providing customer-service feedback for hotel managers. ''They seemed to feel they had a captive audience, that business travelers definitely needed the Wi-Fi and would pay for it in addition to the room rate for corporate meetings and conventions.''
 That's changing. In an online survey in late April by the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, 80 percent of travel managers said that Wi-Fi availability was a ''deal-maker/breaker'' in deciding which hotels to select.
 Long gone are the days when a business hotel could shrug off a shaky, or even nonexistent, connection. ''Providing Wi-Fi isn't an option, it's a requirement,'' said Richard Crum, the president of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives. Mr. Crum predicted that as the current travel recovery gained traction, convention and luxury hotels would bow to pressure and start dropping the fees.
 It isn't just the extra $10 or $12 a day, he said. It's also a cultural shift in expectations. ''I mean, you can walk into a McDonald's and get it free,'' he said. ''It's also the hassle factor associated with paying per day, with having to get on your mobile device and put in your room number and code. You just want Wi-Fi that works and is ready to go.''
 Marriott International, whose 3,400 worldwide properties include the midlevel Courtyard and the luxury Ritz-Carlton brands, has a major corporate initiative under way to re-evaluate Wi-Fi supply and demand, by way of anticipating future requirements from an ever-expanding array of devices, whether laptops, Wi-Fi smartphones, Kindles or big Wi-Fi video systems for meetings.
 Bandwidth is the mantra. ''You can't ignore your bandwidth anymore,'' said Page Petry, a senior vice president for Marriott's information technology. Hotel owners ''can't just say, 'Oh, we upgraded our bandwidth yesterday and now we don't have to worry about it.' You always have to be proactively planning so you don't get yourself in a situation again where you have a lot of congestion and you're trying to play catch-up.'' 
 Traditionally, she said, a hotel ''built out a network whenever they had a different type of device that needed to be accommodated, whether it was a telephone, a TV or a PC.'' The result was a ''multitude of networks'' at work in most hotels. Marriott is working to converge those into a unified network in which demand can be managed hour by hour, especially as people tend to remain online for longer periods, gobbling up bandwidth.
 The proliferation of personal devices like smartphones that can use both Wi-Fi and cellular connections probably won't reduce bandwidth demand. In hotels, those users often opt for Wi-Fi. ''Many of these mobile devices work more effectively and burn less battery life on Wi-Fi, where they're usually able to access sites that are higher in graphic intensity,'' Mr. Crum said.
 In making arrangements for an annual conference this month in Chicago, planners required that the hotel guaranteed free Wi-Fi access throughout the building, not in just rooms and public spaces, but in meeting spaces too. They also worked with cellular providers to improve signals in meeting areas, were cellular coverage was typically weaker.
 ''You know how they ask you to turn off mobile devices in most meetings? Well, not here,'' Mr. Crum said. ''I want people posting to Twitter and Facebook, communicating, using social networks, setting up meetings. I want full connectivity.''

HEADLINE: Rent Board, Booed as Usual, Recommends Increases

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The board that regulates rents at the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments recommended a range of increases on Wednesday evening over the boos and hisses of a small yet spirited crowd of tenants, many of whom argued for rent freezes, citing high unemployment and hardship. 
 The Rent Guidelines Board approved increases of 2 percent to 4 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent to 6 percent for two-year leases, among the lower range of increases the nine-person panel has recommended in recent years. After public hearings on June 15 and June 17, the final increase will be set at a meeting June 24.
 Increases would apply to leases renewed between Oct. 1, 2010, and Sept. 30, 2011. Last year, despite clamoring from elected officials to freeze rents, the board approved increases of 3 percent on one-year leases and 6 percent on two-year leases. 
 About five dozen tenants and their supporters attended Wednesday's meeting, held in the Great Hall at Cooper Union in the East Village, brandishing anti-increase signs and erupting in catcalls whenever a proponent of a rent increase spoke. Onlooker outbursts and outrage, and landlords' bemoaning operating costs, have long greeted the board's annual meetings. 
 ''You're doing this with no consideration to the people of New York City,'' yelled Jeanie Dubnau, 72, a tenant advocate from Washington Heights, after the board passed the recommended increases by a 5-to-4 vote.
 Two board members supported a rent freeze, eliciting cheering from the crowd. One of those members, Adriene L. Holder, attorney in charge at the Legal Aid Society, cited increases in homelessness, unemployment and evictions, compounded by dips in inflation-adjusted wages. 
 Ronald S. Languedoc, a tenant lawyer and the board member who forwarded the motion proposing a rent freeze, said the recession had been ''devastating'' for rent-stabilized tenants. He also noted that operation costs for landlords of rent stabilized apartments had increased 3.4 percent from May 2009 to March 2010, according to data compiled by the board. ''That price increase is the lowest in my time on the board,'' Mr. Languedoc said.
 The motion to freeze rents was voted down by 7 to 2, as onlookers shouted, ''Greed! Greed! Greed!'' 
 Steven J. Schleider, a board member, proposed increases of 5 percent for one-year leases and 9 percent for two-year leases, saying that the board's calculation of landlords' costs ''grossly understated'' expenses like rising fuel costs. But the board's new chairman, Jonathan L. Kimmel, turned down that proposal. 
 Wednesday's vote came as the board awaited a ruling in the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in a case stemming from increases it passed in 2008 and 2009. It had mandated minimum increases for people who had lived in rent-stabilized apartments for more than six years and paid less than $1,000 a month.
 A State Supreme Court justice ruled in January that those increases were illegal.
 If her decision is upheld, about 350,000 tenants could receive rebates or reductions in their rent.

HEADLINE: Food to Grab and Go, With Flair

BYLINE: By ELAINE GLUSAC

 BODY:
WITH a Javits Center trade show scheduled to take up the majority of his day last month, Allen Marko, director of technical and plant operations for Obagi Medical Products, had no time to stop for a bite. 
 ''I didn't want to waste my time at the show having lunch,'' Mr. Marko said. 
 A guest at the Grand Hyatt New York, he solved the time problem at Market, a new grab-and-go outlet in the hotel lobby with no seating and lunch options like deli sandwiches ($7.50) and roast chicken with mashed potatoes ($12). 
 ''I was extremely impressed,'' Mr. Marko said. ''I knew I had a 20-minute cab ride so I grabbed a sandwich in the cab.'' 
 Working lunches and multitasking are standard procedures for many business travelers. The difference now is that hotels are vying to cater to their habits as grab-and-go meals trickle up from fast-food counters to more refined addresses. 
 ''Business travelers are packing more time into the day, using their travel time to work,'' said Matthew Adams, vice president and managing director for the 1,300-room Grand Hyatt. ''You saw them streaming out of the hotel going to Starbucks.''
 The success of Starbucks at stealing breakfast -- and sometimes lunch -- crowds from their hotels has inspired the hospitality industry to punch back with an array of travel- and budget-friendly food options. They include room service to-go menus, fancy food courts and globe-trotting gourmet markets, distancing grab-and-go food from its humble origins in vending machines.
 ''Travel is about productivity and using every minute wisely,'' said Bjorn Hanson, associate professor at the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. ''The dining room is perceived to have slow service and high prices.'' 
 As senior associate director of development for Rochester University, Alan Carmasin travels nearly every other week, often staying at the Aloft Hotel in Lexington, Mass., where guests can toast their own bagels ($2), grab a breakfast sandwich ($6) or take away a boxed salad ($6.50) from the 24-hour self-service lobby cafe called Re:fuel. 
 ''If I have time I'll sit down, but I'm just as happy to grab and go because I may be meeting a client or have to work in the room,'' Mr. Carmasin said. ''I like their program. It's not luxurious, but it's friendly.''
 The two-year-old chain, which operates 40 hotels, is set up for the self-sufficiency of travelers like Mr. Carmasin. 
 ''This is a group that likes to service themselves,'' said Brian McGuinness, senior vice president for specialty select brands at Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide. ''They check in themselves, they get their own coffee. They believe they can do it better. Control is an important factor to them.'' 
 Restoring control to travelers in uncertain times is a rallying cry among food and beverage managers eager to serve those with no time for their restaurants nor interest in airport food. The Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago sells 20 to 30 lunches to go a week from the room service menu, and more to groups who give the hotel's insulated lunch bags stuffed with options like Maine lobster pita ($40) and grilled chicken Caesar wrap ($28) to airport-bound meeting attendees. 
 The W2Go menu at the W Atlanta-Midtown offers $15 lunchboxes from Spice restaurant, which is run by the celebrity chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Recent selections included a Vietnamese chicken sandwich with nuoc cham mayo and grilled eggplant spread. 
 Panzano, a restaurant in the Hotel Monaco Denver, offers guests a ''breakfast with wings'' menu, featuring house-made granola ($6.75) and a breakfast croissant sandwich ($8.50) ready in 15 minutes, as early as 6 a.m. 
 Hotels say food sales have increased with to-go programs, rather than cannibalizing restaurant traffic. Many attribute the popularity of grab-and-go to the budget worries brought about by a lagging economy. 
 ''People are less comfortable paying $25 for breakfast, plus gratuity,'' said Mr. Hanson of N.Y.U. ''Takeaway is in tune with economic times.''
 In addition to offering to-go packaging at all of its restaurants, Marriott International is expanding its lobby markets. This month the Grosvenor House, a JW Marriott Hotel in London, will open Park Lane Market, replacing a street-level coffee shop with an upscale take-out shop featuring sandwiches, salads and sweets. The company also operates food markets at resorts in Orlando and Phoenix.
 ''We tested doorknob to-go lunch menus seven years ago and it didn't work; it's working now,'' said Robin Uler, chief creative officer for Marriott International, who cites the productivity squeeze and the lack of airline food service for forging the trend. ''Now if you don't think about lunch when you can, you may not get it until after five.'' 
 Fairmont Hotels and Resorts plans to open its new food hall in New York's venerable Plaza Hotel by late spring. Modeled on a European gourmet market like the one in London's Harrods department store, the 5,400-square-foot market includes eight dining stations devoted to sushi, burgers, noodles, pizza, seafood and more. Food is made to order and prepackaged for carry-out. Though menu pricing is undetermined, management says it will appeal to trimmed expense accounts. 
 In addition to lowering the cost to consumers, grab-and-go food is cheaper to sell, said Joe Brancatelli, who runs the business Web site JoeSentMe.com. 
 ''It's worked for hotels because it's a lower-cost way of delivering food,'' he said. ''Nothing is more expensive than room service.''
 Indeed, even Mr. Adams of the Grand Hyatt New York sympathizes with room service complaints. ''Guests don't understand $38 for two eggs over easy from traditional room service,'' he said. ''They don't see the infrastructure that goes into it.'' 
 Without the service overhead, to-go prices are closer to those of nonhotel vendors, where guests were often heading. Aiming to keep them in-house, the Grand Hyatt's Market will begin selling beer and wine, along with its array of prepared meals and snacks. What if you don't finish that six-pack? A room renovation beginning in July will install refrigerators to store items from the lobby larder.

HEADLINE: 'Los Suns' Join Protest, Then Stop The Spurs

BYLINE: By BILLY WITZ. 
Howard Beck contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Suns' decision to wear ''Los Suns'' jerseys Wednesday -- as a celebration of Cinco de Mayo and as a political statement in opposition to Arizona's new law dealing with illegal immigrants -- drove another wedge into the contentious debate here. 
 Then, for several hours, the Suns found a way to bridge the divide -- by winning a basketball game. 
 The Suns, after a slow start, pulled away down the stretch thanks to their 3-point shooting, and defeated San Antonio, 110-102, to take a 2-0 lead in their Western Conference semifinal series. 
 Grant Hill, who at 37 is in the second round of the playoffs for the first time in his career, played a key role at both ends of the court, scoring 18 points and doing most of the defensive work on the Spurs' Manu Ginobili, who was held to 11 points.
 As the Suns left the court to cheers, fans began to file out of US Airways Center.
 Outside, an N.B.A. playoff game had become a temporary stage for a divisive national debate. Inside, it was merely a playoff basketball game -- players getting knocked to the floor and jump shots being taken with the weight of great consequences.
 In the preceding 24 hours, it was Robert Sarver, the Suns' managing partner and a native of Tucson, who had stepped into another tough fight with his decision to have the Suns wear their alternate ''Los Suns'' jerseys, something they did twice this season as part of the N.B.A.'s ''Noche Latina'' campaign. 
 Sarver called the new law, which has been the subject of a fierce debate both nationally and locally, flawed and mean-spirited and said it would hurt the state's economy. 
 ''However intended, the result of passing this law is that our basic principles of equal rights and protection under the law are being called into question,'' Sarver said Tuesday in a statement, ''and Arizona's already struggling economy will suffer even further setbacks at a time when the state can ill-afford them.'' 
 Sarver, through a team spokesman, declined to comment Wednesday. 
 Indicators of how Suns fans felt about the law were hard to come by. Most stark political differences were covered up by the color orange that filled the arena. 
 One fan who stood out was Andrew Bloom, who wore a sombrero, taped ''Los'' above the Suns logo on his Amar'e Stoudemire jersey and said he had a concealed banner he would unfurl later that read: Deport the Spurs. 
 But overt signs of support or opposition were rare. 
 A clerk at the team store said sales of ''Los Suns'' T-shirts and jerseys were more brisk than usual but she could not provide numbers. David Rojo, who wore one of the orange T-shirts, said he appreciated that Sarver, as the leader of one of Phoenix's most prominent businesses, would take such a strong stand in opposition to the law. 
 ''It's awesome for me because my parents are immigrants from Mexico,'' Rojo said. ''It's important that it's not just immigrants who are opposed to the law, but an organization that has a strong place in the community.'' 
 Jerry Dilk, a season-ticket holder for 22 seasons, was not so pleased. 
 ''I've got no problem celebrating Cinco de Mayo,'' said Dilk, who did not share what he called Sarver's liberal point of view. ''But I'm disappointed he chose to use his position to make a political statement.'' 
 The fallout from Sarver's decision, which was made after getting unanimous support from his players, is why sports figures are so reticent about becoming involved in political issues.
 So, despite Tuesday's outspoken support of the gesture from those in both organizations -- Suns General Manager Steve Kerr said that allowing the police to ask people for their papers ''rings up images of Nazi Germany'' -- the topic of Los Suns jerseys was one that both coaches sought to distance themselves from Wednesday. 
 This was, after all, the playoffs. 
 ''Now it's game time,'' Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, who strongly supported Sarver on Tuesday, said as he stood outside his team's locker room about 90 minutes before tip-off. ''I'm not running for office, just coaching.'' 
 Suns Coach Alvin Gentry was no more interested in discussing the subject. 
 ''This is the last thing I'm going to say about it,'' Gentry said. ''We've worn these jerseys before. We're 3-0 in these jerseys. We're wearing these jerseys just because it's a national holiday, it's Cinco de Mayo. We're wearing it because of the diversity we have in the state of Arizona, and we're wearing it because of the diversity in the N.B.A.'' 
 Gentry also sidestepped the question of whether the fans would blame the uniform controversy if the Suns lost. 
 Then the Suns went out and ensured that he would not have to.

HEADLINE: Thinking Outside Rails and Runways, And Taking the Bus

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
DERRICK ROBERTS could drive, fly or ride the train on his weekly business trips to Washington from his home in Manhattan. Instead, he takes the bus, seemingly the least comfortable and most time-consuming of his commuting options.
 Only Mr. Roberts doesn't take an ordinary bus that stops at every city along the way, but MegaBus, one of the growing number of express services that are quickly redefining the images of bus and business travel in this economy.
 MegaBus's business plan, like those of BoltBus and other rivals, is relatively simple. Most tickets are sold online and are paperless. The first passengers to reserve seats on each bus get the cheapest prices, often starting at $1. Buses connect city centers, from Midtown Manhattan to crucial depots in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington and elsewhere for easy access to mass transit. 
 The buses make few if any intermediate stops, so travel times are often the same as driving and only slightly longer than taking the train, at a fraction of the price. Critically for business travelers, buses are outfitted with free Wi-Fi connections, electric outlets and in some cases, tables and cup holders.
 ''When I first heard it, I thought it was another New York scam, a $1 bus ticket,'' Mr. Roberts, a lighting designer, said as he showed his $15 e-ticket on his BlackBerry to the driver before boarding a bus to Washington. ''The plane can't compete. I even have power for my computer. It's user-friendly.''
 Express bus services like the so-called Chinatown buses have been around for years. Typically, they are marketed to the most budget-conscious travelers willing to put up with spotty service and less convenient drop-off points to save money.
 Some of the newer services, though, were created by established bus companies trying to cater to younger, tech-savvy travelers who might otherwise use Amtrak or a discount airline. MegaBus, a subsidiary of Coach USA, has been in business for four years, and entered the New York market in 2008, when BoltBus, a division of Greyhound, also introduced similar services.
 Their timing was good. The recession was under way and travelers were looking for bargains. Airport security was being tightened and fuel prices were rising, which meant more hassles and higher prices. And while Amtrak's Acela train service in the Northeast is praised for its speed and comfort, cost is rarely one of its selling points.
 Last year, as commercial airline traffic and rail ridership dipped, intercity bus service grew 5.1 percent, according to the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University.
 MegaBus has seen double-digit growth in ridership, carrying one million riders in the last eight months on its 98 double-decker buses. Nearly 200,000 riders a month use BoltBus, whose buses run about 85 percent full. The company broke even after three months, instead of at the end of the first year as expected.
 There are no precise figures on how many business travelers take the bus. But the bus companies say they are a small, but growing percentage of their ridership. Over all, the largest group of riders -- up to three-quarters -- is between the ages of 18 and 34. Women outnumber men, and many are of college age.
 More and more riders, the companies say, are working at their first jobs, either for small companies or independently. These riders often do not own a car and consider Amtrak an inconvenient luxury that provides more legroom but little Internet connectivity at far higher prices.
 ''We're starting to see briefcase-carrying travelers use the buses because of their cutting-edge image and Wi-Fi,'' said Joseph Schwieterman, a professor at the Chaddick Institute who has studied intercity bus companies. ''We did focus groups with people in their 20s and when we brought up Amtrak, they rolled their eyes.''
 For all their cachet, express buses are not for everyone. Larger travelers may have trouble negotiating the narrow aisles and seats. And because there are few tray tables, laptops must be kept in your lap, which makes it hard to spread out. Wi-Fi connection speeds can also get sluggish if too many passengers are logged on.
 And while buses spend most of their time on interstate highways, they are at the mercy of traffic, particular when entering and leaving city centers like Midtown Manhattan.
 ''The question remains about reliability,'' said Jeffrey Zupan, a senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association. ''It's a question of personal comfort, and it's a crapshoot not just on Friday and Sunday, but many days.''
 Still, for riders who need to work while they travel, start and end their journeys in city centers, and save a few dollars, express buses are the way to go.
 ''I am the happiest traveler once I get into my seat and start setting up my mobile office,'' said Mr. Roberts, the lighting designer. ''I pull up my three e-mail accounts on three separate windows and start multitasking my day away. Before you know it, I am in D.C. meeting all of my deadlines.''

HEADLINE: Saving the Teachers

 BODY:
Last year's $100 billion education stimulus plan insulated the public schools from the worst of the recession and saved an estimated 300,000 jobs. With the economy still lagging and states forced to slash their budgets, Congress must act again to prevent a wave of teacher layoffs that could damage the fragile recovery and hobble the school reform effort for years to come. 
 In March, Representative George Miller, a Democrat of California, introduced a jobs bill that included a $23 billion school rescue plan. Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat of Iowa, has since introduced a similar plan fashioned as an emergency spending bill. The House version is the better of the two. 
 The need for a second school stimulus plan was underscored on Monday by a new analysis from the American Association of School Administrators, which reported that cash-strapped districts were prepared to cut as many 275,000 jobs in the 2010-2011 school year. 
 The loss of that many paychecks -- and the resulting decline in consumer spending -- could kill off still more jobs in the communities where teachers and other school employees live.
 Assuming that both houses pass their respective bills, House leaders should insist on two important changes. 
 First, they should discard ambiguous language in both bills that could allow that states to use the money for expenditures other than education. Second, they should remove a provision of the Senate version that exempts the states from adhering to important reform requirements laid out the original stimulus bill. 
 Under those conditions, states are barred from cutting school funds and using the new federal dollars to fill the gap. They are also required to create data driven systems for monitoring student progress and evaluating teachers -- and to ensure that low-income and minority children are no longer disproportionately taught by unqualified teachers. 
 Despite arguments to the contrary, the school rescue plan can, in fact, do double duty. 
 It could both prevent layoffs and advance the cause of reform.

HEADLINE: If the Picasso Was Out of Reach, Maybe Its Former Home Will Do

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
For those who yearned for Picasso's ''Nude, Green Leaves and Bust'' but could not outbid the anonymous buyer who paid $106.5 million at the Christie's auction on Tuesday, here is an item from the same estate for a fraction of the record-breaking price: the home of the art patrons who owned the painting. 
 The house of Sidney F. Brody and Frances Lasker Brody, longtime benefactors of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is for sale for a mere $24.95 million (or just under a quarter of the price of the Picasso). 
 The 11,500-square-foot house in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles, designed in 1949 by the famed architect A. Quincy Jones, has been listed by Coldwell Banker Previews International of Beverly Hills, and is expected to start showing in several weeks.
 A ceramic mural by Matisse (reworked by the artist after the Brodys expressed initial disappointment) has since gone to the museum. But the residence remains, a classic example of Hollywood Modernism with five bedrooms and four staff bedrooms, a tennis court, a pool and a guest house, as well as many pieces of William Haines furniture and the original gold dragon door handles. 
 Linda May, an executive director of Coldwell Banker who is an agent for the property, said Wednesday that she expected no shortage of potential buyers despite the rocky economy, ''especially from people that are aficionados of really great architecture, original architecture that has not been ruined.'' 
 The Brody estate, with its artwork still in place, can be seen at nytimes.com/artsbeat.

HEADLINE: Money Woes, Long Silences and Islamic Zeal

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON and SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
Theirs was an arranged marriage: two well-educated children of prominent Pakistani families set up through a mutual friend. He was the quiet one; she was the one who laughed at parties. 
 At their wedding in Peshawar six years ago, men and women danced separately but also together, ''a rarity at that time,'' recalled one guest. ''It was such a huge gathering that even their family friends from Qatar came.''
 When they returned to the United States, his colleagues at the cosmetics maker Elizabeth Arden celebrated with a small office party. 
 The husband, Faisal Shahzad, put photographs of his wife, Huma Mian, on his desk at the Arden office in Stamford, Conn. They bought a brand-new house for $273,000, 35 miles away on Long Hill Avenue in Shelton. By the time they moved in, she was pregnant, the neighbors recalled. 
 As another day passed with Mr. Shahzad talking to investigators about the car bomb he had admitted driving into Times Square on Saturday, details emerged on Wednesday about the couple and their life together, along with speculation about his radicalization. People who knew them, both in Connecticut and in Pakistan, said he had changed in the past year or so, becoming more reserved and more religious as he faced what someone who knows the family well called ''their financial troubles.'' 
 Last year, one Pakistani friend said, he even asked his father, Bahar ul-Haq, a retired high-ranking air force pilot in Pakistan, for permission to fight in Afghanistan.
 Mr. Haq, now in his 70s, adamantly refused, according to a person familiar with the conversation, saying that he disapproved of the mission and reminding his son that Islam does not permit a man to abandon his wife or children. 
 As a newlywed, the wedding guest said of Mr. Shahzad by e-mail from Pakistan, ''there was no sign of him being extremist or, for that matter, he wasn't a bit religious.'' But in the past couple of years, after changing jobs and fathering two children, Mr. Shahzad ''started talking more of Islam.'' The guest spoke on the condition he not be identified because of concerns about his safety in the wake of the attempted car bombing.
 ''The recession had taken a toll on them, I guess,'' he wrote in an e-mail message from Pakistan. He said that their money worries became apparent in 2008 or 2009 and that Mr. Shahzad ''lost his way during the financial problems.'' JPMorgan Chase has since moved to foreclose on the Shelton house, which the couple had abandoned in a hurry, leaving behind clothes and toys.
 In February, Mr. Shahzad leased a two-bedroom apartment in Bridgeport, Conn. His landlord said he never saw Mr. Shahzad's wife. Faiz Ahmad, a friend from the Shahzad family's ancestral village, Mohib Banda, said that when he last saw Mr. Shahzad, at a wedding a year and a half ago, he was sure that something was wrong. Mr. Shahzad seemed changed, he said, sitting by himself and not talking very much. 
 He was ''completely quiet on the sofa, like someone who has some worries, and undergoing some internal change,'' Mr. Ahmad said. ''So he was sitting silent, silent. And silence in itself is a question.'' 
 A Pakistani man said that an acquaintance of his who was a friend of the Shahzad family told him that within the past year, Mr. Shahzad had peered critically at a glass of whiskey the friend was holding, indicating a judgmental stance typical for rigid jihadis. 
 Mr. Shahzad, now 30, appeared to be tracing a familiar arc of frustration, increasing religiosity and, finally, violence. He was born and raised in Pakistan, with a privileged upbringing in a moderate family that lived in at least three places -- Karachi, Rawalpindi and Mohib Banda. Mr. Haq, according to Mr. Ahmad, ''was a man of modern thinking and of the modern age.''
 Family friends interviewed on Wednesday said they believed that Mr. Haq was in hiding in the city of Dera Ghazi Khan in western Pakistan, where the family has wheat fields. Mr. Shahzad's wife was also believed to be in Pakistan, though her whereabouts was unknown. Dawn, a Pakistani daily, reported that her father had been arrested in Karachi, but Pakistani authorities would not confirm that.
 Mr. Shahzad, the youngest of four, was born into a new generation in the years after a military autocrat, Zia ul-Haq, began to inject a rigid version of Islam into Pakistan's education system. At the same time, hard-line mosques were given money and land, elevating a narrow, often sectarian world view that cast a pall over young Pakistanis.
 Ms. Mian, the oldest of four, was born in Colorado, though she spent summer vacations in Pakistan and lived with her family in Qatar for a while as a child, according to the wedding guest. Her father, Mohammad Asif Mian, earned two master's degrees at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., in the 1980s, and has written four books.
 In the best-selling ''Project Economics and Decision Analysis,'' published in 2002, Mr. Mian thanked family members for their patience and support, adding, ''Special thanks to my daughters at the University of Colorado for being on the dean's list; this has contributed a lot to my enthusiasm.''
 Ms. Mian and her sisters, Saba and Hina, all studied at Denver-area colleges and shared a house just off the campus of the University of Colorado in Boulder in 2003 and 2004. 
 Huma Mian married Mr. Shahzad soon after earning an accounting degree in 2004, and moved to Connecticut, where he was pursuing an M.B.A. at the University of Bridgeport and, on an H-1B visa for highly skilled workers, was working as an operation analyst at Elizabeth Arden, managing and analyzing accounts receivable, according to a resume obtained by MSNBC.
 ''I was always surprised, with her having to buy milk for the baby and everything else, how they afforded this on one income,'' recalled Brenda J. Thurman, a neighbor in Shelton. 
 The couple did not socialize much with people on their block. ''It was three years before I knew she spoke English,'' Ms. Thurman said. 
 Ms. Thurman said that Ms. Mian left for a couple of months in late 2008 or early 2009, and that Mr. Shahzad told her she was going to Pakistan to have their second child. Within a few months of her return, they packed up and left again last summer. Mr. Shahzad, who had left Elizabeth Arden in 2006 to become a client reporting analyst at Affinion, a financial marketing services company in Norwalk, Conn., quit his job there. 
 Piles of garbage remained outside the home in Shelton this week, filled with clues about their lives. There were packets of Nair, moisturizer with Arabic writing on the back, a makeup brush, a Japanese cherry blossom scent body spritzer, wrapping paper and gift bags that appeared to be for baby gifts.
 There was an envelope addressed to ''Faisal, Huma and Alishaba,'' which contained a card proclaiming, ''Congratulations on your new little girl!''
 How, why or where Mr. Shahzad became radicalized remains unclear. Dr. Saud Anwar, the founder of a Pakistani-American association in Connecticut, said that as soon as Mr. Shahzad's name surfaced in connection with the car bomb, he canvassed Connecticut Muslim and Pakistani groups and found he was not involved with any of them. 
 But Dr. Anwar said he had been in touch with a university classmate of Mr. Shahzad's, a man of Pakistani descent who told Dr. Anwar he did not want to be interviewed by reporters. The classmate said he had remained friends with the couple and had noticed something different about Mr. Shahzad about a year ago. 
 ''His personality had changed -- he had become more introverted,'' Dr. Anwarsaid the classmate told him. ''He had a stronger religious identity, where he felt more strongly and more opinionated about things.'' Dr. Anwar said he had asked the classmate whether this change had come through association with a group, and the friend said it seemed to be ''on his own that he was learning all these things.'' 
 Mr. Ahmad, the friend from Mohib Banda, speculated that the transformation was rooted in Karachi. An associate of Mr. Shahzad's was arrested in a mosque believed to have ties with a militant group in Karachi early Tuesday, Pakistani intelligence officials said. 
 ''The question is who has put Faisal in this path?'' Mr. Ahmad asked. ''The Faisal with the beard that you see, he was not the old Faisal. He was like you, like me, handsome, liberal and an active person.''
 According to Pakistan's information minister, Mr. Shahzad traveled to Pakistan 13 times in the past seven years. One Pakistani official who knew the family said it was unlikely that Mr. Shahzad would have been radicalized in Pakistan if he was only on short trips, which tend to be dominated by family commitments like weddings; the criminal complaint against him filed on Tuesday says that he returned in February from a five-month stint. It also said Mr. Shahzad had been trained in bomb-making in Waziristan.
 Another family friend in Pakistan, Kifayat Ali, called Mr. Shahzad ''emotional'' and said that he used to carry a dagger around with him as a boy. He speculated that Mr. Shahzad had become enraged by the United States' military actions, fueled by the Pakistani press blaring conspiracy theories and anti-American vitriol.
 ''A person sees the brutality of Afghanistan and Iraq,'' Mr. Ali noted. ''These scenes affect people.''
 The resume posted Wednesday on msnbc.com said Mr. Shahzad held three different positions at Elizabeth Arden over five years starting in mid-2001, and then spent three years at Affinion. At Arden, he said he had ''decreased bad debt write-offs by 47 percent'' and ''recovered over $2.5 mil in 'lost' revenue.'' At Affinion, he said he prepared ''monthly commission forecasting for high-profile Affinion clients such as Citibank, Bank of America, Royal Bank of Scotland, Peoples Bank, US Bank, Wells Fargo and a couple of smaller clients.''
 But James Hart, an Affinion spokesman, said ''there's a lot of resume puffery in there'' and that Mr. Shahzad had been ''one rung up from entry level'' when he left. 
 A former manager at Elizabeth Arden said that he was the only Pakistani working for the company at the time, but never asked for special accommodation for prayer. And she remembered that on Sept. 11, Mr. Shahzad, like everyone else, huddled around the one radio in the office, listening to bulletins about the attacks on the World Trade Center.
 ''I think he was just normal,'' she recalled. ''Isn't it always the case, though? It's always the normal ones that you don't really think they're going to do something like this.''
 James Barron reported from New York and Sabrina Tavernise from Peshawar.

HEADLINE: Taking Greenery Straight Up

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
GIVEN the chance to accompany a team of botanists on a plant-collecting expedition to South America, most gardeners would probably be satisfied with the experience. They wouldn't come home and try to recreate the rain forest in Manhattan.
 But Michael Riley isn't like most gardeners. Mr. Riley, a former commodities trader turned plant expert who went on to become assistant director of the Horticultural Society of New York, was eager to move beyond potted plants in a way that hadn't yet occurred to many others. It took a number of expeditions, a lot of research and more than a decade and a half, but by 2003 he had figured out how to grow a wall of plants inside his Upper West Side apartment.
 ''In the rain forest, I realized that plants didn't need to grow in pots with labels,'' said Mr. Riley, 64. ''I wanted to grow plants in ways that were natural to them.'' 
 With his partner, Francisco Correa, a Spanish teacher who is now 52, Mr. Riley attacked a corner of his living area, stripping the walls of plaster and affixing exterior-grade plywood to new and existing building studs. On top of the plywood went bitumen roofing to protect the walls. Cork bark was then stapled over that, and plants were inserted into pockets in the cork. Sprinklers and lighting were installed overhead, trenches were put in at the base of the walls to catch water that trickled down, and pools were added in the middle of the room to increase humidity.
 These days, Mr. Riley's project isn't that unusual. Vertical gardens -- which began as an experiment in 1988 by Patrick Blanc, a French botanist intent on creating a garden without dirt -- are becoming increasingly popular at home. Avid and aspiring gardeners, frustrated with little outdoor space, are taking another look at their walls and noticing something new: more space. And a number of companies are selling ready-made systems and all-in-one kits for gardeners like Mr. Riley who want to do it themselves. (For those who prefer to leave it to the professionals, landscape designers can build vertical gardens for a hefty fee.)
 In the last few years, companies that sell green wall supplies have seen a jump in sales. ELT, an Ontario company that specializes in green roofs, began selling living wall systems a little over three years ago and is now one of the biggest suppliers to the United States. Greg Garner, the company's president, said that its green-wall sales have increased 300 percent since 2008. Four months ago, the company introduced a cheaper, lighter kit to make living walls accessible to the average gardener; prices start at about $40 for a one-square-foot panel.
 ''We've turned living walls into something anyone can do,'' Mr. Garner said. ''The walls have gone from zero percent of our business leads to 80 percent of our business, and it's happening all over the place, from the Middle East to North America to Europe.''
 Another big living-wall company, Gsky Plant Systems in Vancouver, British Columbia, was founded four years ago as a green roof supplier but now focuses almost exclusively on vertical gardens, which it designs, installs and maintains for around $125 a square foot. Hal Thorne, Gsky's chairman, said the company's growth in the last year ''was phenomenal -- we nearly doubled sales.''
 Many of the modular systems -- essentially plastic trays filled with dirt and attached to a wall, with a sprinkler or drip irrigation system installed above -- differ dramatically from Patrick Blanc's living walls, which can be seen in commercial and institutional buildings around the world, including the Athenaeum hotel in London and the Musee du Quai Branly in Paris.
 Mr. Blanc, who was inspired by tropical rain-forest plants he had studied, knew plants could survive on water and fertilizer alone, and developed a system for growing them on walls lined with felt. The living wall was part of his effort to bring greenery into cities. ''When you live in towns, you don't always go into gardens,'' he said. ''It's really important to use empty spaces to invite nature into town.''
 He is not a fan of the new kits. On a recent visit to San Francisco to begin work on a green wall for a private high school, his largest outdoor vertical garden in North America, Mr. Blanc dismissed them as artificial. Plants may grow vertically on a surface like the face of a cliff, he said, but ''in nature, you don't have vertical dirt.''
 At a local nursery, he pointed at one modular system: ''This is very heavy and a lot of plastic,'' he said. ''After three to five years, you have no more substrate -- the dirt gets compacted.''
 Last year, inspired by Mr. Blanc's work, Matthew McGregor-Mento, 38, an executive creative director at Gyro: HSR, a New York advertising agency, and his wife, Emma, 35, a massage therapist, set out to build a vertical garden in their two-bedroom apartment in the East Village. They attached an 8-by-10-foot aluminum frame to a wall in the entry hall, screwed waterproof sheets of PVC to the frame and tacked on two layers of matting. Then they inserted some 400 plants -- philodendrons, ivies and ferns -- into holes they cut in the felt.
 A trough they installed along the floor collects runoff water from the irrigation system, and a pump with a filtration sponge sends it back up the wall. Timers control the watering, which happens four times a day.
 The design, which they devised with the help of a horticulturalist friend, was based on Mr. Blanc's system and on research they had done online. The total cost was $3,000, but the result was worth it, Mr. McGregor-Mento said. Most people who visit want a green wall of their own, and the effort involved wasn't that onerous: ''Building a vertical wall is about as difficult as painting a room.''
 Others have found it more challenging. Peter Kastan, an unemployed movie location scout in Miami, had never grown anything when he decided to install a vertical garden in a friend's loft. The apartment, which his friend offered to him as a laboratory since it was vacant and he couldn't rent it, had abundant light and high ceilings, and Mr. Kastan, after reading about Mr. Blanc's living gardens online, thought it would be an ideal environment.
 He began by contacting living-wall creators around the world for advice, and then drove all over Florida visiting nurseries to find plants. He bought 650, including bromeliads, hoyas, begonias and ferns, favoring those that were local and ''the most interesting to look at,'' he said. And one weekend last November, he and his wife, Mai Tran, and a friend put up the 12-by-12-foot plant wall.
 Like Mr. McGregor-Mento, Mr. Kastan used matting affixed to a metal frame bolted to the wall. He bought most of the materials from local hardware stores or online suppliers. About $10,000 later, he has a large, vibrant green wall. He recently completed a smaller one in the kitchen, with herbs and mini-tomatoes.
 But it took a lot of work to get the irrigation, the lighting and the plants right. The first month, he lost several plants near the bottom of the wall, where water was collecting. He realized then that some plants were getting too much water and needed to be moved a different spot on the wall; others he had to get rid of.
 ''It's like having a large poodle,'' Mr. Kastan said. ''You have to take care of it, feed it, walk it. It's intensive care for plants.''
 Even professional gardeners sometimes have trouble with their first living wall. Martha Desbiens, a co-owner of VertNY, a landscape design firm specializing in roof gardens, used sedums in a green wall on a client's terrace, and they dried out over the winter while theirrigation system was off. In a roof garden, they would have gotten plenty of moisture from snow, she noted, but planted vertically, they didn't get nearly enough.
 ''A lot of living walls fail,'' Ms. Desbiens said. ''There's a big learning curve.''
 Marguerite Wells, a co-owner of Motherplants, a nursery in Ithaca, said she tries to steer people away from them.
 ''People want green bling,'' Ms. Wells said. ''People think, 'It looks beautiful and perfect, and I want something beautiful and perfect in my life.' ''
 But vertical gardens can't be watered with a hose or ignored for long stretches of time, she noted, and won't tolerate certain plants. Inevitably, the irrigation stops working, she said, whether the pumps break down, the emitters get clogged (if a dirt system is used) or water gets stuck in one cell of a modular system. And within a few days of any malfunction, plants begin to die.
 Amelia Lima, a landscape designer in San Diego, encountered the most basic problem when she decided to turn the 40-foot wall in her backyard into a vertical garden. At first, she tried hanging plants and art on the wall, which faced the picture windows in her living room and kitchen, but it looked drab. Then she found a landscape architect who had worked with Patrick Blanc on a project in Brazil and hired him to help. But halfway through the project, she realized she had forgotten something essential: a water source.
 ''People think it's a green wall,'' Ms. Lima said, as in, ''you hang a picture on the wall and it's done.''
 But there's a lot more to it than that, she added: ''There's construction, watering -- you're making a garden.''
 Just Another Plant in The Wall
 Making your own living wall can be done in one of two ways -- as a fully bespoke model or something more off-the-rack. Whichever you choose, there are a few things to keep in mind.
 Vertical gardens are heavy, and not every wall is strong enough to support one. Check with a carpenter or your landlord to make sure the designated wall can handle the load.
 When selecting a spot for your living wall, make sure the area gets plenty of light. The best light is natural, but you will also need to install artificial lighting.
 Custom installations like the ones Patrick Blanc builds require a frame that can be attached to the wall, a waterproof barrier to protect the wall, a surface material like felt or cork to hold the plants in place and an irrigation system with PVC or polyethylene tubing and a submersible pump (the kind found in aquarium shops).
 Ready-made vertical garden kits have small containers angled to hold dirt and can be watered manually. After you plant your cuttings in the dirt, you'll need to let them grow horizontally for several months so they develop strong roots. Once the roots have taken hold, you can attach the kit to the wall. (Kits are available from a number of sources, including eltlivingwalls.com, sgplants.com and floragrubb.com.)
 Each wall has different requirements, depending on its light and plants (talk to a local nursery or green-roof specialist about the best plants for your wall), but many people water their vertical gardens three times a day for 8 to 10 minutes. You will need to add fertilizer to the water to make sure the plants get necessary nutrients.

HEADLINE: Canada's Doubts on Toyota

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting from Detroit.

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- During much of the eight-month crisis between Toyota and safety regulators over recalled vehicles in the United States and Canada, the public pronouncements from the two governments have been remarkably different. 
 As early as November, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration criticized the Japanese automaker for providing ''inaccurate and misleading information,'' while its Canadian counterpart, Transport Canada, issued a statement that declared, ''Transport Canada applauds Toyota's action to protect consumers.'' 
 The divergent messages have helped create the impression in Washington and elsewhere that Toyota has been more cooperative with Canadian regulators, and that somehow Canadian car owners have received better and swifter treatment. But newly released Transport Canada documents show that behind the scenes, some Canadian regulators were just as frustrated -- and sometimes alarmed -- by Toyota as were transportation officials in the United States.
 ''Toyota Canada's action seriously undermines this safety issue,'' one field investigator for Transport Canada wrote in an e-mail message in October after reviewing Toyota's public disclosure over floor mats that may have caused unintended acceleration. ''Frankly, I'm appalled by their action.'' 
 As lawmakers in Washington hold a hearing on Thursday to consider new American safety regulations as a result of the recall of millions of Toyota vehicles, a parliamentary committee here is reviewing thousands of pages of e-mail messages and other internal regulatory documents that are casting the carmaker in an unflattering light -- and are causing some Canadians to question the effectiveness of the country's approach to regulating an industry that politicians have carefully courted rather than alienate. 
 A spokeswoman for Toyota Canada said the documents were incomplete and created an incorrect perception of the company's activities. ''There are documents that are missing that put everything in perspective,'' said the spokeswoman, Sandy Di Felice. 
 Still, there are calls among opposition members of Parliament for legislation, along the lines being proposed in Washington, to give Transport Canada greater authority over the auto industry and to impose new reporting requirements on manufacturers. 
 John Baird, the Canadian transportation minister, has toned down his department's praise for Toyota and has even vaguely raised the prospect of criminal charges against the company, the regulators' only enforcement tool. But while the United States transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, has announced plans to fine Toyota $16.4 million, the largest fine allowed, for not promptly notifying the government about potential problems, Canadian regulators have held back.
 The Canadian approach, in part, reflects the importance of auto manufacturers to the economy. Ontario long ago overtook Michigan in car production, and its auto industry accounts for about 14 percent of Canada's manufacturing as measured through gross domestic product. In an economy otherwise dominated by energy and other natural resource exports, cars and car parts are overwhelmingly Canada's biggest manufactured exports, with the bulk of production destined for the United States.
 Even critics tend to be measured when talking about Toyota's problems.
 ''Clearly, we don't want to do anything to damage the auto industry in Canada,'' said Joe Volpe, a member of Parliament from the opposition Liberal Party who is among those pushing for new regulatory muscle. ''But it strikes me as rather odd the Americans slapped a fine on Toyota on the basis of information they received from Europe and from Canada when in Canada our minister wasn't acting at all.''
 The clash between Transport Canada and Toyota's subsidiary in Canada, as reflected in the documents released this week by a parliamentary committee, has focused on two issues. 
 First, at the beginning of the campaign last fall to address the floor mat problem, Canadian officials were puzzled by and concerned about Toyota's apparent attempt to play down the problem on its Web site in Canada, in sharp contrast to the company's approach in the United States.
 Second, Transport Canada struggled to get Toyota to add the Venza, a relatively new station wagon, to the list of vehicles affected by the floor mat recall.
 After Transport Canada published the first notice about the floor mats in October, it received a report about Toyota's recall notice from Andreas Koschate, a field investigator who works for the regulators under a contract.
 On the home page of Toyota's Web site in the United States, Mr. Koschate noted, a floor mat ''safety advisory'' was highlighted and linked to additional information. By contrast, Mr. Koschate wrote of the company's Canadian Web site, ''nobody from the Canadian public would even notice Toyota Canada's 'statement.' ''
 Mr. Koschate prepared a chart, which was later sent to Toyota, showing that Canadians had to click through four Web pages to learn about the floor mat issue. Mr. Koschate added labels on each step reading: ''No concern here. Keep looking!'' 
 The documents also show that Nigel Mortimer, head of recalls for Transport Canada, sent an e-mail message to a government relations executive at Toyota Canada in early October expressing his concern about the company's Web site and the absence of the Venza from the recall.
 While Mr. Mortimer asked for immediate action, Toyota replied that it was still waiting for guidance from its head office in Japan about which vehicles to include in the recall and suggested that it would get back to him the next week. Toyota's reply did not address Mr. Mortimer's concerns about the Web site.
 Toyota eventually altered its Canadian Web site, but officials at Transport Canada remained unsatisfied, the documents show.
 ''Though you now have a hot button on the front page, the corresponding link is certainly inferior to the U.S.A. site and not as we discussed,'' Mr. Mortimer told the company in an e-mail message in October.
 E-mail messages sent within Transport Canada also reflected the regulators' frustration with Toyota. ''The difference between Toyota U.S.A. and Toyota Canada approaches is not logical,'' Kash Ram, the director general of road safety and motor vehicle regulation at Transport Canada, wrote in one such internal message. 
 Ms. Di Felice, the Toyota spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that Toyota Canada's first Web efforts had been limited because of a lack of notice the company received about a similar floor mat announcement in the United States. ''We did the best job we could, given the time and circumstances,'' she said.
 Early on, Transport Canada wanted the Venza added to the list of recalled vehicles, the documents show. After examining a Venza at a dealership in Ottawa, a Transport Canada investigator found that undoing just one of the two clips holding the driver's floor mat in place could cause the accelerator to jam.
 While Transport Canada sent Toyota many e-mail messages about the Venza, the company did not recall the model until Dec. 16, about two and a half months after the government's first request. The reason for the delay is not clear from the e-mail records, but Ms. De Felice said it took Toyota until late November to finish investigating two complaints of unintended acceleration in Venzas filed with Transport Canada.
 Brian Masse, a member of the transportation committee from the New Democratic Party, said he planned to use some of the e-mail messages to prod Mr. Baird, the transportation minister, to support new regulatory legislation, though so far the Conservative government has shown no interest in two bills that would increase Transport Canada's powers. If nothing else, Mr. Masse said, the new documents undermine Toyota's presentation to the committee about how it handled the floor mat issue.
 ''Toyota basically dismissed them,'' Mr. Masse said of Transport Canada's safety concerns. 
 James Kusie, a spokesman for the transportation minister, suggested that the battle with Toyota may lead to regulatory changes.
 ''The minister has stated on several occasions that he supports the transport committee's current study into this matter,'' Mr. Kusie said.

HEADLINE: Beaming Into the Big Meeting

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
FALLOUT from a recession and ash from a volcano drove more companies than ever to try videoconferencing. Once the skies clear on both fronts, will it be time to plan more business trips or will virtual meetings continue to get the job done? 
 As a technology consultant for the IBB Consulting Group, Justin Forer of Miami takes 100 to 150 flights a year and also participates in one to four audio or video conferences a day. His answer? ''I do believe you can get quite a bit done via teleconferencing'' -- especially things like project updates and clarifications. 
 But when it comes to creating strategies, general brainstorming or generating new business, a trip is better, he said. He sees videoconferences as just another tool in his arsenal of business interactions. 
 Revenue from videoconferencing grew during the recession, according to the Gartner research firm. That growth is expected to continue as the economy recovers. Gartner forecasts that videoconferencing will generate more than $8.6 billion in revenue worldwide in 2013, compared with less than half that amount in 2009. 
 If companies have both options at their disposal, how can they deploy them successfully?
 Videoconferencing ''is well suited to routine kinds of information exchange activities'' -- for example, a regular meeting of a management team, said Patricia L. Mokhtarian, chairwoman of the Transportation Technology and Policy Graduate Program at the University of California, Davis. 
 The technology ''enables activities that need to happen in a regular workflow in spite of the fact that people are across the country or across the world,'' said Laura Neumann, senior user researcher for Microsoft, which offers videoconferencing. 
 And videoconferences can serve as backup in an emergency, as the volcanic eruption in Iceland showed. Companies offering the service found themselves inundated with calls as travelers were unable to make it to meetings. 
 Among those stranded was Stephen Prentice, a London-based analyst for Gartner who was scheduled to deliver the keynote address at his company's wireless, networking and communications conference in San Diego.
 Once he realized that he would be unable to fly to San Diego, Mr. Prentice, along with technical people in London and in San Diego, spent three days figuring out the best way for him to deliver the speech remotely. The title of the speech he had planned to give in person? ''The Art of Being There When You're Not,'' about the use of virtual worlds. 
 With video, it is much harder to gauge an audience's reaction, so it is important to have ''back channels'' from the audience to the speaker, Mr. Prentice said. While he gave his speech, a colleague in San Diego instant-messaged his impressions of the audience's reaction (were they interested? bored?) to a colleague sitting next to Mr. Prentice in London. His colleague in London wrote down the comments using a marker on a whiteboard. A colleague also monitored and relayed Twitter postings by participants during the speech. 
 The technical quality of the delivery was ''perfectly acceptable'' considering the constraints he was facing, Mr. Prentice said. 
 When videoconferencing for meetings is makeshift or bare bones, it can be harder to hold a smooth conversation and read the room for visual and vocal cues. Jittery or pixelated pictures can be distracting. Sound delays can be jarring, making it hard to interrupt the speaker (good for keeping rudeness at bay, bad for cutting off nonstop droners). 
 ''It really interrupts the natural flow of the conversation'' to have technical issues, said Charles Stucki, head of the TelePresence business at Cisco. He says the goal of a company's meeting technology -- with its absence of voice delays, high-quality picture, curved tables and large curved screens -- ''is not to remind me that you're not here.'' 
 This type of system requires a major financial commitment. A three-screen TelePresence meeting service -- including labor, equipment and bandwidth costs -- runs from $10,000 to $20,000 a month. For many companies that can be a substantial savings -- both in time and money spent traveling, Mr. Stucki said. 
 Still, ''it's not like you're never going to travel again,'' Mr. Stucki said. For example, he would have preferred to be in Norway last month to toast Cisco's deal to buy Tandberg, a videoconferencing company that is based there. But because of the volcano, he (like Mr. Prentice) was stranded in London. So the company set up a global Champagne toast to the deal involving hundreds of employees in nine cities around the world -- a rare case where videoconferencing was used mainly to enact a ritual.
 Toasting a deal, meeting a customer for a meal, having a personal conversation with a colleague -- the trip will always trump video in these areas.
 Business trips are superior for things like finding and reaching out to new customers, starting a project, soothing a client, dealing with controversy or delivering bad news, Professor Mokhtarian said. 
 She said such trips also make a powerful statement that videoconferences cannot: They signal that the people being visited are important. ''Sometimes it's not so much the content of the meeting itself as it is the symbolic nature of the person taking the time to be there,'' she said. 
 And there are benefits for the business traveler. People like to complain about traveling, but in fact it can be enjoyable and confer status, Professor Mokhtarian said. True, ''if it's a routine trip to Nowheresville, then there may not be many side benefits,'' she said. But a visit to an interesting location that includes dinner with a client, a weekend for sightseeing or a side trip to see family and friends can add luster to a job.

HEADLINE: Freddie Mac Seeks Billions More After Big Loss

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Freddie Mac is asking for $10.6 billion in additional federal aid after posting a big loss in the first three months of the year. 
 The new request will bring the total bill for rescuing Freddie Mac, which has been effectively owned by the government since nearly collapsing in September 2008, to $61.3 billion.
 Freddie Mac said Wednesday that it lost $8 billion, or $2.45 a share, in its first quarter. The results compared with a loss of $10.4 billion a year earlier. The most recent quarter includes $1.3 billion in dividends paid to the Treasury Department. 
 The company, however, cautioned that new accounting standards made it difficult to compare the most recent quarter with the year-earlier period. In the first quarter of this year, Freddie Mac was forced to bring $1.5 trillion in assets and liabilities onto its balance sheet, causing the company's net worth to fall by $11.7 billion.
 Nevertheless, the company's chief executive, Charles E. Haldeman Jr., said, ''We are seeing some signs of stabilization in the housing market, including house prices and sales in some key geographic areas.''
 Mr. Haldeman cautioned, though, that the housing market ''remains fragile with historically high delinquency and foreclosure levels'' and high unemployment.
 Created by Congress, Freddie Mac and its sibling company, Fannie Mae, buy mortgages from lenders and package them into bonds that are resold to global investors. As the housing bubble burst, they were unable to raise enough money to stay afloat, and the government effectively nationalized them.
 The total taxpayer bill for both is now about $136 billion.

HEADLINE: The Long Reach of a Foreign Crisis

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE AND ROB COX

 BODY:
The United States is a great distance from Greece, and its economy is moving in a better direction. But the subprime crisis showed how fast and how far local financial problems can spread. If the euro zone gets into real trouble, the United States may be safe-ish, but it can't hope to escape unscathed.
 American investors got a sampling this week of what further deterioration in the euro zone could taste like. On the good side, investors rushed into perceived harbors: the dollar and Uncle Sam's own debt. On the bad side, the swoon in prices of American shares and corporate debt indicated the long reach of a foreign crisis. 
An encumbered euro zone economy isn't good news for global growth, an essential ingredient in the still developing economic recovery in the United States. A new European recession would slow demand for American exports, which would be less competitive in any case, thanks to the crisis-strengthened dollar.
 Then there is the interconnected global financial system. Few envisioned that lax lending standards for subprime loans would start a chain reaction ending in a global crisis and recession.
 The European Union is trying to keep its problems local, by helping Greece and stamping out brush fires breaking out in Portugal and Spain. But troubles could spread rapidly, especially if European politicians balk at offering aid or some banks begin to buckle under their sovereign debt holdings. In a complex system, the woes might rapidly cross borders and oceans.
 The International Monetary Fund's involvement in the bailout also means that the United States is stretching itself further. As the largest shareholder in the fund, it is effectively lending Greece money when private markets will not.
 Of course, the United States government benefits from the crisis in one important way, at least for a while. If Europe were sound, investors would probably be more worried about the American fiscal deficit of $1.5 trillion, even if the latest budget news is more positive. Unfortunately, the ease of placing government debt could give policy makers the idea that huge deficits don't matter. They will, though, a crisis or two from now.
 Art as an Indicator
 Pablo Picasso was never called a financier. But the Spanish artist can now claim to teach a financial lesson. The $106.5 million sale of his ''Nude, Green Leaves and Bust,'' a record price for the one-day masterpiece, underlines the disparate fortunes of the financial and the real economy.
 Though Christie's did not reveal the painting's buyer, it was almost certainly an oligarch or hedge fund mogul. The auction house's chief pointed to ''depth of buying from Russia, China and the Middle East.'' Christie's brought in nearly 30 percent more than the bottom of its expectations from the New York sale of 56 artworks.
 Moreover, the gaggle of emerging market heavyweights like Roman Abramovich of Russia were said to be bidding against some of the hedge fund world's most prolific collectors, including the Citadel Investment founder Ken Griffin and the Connecticut billionaire trader Steven Cohen.
 Although consumers in much of the world are still limping out of recession, the auction extravaganza is not all that surprising. The real world may still be licking its wounds, but the financial economy is in fine fettle.
 Robust prices for financial assets may reflect easy money or hopes that the recent evidence of economic strength in the United States has entered a sort of V-shaped recovery. But whatever the reason, junk bonds are back at par for the first time in three years and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained nearly a third since last May's art sales. Then, Sotheby's fetched a quarter less than its presale low estimates and failed to find buyers for a Picasso painting and a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti.
 There were unsold pieces at Tuesday's auction, suggesting that any bubble in the art market is concentrated around stars like Picasso. That, too, stands to reason, particularly in a period where currencies are perceived to be vulnerable to sovereign mishap or rising inflation. As financial theorists argue, specie backing for money does not have to have any intrinsic value, just a shared appreciation. And so the global financial elite have found their store of value -- in a nude mistress from Paris.

HEADLINE: For Some Plying the Road, Two Wheels Are Plenty

BYLINE: By DEXTER FORD

 BODY:
PICTURE a Hollywood agent powering to a power lunch. ''Entourage'' has done it for us: an expensive convertible, an iPhone and dialogue devoted equally to schmoozing and screaming. 
 But for Erwin More, an actual talent agent whose clients include film and television actors whose names you'd recognize in a second, traveling for work is closer to a clip from ''Roman Holiday.'' He rides his Vespa through the midsection of Los Angeles every sunny workday, from his home in manicured Hancock Park to the Paradigm Agency's offices in Beverly Hills. 
 And when he has to take in a meeting outside the area, Mr. More is far less likely to climb into his automobile than he is to strap on a helmet and rev up his scooter, an LXV 150. 
 ''About three years ago, I accidentally-on-purpose mentioned to my wife that I wanted a Vespa, and she surprised me at Christmas,'' said Mr. More, 52. ''I love it. It was a life-changing experience. 
 ''Jumping onto the scooter, as opposed to getting in my car, forces me to step away from my phone and e-mail and BlackBerry. It can save me about 10 minutes, depending on traffic, in what's usually a 25-minute trip by car. And it's incredibly fun, when I have a meeting, to get out and hop on the bike.'' 
 It's not for everybody, but traveling on two wheels has become increasingly attractive: parking is a snap, and you can thread through even the most knotted city traffic. 
 Thanks to an ever-expanding worldwide network of motorcycle rental companies, it's now possible to hop on a motorcycle or scooter in many major and many minor cities, be it Sedona, Ariz., or St. Tropez, France. 
 Eaglerider Motorcycle Rental, which started out in 1992 renting three Harley-Davidsons from a Los Angeles garage, now rents more than 3,500 motorcycles in Europe, North America and Australia. 
 On your next import-export foray to Turkey, would you like to pick up a Harley Sportster in Istanbul and work your way along the Mediterranean to drop it off in Nice? No problem. 
 If you have a spare week after a sales convention in Munich and have a hankering to see the Alps from the seat of a Ducati Multistrada, Edelweiss Bike Travel, an Austrian company that has pioneered expert-guided motorcycle tours all around the world, will be happy to set you up. 
 The late Malcolm Forbes may well have been history's most outrageous motorcycle-borne business traveler. He planned and sponsored lavish, Harley-Davidson-mounted trips in the '80s, ostensibly conceived to publicize Forbes magazine, to whatever exotic locale he had an urge to see, including Turkey, Russia, China, Pakistan and the edge of the Arctic. His personal motorcycle gang -- whomever he invited on his tours -- was known as the Capitalist Tools. 
 Business journalists and motorcycle-press writers were routinely invited along to generate publicity for Mr. Forbes and his enterprises. One rookie Motorcyclist Magazine associate editor, Nick Ienatsch, was picked up by Mr. Forbes's personal DC-9 airliner at Los Angeles International Airport for an all-expenses-paid Capitalist Tools tour of Turkey, just weeks after he had quit his job as a Salt Lake City motorcycle mechanic. 
 Riding a motorcycle or scooter, especially in a strange foreign country, takes more skill, experience, commitment and courage than simply renting a Camry. If you are not a veteran motorcyclist or scooterist, you owe it to yourself and your dependents to get the right training and riding gear. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation's rider course, which you can take in most major American cities, is a well-regarded way to get your feet wet -- and pass your state motorcycle license test. A good full-faced helmet, meeting the standards of the federal Department of Transportation or the Economic Commission for Europe, is a must. 
 Peter Goodwin, an advertising executive in Manhattan Beach, Calif., takes a motorcycle when he's out scouting locations for photo shoots. He also rides with clients on weekends, and, sometimes, commutes on two wheels.
 ''When I'm traveling in a car -- no matter how great a car it is -- I'm cut off from the world around me,'' he said. ''On my KTM I'm actually touching my surroundings. 
 ''That works for me. I have found, again and again, that on my bike my mind is free to interconnect in ways it wouldn't if I said to myself, 'O.K., come up with something ... now.' ''

HEADLINE: Air Security Gets Faster, But at Price Of Privacy

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 AVIATION security is getting less cumbersome, but more intrusive.
 In 2009, 99.5 percent of passengers waited less than 20 minutes, according to the Transportation Security Administration, and more than 85 percent waited less than 10 minutes. In 2007, a bad year, 96.9 percent waited less than 20 minutes. Lines are moving faster partly because passengers now know the drill -- they empty their pockets, take off their shoes and put their toiletries in resealable bags without needing to be told -- and partly because screeners have gotten faster at identifying and dealing with objects that look suspicious on X-ray, specialists say.
 The fastest approach to speeding passengers through an airport checkpoint may be a future technology that sees through passengers' clothes, but many people object to the routine use of a technology that undresses passengers through imaging. The T.S.A. already uses such scanners, which require a traveler to stand in a booth with arms raised. Security experts hope for a walk-through process instead. 
 Scrutiny is getting tighter in other ways as well. People lining up to go through a checkpoint are being observed more closely -- by security agents with psychological training, to help spot people whose behavior suggests they are up to no good. 
 An approach that offered frequent travelers a path to the head of the line was dropped last year, when a company called Verified Identity Pass abruptly closed. Among the reasons was that the number of passengers willing to pay $100 to $200 a year to avoid long lines was never more than a few hundred thousand, while the planners had anticipated millions. A company that bought the database of the original program hopes to revive it in the fall. 
 On the one hand, Roger Cohen, the president of the Regional Airline Association, said, the lines were not so bad, and he let his membership in the Verified Identity Pass program lapse before the company went bankrupt. Changes like having passengers check in and obtain boarding passes at automated kiosks or by computer from home have helped ease congestion, he added. 
 On the other, he said, security inspections ''clearly had a debilitating, depressing effect on people's travel habits.'' 
 The impact is clearest in the data about short flights, where driving is a realistic alternative. In close-city pairs, air traffic has dropped sharply. 
 Looking only at passengers who were not transferring from other flights, traffic between Atlanta and Jacksonville, Fla., was down 41 percent from 2000 through 2009, according to OAG, the organization that used to be called the Official Airline Guide. It was down 47.4 percent between Pittsburgh and Washington and 58.1 percent between Chicago and Cleveland, 
 Traffic between New York and Washington fell by 53.4 percent, and between New York and Boston 48.8 percent, again counting only passengers whose trip was from one city to the other. Amtrak service between those cities improved over the period and Amtrak captured more of the market -- although rail passengers, too, are now sometimes pulled aside by T.S.A. agents, and their belongings searched. 
 While the airlines have reduced capacity on all routes, they have reduced the number of seats on short routes most. From 2000 to 2010, the number of seats on flights under 250 miles was cut by 42.2 percent, compared with 17.2 percent for all flights. The number of such short flights was cut by 46.9 percent, compared with 18.5 percent over all.
 Whatever progress has been made, the challenges are not all in the past. The attempt on Christmas by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to bring down a Northwest jet approaching Detroit from Amsterdam is a reminder of that. Security precautions failed to detect him in advance but did force him to try a small bomb, hidden in his underwear. Since that episode, the T.S.A. has begun swabbing the palms of some travelers to look for signs of explosives, and conducting more security checks at the gate, after passengers have cleared the checkpoints, to look for trouble. 
 But these changes may not mean much to passenger convenience, said Kip Hawley, who led the T.S.A. in the Bush administration, because the factor that determines the speed of the line is usually how fast the security agents can scan carry-on bags. About all a business traveler can do, he said, is, ''if somebody wants to come up to me and swab my palm, I've got to be a good sport.'' 
 Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group, said security would only get more thorough. ''Security is recession-proof,'' he said. ''It's global and it's growing.''

HEADLINE: New Assistant Takes Over As Hofstra Basketball Coach

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

 BODY:
A tumultuous off-season for college basketball in the New York metropolitan area has yielded its share of bizarre coaches' stories, from the implosion of Fred Hill at Rutgers to the arrest of Hofstra's newly hired Tim Welsh to the rebirth of Steve Lavin at St. John's. 
 But perhaps the final stop on the carousel may be the most unexpected. Hofstra announced on Wednesday that it was hiring the assistant Mo Cassara to replace Welsh, who resigned on Monday after being arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated. 
 Cassara found himself unemployed when Boston College surprisingly fired Coach Al Skinner in late March. After he landed at Hofstra to be an assistant for Welsh, Cassara appeared destined to be looking for work again. 
 ''I never expected to be here,'' he said. 
 Instead, the 36-year-old Cassara signed a multiyear deal Wednesday to become the Pride's coach. Since being hired as an assistant five weeks ago, he has lived in a dorm on campus. His future was so uncertain that he said he had spent the past few nights making lists of people to call about jobs. 
 ''I'm devastated about the way that this job presented itself,'' said Cassara, who has known Welsh for years. 
 The hiring of Cassara was surprising considering that he was the third assistant at Boston College. He does have college head-coaching experience, however, with two years at Division III Clark University in Worcester, Mass., from 2004-6. He also served as the head coach at Worcester Academy, where he mentored the future N.B.A. players Jarrett Jack and Craig Smith. 
 Cassara said he would retain Hofstra's new staff, which includes the former longtime Providence assistant Steve DeMeo and the former Syracuse point guard Allen Griffin. 
 Hofstra returns a strong nucleus and will be among the favorites to win the Colonial Athletic Association next season. 
 ''We want to build on what Jay Wright and Tom Pecora have done here,'' Cassara said.

HEADLINE: Changing Times and Money Woes Doom a Military School

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CORNWALL-On-HUDSON, N.Y.
 The names, if they're remembered at all, mostly linger in dim memories of old magazine advertisements featuring the stern faces of young uniformed cadets: LaSalle Military Academy, Peekskill Military Academy, Dr. Holbrook's Military School, Poughkeepsie Military Institute, Silver Lake Military & Naval School.
 More than 40 military schools, once a staple of American education, have closed their doors over the decades in New York State. One still exists, the New York Military Academy, seven miles from West Point, founded in 1889. Its alumni, dubious and grand, include Donald J. Trump and Stephen Sondheim, the bandleader Les Brown, John A. Gotti Jr. and many others who became leaders in business, the military and the arts. 
 But with an enrollment that has dropped from a peak of 525 in the 1960s to 145 now, it probably won't exist much longer. Its trustees announced last month that the school would suspend operations at the end of the school year, a victim of the recession, its own missteps, lack of support from its alumni and changing times. 
 The academy, with its stained-glass chapel, can-do messages chiseled into oak, shuttered dorms, empty stables and uniformed cadets scurrying by reflects a national trend: the perhaps 400 military prep schools that once existed have shrunk to about 25. Still, administrators and cadets say that economic more than educational issues are killing places like N.Y.M.A., and that they will leave a hole when they go.
 ''If you ask if we're relevant, and we're needed, I can emphatically answer, 'Yes,' '' said Capt. Robert D. Watts, the first naval officer and the first black to serve as superintendent. ''We have a plan to move forward, but unfortunately, we're running out of time, and we're running out of money.''
 Trustees announced the closing after several years of financial problems and near-death experiences. They said they needed $7 million to pay down debt, increase enrollment and put the school on a sustainable path. Officials hold out slim hopes that alumni will come up with enough money to avert a shutdown or restart the school if it closes. 
 At issue are college preparatory military schools, not boot camps, and the reasons for the decline are many. Once a familiar part of the journey from boyhood to manhood, military schools now are often seen as harsh, punitive and outdated. Falling enrollment set off a vicious cycle of inadequate outreach and maintenance. The recession took a particular toll on schools like N.Y.M.A. with no endowment and limited resources for financial aid. Private day schools offer increasing competition.
 Captain Watts and others say military academies made a critical error decades ago when they positioned themselves as tough-love institutions for troubled youths. Advertisements for N.Y.M.A. decades ago asked parents to send broken young men to be fixed and polished. That was an off-putting message, led students to leave once they were ''fixed'' and created an atmosphere that helped lead to a series of hazing episodes more than five years ago that were a public-relations catastrophe. 
 Officials say the school has turned around and refocused on its mission of providing structure, discipline and leadership skills for college-bound students who want and need it. The school says 100 percent of its graduates go on to college, and it will not accept applicants it considers unduly troubled. The military aspects are a means, not an end, to support educational achievement, said Captain Watts, who was brought in after the hazing episodes.
 ''The model we use is about character and leadership; we're not developing little soldiers,'' he said. ''We use a positive developmental model. The days of yelling and screaming at young people and belittling them, that's long gone.''
 That said, the negative image lingers. And the enrollment drop and cash shortage has made it hard for the school to recruit and compete. It offers a single Advanced Placement course, down from four three years back -- not much of an inducement to good students. 
 Most of the 25 or so college prep schools represented by the Association of Military Colleges and Schools of the United States are on sound footing, and some are flourishing. One success is the Culver Military Academy, which is part of the Culver Academies (there is also a nonmilitary school for girls) of Culver, Ind., with 792 students, a $280 million endowment and an international reputation. John Buxton, its head of schools, said Culver went co-ed early, focused on academics and never billed itself as a haven for the troubled. 
 Still, the most galling and perhaps damning thing for N.Y.M.A. is that its own alumni have never been loyal financial supporters. Alumni have a net worth of $2.5 billion, Captain Watts said. But they usually provide no more than 5 percent of the academy's annual funds, leaving it almost totally dependent on tuition, and they haven't stepped up as the school faces a shutdown.
 Gabriel Tiffany-Miller, the first captain or leader of the cadets, said the school's biggest problem was the misperception that it was a boot camp for troubled youth. ''I think people just don't understand what we do,'' he said. ''I wish people would come and see it with their own eyes.'' 
 He said graduation would be a bittersweet experience. ''If it's the last one, we'll be walking out with our heads down,'' he said. 
 ''No,'' Captain Watts added quickly. ''You need to always walk with your head up.''

HEADLINE: Community's Recovery Still Incomplete After Exxon Valdez Spill

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
CORDOVA, Alaska -- As the oil spill spreads ominously in the Gulf of Mexico, its impact uncertain, communities here beside Prince William Sound are still confronting the consequences of March 24, 1989, the day of the wreck of the Exxon Valdez. 
 The tanker Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil, staining 1,500 miles of coastline, killing hundreds of thousands of seabirds, otters, seals and whales, and devastating local communities. The spill stopped after just a few days. Recovery may not have an end date. 
 Fishing here is far from what it was. Suicides and bankruptcies and bitterness surged. Many people left even as a few became ''spillionaires,'' getting paid to clean up. 
 A new industry took hold: environmental groups, scientific organizations, experts in the psychological trauma of oil spills. A network of fishermen is now trained and paid by the oil industry to respond if another disaster strikes. 
 Lawyers, fishermen and environmentalists in the gulf are now calling, looking for guidance in areas like how to harness political anger over the spill and the most effective ecological triage. National news crews are chartering planes to nearby islands to see how oil still coats rocks just below the surface all these years later. 
 Fishermen recount once again their complicated journeys from the spill to the payments they received just last year from a punitive damages judgment of about $500 million against Exxon in 1994. 
 People here say they want to move on. 
 ''You've got one jaded group of people in this town,'' Sylvia Lange, who worked her first fishing boat at 14 and now runs a hotel overlooking the water. ''First it was the 10th anniversary, then the 20th and now this.''
 Cordova is a reluctant touchstone, still trying to figure out how to respond to the event that defines it for much of the outside world. This year, officials hope to break ground on an ambitious new museum that will replace the frayed scrapbooks of news clippings that now rest on a table near dugout canoes and tools used for gold mining in a room connected to the local library.
 ''We don't even have an exhibit about the spill, and yet it's the most-asked question we get,'' said Cathy Sherman, who runs the current museum and library. ''Nobody even wanted to be reminded of it here.''
 Ms. Sherman said the new museum, which has secured about $18 million in financing from the state and other sources, will tell the story of the spill through objects, including a piece of the Valdez hull. But it will also try to show ''what we learned,'' she added.
 The lessons continue, even after books and dissertations have been written, documentaries made, songs composed and case studies completed. The mountain views are still stunning but the herring fishery is gone, the king and Dungeness crabs, too. Prawns are coming back, but just barely. The loss of the herring industry over the years since the spill has cost the region about $400 million, said R. J. Kopchak of the Prince William Sound Science Center, although some blame cyclical patterns or other factors for the change, not the spill. 
 Much of a generation chose paths other than fishing, though some younger people have decided to take their chances. 
 Makena O'Toole, 24, said his earliest memory from childhood was of the paralyzing moment his father, a fisherman, heard that the Valdez tanker had crashed into Bligh Reef. Now, even with the famed Copper River sockeye that spawn here, Mr. O'Toole said, ''This is still not a place to be a fisherman.''
 Mr. O'Toole said he plans to move south in September, to fish out of Sitka, where he said the fishery was more abundant ''because there wasn't an oil spill there.'' 
 In December, Exxon sent the last of a nearly $500,000 payment to John Platt, but Mr. Platt said he never saw it. Straight to the state and the bank it went, to clear the liens on his boats and his fishing permits, to dig out of the debt he accumulated, some through his own admitted missteps, in the two decades since the wreck of the Valdez. 
 The payments were initially supposed to be much higher, before Exxon successfully fought, all the way to the Supreme Court, to have them reduced.
 ''The money was supposed to bring closure,'' Mr. Platt said. ''Deep down inside I was really banking on it, but it didn't happen.''
 Most people received far less money than Mr. Platt and other fishermen who were able to document strong catches in the years before the spill. Others opted out of the sprawling class-action suit.
 Ms. Lange said her family dropped out of the suit and moved to western Alaska to work in the fishing industry there for several years after the spill. 
 ''We made the conscious decision that we were no longer going to be victims,'' she said. ''I could see my whole life going into the spill.''
 Empathy is high here for those closest to the spill in the gulf. Perhaps economic disaster still can be averted, some say. Maybe the fact that the Gulf Coast is so much more accessible than Prince William Sound will help. Maybe its economies will prove diverse enough to handle whatever hit comes. Maybe the warmer water will help disperse the oil. Maybe the fact that, unlike here, the oil spilling in the gulf is being emulsified somewhat as it rises from 5,000 feet below.
 But most people here said they thought that at least some communities in the gulf would begin a painful journey with no clear conclusion.
 Two years ago, Mike Webber, a fisherman here who also does native carvings, unveiled a ''shame pole'' he had made to protest Exxon's actions during and after the spill. The pole depicted dead eagles, herring with lesions, the head of an Exxon executive, upside down. 
 Now, Mr. Webber said, ''People keep telling me to do a healing pole, but I can't come up with any characters for it.''

HEADLINE: Need a Little Nap in the Terminal? Get a Room!

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
NEVER have so many travelers needed a collective nap as they did in April when the ill winds blew across Europe from a spewing Icelandic volcano.
 A few fortunate ones were able to book accommodations in nearby airport hotels and in terminal pod hotels like Yotel, whose locations at Gatwick and Heathrow airports in London and Schiphol in Amsterdam are often full, said Jo Berrington, its marketing director. 
 The rest of the hapless travelers who decided to wait out the ash for days made do on terminal floors, cots and uncomfortable chairs. The sight of so many people desperate for shut-eye brought into sharp relief the fact that airports, for the most part, are not intended for long stays. 
 ''Sleeping at an airport is never an easy thing to do,'' said Michael Breus, author of ''Beauty Sleep.'' The task is born of necessity, typically due to delays or cancellations, which in turn makes travelers anxious or angry, he said, adding, ''It's never good.'' 
 Resourceful travelers will go wherever they can -- a quiet corner, a chapel, a pay-by-the-day airport lounge, a spa massage recliner, a rented workstation desk -- to lay down their weary heads. 
 Those willing to pay a premium for privacy, quiet and comfort have more options on concourses beyond the security gate. For Yotel customers, who have ranged in age from 16 to 90, Ms. Berrington said, ''it's all about location and value and quality.'' 
 Rates in London range from $:25 ($38) for a four-hour minimum stay to $:80 ($123) for 24 hours. Amenities include en suite bathrooms with rain showers, beds with organic mattresses, flat-screen TVs, free Wi-Fi and workstation, food and drink service. A standard cabin is about seven feet by nine feet.
 The goal is affordable luxury, Ms. Berrington said. ''We don't want to make people feel it's exclusive,'' she said. ''It's for everyone.''
 Yotel is expanding its London space to add more cabins and a minilounge for guests to socialize. The company is looking for available space in United States airports, Ms. Berrington said. Meanwhile, it is building a 669-cabin hotel at 42nd Street and 10th Avenue in Manhattan, which is expected to open next year.
 The idea of providing high-end short-stay accommodations for airline travelers is catching on in the United States. At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Minute Suites opened in November, offering five private rooms, with a daybed sofa, workstation, DirecTV and sound-suppression system. The rate is $30 for the first hour and $7.50 for each additional 15-minute period.
 Guests are offered hot towels to refresh themselves, but must leave Minute Suites to use the nearby restroom on Concourse B. For economic reasons, said Daniel Solomon, a founder and managing partner, Minute Suites decided not to provide showers. Once showers are involved, he said, the business is considered a hotel and the guest is taxed as such. 
 Research suggested customers would rather nap, work, watch television or browse the Internet, he said. 
 Jason Philbrick of Minneapolis stopped by recently for a nap and paid for an hour and a half. He said the price was reasonable, the service professional and the suites more than adequate.
 ''They had white noise, which I found worked somewhat successfully,'' he said, though he did feel vibrations from the planes. The suite ''is not spartan; on the other hand, it's not sumptuous,'' Mr. Philbrick said. ''I think they went down the middle there and probably hit a good balance.'' 
 Minute Suites plans to add a second location in the Atlanta airport and is talking with other airports as well, Mr. Solomon said.
 Later this year, in a postsecurity space at the San Francisco International Airport, Unique Retreat plans to open with 15 to 20 private sleeping units. The rate for the rooms is expected to be similar to Minute Suites, according to Greg Lovett, founder and chairman.
 Amenities will include soundproofing, HDTV, free Internet, workstation, personal temperature controls, ''intelligent lighting'' and full-size luxury bedding. Bathrooms and showers will eventually be available, though not in the rooms, Mr. Lovett said.
 Unique Retreat is talking with 11 other airports, he said, that are looking to add short-term stay locations. ''It really is the hot topic in the industry. There's an absolute need for this type of service, and it benefits everyone.''
 According to a 2009 report from the Brookings Institution, there has been a 20-year trend of increasing flight delays. The average length of United States flight delays rose to 56.5 minutes in June 2009, from 40.9 minutes in 1990, the report found. Those more than two hours late more than doubled in that period to 10.1 percent of all delays. 
 ''The sad reality,'' said Mr. Lovett, ''is it's getting worse.'' Having a convenient retreat affords travelers a necessary escape route, he said, ''to maintain some sanity.''
 Here are a few of the latest short-stay options for travelers:
 CABINS Designer capsule-type hotels inside security like Yotel at Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London and Schiphol airport in Amsterdam. Hourly or overnight stays can be booked, with a four-hour minimum. En suite bathroom. www.yotel.com.
 MICRO ROOMS Rent-by-the hour micro rooms like Minute Suites inside security at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The rate is $30 for the first hour and $7.50 for each additional 15-minute period. No bathroom. www.minutesuites.com.
 PLANNED Unique Retreat, which is expected to open 15 to 20 private rooms later this year inside security at the San Francisco International Airport. The rate will be similar to Minute Suites. Bathrooms will be available in the second phase of construction. www.uniqueretreatllc.com.

HEADLINE: A Bank's Ads, Dressed Up in Historical Garb

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
EARLY in the first installment of ''America: The Story of Us,'' the 12-hour documentary series on the History cable channel that began on April 25 and covers 400 years of United States history, an actor depicting a British soldier bumps into another depicting Paul Revere, and the narrator Liev Schreiber says, ''When revolution comes to North America, Revere will be at the center of it.'' 
 Viewers might be momentarily confused when the screen goes dark, signaling a commercial break, only to light up again with men dressed in colonial garb on the cobblestone streets of Boston. The scene cuts to a bow-tied historian named K. C. Johnson, who tells an interviewer, ''American colonies before the revolution existed for the economic good of the mother country,'' and then to another historian, Steve Gillon, who adds, ''The British used money as a way of keeping the Americans down.'' Then, to a triumphant flourish of music, the Bank of America logo appears, along with the screen text, ''Fueling progress, creating opportunity, building on our heritage.'' 
 The first half of the two-minute spot, produced by the History Channel for Bank of America, the sponsor of the series, reveals the historical significance of the Massachusetts Bank, founded in 1784 and counting among its customers Paul Revere and John Hancock (and, owing to a series of acquisitions, part of Bank of America's historical DNA). The second half of the commercial focuses on present-day New Bedford, Mass., where the mayor, Scott W. Lang, and other residents praise Bank of America for making loans for revitalization efforts.
 The History Channel is producing 12 two-minute videos for Bank of America, each beginning in the same era as the episode, then jumping to a current example of the bank's civic-mindedness. Representatives of the bank and the cable network do not describe the videos as commercials, preferring the terms ''mini-documentaries'' or ''interstitial content.''
 ''When the History Channel came to us with this opportunity, it was a neat fit because we are inextricably linked to pivotal points in U.S. history,'' said Meredith Verdone, senior vice president of brand, advertising and research at Bank of America. ''Our legacy as a company is that we have always fueled opportunity.''
 Another part of that legacy, of course, is Bank of America's role in the financial crisis, borrowing $45 billion in government bailout money and agreeing to pay $150 million to settle charges that it failed to disclose losses and bonus payouts at Merrill Lynch while acquiring the company in 2008. While Bank of America does not address such issues in the mini-documentaries, one story featured during an episode about the Depression highlights that Bank of America helped finance construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, one of the public works projects that helped the country rebound. 
 Both then and today, said Joseph L. Goode, a Bank of America spokesman, ''you see a company like Bank of America acknowledge the industry's mistakes but then step up and help the country move forward.'' In the spots, which will run only during the documentary series, the bank makes repeated references to plans over the next decade to lend $1.5 trillion for community development projects and to contribute $2 billion to charitable causes.
 Bank of America spent roughly $4 million to $5 million on the campaign, according to Ms. Verdone. It spent a total of $464 million on advertising in 2009 and $618 million in 2008, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP that tracks ad spending.
 The first night of the mini-series, which will be shown in two-hour installments each week through May 30, drew 5.7 million viewers, the largest audience in the network's history. 
 It is not the first time the History Channel has produced what its president, Nancy Dubuc, called in an interview ''interstitial content that highlights their brand in terms of whatever show we're in at the time.'' 
 A Verizon commercial that had its premiere in March during ''Ax Men,'' the reality series about logging crews, was shot in a documentary style and featured loggers using a shock- and water-resistant phone. 
 As for the Bank of America campaign, Mary Bottari, editor of BanksterUSA.org, a Wall Street watchdog Web site published by the Center for Media and Democracy, called it ''greedwashing,'' a play on the term greenwashing, used to describe companies with questionable environmental practices that employ advertising and public relations to appear more earth-friendly.
 ''These types of efforts to remake your image after getting pummeled in the financial crisis are happening all over the place,'' said Ms. Bottari. She cited as examples the Goldman Sachs announcement in November that it would spend $500 million helping small businesses, and a JPMorgan Chase program last year awarding $25,000 each to 100 charitable organizations, based on votes on Facebook.
 Decidedly more enthusiastic about Bank of America's generosity is the History Channel itself, which benefited not only from the bank buying advertising during the series but also promoting it, both by highlighting it on the Bank of America Web site and by showing trailers on video monitors in more than 1,000 bank branches. 
 ''Clearly when you set out to do a series as ambitious as this you're taking not only a ratings risk but an economic risk as well,'' Ms. Dubuc, the History Channel president, said. ''So when something this size comes to life and comes closer to airing we hoped that an advertiser would see the value in it that we did, and Bank of America was a natural partner for us.''

HEADLINE: Back on The Road, But on a Shoestring

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
BUSINESS travel has often been depicted with a dash of style and adventure. Think of Eva Marie Saint in ''North by Northwest,'' the various James Bond movies, or George Clooney in ''Up in the Air.''
 Boarding a railcar, ocean liner or jet seemed to be a reward in itself.
 Tell that to today's typical traveler, who takes a bus to the airport, pays through the nose for a sack of takeout food before boarding the plane and totes everything from laptop to a change of socks in a single bag.
 This is the state of business travel, spring 2010. The good news for the travel industry, analysts say, is that companies are loosening purse strings after a tough year and a half. But for now, the emphasis is on putting off the Ritz. 
 When and if the comforts of the past return depend on how much businesses are willing to spend and what concessions they can wring out of airlines, whose profits now depend on charging for amenities as basic as pillows. 
 Despite technology that allows travelers to book a ticket online, check in at a kiosk and even slide a bag through a screening machine without removing their computer, delays, added costs and crowds are now a normal part of the experience.
 ''Companies are not saying, 'It's O.K. to stay at the Ritz.' They are keeping a very keen eye on expenses because of any unforeseen circumstance,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research.
 On her most recent trip to London, Meredith E. Rutledge, an assistant curator at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland who often sets out in search of valuable memorabilia, combined three activities that in the past might have called for individual visits.
 She hunted for new artifacts for the hall's sprawling displays; collected costumes worn by the Supremes from a museum in Newcastle, England, for shipment back to Cleveland, and met with members of the Hollies and ABBA to prepare for the bands' induction in March.
 Instead of booking a hotel, however, Ms. Rutledge stayed with family, and instead of cabs she used the subway to get around town.
 ''We're a nonprofit organization, and we must always be prudent,'' Ms. Rutledge said.
 A new study by Forrester found that about 10 percent fewer business travelers booking online are expected to hit the road in 2010 compared with 2008. That's a significant improvement from 2009, when business travel slumped by 25 percent from 2008 in the throes of the recession. But budgets are staying tight, the review of more than 4,000 business travelers showed.
 More than half of those who responded said they expected their companies to spend the same amount in 2010 as they did last year, and an additional one-fourth of those companies are continuing to scrutinize spending for ways to cut back.
 The scare caused by a terrorism incident on a plane trying to land in Detroit at Christmas and the ash cloud from the Icelandic volcano that snarled European travel in April ''couldn't have come at a worse time, because we are finally seeing meaningful business travelers return to the skies,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. 
 Those uncertainties are part of the reason companies are waiting as long as they can to approve travel and why business travelers are booking much closer to their travel dates than in the past.
 According to research by the Travel Leaders Group, a national travel agency, almost all domestic trips are booked within two weeks or less, and about three-quarters of international travel is booked within three weeks or less.
 In an earlier time, those travelers might have expected to pay higher prices than if they had booked sooner. But travel Web sites have made it possible to hunt for last-minute bargains, while corporate travel departments are learning to bargain hard with airlines, not just on fares but on perks.
 But the fees charged by airlines on everything from bags to window seats are making it hard for companies to figure out what the real cost of a plane ticket will be. 
 That could be a reason some travelers are forgoing airplanes. In 2008, two-thirds of travelers said that they had taken a plane trip for business at least once during the last 12 months, according to Forrester. By the first quarter of 2010, that had fallen to 58 percent, and a growing number of travelers chose simply to drive their own cars, the Forrester numbers show.
 Luke Song, a high-fashion milliner based in suburban Detroit, is among them. This spring, he drove to Louisville, about 360 miles from Detroit, ''because I wanted to travel in comfort,'' he said. 
 Despite his expanding business -- he has sold hundreds of hats similar to the one he designed for Aretha Franklin to wear at President Obama's inaugural, and his work has appeared in countless magazines as well as in the Detroit Institute of Arts -- Mr. Song is keeping a lid on expenses. 
 This year, for the first time in 12 years, Mr. Song skipped the industry's biggest millinery trade show, meeting instead with buyers whom he encouraged to travel to his showroom. 
 Ms. Rutledge also does her best to convince donors to visit the Rock Hall in Cleveland, which she calls an ''important tool'' in her efforts to land new exhibits -- and save money on travel. 
 ''We often try to get people to come to us instead of vice versa,'' she said.
 Mr. Song and Ms. Rutledge said they constantly keep an eye on airfares, which threaten to creep up again this summer because of rising oil prices.
 In late April, the German airline Lufthansa said it was adding $10 to its fuel surcharges of $150 each way on international flights from the United States to Europe. The surcharge is as much as $216 each way to other destinations.
 Mr. Harteveldt said a growing number of companies are pushing airlines to include some of the recently added incremental costs in the fares they negotiate with corporate travel departments.
 For example, airlines might provide a traveler with a voucher for a meal or beverage on a plane, include the price of access to an express security line or a place in a priority-boarding group, giving passengers the first chance at stowing their gear in overhead compartments.
 For airlines, the choice may be between keeping a corporate customer and losing some of the fees that helped offset the 25 percent decline in passengers from 2008 to 2009.
 Continental, which announced on Monday it is merging with United Airlines, estimates it will collect $350 million this year on baggage fees, although Ms. Rutledge is allowed to check a bag free when she checks in using her Continental credit card, because the airline is the Rock Hall's official partner. Industrywide, airlines collected $7.8 billion last year in all manner of fees, collectively called ''ancillary revenue,'' according to the Transportation Department.
 Continental is collecting an additional $100,000 a day by charging economy-class passengers for seats with extra legroom. ''That's revenue we never collected before,'' Jeffery A. Smisek, chief executive at Continental, told analysts and reporters on a conference call in April. Mr. Smisek will run the merged airline.
 The same difficulties experienced by the airlines extend to hotels, but there were signs of improvement in the first quarter. At Marriott International, room nights sold to corporate travelers -- those booked through travel departments -- rose 16 percent in the first quarter from the same period in 2009, and they were up 21 percent in March alone. Rooms booked by those attending meetings rose 15 percent in the quarter and 50 percent just in March.
 ''The recovery is clearly occurring faster than we anticipated,'' Arne M. Sorenson, Marriott's president, told analysts in April. But Mr. Sorenson remains cautious. ''Hotel demand is highly correlated to the economy,'' he said, and high unemployment is still cause for concern.
 Given that his business is based in Detroit, where his customers have cut back on many luxury purchases, although not his hats, Mr. Song has learned to keep things lean. 
 When he does fly, it is strictly in coach, and he carries only a rolling suitcase and a laptop bag. To save money on baggage fees, and avoid losing his designs, he ships his cases of sample hats and materials ahead to his clients, which include celebrities like Paris Hilton and boutiques worldwide.
 Even Mr. Song's streamlined approach is more than many travelers try these days, however. Many are making do with a single bag that holds both computer and a week's worth of gear.
 ''Travelers are taking papers, electronics, cords, files, computers and clothing, and they need it to fit and be organized,'' said Candyce Johnson, vice president for marketing and merchandising at Eagle Creek, a popular maker of business luggage.
 Baggage fees, which major airlines began to charge in 2008, have revolutionized the way business travelers look at luggage. Two years ago, Eagle Creek offered only two styles that were meant to accommodate clothing as well as a laptop. Now, its lineup includes 17 such ''laptop solutions,'' as Eagle Creek calls them, and more are coming in 2011. 
 ''Our customers want intuitive products,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''They don't want to have to think about their bag or their stuff.''
 But they also do not want to be boring. One of Eagle Creek's most popular bags comes in an orange shade the company calls Crush, and consumers are demanding more bags that are not easily identifiable as laptop bags.
 ''If you look in airplanes' overhead bins, you'll see that traditional luggage has lost its relevancy,'' she said.
 Mr. Song is participating in another business travel trend: virtual meetings. Rather than fly to Asia or Europe, which would take at least a week out of his schedule, he does business overseas by e-mail or increasingly, Web conference calls via Skype or virtual conferencing.
 Forrester's research reflects the trend. ''There is a chunk of business travel that existed a few years ago that has gone away and had nothing to do with the recession. It had to do with the strength of technology,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''A lot of business travelers have realized how productive they could be by taking advantage of technology.'' 
 But in some cases, there simply isn't a substitute for hitting the road. ''We've traveled from Birmingham, Alabama, to Birmingham, England, and from Texas to Toronto to Tokyo,'' Ms. Rutledge said. 
 ''When we have the opportunity to acquire an important collection, often we have to travel to see it -- and we find creative ways to make it happen.''

HEADLINE: CBS Posts Smaller Loss In Quarter

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
The CBS Corporation on Wednesday joined other media companies that are climbing out of the crater created by the recession. 
 The company, which owns the CBS television network and local stations, reported a net loss of $26.2 million in the first quarter, an improvement from a loss of $55.3 million a year earlier. Excluding the costs of staff cutbacks and tax charges, CBS said it earned $34.3 million. 
 CBS had little to say about its talks about a news-gathering partnership with CNN. 
 Revenue during the quarter climbed 12 percent, to $3.53 billion. Leslie Moonves, the CBS chief executive, said the increase was the company's first double-digit, year-over-year revenue gain since it was spun off from Viacom at the end of 2005. 
 Mr. Moonves attributed some of the rise in revenue to significant improvements in advertising spending and a ''remarkable turnaround in local broadcasting.'' Groups of local stations had been particularly wounded by advertiser retrenchment, but they now appeared to be rebounding to some degree. One such group, Sinclair, which owns or operates dozens of stations including two CBS affiliates, said Wednesday that its revenue had grown nearly 13 percent last quarter, something it attributed in part to renewed automotive advertising. 
 CBS said its local television and radio stations posted a 19 percent gain in revenue in the quarter, to $606 million. Mr. Moonves, an advocate of so-called retransmission fees paid by cable operators for local stations, said CBS was on pace to collect at least $100 million in retransmission fees this year. 
 Despite the growing revenue from retransmission fees, CBS is more dependent on advertising than other major media companies. The company's total advertising revenue was up 17 percent, to $2.38 billion. About half of that percentage gain, more than $150 million worth, was credited to CBS's broadcast of the Super Bowl in the quarter. The Nielsen Company said the game was the most-watched broadcast ever in the United States. 
 Looking to the second quarter, Mr. Moonves said the upfront advertising sales season that begins later this month ''will be the strongest one in years.'' 
 Separately, Time Warner acknowledged Wednesday that CNN, its cable news arm, could form a partnership with CBS News or another broadcast news division in the near future. 
 Speaking more openly than he has in the past about a possible partnership, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, said that ''it's no secret we've talked to other news organizations'' about news-gathering agreements. 
 He told analysts on a conference call that it was ''entirely possible'' that a deal would be struck in the next 12 months. 
 Time Warner has held talks with CBS and ABC about news-gathering deals over the years, but the talks with CBS have taken on renewed urgency in recent weeks, according to executives briefed on the discussions. 
 Mr. Bewkes said that a deal, if it happened, would be intended to help the broadcaster more than CNN. He specified that Time Warner did not ''have any desire to own a broadcast network.'' 
 Asked about the reports of such an arrangement later on Wednesday, Mr. Moonves spoke broadly. ''We've been talking to CNN for years about what we can do together,'' Mr. Moonves said, citing the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper's role on CBS's ''60 Minutes'' as an example of sharing between the two news outlets. ''We're in constant dialogue about, how do we make our businesses better, how do we make them more efficient, and we will continue to do that.''

HEADLINE: NATO and Europeans Plot Path Ahead

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- An unusual online effort by NATO, the European Union, governments and research groups to ask a broader public for ideas on the future of Western security policy has produced a series of recommendations that call for NATO to develop a civilian arm and the European Union to create its own intelligence agency.
 The discussion, called the 2010 Online Security Jam, brought together some 3,800 people with expertise or interest in trans-Atlantic security issues from 124 countries, who logged in over five days in February for thematic conversations led by many senior officials and scholars in Europe, Russia, China and the United States. 
 The recommendations, which will be released on Friday, will be presented in detail then to NATO's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and to Catherine Ashton, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security. Both NATO and the European Union are preparing new guidelines for their future: NATO, a new strategic concept, and the union, a blueprint for 2020. 
 NATO is working on a new strategic concept to be finished by the NATO summit meeting set for November in Lisbon. It will be the first reworking of NATO's guiding strategy since 1999, and is meant to reinforce its core mission and goals, particularly the idea of collective defense. The strategy must also take into account new challenges from terrorism, online attacks, nuclear proliferation and enhanced missile threats and NATO's experience in fighting wars, in Serbia and Kosovo and Afghanistan. 
 The recommendations have already been provided to separate working groups on both NATO and the European Union.
 Former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is chairwoman of an expert group that has been working to draft a new strategic concept for Mr. Rasmussen, who will make proposals to member governments for consultation. The jam, which is a concept of Internet exchanges pioneered in 2001, is a separate effort to aid those deliberations.
 At the same time, a former Spanish prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, is working on a report examining the European Union in 2020. The Europeans are developing their own diplomatic and military capacity alongside NATO's, and how they work together is a delicate and crucial topic.
 The so-called jam focused on the ways that NATO and the European Union might work together more efficiently for collective security in a more complicated, post-cold-war world.
 Among the senior officials who led the online conversations were Adm. James Stavridis, the supreme allied commander in Europe; Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, former NATO secretary general; Gen. Hakan Syren, chairman of the European Union Military Committee; Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning in the United States State Department; Marc Perrin de Brichambaut, secretary general of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; and Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow Center. The recommendations, which were picked out of the discussions by the organizers, included a more serious effort by NATO to reach beyond its military constituencies to the larger voting public, like through the creation of a civilian branch to cooperate with civilian actors like nongovernmental organizations. 
 Another recommendation was to coordinate better on how to promote ''human security,'' from better governance to combating corruption and the protection of civilian populations and refugees in a battle or continuing conflict.
 Another, indirectly aimed at Russia, proposes that NATO and the European Union develop mutual assistance agreements with nonmembers in the case of environmental disasters or large-scale terrorist attacks.
 There is also a proposal for a European Intelligence Agency to better coordinate individual national intelligence on looming or hybrid issues like environmental threats, energy security and cybersecurity. It could also support specifically European Union military operations.
 Other ideas include the creation of a European Security Academy for European Union military and civilian staff members, improved public diplomacy to reduce the distance many Europeans feel from the union's institutions, a European inventory of scarce natural resources with a mandate to protect them and an international crisis preparatory fund, which might collect 5 percent of donations made to any particular crisis for longer-term preparations.
 Robert E. Hunter, a former American ambassador to NATO and a senior adviser at RAND, praised the security jam for doing ''something that NATO's group of experts has not: to reach beyond the 'usual suspects,' to people who have truly original ideas and a range of analysis.''

HEADLINE: European Criticizes U.S. Raters Of Credit

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union's financial services commissioner, Michel Barnier, vented his frustration with American-based credit ratings agencies Wednesday as Moody's Investors Service put Portugal on review for another possible downgrade that could make it more difficult for the country to service its debt. 
 Mr. Barnier was briefing reporters before his first official visit to the United States, where he will meet next week with Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary. He will also meet with Wall Street leaders like Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.
 Mr. Barnier complained that there were too few debt rating agencies, and he suggested that they were dominated by American owners.
 ''There are not enough ratings agencies, not enough competition and not enough diversity,'' he said. ''Why should there not be an agency that is more European than those that exist today?''
 A decision by Standard & Poor's, also based in the United States, to downgrade Greece's debt to junk status last month enraged European officials, who questioned whether the ratings agencies were accurately assessing how likely it was that countries in the euro zone would default on their sovereign debts.
 Mr. Barnier said it was ''an open question'' whether such an alternative agency should be run by the private sector or by a public body.
 During his trip, Mr. Barnier will question Mr. Blankfein on controversial financial transactions like credit-default swaps as part of gathering information before deciding whether to ban certain practices in Europe, European officials said.
 Another issue for Mr. Barnier is regulation of hedge funds. In March, Mr. Geithner warned him in a letter not to pass a law on hedge funds ''that would discriminate against U.S. firms and deny them the access to the E.U. market that they currently have.''
 Mr. Barnier said Wednesday that he would use his visit to Washington to establish a closer working relationship with Mr. Geithner and to reassure him that he was doing everything he could to pass a law that would not discriminate. But Mr. Barnier said he would explain to Mr. Geithner that the final decision on legislation would be up to European Union governments and the European Parliament.
 Mr. Barnier may also deliver that message to prominent players in the private equity industry, like Henry R. Kravis, a co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, at a dinner Sunday in New York.
 On Monday in Brussels, a powerful committee in the European Parliament is expected to hold a preliminary vote on the proposed law on hedge funds, which could include rules raising the bar for access of foreign funds and fund managers to the European market.

HEADLINE: Two Who Presided Over Bear Stearns Are Questioned on Its Demise

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- A former chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns conceded Wednesday that his investment bank had taken on too much risk before it failed.
 ''That was the business,.'' James E. Cayne, the former chief, said during a nine-hour hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. ''That was, really, industry practice. In retrospect, in hindsight, I would say leverage was too high.''
 Mr. Cayne's admission under questioning came after he and other former Bear Stearns executives testified that market rumors and a classic run on the bank were to blame for the firm's collapse in March 2008, when it was absorbed by JPMorgan Chase. 
 He showed little emotion at the hearing, giving no hint of his reputation for outbursts during his nearly 15 years at the helm of the company before stepping down in January 2008.
 The commission chairman, Phil Angelides, said Bear Stearns seemed to have taken on an extraordinary level of risk involving high leverage, a concentration in mortgage-backed securities and short-term financing of its operations.
 ''There's a form of financial Russian roulette that Bear Stearns was playing along with other investment banks,'' Mr. Angelides said.
 The panel was appointed by Congress to diagnose the causes of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, and it has been holding a series of hearings. It is due to deliver a report to lawmakers and the White House by Dec. 15.
 Congress is already working on a bill to overhaul financial regulation, but Mr. Angelides has said there will still be scope for more reforms, including possible changes to mortgage financing.
 On Thursday, the commission is scheduled to hear from former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the current Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, on financial firms and markets falling outside the traditional bank regulatory structure.
 Mr. Cayne's admission over risk-taking was a departure from the general thrust of testimony by himself and four other Bear Stearns executives. They said the firm's collapse was beyond their control: a wave of rumors and loss of confidence that overwhelmed Bear's risk management models and drained its liquidity in a matter of days.
 ''The market's loss of confidence, even though it was unjustified and irrational, became a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' Mr. Cayne said.
 Similar market fears later in 2008 led to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the reorganization of other major investment banks.
 Mr. Cayne's successor as chief, Alan Schwartz, told the panel he believed the Securities and Exchange Commission did investigate whether market players were manipulating Bear's stock. But Mr. Schwartz said he did not know whether the S.E.C. could separate who had started the rumors against the bank and who was responding to the rumors.
 ''In my heart, I believe something was going on,'' he said.
 The executives were pressed over whether the bank's leverage level and lack of foresight on a looming collapse of the United States mortgage market made it the first major victim of the financial crisis.
 About a month before its collapse, Bear had about $12.5 billion in loans with either deficient or no documentation -- more than the firm's total equity, Mr. Angelides said.
 ''It seems like there were a lot of warnings signs, a lot of red and yellow lights going off,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Facebook And Privacy Clash Again

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
For many users of Facebook, the world's largest social network, it was just the latest in a string of frustrations.
 On Wednesday, users discovered a glitch that gave them access to supposedly private information in the accounts of their Facebook friends, like chat conversations.
 Not long before, Facebook had introduced changes that essentially forced users to choose between making information about their interests available to anyone or removing it altogether.
 Although Facebook quickly moved to close the security hole on Wednesday, the breach heightened a feeling among many users that it was becoming hard to trust the service to protect their personal information. 
 ''Facebook has become more scary than fun,'' said Jeffrey P. Ament, 35, a government contractor who lives in Rockville, Md. 
 Mr. Ament said he was so fed up with Facebook that he deleted his account this week after three years of using the service. ''Every week there seems to be a new privacy update or change, and I just can't keep up with it.''
 Facebook said it did not think the security hole, which was open a few hours, would have a lasting impact on the company's reputation. 
 ''For a service that has grown as dramatically as we have grown, that now assists with more than 400 million people sharing billions of pieces of content with their friends and the institutions they care about, we think our track record for security and safety is unrivaled,'' said Elliot Schrage, the company's vice president for public policy. ''Are we perfect? Of course not.'' 
 Facebook is increasingly finding itself at the center of a tense discussion over privacy and how personal data is used by the Web sites that collect it, said James E. Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers University. 
 ''It's clear that we keep discovering new boundaries of privacy that are possible to push and just as quickly breached,'' Mr. Katz said. 
 Social networking experts and analysts wonder whether Facebook is pushing the envelope in a way that could damage its standing over time. The privacy mishap on Wednesday, first reported by the blog TechCrunch, did not help matters.
 ''While this breach appears to be relatively small, it's inopportunely timed,'' said Augie Ray, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''It threatens to undermine what Facebook hopes to achieve with its network over the next few years, because users have to ask whether it is a platform worthy of their trust.''
 Over the last few months, Facebook has introduced changes that encourage users to make their photos and other information accessible to anyone on the Internet. Last month its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, unveiled plans to begin sharing users' information with some outside Web sites, and Facebook began prompting users to link information in their profile pages, like their hobbies and hometowns, in a way that makes that information public. 
 That last change prompted the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group, to file a complaint on Wednesday with the Federal Trade Commission. 
 ''Facebook continues to manipulate the privacy settings of users and its own privacy policy so that it can take personal information provided by users for a limited purpose and make it widely available for commercial purposes,'' Marc Rotenberg, the group's executive director, said in a letter to the commission. 
 The extent of the discontent among users is hard to quantify, but one measure is a group created on Facebook to protest the recent changes, which has attracted more than 2.2 million members. 
 Mr. Schrage said that the company was aware that some users were not happy with the changes, but that the overall response had been positive. 
 Part of the reason Facebook's recent changes are upsetting users is that, in contrast to a service like Twitter, most people signed up for Facebook with the understanding that their information would be available only to an approved circle of friends, said Danah Boyd, a social media researcher at Microsoft and a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
 ''Facebook started out with a strong promise of privacy,'' she said. ''You had to be at a university or some network to sign up. That's part of how it competed with other social networks, by being the anti-MySpace.'' 
 As the company has changed its approach to privacy, it has introduced new ways for users to adjust their privacy settings. But these tools have grown increasingly convoluted, leaving many users frustrated and unsure of what information is available to whom. They say a site that they joined for the sake of friends and fun has started to feel too much like work.
 ''At this point, I have no idea how many times I've changed my settings,'' said Lauren Snead, a 24-year-old student in Murfreesboro, Tenn. ''I've done it so many times. I'm tired of logging in one day and seeing everything is different and trying to understand what it means.''
 In addition, many users are not even aware of the privacy settings, Ms. Boyd said. A recent survey from Consumer Reports found that 23 percent of Facebook users either did not know the site offered privacy controls or chose not to use them.
 Mr. Schrage said the company was working to clear up confusion about the settings.
 Many frustrated users may not give up on the site because it has become a vital form of communication. Facebook continues to add users at a rapid clip, doubling in size in the last year.
 ''I'm not going to quit Facebook, because it's so ingrained in the culture,'' said Ryan Scannell, a 26-year-old food scientist in Chicago. ''Facebook is not a private place, I don't expect it to be. But at the same time, I'd like to control what's accessible to strangers and what's accessible to family and friends.''
 There are financial motives behind the company's moves. One of the ways Facebook makes money with its free service is by customizing the selection of advertisements shown to individual users. The more information publicly available about users, the more the company can make from such focused ads. 
 In addition, analysts say Facebook may be eyeing the lucrative market for online search, figuring that its users will be more likely to turn to their friends for advice and information than the wider Web. That opens up more opportunities for advertisers.
 ''They're heating up in their battle against Google,'' said Sean Sullivan, a security adviser at the Internet security firm F-Secure who analyzes social networks. ''If I'm looking for a day care for my 6-year-old, I'm going to put that in my status message, not do a Google search.''
 Mr. Schrage of Facebook said the controversy over the site's changes was indicative of a larger shift online. 
 ''Facebook has been made the center of attention around a really important issue of how technology is changing the conception of privacy, control and sharing,'' he said. ''People are uneasy about it, but as they start to see the benefits and advantages of it, they start to see the value of the experiences.''

HEADLINE: Senate Liberals Move to Toughen Bill Regulating Wall Street

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Edward Wyatt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Liberal Democrats in the Senate, emboldened by a wave of populism, are trying to make financial regulatory legislation far tougher on Wall Street, potentially restricting or breaking up the biggest banks and financial companies. 
 Normally such efforts might attract little concern among Senate leaders or the White House. But the confluence of a high-stakes election year and a pervasive anti-Wall Street sentiment after the recession has given liberals unusual muscle in the debate. It has also raised the prospect that they could succeed in reshaping the bill. 
 The liberal amendment that could be hardest to defeat -- and is among the most deeply dreaded by Wall Street -- also has some of the purest populist appeal: a proposal by Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware to break up the nation's biggest banks by imposing caps on the deposits they can hold and limits on other liabilities. 
 ''Look at what we did to AT&T, look at Standard Oil, basically what you do is you just split it apart,'' Mr. Kaufman said in an interview. ''If we don't do that, we have got too big to fail, because when you look at these big complex entities, you cannot resolve them in a major financial crisis.'' 
 Already, antibank rhetoric dominates the debate, which began in earnest this week. Odd as it might seem, liberal Democrats are aligned with conservative Republicans on some issues, further lifting the chances of amendments like one by Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, to audit the Federal Reserve. 
 After President Obama rallied the charge for weeks for tough new rules on Wall Street, the strong push by liberal Democrats is forcing the administration to prevent the bill from getting too tough. It has also shifted the lobbying strategy for financial companies, putting them squarely on the defensive. 
 Some of the liberals view the financial regulatory legislation as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to slap handcuffs on big banks that they have long viewed as greedy. 
 ''I have been a reformer and a watchdog all of my life,'' Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, said in an impassioned floor speech. ''I have a deep suspicion of how big banks treat the little people and what they do with the little people's money.'' 
 ''We bailed out the whales,'' Ms. Mikulski continued. ''We bailed out the sharks, and we have left the people in the community, the little minnows, to swim upstream and be on their own.'' She added, ''Now is the opportunity to pass real financial reform.'' 
 On Tuesday, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, announced that he would support the Brown-Kaufman proposal, which would require some of Wall Street's heaviest hitters, including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, to shrink in size. On Wednesday, the majority leader, Harry Reid, called the proposal ''intriguing.'' 
 White House officials noted that the administration supported some of the liberal amendments, though perhaps not in the precise form in which they are being offered, and would have ample opportunity to shape the final regulatory package when the Senate bill was melded with the version adopted by the House of Representatives last December. 
 But in a preview of the legislative pirouettes that the administration may yet have to perform, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, signaled in Congressional testimony on Tuesday that the White House would work to scale back a provision by Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, that would require big banks to spin off most of their lucrative derivatives business. 
 Mrs. Lincoln, who is facing a difficult re-election campaign this year including a primary challenge by a more liberal Democrat, put forward a much tougher restriction on derivatives than the White House had anticipated. 
 In response to a question, Mr. Geithner said he was not prepared to take a formal position on Mrs. Lincoln's proposal but he said, ''You would not make the system more stable by taking functions that are integral and central to banking and separating and putting them somewhere else. That will create a less stable system.'' 
 Another case in point is the proposal by Mr. Sanders, a self-described socialist, who is feeling bullish about his amendment requiring a public audit of the Fed. Mr. Sanders's idea is opposed by the Fed and the White House, which view it as an encroachment on the central bank's traditional independence.
 Conservative Republicans like David Vitter of Louisiana also support the idea, and Mr. Sanders says he believes he can win the 60 votes needed to attach his proposal to the bill. 
 That, in turn, has the White House and the banking committee chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, scrounging for ideas for a so-called side-by-side amendment -- an alternate proposal on the Fed that would give senators something to support while offering them cover to vote down the Sanders measure. 
 The Senate on Wednesday approved the first amendments to the bill, including one that represented a deal between Mr. Dodd, and Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, intended to prevent future taxpayer-financed bailouts of failed banks. 
 But while that proposal was approved by a vote of 93 to 5, some liberals said it did not go far enough. And the decision by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, to join four conservative Republicans in opposition to the amendment underscored the potential for cooperation of the left and the right in the days ahead. 
 Other proposals that could win bipartisan support is one that would impose the so-called Volcker Rule, barring banks from proprietary trading. Another would reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, approved after the Great Depression, which maintained a firewall between commercial banking and investment banking until Congress repealed it in 1999. 
 Mr. Kaufman said that he was motivated not by populist politics, but by a desire to protect American markets from increased competition overseas. ''I am not coming at this as a populist,'' he said. ''I am going at this as, 'How do we protect our capital markets?' '' He added, ''God does not guarantee that the U.S. be the center of all capital markets.''
 Other senators acknowledged that they were driven by years of conviction that tougher rules were needed for big banks and Wall Street. 
 ''It is time that we pull the sharks out of the tank,'' said Ms. Mikulski, who is one of six senators still in office who voted against repealing Glass-Steagall in 1999. ''Make sure the whales do not crush the little guy, and make sure that the minnows get a chance and that we have an economy that is swimming.''

HEADLINE: Bold Stroke May Be Beyond Europe's Means

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Europe may need a broad cure to its debt crisis, but the increasingly awkward pairing of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund makes such action unlikely. 
 Just three days after a 110 billion euro ($134 billion) bailout of Greece was presented as the latest step to stabilize European markets, the opposite has transpired. Fears have spread through the financial markets that a larger epidemic would infect Spain, Portugal and perhaps other indebted countries outside the euro zone, like Britain and the United States.
 In response, analysts are calling for a shock and awe option -- some rescue of the largest of the peripheral euro zone economies suffering from stagnation and high levels of debt, not unlike the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was created to restore confidence in the American financial system. 
 They suggest that the European Central Bank buy back billions of euros of unwanted Greek, Portuguese and Spanish debt and that the I.M.F. offer a large bailout for Spain. 
 Such a broad stroke would surely cost more than the $700 billion that the United States pledged to back up its failing banks in late 2008. Therein lies the rub: not only is it an enormous sum, but it requires a degree of flexibility, political courage and teamwork that the European Union and the I.M.F. have not yet begun to show.
 ''It is not really about money,'' said Timothy Congdon, an economist and professed euro skeptic who foresees an exodus of savings from banks on Europe's periphery to Germany as doubts build about these countries' staying power in the Eurozone. ''It is about how much pain the people in periphery can stand in order to keep this thing going. Once the confidence is gone, and Greeks and Spaniards move their deposits to Frankfurt, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and the whole thing implodes.''
 Officials throughout Europe continue to say that the plan for Greece is sufficient and there is no need for a broader aid proposal or a formal debt restructuring in any afflicted countries. Investors, though, continue to push down the euro, which fell to $1.28 on Wednesday, a significant sign of eroding confidence. 
 The traditional way to combat unemployment in a recession is to expand the money supply. Such a step puts downward pressure on interest rates and makes capital more plentiful for businesses and consumers alike, spurring economic growth. 
 Mr. Congdon said recent figures indicate that even after deflationary pressures in Spain and Ireland, and the broader effect of the Greek crisis on credit-starved banks in Europe, there had been no growth in the European Central Bank's money supply. 
 This is proof enough, he contends, that the central bank remains under the influence of Germany, which firmly opposes this type of debt monetization, one that has been aggressively deployed in the United States and Britain to combat the recession.
 As for the I.M.F., its ambitious managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has been eager to present the fund as a potential savior for Europe. This is in spite of a postwar track record of providing a specific treatment of fiscal austerity and currency devaluation only when asked. So far, the fund has not shown the type of flexible, multination solution investors now say is warranted.
 And even if the fund were called upon to address Europe's broader debt crisis, doubts remain as to whether it has sufficient funds to do the job properly.
 Representative Mark Steven Kirk, Republican of Illinois, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees financing to the I.M.F., estimates that a bailout of Spain could cost as much as $600 billion. Citing research from the Congressional Research Service, he says the fund has only $268 billion to lend.
 With a 17 percent share of the international fund, the United States is the largest shareholder and financial contributor. Given the frustrations after the rescue of its financial institutions, and their subsequent landmark profits, there would seem to be scant appetite in the United States for increasing its support.
 But there may be a deeper problem. The classic methodology that the fund uses in such situations -- harsh austerity leavened with a currency devaluation -- may not be fully applied in this instance. Greece alone does not control the euro, nor does Portugal or Spain.
 According to Desmond Lachman, an economist and a former staff member in the fund's policy review department, it is this dilemma that makes the fund's job in Europe nearly impossible -- especially in light of the 2 trillion euros of outstanding debt in the troubled peripheral economies. 
 Mr. Lachman argues that currency devaluations are a crucial balancing component to every harsh austerity program because they can kick-start exports and growth, thus diluting the pain of public spending cuts. 
 But with Greece and other Eurozone economies having a fixed currency, this option is unavailable, forcing the fund to compensate with even deeper austerity measures that prolong recessions and spark the type of social anger that came to characterize the fund's controversial programs in Southeast Asia in the late 1990s. 
 For Greece to meet the fund's target of a budget deficit of 4 percent to 6 percent of economic output in 2014, the government will need to find savings of 13.5 percent of its total output, according to an analysis by Barclays Capital. Such a turnaround has little precedent in past restructuring efforts in Western Europe and will be all the more difficult given the depth of the recession and the inability of Greece to devalue.
 Some analysts wonder if the ever-sliding euro could give Greece and Europe the devaluation and the competitive boost it so desperately needs -- or whether it will again be too little, too late. 
 Greece is not the only country that must survive brutal spending cuts and maintain a fixed currency regime. The economies of both Latvia, as part of an I.M.F. program, and Lithuania, on its own, have shrunk by more than 10 percent as a result of deep pullbacks in government spending. 
 Mr. Lachman says that when the I.M.F. came to the rescue of Latvia, which also has a fixed currency, his staff recommended that the Latvian lat be allowed to float to ease the pain of the budget cuts. 
 ''I know that the staffers were very unhappy with the program -- they believed it would be impossible to achieve an adjustment in Latvia without moving the exchange rate,'' Mr. Lachman said. ''But the European Commission felt that if Latvia moved its rate, there would be contagion in Europe -- so they put the pressure on.'' 
 So far, neither Latvia nor Lithuania has been overwhelmed with the type of protests now occurring regularly in Athens. 
 But for Greece, where unions are powerful and already gearing up to oppose the government, not having the luxury to devalue the currency will make it all the harder for the fund's program to succeed.

HEADLINE: Look What I Bought (or Got Free)

BYLINE: By TRICIA ROMANO

 BODY:
MELISSA ROSE PONCE DE LEON, a 19-year-old bartender from the Bronx, had just gone shopping. When she got home she sat in her tiny peach-colored room, leaned into her Web cam and held up her swag: a few MAC lipsticks, a glittery black V-neck top, a snake bracelet and a new pair of Ugg boots.
 ''If you follow me on Twitter, you know I was Twittering about my dilemma,'' she said earnestly to her audience. ''Should I get the gray or should I get the black?'' She held up a pair of black Uggs. Mystery solved.
 This is a haul video, a phenomenon that has been sweeping YouTube for more than a year in which women, most of them young, methodically share their fashion and beauty purchases. The videos are the virtual equivalent of watching a girlfriend show off her finds after a shopping trip. And, in a recession, they fulfill a voyeuristic thrill: seeing how other people spend money. 
 Haul videos have also turned into a lucrative enterprise for some. Ms. Ponce De Leon, for instance, earns $1,000 a month through YouTube's ''partners'' program, which gives members a share of the profits from advertisements that appear with their videos. Some haulers receive money from the companies whose products they review -- usually in disclosed, sponsored posts, but sometimes under the table.
 Haulers with corporate sponsors sometimes host contests, giving away products as a way to attract new subscribers. Sometimes the women are paid a commission: Maryapril Bautista of Los Angeles, for example, says she earns a 15 percent commission from a hair care company, Flat Iron Experts, on sales generated by her product reviews.
 ''We talk about a product, and then we give a link to the Web site,'' said Ms. Bautista, who uses the screen name AprilAthena7. She makes less than $100 a month because her subscriber base is low, she said, ''but a lot of those girls probably have 50,000 and make a couple of thousand a month doing that.''
 The amount of money a hauler makes ''depends on how many views you have,'' said Margaret Healy, manager of strategic partnerships for YouTube. ''The more monetizable views you have, the more money you are going to make, bottom line.''
 Under Federal Trade Commission guidelines that took effect in December 2008, haulers must disclose if they received free products. But many of them don't know this. ''The companies should be telling the girls that they need to say that they got it for free, '' said Mary Engle, an F.T.C. spokeswoman. And the commercialization of hauling has hit some other stumbling blocks.
 Teresa Ulrich, a hairdresser in Vancouver, British Columbia, was surprised when a small clothing company called Hot Miami Styles sent her an e-mail message asking that the review of the free clothes they had sent her be ''positive.'' Undaunted, she filmed an honest assessment. In her video she held up an awkwardly shaped blue item that was supposed to be a dress. ''It's so beyond bad, it's bad, bad, bad,'' she said. ''It's car-wash bad -- as in, I'll wash my car with it.''
 After the video had been posted for only a few hours and viewed 5,000 times, the company e-mailed Ms. Ulrich, pressuring her to take it down, claiming two employees were fired because of the ''drop in sales.'' She refused. At 29, Ms. Ulrich says that she is less impressionable than most younger haulers. ''I feel like it's the integrity of the person, really,'' she said. ''I feel like when people get stuff for free, they lie.''
 Lauren Luke, a role model to many haulers (she parlayed her YouTube videos into a career as a makeup artist with her own product line and TV show), agrees that money changes everything.
 ''When it all sort of started, there was a lot of people on there who told the truth more about a product because there was nothing to gain,'' Ms. Luke said in an interview. ''But now, there's so many people getting free makeup products, and they're on commission, that it's really hard -- for me, as well -- to think, 'O.K., who do I believe?' ''
 Two of the most successful haulers are Blair and Elle Fowler, sisters from Tennessee who have a combined half-million subscribers to their two YouTube channels. Reports say Blair is 16; Elle, 21. They are represented by an agent in Los Angeles, Shelly Marchetti.
 A representative of a British accessories company, Secret Conquest, said by e-mail that Ms. Marchetti had asked that a ''large reimbursement'' be paid to Blair Fowler in exchange for a review. The review did not happen. The e-mail negotiations were posted on a Web site, which shows the amount was $500.
 Darian Braun, the owner of a spray tan company called SunLove, said by telephonethat he had paid Elle Fowler $4,000 for a review on the understanding that the payment was meant to cover editing costs. After a dispute, he said, Ms. Fowler took down the video.
 Ms. Marchetti denied a request for an interview with the Fowlers and did not respond to a request for comment on SunLove or Secret Conquest. At press time, a publicist for the Fowler sisters, Merritt Loughran, sent an e-mail statement saying: ''Elle and Blair choose to only work with brands and products that they like. Most of their reviews are non-paid, and for the ones that are, they provide full disclosure per F.T.C. requirements.''
 Ms. Ponce De Leon said that based on the ways that companies had approached her, undisclosed payments between haulers and suppliers were probably routine. Although she does sometimes accept free products, she said, she does not take money. ''I am very leery now of taking things for free and if I do take something for free, I really test it out for a while,'' she said.
 If Ms. Ponce De Leon takes her role seriously, there is a good reason: nearly 48,000 people have watched her 12-minute video about the Ugg boots. She has 131 videos -- including reviews and tutorials -- uploaded under the moniker MakeupByMel, that collectively have garnered nearly four million views.
 She even has a parodist or two. In one video, an imitator plays up her resemblance to Snooki of ''Jersey Shore'' fame: The fake gum-snapping Ms. Ponce De Leon shares her purchases from Lush in an overly broad Noo Yawk accent. The gag is that she doesn't seem to know anything about the products' names or prices.
 As for Ms. Ulrich, the Vancouver-based hauler, she is in talks about hosting a style program for a Canadian shopping Web site, and trills at the thought of hauling leading to a glamorous career. ''That would be really amazing,'' she said.
 Then she caught herself with a philosophical thought, which seems to be a rarity among haulers. ''When is it going to be enough stuff?'' Ms. Ulrich asked. ''When are we going to have enough?''

HEADLINE: U.S. Service Sector Grew in April, but Less Than Expected

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The service sector expanded in April, with business activity accelerating at the strongest pace in four years.
 The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said Wednesday that its service sector indexread 55.4 in April, the same level as in March. A reading above 50 indicates growth, and April was the fourth consecutive month of growth. 
 Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a stronger reading of 56.
 The service sector accounts for 80 percent of American jobs, in areas like health care, retail and financial services. It has lagged behind the smaller manufacturing sector in the recovery as consumers curtailed their spending.
 While employment data released from other market trackers Wednesday pointed to a brightening jobs picture, the trade group's jobs index contracted for the 28th consecutive month in April despite strong growth in business activity.
 The payroll company ADP reported on Wednesday that private employers added 32,000 jobs last month, with service providers adding 50,000 jobs. 
 The government reports Friday on April employment. Economists expect employers to add 200,000 jobs, which would be the biggest jobs gain since March 2007. The unemployment rate is expected to stay at 9.7 percent.
 That's ''pretty modest'' employment growth, said Ryan Wang of HSBC. Of the increase of 200,000 jobs forecast for April, HSBC predicts 135,000 will come from temporary hires by the Census Bureau.
 The service sector is getting a lift from improving retail sales after their plunge a year ago, and from industries associated with manufacturers, he said. But they remain cautious about hiring, he added.
 Jennifer Lee, an economist with BMO Capital Markets, said even though the service sector index was lower than expected, it still shows the non-manufacturing sector has grown in the last four months.
 ''That is key as industries outside of manufacturing account for about 80 percent of the U.S. economy and is thus a good indication that the economy is spreading beyond the manufacturing base,'' Ms. Lee said.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its measure of business activity rose to 60.3, the strongest pace of expansion since April 2006, and a measure of new orders remained high. New orders signal future business.
 Fourteen of the 18 industries surveyed said they grew in April, led by arts and entertainment, real estate, the information sector, agriculture, and management and back-office support services companies.
 The four industries that shrank were utilities, education, health care and social services, and professional and scientific services.

HEADLINE: How Successful Are Charter Schools?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Many Charter Schools, Varied Grades'' (front page, May 2):
 As a teacher at a charter school, I get a bit frustrated when I read articles criticizing charter schools, especially because we need to better understand what the statistics often quoted by opponents actually represent.
 Critics claim that students at many charter schools do not perform as well on standardized tests as do students at public schools. While that may be true, there is often a story behind the statistics that is left out of these debates. 
 Many charter schools accept students who were struggling or even failing elsewhere and sometimes get these students well into the school year. These students' test scores will be included at the new school, but their deficits may be left over from previous academic experiences.
 Since it does not seem that we will get rid of performance-based testing any time soon, a better way to determine the effectiveness of charter schools -- and all schools -- might be to look at the individual scores of students and how they progressed from year to year. If we did this, a lot of schools that now appear to be failing might actually be shown to have performed miracles.
 Norah Mason South Euclid, Ohio, May 3, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The state of education data in the United States makes it impossible to issue sweeping conclusions about the condition of charter schools.
 The idea that a research organization's conclusions regarding student achievement can be definitive in the absence of national, longitudinal data is folly. Yet your article highlights the deeply flawed research released last summer by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes.
 In contrast to the methodology of that study, the only way to determine charter school success is to compare the achievement of students in a charter school with the achievement of students in the public school they would have otherwise attended.
 As your article noted, Caroline Hoxby, an economist, conducted such a study. The conclusions were profoundly positive for charter school students in both reading and math. Additional data show that the longer a child is in a charter school, the better he or she performs.
 The students on the waiting lists of the nation's 5,000 charter schools would fill another 5,000 charter schools. This is why many school districts and policy makers look to charter schools today as models for curricular, operational and technological innovation, despite funding that is typically 65 to 80 percent of that of conventional public schools.
 Charter schools that fail get closed, as is the case with more than 650 to date, and thus accountability is in full force.
 Jeanne Allen Pres., The Center for Education Reform Washington, May 3, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As the rush to expand charter schools accelerates, fueled by private foundations pushing public policy and public money in this direction, stakeholders and observers should pause to consider the overall mediocre record of charter schools thus far.
 Despite evidence that charter schools don't do a better job than traditional public schools in improving student achievement, the zeal to siphon public money away from traditional public schools has not abated.
 Charter supporters argue that a market-based ''choice'' model increases competition and will improve education. This has led a number of people with little experience in educating children to establish charters touting innovation and efficiency yet showing little educational progress.
 While there are charter schools led by visionary, experienced educators with a true commitment to improving achievement in poor communities of color, they are few and their programs have often proved difficult to replicate.
 Education policy and politics that place a premium on charter schools in the face of scant evidence of their success compromise student learning and risk greater segregation and stratification of schooling.
 The lessons drawn from research on charter school outcomes strongly caution against blindly jumping on the charter school bandwagon.

HEADLINE: England Ambivalent About U.S. Soccer

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
London
 When England drew the United States, Slovenia and Algeria at the coming World Cup, The Sun tabloid ran a headline that said ''EASY,'' and added, ''best English group since the Beatles.''
 The British actor Hugh Grant then appeared in New York on ''The Daily Show'' and told the host, Jon Stewart: ''I'm always surprised you have a male football team. It's a female game here.''
 As inventors of the sport, the British can be condescending and uninformed about the game in the United States, viewing American soccer with the same smugness that the United States might view English baseball.
 Not everyone is so dismissive. Actually, the view of American soccer here is nuanced and complicated. There is an appreciation for the Americans who play in the English Premier League, a respectful regard for the national team, widespread indifference to Major League Soccer, wariness of American businessmen who own some of the biggest E.P.L. teams and a belief that the second-tier United States can become a global soccer power. 
 ''Where there was once 30 percent respect for the national team and soccer in the U.S. and 70 percent who were totally ignorant, I think it's now 60 percent respect,'' said John Harkes, who in 1990 became one of the first Americans to play professionally in England.
 Jonathan Spector, an American defender at West Ham United, senses respect for the United States national team ''when we are playing any team apart from England.''
 He added: ''It doesn't make a great deal of sense. Now that we're playing England, it's supposed to be a walk in the park for them.''
 This may stem from national pride and defensiveness, Spector said, given the economic, cultural and political standing of the United States as a world superpower.
 Soccer ''is the one thing they have left that they think they can beat us in,'' Spector said.
 If the United States defeats England on June 12 at the World Cup in South Africa, a feeling of ''doom and gloom'' will undoubtedly spread across Britain, Spector said. Given a strong belief that England can win the World Cup, a loss to the Americans ''would basically end England's chances with the public and the media, even though realistically that wouldn't be the case.''
 Jay DeMerit, an American defender who plays at Watford, said pressure and expectation would result in such severe criticism of the English with a defeat to the United States that ''they wouldn't want to come home.''
 The United States defeated England, 1-0, at the 1950 World Cup. It remains one of the tournament's greatest upsets. But it was also 60 years ago. Much more impressive to the British are the Americans' defeat of Spain, then the world's top-ranked team, and a narrow loss to Brazil at the Confederations Cup last June.
 ''I think everyone knows if there's a gap'' between the English and American national teams, ''it's a pretty small one,'' said Oliver Kay, the chief soccer correspondent for The Times of London.
 Barry Glendenning, a humorist for The Guardian, teases the American enthusiasm by placing an exclamation point after U.S.A.! and refers to the 1994 World Cup held in the United States as ''the summer soccer-ball kickabout,'' but he said he is only having fun.
 ''As far as the national team, no one is treating them as a joke,'' Glendenning said of the Americans. ''I think people would prefer that England didn't have to face them first.''
 When Harkes arrived in England to play at Sheffield Wednesday, he heard jeers from some fans, who advised him to ''go home, Yank, go play your American football.'' But that attitude has changed. American goalkeepers from Kasey Keller to Brad Friedel to Tim Howard and Marcus Hahnemann have thrived in England, one theory being that they grew up playing sports where they used their hands.
 And now the success of Clint Dempsey at Fulham and Landon Donovan in his brief appearance at Everton has tempered the belief that Americans field players may lack the mental or physical toughness to make it in England, Kay said.
 ''The assumption is, there is more where that came from,'' he said.
 DeMerit said the work ethic of American players was welcomed. ''They don't say I can't,'' DeMerit said, quoting a friend who is a youth coach in London. ''They say, why can't I?''
 M.L.S., on the other hand, does not engender the same respect. Mostly it is ignored. After David Beckham joined the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007, David Hirshey, the executive editor of HarperCollins, which published Beckham's autobiography, ran into the venerable soccer writer Brian Glanville at an Arsenal match here.
 ''As much as his game has eroded over the years, he should be one of the better players in the early-retirement home that is M.L.S.,'' Hirshey recalled Glanville telling him.
 Nor has the red carpet been rolled out for the Glazer family at Manchester United, or for Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool, owners who have loaded their clubs more with debt than with good will from supporters. These Americans misjudged the English view that a team should be run as a public trust, not a cash machine, said Tom Cannon, a soccer finance expert and professor at the University of Liverpool.
 ''English football fans don't like that other view of the world,'' Cannon said.
 Nor may they be comfortable with the notion posited in the book ''Soccernomics'' that the United States, which reached the World Cup quarterfinals in 2002, is destined to become a soccer power, given its wealth, population and vast youth system.
 If the United States defeated England, ''I don't think it would be a milestone moment,'' said Simon Kuper, one of the book's authors. ''It would be a step on a path that the U.S. has already taken that seems to be leading slowly upward.''
Correction: May 10, 2010, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, the On Soccer column on Thursday, about England's mixed view of the game in the United States, referred incorrectly in some copies to John Harkes, one of the first Americans to play professional soccer in England, and to one of the teams for which he played. He arrived in England in 1990 to play for Sheffield Wednesday; he did not arrive ''in England to play at Sheffield on Wednesday.''

HEADLINE: Mayor's Budget Would Reduce New York City Teaching Force by 6,700

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, anticipating deep financial cuts from Albany, plans to cut the number of city teachers by 6,700 to help close a projected $5 billion deficit under his latest budget proposal, people briefed on the plan said.
 Mr. Bloomberg also intends, in a proposal to be unveiled on Thursday, to reduce the city's work force by about 5,000 other workers, mostly through attrition and spread across many different agencies. And he is prepared, officials say, to take his budget knife to a host of programs that many residents have come to treasure, closing as many as 75 senior centers, as well as day care centers and programs for children. 
 One area that will be spared, however, is public safety. Mr. Bloomberg has decided that the police force, which dropped to 35,641 last year from 40,285 in 2000, cannot absorb any more cuts, especially in the wake of the Times Square bomb scare. 
 So he will scrap his original plans, as sketched out in his preliminary budget address in January, to reduce the police force by 892 officers through attrition, city officials said.
 It was not immediately clear, however, whether Mr. Bloomberg planned to back away from his original proposal to close 20 fire companies.
 Mr. Bloomberg's budget will not contain any new taxes, according to people who spoke on condition of anonymity, so as not to upstage the mayor's presentation on Thursday. There may be proposals for some additional sources of revenue, though details were not available. 
 When asked about the particulars of the budget, Marc La Vorgna, the mayor's chief spokesman on the budget, declined to comment.
 The new proposal reflects the sobering reality that the city, while in far better shape financially than most, is still reeling from the effects of the recession, as well as years of generous contracts for unions and increased spending.
 ''The mayor's not going to be restoring much,'' one person briefed on the plans said. ''It's going to be devastating. People are going to be screaming.''
 But more than anything else, the proposal reflects Mr. Bloomberg's frustration with Albany.
 In January, his plan called for reducing money for libraries, trimming the number of caseworkers who deal with H.I.V. and AIDS, eliminating nurses from elementary schools and increasing caseloads for workers in the Administration for Children's Services. He also proposed eliminating 20 fire companies, increasing the cost of truck parking on Manhattan streets by 25 percent and closing four swimming pools and a center for the homeless.
 But he warned that if Gov. David A. Paterson's proposed state budget was enacted, the city would face an additional shortfall of $1.3 billion -- a shortfall that he said would result in thousands of additional layoffs on top of his own proposals.
 State legislators were supposed to have a budget in place on April 1, giving the city three months to adjust its own budget accordingly. The city is legally required to reach a balanced budget for the new fiscal year by July 1. But Albany has not reached a budget deal, and there is no indication that one is imminent.
 So that means Mr. Bloomberg is left with a moving target, trying to estimate how much money the state will provide. Albany's predicament also makes things difficult for the City Council, which must hold hearings and approve the budget.
 Mr. Bloomberg is likely to hold Albany accountable for his plan to lay off, or lose through attrition, 6,700 teachers. 
 ''He's going to be putting in very little money because he's really upset with Albany,'' one city official briefed on the budget said.
 Stu Loeser, the mayor's chief spokesman, said, ''Unlike Albany, we in New York City have made tough choices and unpopular budget cuts over the last three years to keep the city's fiscal house in order.''
 The budget would, he said, ''include further cuts to many important city services, but it won't include a reduction in the number of police officers out on our streets.''
 Over all, the proposal totals about $64 billion and will not be appreciably different from last year's budget. But rising expenditures for pensions and health benefits, which have ballooned under Mr. Bloomberg's watch, are eating into the budget, and forcing the city to look for cuts elsewhere.
 In January, the mayor signaled that he was prepared to take a much tougher position on union contracts and pension and health benefits. He urged teachers, for instance, to accept a smaller annual raise in the contract now being negotiated (2 percent, rather than the 4 percent received in some years). 
 He also encouraged unions to consider long-term changes in pension and health benefits that could save hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
 And last week, in yet another sign that Mr. Bloomberg would be focusing on cutting costs and streamlining government, he announced that he had tapped Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis, as his new deputy mayor for operations. Mr. Goldsmith, a fiscal conservative, made a national name for himself by downsizing government and pushing for privatization.

HEADLINE: Facebook And Privacy Clash Again

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
For many users of Facebook, the world's largest social network, it was just the latest in a string of frustrations.
 On Wednesday, users discovered a glitch that gave them access to supposedly private information in the accounts of their Facebook friends, like chat conversations.
 Not long before, Facebook had introduced changes that essentially forced users to choose between making information about their interests available to anyone or removing it altogether.
 Although Facebook quickly moved to close the security hole on Wednesday, the breach heightened a feeling among many users that it was becoming hard to trust the service to protect their personal information.
 ''Facebook has become more scary than fun,'' said Jeffrey P. Ament, 35, a government contractor who lives in Rockville, Md. 
 Mr. Ament said he was so fed up with Facebook that he deleted his account this week after three years of using the service. ''Every week there seems to be a new privacy update or change, and I just can't keep up with it.''
 Facebook said it did not think the security hole, which was open a few hours, would have a lasting impact on the company's reputation.
 ''For a service that has grown as dramatically as we have grown, that now assists with more than 400 million people sharing billions of pieces of content with their friends and the institutions they care about, we think our track record for security and safety is unrivaled,'' said Elliot Schrage, the company's vice president for public policy. ''Are we perfect? Of course not.''
 Facebook is increasingly finding itself at the center of a tense discussion over privacy and how personal data is used by the Web sites that collect it, said James E. Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers University.
 ''It's clear that we keep discovering new boundaries of privacy that are possible to push and just as quickly breached,'' Mr. Katz said.
 Social networking experts and analysts wonder whether Facebook is pushing the envelope in a way that could damage its reputation over time. The privacy mishap on Wednesday did not help matters.
 ''While this breach appears to be relatively small, it's inopportunely timed,'' said Augie Ray, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''It threatens to undermine what Facebook hopes to achieve with its network over the next few years, because users have to ask whether it is a platform worthy of their trust.''
 Over the last few months, Facebook has introduced changes that encourage users to make their photos and other information accessible to anyone on the Internet. Last month its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, unveiled plans to begin sharing users' information with some outside Web sites, and Facebook began prompting users to link information in their profile pages, like their hobbies and hometowns, in a way that makes that information public.
 That last change prompted the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group, to file a complaint on Wednesday with the Federal Trade Commission.
 ''Facebook continues to manipulate the privacy settings of users and its own privacy policy so that it can take personal information provided by users for a limited purpose and make it widely available for commercial purposes,'' Marc Rotenberg, the group's executive director, said in a letter to the commission.
 The extent of the discontent among users is hard to quantify, but one measure is a group created on Facebook to protest the recent changes, which has attracted more than 2.2 million members.
 Mr. Schrage said that the company was aware that some users were not happy with the changes, but that the overall response had been positive.
 Part of the reason Facebook's recent changes are upsetting users is that, in contrast to a service like Twitter, most people signed up for Facebook with the understanding that their information would be available only to an approved circle of friends, said Danah Boyd, a social media researcher at Microsoft and a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
 ''Facebook started out with a strong promise of privacy,'' she said. ''You had to be at a university or some network to sign up. That's part of how it competed with other social networks, by being the anti-MySpace.''
 As the company has changed its approach to privacy, it has introduced new ways for users to adjust their privacy settings. But these tools have grown increasingly convoluted, leaving many users frustrated and unsure of what information is available to whom. They say a site that they joined for the sake of friends and fun has started to feel too much like work.
 ''At this point, I have no idea how many times I've changed my settings,'' said Lauren Snead, a 24-year-old student in Murfreesboro, Tenn. ''I've done it so many times. I'm tired of logging in one day and seeing everything is different and trying to understand what it means.''
 In addition, many users are not even aware of the privacy settings, Ms. Boyd said. A recent survey from Consumer Reports found that 23 percent of Facebook users either did not know the site offered privacy controls or chose not to use them.
 Mr. Schrage said the company was working to clear up confusion about the settings.
 Many frustrated users may not give up on the site because it has become a vital form of communication. Facebook continues to add users at a rapid clip, doubling in size in the last year.
 ''I'm not going to quit Facebook, because it's so ingrained in the culture,'' said Ryan Scannell, a 26-year-old food scientist in Chicago. ''Facebook is not a private place, I don't expect it to be. But at the same time, I'd like to control what's accessible to strangers and what's accessible to family and friends.''
 There are financial motives behind the company's moves. One of the ways Facebook makes money with its free service is by customizing the selection of advertisements shown to individual users. The more information that users put into their profiles, the more the company can make from such focused ads.
 In addition, analysts say Facebook may be eyeing the lucrative market for online search, figuring that its users will be more likely to turn to their friends for advice and information than the wider Web. That opens up more opportunities for advertisers.
 ''They're heating up in their battle against Google,'' said Sean Sullivan, a security adviser at the Internet security firm F-Secure who analyzes social networks. ''If I'm looking for a day care for my 6-year-old, I'm going to put that in my status message, not do a Google search.''
 Mr. Schrage of Facebook said the controversy over the site's changes was indicative of a larger shift online.
 ''Facebook has been made the center of attention around a really important issue of how technology is changing the conception of privacy, control and sharing,'' he said. ''People are uneasy about it, but as they start to see the benefits and advantages of it, they start to see the value of the experiences.''
Correction: May 10, 2010, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Facebook users' privacy concerns referred incorrectly to the type of information the site uses to customize advertising for individual users. It uses both public and private information on the user's profile page, not public information alone.

HEADLINE: New Sestak, Specter Ads in Pennsylvania Senate Race

BYLINE: KATE PHILLIPS


HIGHLIGHT: It's less than two weeks before the Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania, and both candidates are firing up their messages. 

 BODY:
The Pennsylvania Democratic primary for the Senate is less than two weeks away, and the ad wars between Senator Arlen Specter and Representative Joe Sestak have begun to flood the TV screens of the state's residents. Senator Specter has been leading in the state polls, but some recent ones suggest that Mr. Sestak has been narrowing the gap in recent days, putting him within 5 to 8 percentage points of Senator Specter.
In addition, as Reid Wilson pointed out on the Hotline the other day, Mr. Specter is getting a cash-infused lift from national Democrats. And President Obama has recorded a radio ad supporting him. Senator Specter has also begun broadcasting a new commercial, touting his longtime backing for increasing the minimum wage, health care for veterans' children and stem-cell research.
While Senator Specter talks in his ad about bucking conservatives on issues like stem-cell research, the latest Sestak commercial, released today, repeatedly highlights the incumbent senator's longtime alliance with Republicans. It includes footage with former President George W. Bush endorsing Mr. Specter and a little hand-grasp with former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the 2008 vice-presidential nominee on the G.O.P. ticket. The Sestak ad spotlights Mr. Specter's decision last year to switch parties when he faced another uphill challenge from former Representative Pat Toomey, a Republican who is holding considerable sway in the state this time around.


In the Specter campaign ad, the backdrop appears to be Pittsburgh, with the PP&G building in the background, no? This is where he makes an appeal to everyday workers, by noting his longtime backing for increasing the minimum wage:
The Democratic primary is Tuesday, May 18. The new commercials represent a bit of a departure for both candidates. We recently reported on Mr. Specter's negative ad about his Democratic opponent's military record, and Representative Sestak hit back hard, by rallying war veterans to his cause. But his first foray in TV advertisements was more biographical. At the time, Mr. Sestak said in an interviewthat he would repeatedly emphasize that he was the true Democrat, and that Senator Specter's career had been allied with Republicans.
The latest ad strikes at Mr. Specter's longtime ties to Republicans. Worth noting, though, is that the incumbent has often straddled the fence, being a far more moderate G.O.P. senator who joined with Democrats on recent legislation like President Obama's stimulus package.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 1,000, Then Rebounds, Shaking Market

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Eric Dash, Christine Hauser, Nelson D. Schwartz, Jackie Calmes and Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A bad day in the stock market turned into one of the most terrifying moments in Wall Street history on Thursday with a brief 1,000-point plunge that recalled the panic of 2008. 
 It lasted just 16 minutes but left Wall Street experts and ordinary investors alike struggling to come to grips with what had happened -- and fearful of where the markets might go from here. 
 At least part of the sell-off appeared to be linked to trader error, perhaps an incorrect order routed through one of the nation's exchanges. Many of those trades may be reversed so investors do not lose money on questionable transactions. 
 But the speed and scale of the plunge -- the largest intraday decline on record -- seemed to feed fears that the financial troubles gripping Europe were at last reaching across the Atlantic. Amid the rout, new signs of stress emerged in the credit markets. European banks seemed to be growing wary of lending to each other, suggesting the debt crisis was entering a more dangerous phase. 
 Traders and Washington policy makers struggled to keep up as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,000 points shortly after 2:30 p.m. and then mostly rebounded in a matter of minutes. For a moment, the sell-off seemed to overwhelm computer and human systems alike, and some traders began referring grimly to the day as ''Black Thursday.'' 
 But in the end, Thursday was not as black as it had seemed. After briefly sinking below 10,000, the Dow ended down 347.80, or 3.2 percent, at 10,520.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 37.75 points, or 3.24 percent, to close at 1,128.15, and the Nasdaq was down 82.65 points, or 3.44 percent, at 2,319.64. 
 But up and down Wall Street, and across the nation, many investors were dumbstruck. Experts groped for explanations as blue-chip stocks like Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris and Accenture plunged. At one point, Accenture fell more than 90 percent to a penny. P.& G. plunged to $39.37 from more than $60 within minutes. 
 The crisis in Greece, high-speed computer program trading, the debate over regulatory reform in Washington, talk of errant trades -- all were pointed to as possible catalysts. But most agreed the plunge would not have been as bad had the markets not already been on edge over the debt crisis in Europe. 
 ''There is a recognition that the Greek crisis has morphed into not only a European crisis but is going global,'' said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the money manager. 
 On the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, traders shouted or watched open-mouthed as the screens lighted up with plummeting prices and as phones rang off the hook. ''It was almost like 'The Twilight Zone.' '' said Theodore R. Aronson of Aronson, Johnson & Ortiz, a money management firm in Philadelphia. 
 Wall Street managers wandered their trading floors, trying to calm their people and figure out what was going on. They began to notice wild movements in stocks like P.& G. and Philip Morris. Many traders said computer program trades accelerated the slide as market indexes fell through crucial levels. 
 In Washington, Treasury officials began combing market tapes for answers. By the evening they still had not gotten to the bottom of it, but they discovered some aberrations -- market blips -- in trading coming out of Chicago.
 The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, was returning to the Treasury about 2 p.m. from the Capitol when he saw on his BlackBerry that the market was down 3 percent. He called the Treasury's market room, which constantly monitors financial exchanges; officials there theorized that the cause was Greece's and Europe's financial woes.
 Minutes later in the Treasury hallway, Mr. Geithner looked again at his BlackBerry and saw that the market was down nearly 9 percent. He told colleagues it had to be a mistake.
 Mr. Geithner immediately called the market room and then the Federal Reserve. He held a conference call with Fed officials and Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. About 3:15, Mr. Geithner walked to the Oval Office to brief President Obama. 
 Next Mr. Geithner spoke with European central bankers. After the markets closed, at 4:15 and again at 5:45, he joined conference calls with the heads of the Fed, the New York Fed, the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; the calls were expected to continue into the evening.
 The Group of 7 industrial nations' ministers and governors, including Mr. Geithner, plan a conference call at 7:30 a.m. Friday Eastern time.
 As of about 6 p.m., all the officials knew was that there had been what one called ''a huge, anomalous, unexplained surge in selling, it looks like in Chicago, at about 2:45.'' The source remained unknown, but it had apparently set off algorithmic trading strategies, which in turn rippled across everything, pushing trading out of whack and feeding on itself -- until it started to reverse.
 Federal officials fielded rumors that the culprit was a single stock, a single institution or execution system, a $16 billion trade that should have been $16 million. But they did not know the truth. 
 What happens to the day's market losers will depend on the nature of the cause and whether it can be identified. That is a question for the S.E.C. The Nasdaq market said in the evening that it would cancel all trades in hundreds of stocks whose prices had swung wildly between 2:40 p.m. and 3 p.m.
 As Wall Street reeled, anchors on CNBC, Bloomberg and the Fox Business Network turned their attention to the Dow.
 When the Dow was down more than 900 points and the CNBC anchor Erin Burnett observed that the P.& G. stock had dropped 25 percent, Jim Cramer, the former hedge fund trader and the host of ''Mad Money,'' seemed to calm the conversation a bit by basically saying, ''Buy, buy, buy.''
 ''If that stock is there, you just go and buy it,'' he said of P.& G. ''That is not a real price. Just go buy Procter & Gamble.''
 The day's uncertainty pushed the euro to its lowest level against the dollar in 14 months. It slipped to $1.2529 at one point before closing at $1.2602. The dollar's rise, and the mounting fear of a slowdown in global growth, sent commodities prices lower. Crude oil fell $2.86 to settle at $77.16 a barrel. 
 By the close, when calm was restored, the focus was on working out what had happened. 
 The S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said they were reviewing ''unusual trading activity.'' But already markets were turning attention back to Europe -- whether German lawmakers would approve the Greek bailout on Friday, whether warning signals would flash brighter, whether the euro zone would stay together, or whether this was a precursor of more gyrations to come.

HEADLINE: A Money Too Far

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
So, is Greece the next Lehman? No. It isn't either big enough or interconnected enough to cause global financial markets to freeze up the way they did in 2008. Whatever caused that brief 1,000-point swoon in the Dow, it wasn't justified by actual events in Europe. 
 Nor should you take seriously analysts claiming that we're seeing the start of a run on all government debt. U.S. borrowing costs actually plunged on Thursday to their lowest level in months. And while worriers warned that Britain could be the next Greece, British rates also fell slightly. 
 That's the good news. The bad news is that Greece's problems are deeper than Europe's leaders are willing to acknowledge, even now -- and they're shared, to a lesser degree, by other European countries. Many observers now expect the Greek tragedy to end in default; I'm increasingly convinced that they're too optimistic, that default will be accompanied or followed by departure from the euro. 
 In some ways, this is a chronicle of a crisis foretold. I remember quipping, back when the Maastricht Treaty setting Europe on the path to the euro was signed, that they chose the wrong Dutch city for the ceremony. It should have taken place in Arnhem, the site of World War II's infamous ''bridge too far,'' where an overly ambitious Allied battle plan ended in disaster.
 The problem, as obvious in prospect as it is now, is that Europe lacks some of the key attributes of a successful currency area. Above all, it lacks a central government.
 Consider the often-made comparison between Greece and the state of California. Both are in deep fiscal trouble, both have a history of fiscal irresponsibility. And the political deadlock in California is, if anything, worse -- after all, despite the demonstrations, Greece's Parliament has, in fact, approved harsh austerity measures.
 But California's fiscal woes just don't matter as much, even to its own residents, as those of Greece. Why? Because much of the money spent in California comes from Washington, not Sacramento. State funding may be slashed, but Medicare reimbursements, Social Security checks, and payments to defense contractors will keep on coming.
 What this means, among other things, is that California's budget woes won't keep the state from sharing in a broader U.S. economic recovery. Greece's budget cuts, on the other hand, will have a strong depressing effect on an already depressed economy. 
 So is a debt restructuring -- a polite term for partial default -- the answer? It wouldn't help nearly as much as many people imagine, because interest payments only account for part of Greece's budget deficit. Even if it completely stopped servicing its debt, the Greek government wouldn't free up enough money to avoid savage budget cuts.
 The only thing that could seriously reduce Greek pain would be an economic recovery, which would both generate higher revenues, reducing the need for spending cuts, and create jobs. If Greece had its own currency, it could try to engineer such a recovery by devaluing that currency, increasing its export competitiveness. But Greece is on the euro.
 So how does this end? Logically, I see three ways Greece could stay on the euro. 
 First, Greek workers could redeem themselves through suffering, accepting large wage cuts that make Greece competitive enough to add jobs again. Second, the European Central Bank could engage in much more expansionary policy, among other things buying lots of government debt, and accepting -- indeed welcoming -- the resulting inflation; this would make adjustment in Greece and other troubled euro-zone nations much easier. Or third, Berlin could become to Athens what Washington is to Sacramento -- that is, fiscally stronger European governments could offer their weaker neighbors enough aid to make the crisis bearable.
 The trouble, of course, is that none of these alternatives seem politically plausible.
 What remains seems unthinkable: Greece leaving the euro. But when you've ruled out everything else, that's what's left.
 If it happens, it will play something like Argentina in 2001, which had a supposedly permanent, unbreakable peg to the dollar. Ending that peg was considered unthinkable for the same reasons leaving the euro seems impossible: even suggesting the possibility would risk crippling bank runs. But the bank runs happened anyway, and the Argentine government imposed emergency restrictions on withdrawals. This left the door open for devaluation, and Argentina eventually walked through that door.
 If something like that happens in Greece, it will send shock waves through Europe, possibly triggering crises in other countries. But unless European leaders are able and willing to act far more boldly than anything we've seen so far, that's where this is heading.

HEADLINE: From a Prophet, A Call for Reform

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
CRISIS ECONOMICS 
 A Crash Course in the Future of Finance 
 By Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm 
 353 pages. The Penguin Press. $27.95. 
 He was known as ''Dr. Doom'' -- a perennial pessimist in the often sunny world that is the dismal science of economics. And in 2008 his predictions of disaster -- delivered two years earlier -- came stunningly, frighteningly true, as the entire global financial system teetered on the brink of the abyss. Cassandra had belatedly become a much-celebrated prophet.
 In a September 2006 talk before the International Monetary Fund, Nouriel Roubini presciently warned that a ''U.S. housing bust'' would spark a recession in America and a ''global hard landing'': homeowners would default on mortgages, trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities would unravel, financial institutions would totter, and a fiscal tsunami would threaten the world. 
 Now, in his new book, ''Crisis Economics'' (written with the journalist and history professor Stephen Mihm, who has written for The New York Times Magazine), Mr. Roubini, a professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business, uses his gifts as a teacher to give the lay reader a succinct, lucid and compelling account of the causes and consequences of the great meltdown of 2008. 
 Although his penchant for singing his own praises can be distracting (''Roubini's prescience was as singular as it was remarkable: no other economist in the world foresaw the recent crisis with nearly the same level of clarity and specificity''), his analysis of the cataclysm and his deft placement of it within a historical context soon steamroller any doubts one might have. Readers may wish that Mr. Roubini elaborated more on certain points -- like why he thinks the current recovery is likely to be ''U-shaped'' rather than a dangerous ''W-shaped'' double dip, as he's suggested in the past. But ''Crisis Economics'' is nonetheless essential reading for anyone interested in getting a crisp, if opinionated, overview of how the global financial system seized up in the fall of 2008 and what may happen in the months and years to come if serious reforms and new regulations are not embraced.
 Instead of imposing a doctrinaire theory upon the facts, Mr. Roubini employs an eclectic, common-sense approach to history, picking a la carte from the thinking of such disparate economists as John Maynard Keynes and Joseph Schumpeter. ''The insights of both schools can be synthesized and brought to bear on the problems we face now,'' he writes. ''Indeed, the successful resolution of the recent crisis depends on a pragmatic approach that takes the best of both camps, recognizing that while stimulus spending, bailouts, lender-of-last-resort support, and monetary policy may help in the short term, a necessary reckoning must take place over the longer term in order to achieve a return to prosperity.'' 
 Taking the reader on a fast guided tour of several centuries of capitalism, Mr. Roubini points out how the patterns of boom and bust are predictable, from the rise of asset bubbles to the spread of collapse to other countries that share similar types of excess. ''Lack of transparency,'' he writes, ''underestimation of risk, and cluelessness about how new financial products might behave when subjected to significant stress are recurrent problems in many crises, past and present.'' 
 As Mr. Roubini observes, the calamities of 2008 were not caused by a bunch of bad subprime mortgages or by a simple housing bubble but by deeper, more tectonic pressures that had been building for years. Not only had the government failed to keep tabs on exotic new financial products like derivatives, but the sweeping away of banking regulations established in the wake of the Great Depression (along with Wall Street's ability to evade remaining rules) had resulted in the development of ''a vast shadow banking system'' outside regulatory oversight. Meanwhile the bonus system adopted by many financial firms spurred the pursuit of short-term profits and excessive risk taking, even as the low interest, easy money policies of the Fed under Alan Greenspan encouraged the growth of leverage and debt. 
 ''By the spring of 2006,'' Mr. Roubini writes, ''the financial system, with its extraordinary reliance on leverage -- and its blind faith that asset prices would only continue to rise -- was primed for a breakdown of monumental proportions.'' Whereas some Wall Street observers have argued that the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 -- or the failure of the government to prevent its collapse -- was the inflection point that led to the fall of global dominoes, Mr. Roubini sees that event as less of a cause of the crisis ''than a symptom of its severity.'' Much of what happened in the succeeding days and weeks, he argues, ''was probably inevitable'' by that point. 
 To keep things from spiraling out of control, the United States government (along with other governments around the world) unleashed what Mr. Roubini calls an unprecedented ''shock-and-awe campaign against the crisis.'' The Fed ''embraced its historic role as a lender of last resort,'' he writes, ''throwing lifelines of liquidity to one kind of financial institution after another,'' and eventually became an investor ''of last resort'' as well, ''wading into government debt markets to inject still more liquidity into the system via quantitative easing.'' In addition the government ''became a shareholder in a host of businesses, buying shares and injecting capital in exchange for an equity stake''; instituted ''outright bailouts of individual banks, homeowners, and others''; and ''even offered to subsidize the purchase of toxic assets, hoping this might restore faith.'' 
 All these monetary and fiscal measures fell into place -- awkwardly and imperfectly -- over the course of the next two years. ''The response to the financial crisis had all the grace and beauty of a battlefield retreat,'' Mr. Roubini observes, ''but in the end it seemed to work: capitalism did not collapse; the fate of particularly hard-hit Iceland was not the fate of the world at large.'' 
 That, of course, was the good news. The bad news, Mr. Roubini says, is that stability was purchased at an enormous price: ''Thanks to all the bailouts, guarantees, stimulus plans, and other costs of managing the crisis, the public debt of the United States will effectively double as a share of the nation's gross domestic product, as deficits in the coming decade are expected to hit $9 trillion or more.'' 
 As Mr. Roubini sees it, America's soaring deficits (exacerbated by the recent bailouts and the tax cuts implemented by the administration of George W. Bush) and its borrowing of more and more money from abroad are dangerous and unsustainable, and could lead to decline of the dollar and the further erosion of American power on the international stage. 
 Much as the economist Joseph E. Stiglitz did in his recent book ''Freefall,'' Mr. Roubini argues in these pages that the United States must use the recent crisis as an opportunity to make deep and meaningful reforms to its financial system.
 He declares that Too Big to Fail firms like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs should be broken up; that the crazy quilt of overlapping regulatory agencies (which creates all sorts of gaps and inefficiencies that can be exploited bybanks) should give way to a more consolidated and centralized system of oversight; and that a ''beefed-up version'' of the Glass-Steagall Act (which separated commercial banking and investment banking) should be adopted. 
 Wholesale reform, Mr. Roubini concludes, is necessary ''to bring the financial system to heel.'' Merely tinkering with existing rules, he goes on, is absurd, given the serious illness of the patient. ''As we've made clear throughout this book,'' he writes, ''the crisis was less a function of subprime mortgages than of a subprime financial system. Thanks to everything from warped compensation structures to corrupt ratings agencies, the global financial system rotted from the inside out. The financial crisis merely ripped the sleek and shiny skin off what had become, over the years, a gangrenous mess.''

HEADLINE: TV Networks See A Seller's Market, Unlike Last Year

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, as television executives prepared for the 2009-10 season, they suffered double-digit percentage losses in advertising revenue because the economy weakened demand among marketers for commercial time.
 Now, as those executives get ready for the 2010-11 season, they are optimistic for a rebound in revenue, and higher rates, because demand has improved in recent months.
 But as the stock market proved on Thursday, months of expectations can be undone in moments. The gyrations on Wall Street reminded everyone taking part in what is known as the upfront market -- called that because the talks and deals occur before the TV season starts -- that happy days are not quite here again. 
 ''Going down 300 points, I say: whew,'' Rob Master, North American media director for the giant marketer Unilever, said in a telephone interview on Thursday, referring to the decline of the Dow Jones industrial average, but ''it's not like we're in an economic boom.''
 ''We were in a very different place 12 months ago, taking today out of the equation,'' Mr. Master said, ''so there's more clarity. But it's all relative.''
 Unilever, which sells brands like Axe, Dove, Good Humor, Lipton and Ragu, will take part in the upfront market, he added, but is also looking at interactive media, social media and other places to spend its marketing dollars.
 In fact, Mr. Master and other Unilever executives are in California this week, he said, to meet with Silicon Valley companies like Apple, Facebook and Google -- all of which offer alternatives to traditional ways to advertise, like television commercials.
 Although ''TV remains an important part of our go-to-market strategy for our brands,'' Mr. Master said, ''we're comfortable with continuing to move our dollars to other places.''
 Steven Center, vice president for advertising and public relations at the American Honda Motor Company, agreed that ''the predisposition now would be that things are getting better'' compared with conditions during the upfront market last spring, ''when the predisposition was that the end of the world is coming.''
 Still, ''we're not seeing a lot of enormous underlying strength'' in the economy, he added.
 His colleague, Thomas J. Peyton, senior manager for national advertising at American Honda, said the company ''intends to be active in the upfront this year. '' Because '' there are certainly more buyers in the market than there were last year,'' Mr. Peyton said it would not be surprising if the broadcast networks and cable channels were able to put through ''small increases'' in rates.
 Two brokerage firms that follow the media industry have forecast robust gains in ad revenue for the biggest broadcasters in the 2010-11 upfront market compared with the 2009-10 market. Barclays Capital predicted an increase of 20 percent, and Credit Suisse predicted an increase of 21 percent.
 But as the trade publication Advertising Age pointed out, such results would leave the large broadcasters short of the ad revenue they took in during the 2008-9 upfront market, before the financial crisis sapped confidence among consumers and marketers.
 That could mean that TV executives may need to do somewhat more promoting of the benefits of the upfront and television advertising to potential customers than is usual.
 For instance, during an upfront presentation by the Oxygen cable channel, Lauren Zalaznick, president for the women and lifestyle entertainment networks at NBC Universal, told media agency employees in the audience, ''You can look like a hero if you make a big, strategic deal in the upfront.''
 And during a presentation by the CNN and HLN cable news channels, which are owned by Time Warner, Jim Walton, president for CNN Worldwide, began his remarks to the media agency audience members this way: ''Thank you. Thank you in advance for your business this year.''
 Those presentations precede the upfront market during which the television and marketing executives negotiate purchases and prices. The presentations are intended to offer previews of the shows being scheduled for the coming season.
 The presentations range from simple to elaborate to over the top. Some analysts believe they can divine the health of the upfront market by how spartan or lavish the events are.
 (Based on attendance at a half-dozen presentations, a reporter who noticed generous spreads on buffet tables, open bars galore and piles of napkins imprinted with the hosts' logos is forecasting a bounce in the upfront market from last year.)
 The cable channels typically present first, then the broadcast networks. This year, the cable presentations began somewhat earlier than usual, in early March. The broadcasters -- ABC, CBS, CW, Fox and NBC -- plan to follow their usual timetable and will make their presentations in mid-May; this year, the dates are May 17 to May 20.
 Some cable channels, eager to compete with the broadcasters, have started scheduling their events during the broadcast upfront week. This year, ESPN, TBS and TNT will make presentations on days that broadcasters have scheduled events.
 In years when demand lags for commercial time, the upfront market can last through the spring and into the summer. That was the case last year. In years when demand for spots is strong, the upfront market can wrap up in a couple of weeks or less; there have even been fiercely robust markets that concluded by Memorial Day.
 Given the circumstances this year, it is unlikely to be a ''two-week upfront,'' said Steve Gigliotti, executive vice president for advertising sales at Scripps Networks Interactive, which operates cable channels like Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.
 Still, ''strong brands will do very well in this marketplace,'' Mr. Gigliotti said, referring to channels that are enjoying growth in viewers and ratings, because of the rising prices in recent months for commercials that are bought shortly before they run rather than ahead of time in the upfront market. (Such short-term buying takes place in what is called the scatter market.)
 ''The scatter market has been incredibly strong,'' Mr. Gigliotti said. ''That's going to push advertisers into thinking, 'I have to make a decision for the long term' '' and make deals in the upfront market.
Correction: May 10, 2010, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Advertising column on Friday, about sales of commercial time for shows that will appear during the 2010-11 television season, misstated the surname of an executive at Unilever who commented on the state of the advertising market. He is Rob Master, not Rob Norman.

HEADLINE: Nigeria Erases 'Acting' in Title Of New Leader After a Death

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Imam Imam contributed reporting from Katsina, Nigeria.

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- Nigeria swore in a new president and buried its old one on Thursday, sealing the transition from its long-ailing leader to his successor and quelling some of the political uncertainty that had loomed for months. 
 Goodluck Jonathan, a mild-mannered academic, formally took over the presidency in the capital, Abuja, just hours before his predecessor, Umaru Yar'Adua, was buried in the northern stronghold of Katsina to chants of ''God is great'' from the crowd. 
 Thousands attended the funeral, underscoring the regional divide in a nation of deep geographic and religious differences: Mr. Jonathan is a southerner and a Christian, and the mainly Muslim north has expressed resentment over his accidental accession to power. 
 The divide is just one of many challenges Mr. Jonathan faces, but now he will do so as Nigeria's full-fledged chief executive instead of as an awkwardly designated ''acting president,'' the in-between status given him three months ago by the National Assembly. It grew weary of Mr. Yar'Adua's continued hospitalization, which had left the nation -- Africa's most populous and one of the main oil suppliers to the United States -- with a vacuum at the top and festering local conflicts.
 Analysts said Mr. Jonathan's new authority, even if briefly held because the country goes to the polls next year, will make him far more able to tackle Nigeria's problems: pervasive corruption; violent religious, ethnic and economic clashes in the north and south; weak infrastructure; shaky institutions; and a compromised electoral system with no coherent national voter list. 
 ''It stabilizes the situation,'' said John Campbell, a former American ambassador to Nigeria. ''President Yar'Adua's death makes Goodluck Jonathan the president of Nigeria in the full constitutional sense of the word. There was a cloud over his situation. That cloud is now removed.''
 Mr. Campbell noted that even as Mr. Jonathan tried to assert his authority as acting president -- naming a new cabinet, signing a budget bill -- supporters of the absent Mr. Yar'Adua were laying the groundwork for a legal challenge to the southerner's ascendancy. 
 An unwritten, widely understood agreement in Nigerian politics holds that power at the top is supposed to alternate between a northerner and a southerner; Mr. Jonathan, by effectively taking office before the end of Mr. Yar'Adua's term, violated that rule, some of the late president's supporters felt. Indeed, before Mr. Yar'Adua died on Wednesday night, he had never formally relinquished power, adding to the confusion over who was in charge. 
 ''Nobody can now challenge his authority, '' said Aminu Masari, a former speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives, who leads a reformist faction in Mr. Jonathan's dominant People's Democratic Party that has declared war on the pervasive corruption and patronage politics within the party. Mr. Jonathan has ''ample opportunity to set the country on the right path.''
 Mr. Jonathan, in his brief inaugural address, stated his ''total commitment to good governance, electoral reform and the fight against corruption.'' 
 Mr. Yar'Adua was largely seen to have failed in curbing corruption, and his efforts in other areas, including ending the insurgency in the oil-producing Niger Delta, remained incomplete. He instituted an amnesty deal to promote peace with the region's militants, but the government's promises to reintegrate thousands of fighters into society have remained largely unfulfilled.
 Mr. Jonathan, in his address on Thursday, pledged to confront that issue as well. ''The efforts at the sustaining of peace in the Niger Delta will be of topmost priority,'' he said. A native of the region, with good contacts there, he is seen as having a better chance at that goal than his predecessor. 
 But hurdles remain, not the least of them an entrenched political culture that may leave the new president with few good options. ''His choices are just two,'' said Toyin Falola, a Nigeria historian at the University of Texas. ''He uses what his predecessors have done, corruption, to gain leverage. Or he uses accountability and gets into trouble.''

HEADLINE: American Bailout, Greek Proportions

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
The bailout of America's failed housing finance giants is taking on Greek proportions. On Wednesday, Freddie Mac asked the Treasury for an additional $10.6 billion after posting first-quarter losses. Together, Freddie and its cousin Fannie Mae have drawn $136.5 billion from Treasury's unlimited equity line since they were seized in September 2008. The European and International Monetary Fund rescue package for Greece, one that was supposed to shock and awe international markets, comes in at the same kind of figure, around $139.7 billion.
 The tragedy, as far as taxpayers in the United States are concerned, is that Fannie and Freddie will most likely need much more capital in coming years. High unemployment and the shaky housing market all but ensure more losses for the two agencies responsible for guaranteeing a majority of mortgages. 
 As wards of the state, it is even harder for the companies to return to profitability than it would be otherwise. Loan modification programs and other initiatives to reduce the burdens felt by homeowners are hardly moneymaking ventures for lenders. Fannie and Freddie also can't sell assets to stop the hemorrhaging, since unloading too many home loans from their huge investment portfolios would send mortgage rates higher.
 Moreover, the housing finance giants are saddled with a 10 percent dividend on any funds drawn from the Treasury. That's more than $13 billion annually and counting. Such a penalty made sense when the government's conservatorship of the two companies looked temporary. Nearly two years later, it seems more like a troublesome drag on recovery. Greece, by comparison, will pay around 5 percent on its emergency financing.
 Despite this, Washington continues to dither. Last month, the government asked for public comment on what to do with Fannie and Freddie. Last year, it promised to deliver a plan by February 2010. A minimum requirement is a hard deadline for deciding whether to privatize them, nationalize them or wind them down. Setting one is long overdue. In the meantime, Treasury should lower the dividend on its bailout funds. Otherwise it risks forcing its two charges to dig even deeper holes for themselves.
 Cold Feet in China
 Has Chinese tightening claimed a scalp? Swire Pacific, one of Hong Kong's oldest conglomerates, withdrew the $3 billion listing of its property business on Thursday, a day before it was due to price. That is a clear vote of no confidence in something -- and probably in a few things.
 To start, the pricing of Swire Properties looked rich when the initial public offering was started in April. Before factoring in new money raised, the midpoint of the range represented a discount of about 10 percent to its estimated net asset value for 2010 -- less than half that of some peers. Its pitch was a push into the Chinese mainland, where it has little experience. It's hard not to conclude that the company just got a little greedy.
 Still, a collection of patchy measures from Beijing is also a significant factor. China's government is determined to quell rapid property price increases, so has raised minimum down payments and restricted mortgage lending. Investors aren't convinced, but markets are likely to remain in limbo as long as Beijing shies away from an interest rate increase, which is more likely to work. The stocks of Swire's Hong Kong peers have fallen as much as 9 percent in two weeks.
 Then there is the Greece effect. Not that there is much risk of China or other Asian sovereigns getting into trouble over debts. Even traditional weak links like Indonesia and the Philippines have now brought their external borrowings under control. But a flight to safety may take money out of Asia. Property and I.P.O. stocks are likely to be on top of the unsafe list.
 There is still confidence in some parts of the Chinese I.P.O. market. The $700 million offering by the cosmetics maker L'Occitane showed boom-time exuberance: the retail part was oversubscribed by 160 times. And Swire might have had a warmer reception if it had aimed a little lower. But fearful investors are clearly cooling on the riskier new issues. And with volatility like Thursday's in United States markets not far from the surface, it's hard to blame them.

HEADLINE: Group Fears Lower Rents Will Expire, Cutting Gains

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration made a proud announcement earlier this week: It had reached the 100,000 mark in its ambitious plan to create or preserve 165,000 units of moderate- and low-income housing by 2014. 
 But according to tenants' advocates, the city stands to lose an even greater number of similar units in the coming decades, erasing the gains, because the rent caps on those units will expire. 
 In a report to be issued on Friday, the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a nonprofit group that represents middle- and low-income-tenant groups, found that nearly 170,000 city-subsidized rental units are at risk of losing their rent caps by 2037. 
 That figure represents roughly two-thirds of city-subsidized rental housing created between 1987 and 2007, the report said. According to the association, the rent caps generally expire after 30 years, after which landlords can charge market rates. 
 ''The mayor is saying they're making impressive gains; however, by 2037, an equal number of units will have washed away because of their lack of foresight,'' said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the housing association. ''This really needs to be fixed.'' 
 The report's authors said there was a clear way to ensure that city-subsidized housing remained affordable. New York's housing authority should copy other cities, they said, and lengthen by several decades the requirements that keep costs down, creating housing that stays affordable for much longer. The report cites Boston and San Francisco, where it said that affordability requirements for such city-sponsored units start at 50 years. 
 But Rafael E. Cestero, the commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that the increased complexity and volume of building in New York made comparisons with Boston and San Francisco unfair. ''We produce 10 times the affordable housing a year that they do,'' Mr. Cestero said.
 Still, Mr. Cestero said his department had begun looking for ways to increase the duration of affordability terms, a change that he said would require the backing of the State Legislature.
 By law, the city can issue low-interest loans for up to only 30 years, he said, which in turn place limits on the duration of rent caps that keep the units affordable. 
 He said the report's estimates of the number of apartments where caps would end were overstated, because the city generally issued balloon mortgages that were rarely repaid at the end of their 30-year terms. At that time, the city can restructure the developers' debt, he said, in exchange for mandating that the units stay affordable. 
 Affordable housing is intended for people with low or moderate incomes. To be eligible, people have to earn a certain percentage of the region's median income, which in 2009 was $76,800. 
 Mr. Cestero also noted that the city had helped to create permanently affordable units using ''inclusionary zoning,'' which allows developers to build more units than would normally be allowed at a particular site in exchange for making 20 percent of the units affordable. Some 2,800 units have already been built under this program, according to city housing data, with another 1,500 in the pipeline. 
 And 6,000 privately developed, permanently affordable units are also to be built on New York City Housing Authority land.
 In the end, Mr. Cestero said, the affordability goals of the housing association and his department were one and the same.
 ''We're absolutely committed to continuing our efforts to preserve affordability,'' he said, ''and we are examining our options for including more long-term affordability in the city's housing plan.''

HEADLINE: Red China, Green China

BYLINE: By BRUCE USHER. 
Bruce Usher, an executive in residence at Columbia Business School, is the former chief executive of a company that operates emission reduction projects.

 BODY:
WITH the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, talk has once again turned to clean energy. What few people appreciate is that the demand for everything from solar panels to energy-efficient light bulbs is already booming. Worldwide, $162 billion was spent in new clean-tech investments in 2009 alone. 
 The United States, with its expertise, capital and entrepreneurial spirit, is well positioned to dominate what could easily be the biggest market of the 21st century. But as the most recent delay over the Senate energy bill shows, the country is missing a key ingredient in shaping an effective clean-tech policy: the political will to encourage the innovation, manufacturing and investment necessary to bring these new technologies to market. And the longer America drags its feet, the more it cedes this enormous potential source of national wealth to the only other country able to capture it -- China. 
 True, China has a long way to go before it can claim the mantle of global market leadership in clean technology. Unlike the United States, however, it has spent the last few years shaping its industrial policy to achieve precisely that goal. 
 China's determination to become the global leader in clean tech has little to do with concerns for the environment and everything to do with jobs. For the foreseeable future, the greatest challenge for Beijing is to ensure full employment and rising income levels. The rapidly growing clean-technology sector is one of the few that can provide a sufficient number of new jobs. (Disclosure: I invest in clean energy in America and abroad.)
 This wouldn't be the first time China has taken economic advantage of opportunities resulting from climate change. The Kyoto Protocol, which caps greenhouse-gas emissions in Europe and Japan up to 2012, includes market-based mechanisms to promote the reduction of emissions at the lowest cost. The largest of these is the Clean Development Mechanism, which allows developing countries like China to generate credits from cuts in their greenhouse-gas emissions that are then sold to developed countries. 
 Beijing was initially slow to establish the domestic regulatory structures and develop the expertise needed to compete in this new market. In a 2004 analysis, the World Bank determined that China accounted for a mere 5 percent of clean-development projects globally. But by 2008, the most recent year for which annual data is available, the bank reported that China's market share had climbed to an astounding 84 percent. 
 Beijing is about to do the same with clean technology. In 2009, its investment in clean energy reached nearly $35 billion, almost double America's $19 billion, primarily due to domestic policies that promote the use of renewable energy. And the strategy is working. In 1999 China made 1 percent of the world's solar panels; by 2008 it was the world's leading producer, with a 32 percent market share, and its solar-panel exports were valued at $15 billion. To put that in perspective, in 2009 America's No. 1 export product by far was civilian aircraft, with exports of $35 billion. 
 Without fast action to greatly expand our clean-tech industry, the United States will be left behind. As such, the Senate energy bill, at a minimum, needs to take aggressive action on the three following points: 
 First, institute national feed-in tariffs or a renewable portfolio standard -- two ways to require that utilities buy clean energy in a minimum amount or at a certain price. Such standards have been effectively put into practice in several states, most notably in Texas with wind power, but only a federal program will provide the scale necessary to compete with China, which has a national feed-in tariff program of its own. 
 Second, establish a price on carbon via either a tax or a cap-and-trade program to encourage low-carbon technologies. The Clean Development Mechanism placed a price on carbon in developing countries, initiating thousands of emissions-reduction projects in China. Putting a price on carbon in the United States would provide an incentive for domestic developers to build similar projects here.
 Finally, get serious about supporting the research and development of carbon capture and storage, and maintain America's lead in a field that offers enormous opportunity but is too large for any one company to finance. Coal is the No. 1 source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the first country to develop economically viable capture-and-storage technology will dictate the terms for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired utilities globally.
 China is busy turning the global challenge of climate change into a national opportunity, but it needs another decade to advance its technology to the point where superior manufacturing and lower costs will secure its dominance of the clean-tech sector. By giving China more time to develop its capacity while neglecting our own, America is not just losing the clean-tech race, it's forfeiting it.

HEADLINE: Gen Art Folds, Victim of Recession

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
After 16 years of presenting film, art, fashion, music and parties, Gen Art, a showcase devoted to young talent and young audiences with branches in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, has folded, a victim of the financial downturn. ''After struggling for the past 18 months since the economic crisis, Gen Art has finally succumbed to the recession,'' its founders, the brothers Ian and Stefan Gerard, wrote in a letter sent out late Wednesday and posted on the Gen Art Web site, genart.org. 
''We have now halted all operations, have let go all of our amazing staff, and shuttered the business,'' they wrote, adding that they hoped Gen Art ''in some small way was as close to your heart -- as it was ours.'' With 80 percent of its revenue coming from corporate sponsorship, Gen Art was hit hard by the recession, Ian Gerard said in an interview on Thursday. After the fall of 2008 ''we were losing money hand over fist,'' he said. A $350,000 sponsorship deal with ''a major financial institution'' fell through at the last minute, in late March, and new investors could not be found quickly enough. ''We had cash flow for about four weeks, and four weeks was just not enough for us to bridge that gap with the debt that we were already carrying,'' Mr. Gerard said.

HEADLINE: Blackstone Said to Be in Talks to Buy Fidelity National

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
A group of private equity companies, including the Blackstone Group, Thomas H. Lee Partners and TPG Capital, is in talks to acquire Fidelity National Information Services in what could be the largest leveraged buyout since the credit crisis, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.
 The talks offer the latest sign that the private equity industry is showing renewed confidence in its core business, acquiring companies. 
 With a market value of more than $10 billion, Fidelity National is smaller than many of the companies acquired during the debt boom of 2006 and 2007: in the last huge acquisition, Blackstone bought Hilton Hotels for $25 billion in 2007. 
 Still, a leveraged buyout of Fidelity National, a big processor of financial data, may test market tolerance for increasingly larger private equity deals. A buyout deal remains more than a week away, these people said, cautioning that the talks were continuing and might still collapse. They spoke on the condition that they not be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.
 Representatives of Fidelity National, Blackstone, Thomas H. Lee Partners and TPG declined to comment.
 Fidelity National stock began to rise in midday trading on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site that talks were under way; the shares closed up $2.68, or 10.3 percent, at $28.68.
 The landscape for mergers has improved over the last 18 months, with corporate buyers proving more willing to open their wallets to acquire companies. Now bankers say that private equity firms are ready to benefit as well.
 In what amounts to a vote of confidence, the private equity group has lined up six banks -- Bank of America, Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase -- to provide financing for the potential deal for Fidelity National, according to the people briefed on the matter.
 Private equity executives have loudly boasted of the billions of dollars in untapped investor capital -- ''dry powder,'' in industry parlance -- that they have at their disposal. Analysts estimate that the industry as a whole has nearly $500 billion available for takeover activity. Blackstone alone has about $13 billion for private equity deals. 
 A takeover of Fidelity National would be more than twice as large as the biggest leveraged buyout arranged since the credit crisis began in late summer 2007. Among the largest postcrisis deals are the $4 billion takeover of IMS Health by TPG and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in November 2009; the $3.5 billion acquisition of the Weather Channel by Blackstone, General Electric and Bain Capital in July 2008; and the buyout of the Interactive Data Corporation by Warburg Pincus and Silver Lake for $3.4 billion on Tuesday. 
 Fidelity National is a leading provider of technology to banks, and its services and software handle credit card transactions, loan processing and back-office systems. The company, based in Jacksonville, Fla., has 31,000 employees and reported $105.9 million in net income last year on nearly $3.8 billion in revenue.
 Among Fidelity National's attractions to the private equity group are its steady stream of revenue, which will help support the debt placed on the company to finance a buyout. The bidders are also betting in part on a continued recovery in the financial sector, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. 
 Thomas H. Lee Partners and TPG Capital have some familiarity with Fidelity National: they tried but failed to acquire the company in 2004, settling for a 25 percent stake in exchange for a $500 million investment. While TPG sold its holdings, Thomas H. Lee Partners remains a big investor. 
 Fidelity National's largest stakeholder is Warburg Pincus, which gained a nearly 11 percent stake after Fidelity National merged with Metavante Technologies last year.

HEADLINE: Avatars Go to School, Letting Students Get a Feel for the Work World

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
ELIZABETH, N.J. -- Even as work crews and scientists mobilized over a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, high school students in this city were hard at work cleaning up another spill -- in the virtual world.
 Students like Christian Lopez jumped into an elaborate video game, called Spill, in which they assumed on-screen identities known as avatars to run cleanup efforts for the mayor of New City. The game, devised to help students sharpen their business acumen and skills, was rolled out in more than 750 schools across the country as part of a business contest in March and April. 
 ''I thought it was going to be easier,'' said Mr. Lopez, 18, whose avatar ''Chris'' made rookie mistakes like showing up in jeans and sneakers for an important meeting with the mayor. His avatar also tried to cut corners in hiring a vendor, only to end up with a former convict. ''It's not bad,'' he said, ''but you have to make the right decisions.''
 While not quite the eye-popping technology of the movie ''Avatar,'' schools are increasingly offering lessons in the virtual world as an alternative to textbooks and PowerPoint presentations. Teachers and students say the use of avatars and virtual worlds in classes from health to economics pulls in even reluctant learners, and encourages problem-solving and higher-order thinking as classroom knowledge is applied to real-life situations.
 In Suffern, N.Y., 2,500 middle and high school students have logged into a virtual world known as Teen Second Life for lessons in subjects including math and foreign languages. Eighth-grade health students fashion avatars to challenge media and social perceptions of beauty. A social studies class visited a recreated Ellis Island to go beyond historical facts and empathize with immigrants and immigration officers through role playing.
 Peggy Sheehy, a media specialist for the Ramapo Central School District, of which Suffern is a part, said such virtual worlds allowed students to learn academically as well as socially.
 ''They're able to explore other options, other genders, other races, other personality types,'' she said. ''A very outspoken, confident person may go into Second Life and be just that, or he could take a side seat, or a student who is very shy may not feel intimidated and becomes a much more vocal part of the community.''
 Linden Lab, which created Teen Second Life, charges schools a one-time fee of $700 to buy and own property in its virtual world and a $147.50 monthly use fee. About 180 schools around the world participate in Teen Second Life, which is a version of Second Life restricted to users from ages 13 and 17.
 The idea of video games in the classroom has concerned some parents, who say it can be a distraction, but many of the games are relatively new and have not been used widely enough to generate much criticism.
 In Elizabeth, the district approved the use of Spill in two required economics classes at Thomas Jefferson Arts Academy in March after a teacher discovered it online; the district is considering whether to expand its use next year. The game is available at no cost to schools through a contest sponsored by the accounting and consulting firm Deloitte and BrandGames, a company that specializes in the use of computer game technology in business communications.
 It took almost a day to load the game software onto the school's computers, which are normally blocked from using gaming sites. ''They were pretty excited,'' said Donald Stewart, a social studies teacher. ''They were playing a video game; that was my selling point.''
 Then the fun started. Students designed their own avatars from a menu of options. One heavyset boy added a paunch to his avatar. Jalisa Wilson, 18, chose a male avatar because she felt a man would have a competitive advantage in business. She named him Bob.
 The Spill game throws tasks and challenges at students to give them a taste of real-life work experience. Students were graded on how well they measured up. There were meetings with the mayor, negotiations with vendors, even an on-screen glossary to look up unfamiliar business terms -- like outsourcing and accounts receivable -- and a notepad for jotting down assignments.
 Students found out quickly that they could not just click mindlessly.
 If they forgot a vendor's name or a meeting location, the mayor's assistant gave them a hard time. The mayor herself had an attitude, telling avatars in jeans and sneakers not to come back until they were properly attired.
 ''She just yelled at me,'' said Nina-C'mone Helms, 18, staring at her computer in disbelief last month. ''She got smart with me because I chose the wrong person. My feelings are hurt, but it deals with real life because people really do talk to people like that.''
 Another student was caught off guard when a vendor demanded that he pay for a Ping-Pong table and soda machine for his workers. The student refused and negotiated the price down.
 Donato Coppola, a teacher, said the only problem with learning in the virtual world was that it could be hard to go back to the real world. When access to the game was blocked because of a technical glitch, he had to give an impromptu PowerPoint lecture on jobs and wages to the students.
 ''They were disappointed,'' he said. ''I tried to make it enthusiastic, but economics is a hard sell. I didn't have enough animation in the PowerPoint for them, I guess.''

HEADLINE: Productivity Rises 3.6%, Exceeding Forecasts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Productivity posted a better-than-expected gain in the first quarter, while labor costs dropped more sharply than expected, the Labor Department said Thursday. 
 The department reported that productivity grew at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the first quarter, better than the 2.5 percent increase economists had expected.
 Unit labor costs dropped at an annual rate of 1.6 percent, a bigger decline than the 0.7 percent forecast. It was the third consecutive quarterly decline, underscoring how much a severe recession had sidelined wage pressures.
 The economy has been growing since last summer but companies have been reluctant to rehire workers, choosing instead to push their slimmed-down work forces to produce more.
 That has translated into a sharp rise in productivity, which grew at annual rates of 7.6 percent, 7.8 percent and 6.3 percent respectively in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009.
 The 3.6 percent rise in productivity for the first three months of this year was a drop from those rates as companies approached the limit of how much they could expand output without hiring more workers.
 That development, however, is viewed as necessary for a sustained recovery because rehiring workers would raise incomes. A rebound in hiring would allow households to increase consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity in the United States. The concern is that unless incomes start rising, consumer spending will not expand and the recovery could falter.
 The 1.6 percent fall in unit labor costs followed declines of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 7.6 percent in the third quarter. 
 For all of 2009, productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work, rose at a 3.7 percent rate, nearly double the 2 percent increase in 2008. It was the fastest annual increase in productivity in seven years.
 In a second economic report, first-time claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week for the third consecutive week.
 The Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment insurance fell by 7,000, to a seasonally adjusted 444,000, above economists' forecasts of 440,000.
 The four-week average of claims, which smoothes fluctuations, declined 4,750, to 458,500, the first decrease in five weeks.

HEADLINE: Amazon and Sales Tax

 BODY:
Amazon.com is in court again, fighting what ought to be a losing battle to defend its longstanding practice of not collecting sales taxes in most states where it does business. 
 In the latest case, reported recently by The Times's Noam Cohen, the company's roundabout argument is that it and its customers have a First Amendment right to tax avoidance. 
 To help you wrap your head around that one, here's some background:
 A 1992 Supreme Court ruling holds that a retailer must collect sales tax only if it has a physical presence in the customer's state. So a bricks-and-mortar retailer that also operates online, like Target or Macy's, will collect sales taxes. Similarly, if you go through Amazon.com to buy something from, say, Target, Amazon will collect taxes from you on Target's behalf. But Amazon and some other purely online retailers do not generally collect taxes on their own sales. 
 That tax is legally due, but if online retailers don't collect it, it's up to the individual buyer to voluntarily pay the tax, which rarely happens and is very difficult for states to enforce. 
 Enter North Carolina. Unable to get Amazon.com to collect the taxes, the state recently began an audit of online businesses, trying to track down what it assumes are millions of dollars in uncollected taxes. The state has told Amazon that it wants buyers' names and the amounts they spent. That state also needs to know the general categories of spending, like books or movies or food, because some items are tax exempt. Amazon has refused to comply, claiming in federal court that North Carolina may be able to learn the titles of books and movies that its customers have bought, imperiling privacy and free speech. North Carolina officials have said they are not seeking those details. Now it is up to the court to decide whether Amazon will have to reveal the names of customers, without titles. 
 This case is not really about privacy and free speech. It's about how far Amazon is willing to go to protect a business model that relies on not collecting sales tax. Noncollection gives Amazon a major unfair advantage over rival retailers that do collect sales tax and deprives hard-pressed states of much-needed revenue. 
 Which raises the bigger issue. Congress has been negligent in not changing the law to require sales tax collection by online retailers but is being lobbied by many states to reform the rules. New York has taken matters into its own hands. The Legislature passed a smart law in 2008, requiring online retailers to collect sales taxes from New York customers. Amazon challenged the law in court, lost and appealed. The appeals court is expected to rule soon. If successful, the New York law could serve as a model for other states. 
 One way or another, it seems inevitable all online retailers will collect sales taxes. The only question is when.

HEADLINE: In China, Soaring Energy Appetite Threatens Emissions Goals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Even as China has set ambitious goals for itself in clean-energy production and reduction of global warming gases, the country's surging demand for power from oil and coal has led to the largest six-month increase in the tonnage of human generated greenhouse gases ever by a single country.
 China's leaders are so concerned about rising energy use and declining energy efficiency that the cabinet held a special meeting this week to discuss the problem, according to a statement Thursday from the ministry of industry and information technology. Coal-fired electricity and oil sales each climbed 24 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, on the heels of similar increases in the fourth quarter
 Premier Wen Jiabao promised tougher policies to enforce energy conservation, including a ban on government approval of any new projects by companies that failed to eliminate inefficient capacity, the ministry said. Mr. Wen also said that China had to find a way to meet the target in its current five-year plan of a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency. 
 ''We can never break our pledge, stagger our resolution or weaken our efforts, no matter how difficult it is,'' Mr. Wen said. Western experts say it will be hard to meet the target, but that China's leaders seem determined.
 ''No country of this size has seen energy demand grow this fast before in absolute terms, and those who are most concerned about this are the Chinese themselves,'' said Jonathan Sinton, the China program manager at the International Energy Agency in Paris.
 China has been the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases each year since 2006, leading the United States by an ever-widening margin. A failure by China to meet its own energy efficiency targets would be a big setback for international efforts to limit such emissions.
 Such a failure would also be a potential diplomatic embarrassment for the Chinese government, which promised the world just before the Copenhagen climate summit meeting in December that it would improve energy efficiency.
 The issue has major economic implications for China and for global energy markets. The nation's ravenous appetite for fossil fuels is driven by China's shifting economic base -- away from light export industries like garment and shoe production and toward energy-intensive heavy industries like steel and cement manufacturing for cars and construction for the domestic market.
 Almost all urban households in China now have a washing machine, a refrigerator and an air-conditioner, according to government statistics. Rural ownership of appliances is now soaring as well because of new government subsidies for their purchase since late 2008.
 Car ownership is rising rapidly in the cities, while bicycle ownership is actually falling in rural areas as more families buy motorcycles and light trucks.
 General Motors announced on Thursday that its sales in China rose 41 percent in April from a year earlier, virtually all of the vehicles made in China because of high import taxes.
 Zhou Xi'an, a National Energy Administration official, said in a statement last month that fossil fuel consumption was likely to increase further in the second quarter of this year because of rising car ownership, diesel use in the increasingly mechanized agricultural sector and extra jet fuel consumption for travelers to the Shanghai Expo.
 The shift in the composition of China's economic output is overwhelming the effects of China's rapid expansion of renewable energy and its existing energy conservation program, energy experts said.
 The increase in oil and coal-fired electricity consumption in the first quarter was twice as fast as economic growth of about 12 percent for that period, a sign that rising energy consumption is not just the result of a rebounding economy but also of changes in the mix of industrial activity. The shift in activity is partly because of China's economic stimulus program, which has resulted in a surge in public works construction that requires a lot of steel and cement.
 Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, which many scientists describe as the biggest man-made contributor to global warming.
 President Hu Jintao pledged in November that by 2020 the Chinese government would slow its growth in greenhouse gases by sharply improving energy efficiency. Mr. Wen went to the Copenhagen climate meeting three weeks later and opposed any international monitoring of China's energy efficiency effort or binding limits on China's overall energy consumption.
 China's current five-year plan, from 2006 to 2010, already sets an efficiency target that the country may now be less likely to meet.
 The plan calls for the energy needed for each unit of economic output to decline by 20 percent in 2010 compared to 2005.
 For a while, China seemed to be on track toward that goal. According to the ministry of industry and information technology, energy efficiency actually improved by more than 14 percent from 2005 to 2009.
 But it deteriorated by 3.2 percent in the first quarter, the ministry said on Thursday.
 Mr. Wen said that this deterioration would make it ''particularly difficult'' for China to meet the 20 percent target.
 Without big policy changes, like raising fuel taxes, ''they can't possibly make it,'' said Julie Beatty, principal energy economist at Wood Mackenzie, a big energy consulting firm based in Edinburgh, Scotland.
 Mr. Hu promised last November that China would improve the energy efficiency of its economy by 40 to 45 percent by 2020. The ministry statement on Thursday did not mention whether Mr. Hu's promise might still be achievable.
 Complicating energy efficiency calculations is the fact that China's National Bureau of Statistics has begun a comprehensive revision of all of the country's energy statistics for the last 10 years, restating them with more of the details commonly available in other countries' data. Western experts also expect the revision to show that China has been using even more energy and releasing even more greenhouse gases than previously thought.
 Revising the data now runs the risk that other countries will distrust the results and demand greater international monitoring of any future pledges by China. If the National Bureau of Statistics revises up the 2005 data more than recent data, for example, then China might appear to have met its target at the end of this year for a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency.
 China's recent embrace of renewable energy has done little so far to slow the rise in emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.
 Wind energy effectively doubled in this year's first quarter compared with a year earlier, as China has emerged as the world's largest manufacturer and installer of wind turbines. But wind still accounts for just 2 percent of China's electricity capacity -- and only 1 percent of actual output, because the wind does not blow all the time.
 Meanwhile, fuel-intensive heavy industry output rose 22 percent in the first quarter in China from a year earlier, while light industry increased 14 percent.
 Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations research unit, said in an e-mail message that he believed China was serious about addressing its emissions.
 ''There is a growing realization within Chinese society that major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would be of overall benefit to China,'' he wrote after learning of the latest Chinese energy statistics. ''This is important not only for global reasons, because China is now responsible for the highest emissions of greenhouse gases, but also because its per capita emissions are increasingat a rapid rate.''
 To some extent, China's energy consumption now might actually help limit its global warming emissions in the future.
 China, for example, used 200 million tons of cement in building rail lines last year, while the entire American economy only used 93 million tons, said David Fridley, a China energy specialist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Although production of that cement raised energy use and emissions of global warming gases, it also expanded a rail system that is among the most energy-efficient in the world.
 China currently moves only 55 percent of its coal by rail, for example, which is down from 80 percent a decade ago, as many coal users have been forced by inadequate rail capacity to haul coal in trucks instead. The trucks burn 10 or more times as much fuel per mile to haul a ton of coal, Mr. Fridley said.
 But now, with new high-speed passenger lines leaving more room on older lines to haul coal and other freight, the percentages could begin shifting away from energy-inefficient trucking, he said.

HEADLINE: Paulson and Geithner Back Calls for Tighter Regulation

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Two Treasury secretaries, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and his successor, Timothy F. Geithner, on Thursday endorsed calls for stricter regulation of financial markets. 
 In back-to-back testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Geithner faced questions about the so-called shadow banking system -- the network of investment banks, insurance companies, mortgage finance entities and hedge funds that largely went unchecked by a regulatory system that was structured around commercial banks. 
 Mr. Paulson, a former chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs who led the Bush administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis, called the system ''archaic and outmoded.'' He told Phil Angelides, the chairman of the commission, that ''we had excessive complexity in financial products.'' 
 Mr. Paulson called for heightened attention to several sectors of the markets, including securitization, the bundling of debts by underwriters who sell the assets to investors; repurchase agreements and commercial paper, major sources of short-term financing; derivatives contracts; and money market mutual funds. 
 Mr. Paulson said that after his appointment in 2006 he tried to plug ''huge gaping holes in the regulatory system,'' including the risks posed by the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 But Mr. Paulson admitted, ''Most of the toothpaste was out of the tube and there really wasn't the proper regulator apparatus to deal with it.'' 
 The legislation on financial regulations that is being debated in the Senate would direct regulators to require higher capital and liquidity for financial institutions -- a step that Mr. Paulson endorsed.
 ''Everybody talks about capital, but to me the biggest lesson I learned out of all the crisis was the lack of focus by so many market participants and by regulators on the importance of liquidity,'' he told Bill Thomas, the commission's vice chairman. ''And you cannot place huge reliance on any short-term overnight market if you don't ask yourself, 'What am I going to do if that market doesn't function as normal? How much of a cushion do I have?' ''
 In response to a question by Brooksley E. Born, a former regulator whose calls for tighter controls on derivatives were rebuffed in the late 1990s, Mr. Paulson said: ''They didn't create the crisis, but they magnified it. They exacerbated it.'' 
 Mr. Paulson also called for greater transparency in derivatives trading, telling Heather H. Murren, a retired stock analyst who serves on the commission, ''No one had any idea how many credit-default swap contracts were out there on General Motors bonds.'' 
 When Ms. Murren asked whether Wall Street's campaign contributions and lobbying had distorted government policy, Mr. Paulson instead blamed legislative inaction.
 ''I do know that it is very, very difficult to get anything that's fundamental, controversial, difficult done at Congress without a crisis,'' he said.
 Mr. Paulson showed little sympathy for the argument that colossal financial companies -- which have grown only larger since the crisis -- should be broken up. 
 ''The level of concentration where we have 10 big institutions with 60 percent of the financial assets, this is a dangerous risk,'' he said. But he added: ''Now I believe these institutions are necessary. They perform a valuable role.'' Even with better regulation and higher capital and liquidity requirements, he added, ''I come to the conclusion that regulation will never be perfect.'' 
 Mr. Geithner, who was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the crisis, said he had tried to improve risk management based on the lessons from the collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998.
 ''Those efforts were, in the end, fundamentally inadequate,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''They did not do enough soon enough. They did not come with enough force and traction.''
 Yet he added, ''I do not believe we were powerless.'' 
 Mr. Geithner said that if ''better-designed constraints in risk taking'' had been in place, ''then this would have been less severe, and if the government had moved more quickly to contain the damage, I think the crisis would have been less severe as well.'' 
 He added that wide swaths of the financial system escaped monitoring. ''You had people crawling over parts of the systems and parts of the system that are very risky, with nobody looking at it, nobody responsible, nobody in charge, and that was a tragic failure for the country as a whole,'' he said. ''It was an avoidable failure, I believe.''
 Legislation being debated in the Senate would establish a financial stability oversight council and designate the Federal Reserve as the regulator for all of the largest financial institutions, not just big banks.
 The executive branch ''came into the crisis with the president having only emergency authority limited to the act of closing financial markets or declaring a bank holiday, actions in a crisis which are largely panic-increasing, not panic-containing,'' Mr. Geithner told Mr. Thomas. ''We didn't have the tools to prevent the fire from jumping the firebreak and infecting the system.''

HEADLINE: Bid to Shrink Big Banks Falls Short

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Sewell Chan contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday rejected an effort by liberal Democrats to break up some of the biggest banks, defeating an amendment to financial regulatory legislation that would have imposed new limits on the size and scope of financial companies. 
 The amendment, proposed by Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Ted Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware, would have forced some of the heaviest hitters on Wall Street, including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, to shrink in size to limit the risk that big banks pose to the broader financial system. 
 The vote was 61 to 33, with 29 Democrats and 3 Republicans and 1 independent in favor, and 27 Democrats and 33 Republicans and 1 independent opposed. 
 It came as the Senate, hamstrung by partisan skirmishing over procedural issues, lurched forward with the broader bill, which would impose the most far-reaching overhaul of the regulatory system since the aftermath of the Great Depression. 
 Opponents of the Brown-Kaufman amendment, including Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, said that size alone was not a cause for concern and that the underlying financial regulatory bill already contained provisions to discourage the risky actions that led to the 2008 financial crisis, and to let regulators break up banks should they pose any danger. 
 ''Size is not the appropriate restriction,'' said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and a member of the banking committee, who helped draft the regulatory bill. ''The real question should be the level of inter-connectedness and the risk-taking we saw in the crisis of 2008.'' Mr. Warner added, ''The Dodd bill does provide ability for these banks to be broken up.'' 
 Mr. Brown and Mr. Kaufman had hoped their measure would be approved on a gust of the populist, anti-Wall Street sentiment that has swept the country since the near collapse of the financial system and subsequent bank bailouts, including the government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
 ''Our amendment ends bailouts by ensuring that no Wall Street firm is so big or so reckless that if it fails, as it does, so does our economy,'' Mr. Brown said in a floor speech pleading for support. ''The bill we're considering today is strong but it needs to be stronger.'' 
 Moments before rejecting the Brown-Kaufman proposal, the Senate approved by voice vote an amendment by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more authority to crack down on manipulation of the commodities and derivatives markets. 
 Separately on Thursday, the Senate moved closer to approving a proposal to require a one-time audit of the Federal Reserve's response to the financial crisis and to force the central bank to disclose the recipients of more than $2 trillion in aid, including the bailouts of big banks. 
 The proposal, by Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, gained momentum even as Republicans and Democrats delayed a vote on it until next week. 
 Despite the delay, the amendment by Mr. Sanders requiring the audit appeared to have enough support among senators in both parties to win adoption easily. 
 The White House and the Fed had opposed the original proposal by Mr. Sanders, which would have allowed additional audits of the Fed. A modified proposal from Mr. Sanders appeared to address those concerns, but it would still force the Fed to disclose information that it had maintained was confidential. 
 The proposal would require the federal Government Accountability Office to conduct a ''one-time audit of all loans and other financial assistance provided during the period beginning on Dec. 1, 2007 and ending on the date of enactment of this Act'' under a number of programs the Fed used to respond to the near collapse of the financial system. 
 The amendment states that the audit ''not interfere with monetary policy,'' addressing a concern raised by the Obama administration and the Fed. 
 Officials said the proposal would expand on changes made to the Fed in 1978, which subjected much of its operations to regular auditing by the accountability office but explicitly excluded monetary policy.
 The audit sought by Mr. Sanders would scrutinize an alphabet soup of programs that injected liquidity into the markets, ranging from commercial paper to money market funds. Under the proposal, the accountability office will not question whether the loans should have been made but will focus on operational integrity and accounting practices. 
 The audit, however, would explore ''whether the credit facility inappropriately favors one or more specific participants over other institutions eligible to utilize the facility'' and ''whether there were conflicts of interest with respect to the manner in which such facility was established or operated.'' 
 The apparent compromise with the administration and the Fed would give Mr. Sanders and other critics of the central bank an opportunity to claim victory, while not breaking with the Fed's insistence that its monetary decisions be sacrosanct and insulated from political influence.

HEADLINE: A Potential Court Pick's Dilemma at Harvard

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- For nearly a quarter-century, Harvard Law School refused to help the nation's military recruit its students, because the armed services discriminated against openly gay soldiers. But in 2002, the school relented to pressure from the Bush administration and agreed to allow recruiters on campus.
 When Elena Kagan became dean of the law school the next year, she faced a moral dilemma over whether to continue that policy.
 She said she abhorred the military's refusal to allow openly gay men and lesbians to serve. And she was distressed that Harvard had been forced to make an exception to its policy of not providing assistance to employers that discriminated in hiring. 
 But barring the recruiters would come with a price, costing the university hundreds of millions of dollars in federal money.
 The choices she made during that long-running episode are now under scrutiny as Ms. Kagan, now the solicitor general, has become a leading potential nominee to the Supreme Court. Her management of the recruiting dispute shows her to have been, above all, a pragmatist, asserting her principles but all the while following the law, so that Harvard never lost its financing.
 She repeatedly criticized ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the policy that bars gay men and lesbians from openly serving in the military. At one point she called it ''a moral injustice of the first order.'' She also joined a legal brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn the law that denied federal funds to colleges and universities that barred military recruiters.
 But even when she later briefly barred the military from using the law school's main recruitment office, she continued a policy of allowing the military recruiters access to students.
 Republicans have signaled that they intend to pounce on Ms. Kagan's forceful criticism of the military's policy on gay soldiers -- and her challenge to the law -- if President Obama nominates her to the court. But the view from Harvard is more complex.
 Far from being rebellious, her colleagues here say, Ms. Kagan bowed to the will of Lawrence H. Summers, then the president of the university and now director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council. Mr. Summers had appointed her dean and did not want Harvard to fight the federal government. Ms. Kagan did not join in when more than half the law school faculty publicly urged him to sue the government over the law that tied federal money to military recruitment.
 A truly radical act, suggested Robert H. Mnookin, one Harvard law professor, would have been for Ms. Kagan to quit.
 ''Elena is very good at reading the lay of the land, at having a sense of who is where on what issue and what the art of the possible might be, who can be influenced, who cannot,'' said Professor Mnookin.
 ''In that sense of being political, she is extremely gifted,'' he said. ''She's very purposeful.''
 Her supporters say that despite the outcome, which was dictated first by the university's needs and then by the Supreme Court, she demonstrated her resolve to fight discrimination.
 ''This is not an issue where it was easy to put your finger in the air and see which way the wind was blowing,'' said Charles J. Ogletree, a Harvard law professor who supported challenging the military policy. ''There was very little benefit to her personally by weighing in on one side.''
 The issue arose long before Ms. Kagan, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1986, came back as a professor and became dean in 2003.
 Because of the military's policy against openly gay soldiers, the law school in 1979 barred military recruiters from using its Office of Career Services, the central clearinghouse through which employers from all over the world seek to recruit top-notch law students.
 But in the mid-1990s, Congress approved several versions of the Solomon Amendment -- named for Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a conservative Republican from upstate New York -- denying federal funds to schools that barred military recruiters.
 The amendment forced many law schools to carve out a military exception to their recruitment policies, which said they would not help employers that discriminated in their hiring practices.
 Harvard reached its own accommodation in 1996. While the school did not allow military recruiters to use its main placement office, it did allow them on campus through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a student group. The recruiters met with students in the same classrooms, just under different sponsorship.
 The atmosphere changed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. In stepping up its recruitment efforts, the Bush administration expanded Solomon in 2002 to say that all federal funds could be revoked from an entire university even if only one school, like the law school, barred recruiters.
 Christopher Cox, then a Republican congressman from California who supported the move, said at the time that it was a scandal that Harvard and other schools banished military recruiters ''while cashing Uncle Sam's checks for billions of taxpayer dollars.''
 The change meant that Harvard faced a loss of $328 million in federal funds, or about 15 percent of its operating budget, almost none of which went to the law school. At that point, in 2002, the law school, under Dean Robert Clark, relented and permitted the military recruiters in its placement office.
 Ms. Kagan became dean the next year and followed the same policy. But she also issued strong statements against ''don't ask, don't tell.''
 ''The military policy that we at the law school are overlooking is terribly wrong, terribly wrong in depriving gay men and lesbians of the opportunity to serve their country,'' she said shortly after becoming dean at the law school's first reunion for its gay, lesbian and bisexual alumni.
 Later, as the issue intensified with protests on campus, she wrote in an e-mail message to students and faculty, ''I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy.''
 Some were disappointed that said she did not back her words with actions and challenge the government.
 ''Harvard was not a leader on this issue, and that was very painful,'' said Amanda C. Goad, 31, a lawyer in New York who was president of HLS Lambda, a gay student rights organization, when she attended the law school. But Ms. Goad, who graduated in 2005, said, ''Dean Kagan was trying to manage a very difficult issue, and it wasn't an issue she could simply or easily resolve in our favor.'' 
 Ms. Kagan did join more than half the faculty in January 2004 in signing an amicus brief when a coalition of law schools challenged Solomon in an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia.
 In November 2004, the appeals court ruled, 2 to 1, that Solomon was unconstitutional, saying it required law schools ''to express a message that is incompatible with their educational objectives.''
 The day after the ruling, Ms. Kagan -- and several other law school deans -- barred military recruiters from their campuses. In Harvard's case, the recruiters were barred only from the main career office, while Ms. Kagan continued to allow them access to students through the student veterans' group. 
 But the ban lasted only for the spring semester in 2005. The Pentagon told the university over the summer that it would withhold ''all possible funds'' if the law school continued to bar recruiters from the main placement office. So, after consulting with other university officials, Ms. Kagan said, she lifted the ban.
 After doing so, she and 39 other Harvard law professors signedan amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to invalidate Solomon. So did the university.
 They all received a dose of reality in March 2006 when the court ruled, 8 to 0, against them.
 ''A military recruiter's mere presence on campus does not violate a law school's right to associate, regardless of how repugnant the law school considers the recruiter's message,'' Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in the opinion.
 The ruling had little practical effect, since most universities, including Harvard, were in compliance. Despite the legal setback, Ms. Kagan continued to express her views, if less vocally.
 Capt. Kyle Scherer, 25, who graduated from the law school last year and is now a military intelligence officer with the Army in Afghanistan, said by phone last month from Kabul that Ms. Kagan always supported students interested in the military. When recruiters came on campus, Ms. Kagan would send out e-mail messages, saying, in effect, ''we distinguish between those who serve their country and the discriminatory policy under which they serve.''
 Last year, when he was promoted from first lieutenant to captain in the Massachusetts Army National Guard, he invited her to the ceremony and gave her the honor of pinning his captain's bars on his shoulder.
 During her confirmation hearings last year to become solicitor general, she said she would uphold Solomon.

HEADLINE: European Bank's Assurances Fail to Placate Investors

BYLINE: By JACK EWING; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris, Raphael Minder from Lisbon and Christine Hauser from New York.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank disappointed investors hoping for decisive action on Thursday to contain the euro zone's increasingly virulent debt crisis, pushing the euro to another low for the year. 
 Investors had been speculating that the European bank might take the unprecedented step of buying Greek bonds itself after a 110 billion euro, or $142 billion, rescue package by the European Union and International Monetary Fund, announced Sunday, failed to soothe fears that Greece would default on its debt. 
 But the president of the central bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said the subject of a drastic move to reassure markets, like buying government bonds directly, did not even come up at the bank's regular monthly meeting, which was held in Lisbon on Thursday. 
 Investors had hoped for a stronger indication that the central bank was willing to take bold steps in response to the debt crisis, which could lap into Portugal and Spain as well as Italy, Ireland and Britain. 
 ''I don't how long it will take them to recognize the seriousness of the situation,'' Silvio Peruzzo, euro area economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said of the central bank's governing council. 
 In the absence of a strong European central government, the central bank is the main institution standing behind the single currency with the political independence to act quickly. But the crisis has sorely exposed the bank's limited powers and influence, especially compared with its United States counterpart, the Federal Reserve. 
 Deflated investors all but ignored assurances by Mr. Trichet at a news conference that ''Greece will not default.'' Risk premiums on Greek bonds soared. 
 Markets also took little comfort in Mr. Trichet's effort to abate fears of a contagion by saying that ''Portugal is not Greece, Spain is not Greece.'' The risk premium, or spread, on Spanish 10-year bonds over equivalent German debt rose to its highest level since the introduction of the euro in 1999, while the spread on Portuguese debt also widened. 
 Spain, whose strains are being closely watched because its economy is so much bigger than Greece's, successfully sold government bonds Thursday, but at a sharply higher cost. The Spanish Treasury said it sold 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion) in five-year bonds at an average yield of 3.58 percent. That is well above the rate in March, when it sold 4.5 billion euros ($5.8 billon) in the bonds at just over 2.8 percent. 
 The Spanish bonds met with healthy demand, with investors seeking 2.35 times more securities than were offered. ''It shows investors are still interested,'' a Treasury official in Madrid said of the sale.
 Greek bonds are paying much more, reflecting investors' assessment of the higher risk of a government default. The yield, or effective interest rate, on Greek 10-year bonds climbed back to where it was before the bailout -- more than eight percentage points above comparable German bonds.
 European stock markets ended lower, with the Euro Stoxx 50 index, which includes euro zone blue chips, falling 2.5 percent. The euro slumped to as low as $1.2522 from $1.2814 late Wednesday, as the United States stock market endured a heart-stopping plunge in the middle of its trading day before retracing some lost ground. 
 ''Rightly or wrongly, investors were upset at the E.C.B. chairman's comment that the situation regarding Greece was not discussed at today's E.C.B. meeting,'' said John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Capital Markets. ''A lot of this has eerie similarities to the 1998 global financial crisis.'' 
 Unlike the Fed, which made huge purchases of bonds to support the United States banking system during the financial crisis, the European Central Bank does not have direct links to a government treasury to back up such intervention. As a result, it has less political clout to pressure markets. 
 But analysts say the European Central Bank could still buy bonds on the open market in a move analogous to a currency intervention. 
 Last year, the European Central Bank bought 50 billion euros in covered bonds, which are low-risk bundles of mortgages guaranteed by underwriting banks, in a successful effort to unfreeze trading in that market. 
 Buying Greek bonds ''really would be some kind of confidence measure, a signal to the market that default is off the table,'' said Marie Diron, chief economist for the Ernst & Young Eurozone Forecast. ''That is what the market needs to know.'' 
 Some observers speculated that the European Central Bank may be hesitant to resort to bond purchases at this stage, because it would then have no other heavy weapons left. 
 Analysts had suggested that the bank might instead slow or even reverse its withdrawal of emergency cash from the banking system. 
 Mr. Trichet said only that the governing council was ''permanently alert and able to take the appropriate decisions even if they are nonconventional.'' He pointed out that the council had moved quickly to erase doubts about whether the central bank would continue to accept Greek bonds as collateral even if they were downgraded further. 
 The move was regarded as a lifeline for banks around Europe, but especially in Greece. 
 In fairness to Mr. Trichet, he faces an extremely delicate situation. The bank's involvement in talks with the International Monetary Fund and European Union leaders on the Greek aid package pushed it uncomfortably close to European politics, an area it was explicitly set up to avoid -- at least publicly. 
 Mr. Trichet presides over a governing council that consists of the leaders of each national central bank, and unlike in the United States or Britain, its deliberations are not revealed. The decision-making process is cumbersome compared with the Fed's and complicated by national interests and the egos of members who are also leaders of important institutions in their own right. 
 To no one's surprise, the European Central Bank on Thursday left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 percent, where it has been for a year and where some economists expect it to be a year from now. 
 Commerzbank pushed back its forecast for a rate rise by three months, until June 2011. 
 ''Higher key rates are now less likely than ever,'' the Commerzbank chief economist, Jorg Kramer, wrote in a research note.

HEADLINE: Blame Albany

 BODY:
An understandably irritated Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Thursday presented New York City's $63 billion budget for next year with a huge question mark attached. How much of the state's annual contribution to the city will be cut this year? 
 The state budget is already more than a month late, and there is no sign that the Legislature -- and the empty suits that pass for leaders -- will come up with one soon. The city never gets nearly as much back from Albany as it sends up in taxes and other revenue. How much more will it lose this year? A billion dollars? More?
 There is no contesting Mr. Bloomberg's view that the State Legislature has shown complete ''irresponsibility'' by failing to make any decisions at all on how to fill a $10 billion state deficit. 
 Still, some of the mayor's grim budget seems overly dire -- particularly his current plan to lay off 6,700 educators. There will be a reduction in the 100,000-teacher force, but does it need to be that large? 
 In his efforts to prepare for the worst, Mr. Bloomberg said he plans to cut the city's work force by 11,000 people, using attrition and layoffs. In addition to the teachers, he would cut about 400 of 11,000 firefighters, plus other workers at parks, children's services, sanitation, and almost every other department. As many as 50 of 300 senior centers will be closed, and four of the city's 66 public pools will stay dry this summer. Libraries and children's services also will take a hit. 
 The mayor noted that as the economy has begun to improve and with help from Washington, the city has begun to see somewhat more revenue than expected. Much of that will apparently go to maintain the city's police force. That is a wise choice, as we were reminded again after last week's attempted bombing in Times Square.
 New York's City Council, which must approve the budget, should consider relieving cuts to senior centers, schools and libraries in areas like Queens where these media centers are vital to people of so many nationalities. Any increases will have to come with cuts elsewhere unless state lawmakers find a way to spare some of these programs with earmarks or grants in the state budget. 
 Tough times require smart management. Mr. Bloomberg is plenty smart. But it is nigh unto impossible to make smart plans until Albany starts doing its job.

 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org.

 ASIA SOCIETY MUSEUM: 'PILGRIMAGE AND BUDDHIST ART,' through June 20. This deftly shaped show, not especially large, spans vast swaths of land and time, from India to Japan and from the first century A.D. almost to the present. Materially it's cornucopian, with all manner of painting and sculpture and a camping store's worth of pilgrim travel gear: rucksacks for sutra scrolls, monastic hiking staffs and fanny-pack shrines, not to mention charts and maps -- some cosmic, some not. The show traces the Buddha's life and the circular path his wandering took between his birth and death in northern India. It also looks at the paths of those who followed him through the centuries and to this day. Some have traveled alone and quietly, others in lively packs. The action in a mural-size pilgrimage painting from 18th-century Nepal looks like a raucous scene from ''The Canterbury Tales'' set in the Kathmandu Valley. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)20100506
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KIKI SMITH: SOJOURN,' through Sept. 12. Kiki Smith's installation ''Sojourn'' was inspired by an 18th-century needlework, Prudence Punderson's ''First, Second and Last Scene of Mortality.'' There are rich ideas in that work, about the female life cycle and the life of the artist; to these Ms. Smith adds religious, mystical and personal symbolism. The installation's many drawings, peopled with women at various stages of life, can be quite affecting. But Ms. Smith has a tendency to sugarcoat death with craft: flowers, papier-mache, antique glass, gold and silver leaf and glitter everywhere. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100506
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY,' through May 30. That any of the nine works in this sweet dream of an exhibition sent over from London could easily be mistaken for works from the Frick's own incomparable collection tells you all you need to know about the quality on display. Rembrandt's ''Girl at a Window'' (1645) is the star of the show. Jean-Antoine Watteau's ''Plaisirs du Bal'' (about 1717) is a poetic, happy-sad vision of privileged indolence. Gerrit Dou's Vermeerish ''Woman Playing a Clavichord'' (1665) is preternaturally lucid. Nicolas Poussin's ''Nurture of Jupiter'' (1636-37), in which the toddler-age future king of the gods suckles a goat while a nymph holds him in her lap in a rocky landscape, is otherworldly. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)20100506
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'HAUNTED: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY/VIDEO/PERFORMANCE,' through Sept. 6. Drawn primarily from the museum's permanent collection, this show haphazardly traces photography, photo appropriation and their offshoots, backtracking six decades to Warhol and Rauschenberg, when three would have sufficed. With few exceptions, the displays are liveliest when closest to the present, in film pieces by Douglas Gordon, Tacita Dean and beyond, as well as the work of younger artists who have devised ways to use appropriation, setup and regular photography (together or separately). Among those are Sarah Anne Johnson and Sara VanDerBeek. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)20100506
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'GRAPHIC HEROES, MAGIC MONSTERS: JAPANESE PRINTS BY UTAGAWA KUNIYOSHI FROM THE ARTHUR R. MILLER COLLECTION,' through June 13. Today's graphic novelists owe a huge debt of gratitude to Hokusai, Hiroshige and the artist featured in this engrossing show, Utagawa Kuniyoshi. With wonderful formal and technical ingenuity, Kuniyoshi created woodblock prints illustrating tales of martial conflict, high-seas adventure and mythic triumph and sold them in vast quantities to the 19th-century equivalents of manga and anime fans. He also made portraits of courtesans in fashionable clothes; comical montages of anthropomorphized cats and octopuses; and antic, pornographic cartoons. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)20100506
 JEWISH MUSEUM: 'MODERN ART, SACRED SPACE: MOTHERWELL, FERBER AND GOTTLIEB,' through Aug. 1. The Millburn, N.J., Conservative synagogue Congregation B'nai Israel is renovating and expanding and has lent some of its art to the Jewish Museum for a small but inspiring exhibition. The synagogue commissioned three large artworks -- Adolph Gottlieb's Torah curtain, Herbert Ferber's exterior sculpture and Robert Motherwell's lobby mural -- for its midcentury Modernist building designed by the architect Percival Goodman. Temporarily installed and amply documented at the museum, they show off the mystical-spiritual side of Abstract Expressionism. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100506
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERING THE ART OF CHINESE PAINTING: XIE ZHILIU (1910-1997),' through Aug. 1. This philosophically intriguing exhibition presents drawings and paintings by Xie Zhiliu, a 20th-century Chinese artist and professor who was trained in traditional artistic methods in his youth. That meant primarily copying and tracing drawings and paintings by past masters. Xie's elegant but unimaginative copies are interesting mainly for what they reveal about how classical artists arrived at works of seemingly effortless perfection: not by observing nature but by repeatedly imitating other artists. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100506
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' continuing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation of one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100506
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'SIDE BY SIDE: OBERLIN'S MASTERWORKS AT THE MET,' through Aug. 29. Oberlin College's Allen Memorial Art Museum, now undergoing renovations, has sent 19 of its best paintings and one sculpture to the Met, and they are now hanging in various historically appropriate permanent collection galleries. Follow the map provided by the museum, and you will discover unfamiliar works by Turner, Cezanne, Kirchner, Rothko and others from the Oberlin collection, and you will also revisit many old favorites from the Met's. It makes for a great scavenger hunt. Bring the kids! (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100506
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense; examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100506
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver, might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100506
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'UNEASY COMMUNION: JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND THE ALTARPIECES OF MEDIEVAL SPAIN,' through May 30. Only about 20 years ago did scholars begin to recognize the extent of Jewish participation in the Spanish visual arts in the two centuries before the nation's expulsion of all Jews in 1492. Ranging from a near mural-scale assemblage of panels depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin by Pere Espalargues to an illuminated manuscript version of ''Guide for the Perplexed'' by the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, this historically illuminating show reveals Jewish contributions to Spanish art and a picture of Jewish life in late medieval Spain. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20100506
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON: THE MODERN CENTURY,' through June 28. Rarely has the phrase ''man of the world'' been more aptly applied than to the protean photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson, the subject of a large and handsome MoMA retrospective. For much of his long career, which began in the 1930s and officially ended three decades before his death in 2004, he was continually on the move, covering the better part of five continents, usually sending his film to various publishers and agencies for developing and editing. Many of his individual pictures are rightfully classics: those taken in the aftermath of World War II in Europe; at Gandhi's funeral; in China on the eve of the revolution. MoMA carefully mixes pictures chronologically, as if to avoid a comparison of Cartier-Bresson's daring in his early work and his later weakness for sentimentality and stereotypes, but the lack of cumulative moral and emotional intensity in the career, and in the show, is evident. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20100506
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARINA ABRAMOVIC: THE ARTIST IS PRESENT,' through May 31. The long-building energy wave of performance art hits MoMA with this four-decade survey of work by one of the form's more visible and magnetic figures. And the show's combination of stressed-out bare flesh on film and live bodies, some nude, in the galleries makes pretty radical fare for the museum. The exhibition is part true endurance-test grit, part pure diva hokum. And it comes with a mission: to demonstrate that it is possible to preserve an ephemeral medium through live re-creations of past work in a museum setting. The demonstration falls flat, but Ms. Abramovic herself is performing a new piece. It consists of her sitting absolutely still and staring straight ahead in MoMA's atrium for almost the entire time the museum is open during the show's run, an estimated 716 hours and 30 minutes, all told. Visitors are invited to participate by taking a seat across from her and meeting her gaze. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20100506
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at MoMA. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it's constantly being reborn. In its current form, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20100506
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PICASSO: 'THEMES AND VARIATIONS,' through Aug. 30. This subtly excellent show brings together about 120 prints from the museum's collection, nimbly accounting for many of the pinnacles of Picasso's crafty exploration of the various print mediums. It also parses numerous themes -- Saltimbanques, wives and mistresses, Cubist nudes, hommages to the old masters, the burly Minotaur -- and includes stunning recent acquisitions. Revealing as much about the printmaking processes as about Picasso's freewheeling involvement with them, it casts a wide net and arranges its catch with penetrating clarity. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20100506
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: FIVE THEMES,' through May 17. This well-designed exhibition of prints, drawings, films and film installations from the last 30 years showcases this artist's dazzling fusion of charcoal drawing and stop-action animation to excellent effect. The 1990 animations that meditate on the ravages of apartheid remain especially powerful. As the show traces a kind of progression away from, and back to, political subject matter, through a gallery that offers a dreamlike visit to his studio, it also traces his growing role in his own work, first as image, then as actor. And with a forthrightness that is almost touching, the exhibition also confirms that in the contest between still and moving images, moving almost always wins. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20100506
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: '185TH ANNUAL: AN INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART,' through June 8. This year the National Academy's Annual has been pared down to 65 artists from the usual 120 or so. Reduced finances are to blame, but happily this juried exhibition doesn't suffer. Quality is high over all, and congestion has been minimized. Painting dominates, as always here, but with everything from photorealism to geometric abstraction, the show still feels rich in variety. The lineup includes the Chelsea habitues Dana Schutz, Ghada Amer and the fast-rising Alison Elizabeth Taylor, whose impressive marquetry work graces a marbled alcove. National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg)20100506
 NEW MUSEUM: 'SKIN FRUIT: SELECTIONS FROM THE DAKIS JOANNOU COLLECTION,' through June 6. This exhibition of works from the collection of a New Museum trustee selected and installed by the art star Jeff Koons might conceivably have pulled a rabbit out of its ethically sticky headgear. Instead it teems with usual suspects, and its overcrowding benefits no one, especially the several larger, more admittedly festivalist works that form its high points. This museum has some rethinking to do, and high on the list should be coming to grips with the size and limitations of its often poorly proportioned galleries. Ultimately the air of complicity is less disturbing than the look of complacency. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20100506
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20100506
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navajo, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20100506
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'COLLECTING BIENNIALS,' through Nov. 28. Start your Whitney Biennial experience on the fifth floor, with this permanent-collection show of works by artists who were in past Annuals and Biennials. It caps off an extravaganza of new art with a humbling and diverting mix of classics, oldies and one-hit wonders. Figurative paintings from the 1950s Annuals are paired with contemporaneous Abstract Expressionism, and some big names from the 1980s (Schnabel, Condo) look refreshed. Most eye-opening is the sense that some of the most influential artists (Warhol, Hammons) barely register on the Biennial scorecard. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20100506
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: '2010 WHITNEY BIENNIAL,' through May 30. In the spirit of the economically bleak two years it represents, the Whitney has made efforts to underpitch its 2010 Biennial, and the show lives up -- and down -- to its billing. There are fewer artists than in the past. Its installation is spartan. Spectacle is out. Much of what's in is quiet and hermetic to the point of looking blank. The prevailing aesthetic is the art of the tweak, minute variations on conventional forms and historical styles: abstract paintings stitched like quilts, performance pieces channeling the 1960s, and so on. The show feels empty where it reflects the retrenched, art-about-art spirit of the moment. But it also has strong work, particularly in video and photography, that speaks of life beyond the art factory. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20100506
 Galleries: Uptown
 . OTTO DIX, through Aug. 30. The first Dix retrospective in this country provides heady glimpses of the achievement of this so-called wild man of German art. Few things escaped his remorseless eye -- from the horrors of World War I to the hypocrisies of the Weimar Republic. He made every stop on the itinerary of German modernism (including Realism, Dada, Surrealism, Expressionism, folk, visionary), had a few Cubist moments and, of course, qualified as degenerate under the Nazis. This exhibition of more than 100 paintings, prints, watercolors and drawings (organized with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) doesn't have the scope -- or the space -- to do Dix justice, but it begins to make up for lost time. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20100506
 ROBERT & ETHEL SCULL: 'PORTRAIT OF A COLLECTION,' through May 27. Racing from Abstract Expressionist paintings to Earthworks, this unforgivably crowded exhibition conveys the amazing instinct for the new, the next new and the next new after that that set Robert Scull, and his wife, Ethel, on one of the most influential shopping sprees in postwar American art -- until they cashed out with the 1973 Scull auction at Sotheby Parke-Bernet. In tandem with its detailed, must-read catalog, the show counts as ''It's a Wonderful Life'' for the art world. Attempting to rehabilitate the collectors most synonymous with the Swinging '60s, it demonstrates what a difference one or two people can make. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, (212) 734-6300, acquavellagalleries.com. (Smith)20100506
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'BLOOD OF SPACE: DRAWINGS BY DAVID CHAIM SMITH,' through May 15. Inspired by the Kabbalah, alchemy and other mystical systems, Mr. Smith creates densely worked, diagrammatic drawings that look as if they'd been made by a Renaissance-era occultist. His semi-abstract, symmetrical compositions in pencil and ink feature an interplay between narrow crisscrossing, circular and serpentine bands and gnarly, rootlike systems. Finely printed words add philosophy reminiscent of the sentiments printed on Dr. Bronner's soap bottles. Cavin-Morris Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 226-3768, cavinmorris.com. (Johnson)20100506
 Galleries: SoHo
 JOSEF ALBERS/KEN PRICE, through June 5. Pairing a German abstract painter and color theorist, Josef Albers (1888-1976), and a ceramic sculptor, Ken Price (born 1935), is a bit of curatorial genius that can make your eyes feel attached to a bigger, better brain. An intricate dovetailing of works spanning several mediums and decades clarifies their individual greatness. The shared passion for strong color juxtapositions is to be expected. Less so are those for Modern architecture, pre-Columbian pyramids, stones, interior spaces (variously erotic, domestic or symbolic) and an oscillation between biomorphic and straight-edged form. Anyone interested in the curatorial arts should see this thrilling show, among the best and most timely to grace a New York commercial gallery. Brooke Alexander Gallery, 59 Wooster Street, (212) 925-4338, baeditions.com. (Smith)20100506
 Last Chance
 JOSEF ALBERS: 'FORMULATION: ARTICULATION, 1972'; closes on Saturday. This headlong plunge into all things Albers presents a portfolio of 127 silk-screen works that sums up his art and thought to a remarkable degree -- especially if you read the ''Statements of Content'' explaining each motif. A horizontal installation aids absorption, which can transform your understanding of both Albers in particular and abstraction in general, revealing it to be, unexpectedly, an art of everyday life. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Smith)20100506
 'CELEBRATING THE MUSE: WOMEN IN PICASSO'S PRINTS, 1905-1968'; closes on Saturday. This venture is pretty much girls, girls, girls: the artist's wives and mistresses, along with mythological goddesses, unnamed models and their more sexualized counterparts -- mantilla-topped majas in various degrees of undress. Underscoring what may have been the artist's chief obsession, it has a nearly overwhelming wildness of its own, including large swaths of the brilliantly varied ''Suite Vollard'' of 1933 -- especially the ''sculptor's studio'' sequence -- and ''Suite 347,'' an etching marathon from 1968. But there is much, much more, including wonderful linocuts of Picasso's second and final wife, the long-suffering Jacqueline. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900, marlboroughgallery.com. (Smith)20100506
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'TWILIGHT VISIONS: SURREALISM, PHOTOGRAPHY AND PARIS'; closes on Sunday. Considering how revolutionary Surrealist photography was back in the day, it may seem paradoxical that nostalgia would be the mood suffusing this resonant exhibition. But it makes sense. Caught in the throes of sweeping change in the cultural capital of the Western world, photographers like Andre Kertesz, Ilse Bing, Man Ray and others were as preoccupied with what was being lost as with what might be gained by modernization, and the images they made are darkly meditative. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)20100506
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PLAYING WITH PICTURES: THE ART OF VICTORIAN PHOTOCOLLAGE'; closes on Sunday. This seemingly modest, startlingly reverberant exhibition reveals that upper-class Englishwomen of the 1860s and '70s devised an early form of collage, the supposedly Cubist breakthrough. Adding cutout photographs of family, friends, royals and celebrities to the watercolor albums that were already an acceptable female activity, they created all kinds of witty effects -- drawing-room scenes, trompe l'oeil designs, human-animal hybrids. The effects of Darwinism and the publication of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' register in these amazing works, as does the collective, even osmotic nature of invention. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100506
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROME AFTER RAPHAEL'; closes on Sunday. This exhibition of 16th-century Italian drawings from the Morgan's collection covers a lot of ground. It moves, in fits and starts, from the High Renaissance to Mannerism and the nascent Baroque. And it's enlivened by the classic match of Raphael versus Michelangelo; drawings by both artists, and their followers, pit Raphael's sprezzatura, or relaxed refinement, against Michelangelo's vein-popping muscularity. Look for drawings by Parmigianino (in Raphael's camp) and the sumptuous Farnese Hours by Giulio Clovio (in Michelangelo's), in addition to splendid Late Mannerist studies by Annibale Carracci. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20100506
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'PHANTOM SIGHTINGS: ART AFTER THE CHICANO MOVEMENT'; closes on Sunday. This confusing show of works by Mexican-Americans who have come of age since the 1990s ranges from Victor Estrada's funky-surrealist paintings to Sandra de la Loza's high-concept installation of documents and a video dedicated to a historic site in Los Angeles. Margarita Cabrera's full-size, all-vinyl sculpture of a Volkswagen Beetle and Alejandro Diaz's distressed cardboard signs bearing handwritten messages like ''I beg to differ'' stand out, but a good case for the continued relevance of the identity-based show is not made. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Johnson)20100506

(Charles Isherwood)20100506
 'A BEHANDING IN SPOKANE'Christopher Walken's signature arsenal of stylistic oddities has seldom been put to more enthralling use than in this gruesome Martin McDonagh comedy about a scam gone wrong. But the rest of the production, directed by John Crowley, never matches its star's strange genius (1:30). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Terry Johnson's inspired revival of this 1983 musical, about family values as seen through the prism of a transvestite revue, delivers the unexpected lesson that in theater, shabby can be not just chic but also redemptive. Kelsey Grammer and Douglas Hodge (in a bravura Broadway debut) star winningly as the happily mismatched couple (2:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'COLLECTED STORIES'Linda Lavin gives a smart, sensitive and funny performance as a fiction writer who acquires an adoring protegee (Sarah Paulson) who is not as innocent as she might seem. Donald Margulies's play explores ethics and aesthetics with intelligence and humor (2:00). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20100506
 'COME FLY AWAY'Twyla Tharp brings her kinetic heat to the cool of Frank Sinatra songs in this dazzling dance musical set in a fantasy nightclub redolent of the 1940s. Brilliantly performed by a cast of truly astounding dancers, the show is a tribute to the pas de deux as mating ritual (1:50). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street , (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)20100506
 'EVERYDAY RAPTURE'is 73617 This restaurant is rated 1 star. 'EVERYDAY RAPTURE' Sherie Rene Scott is Sherie Rene Scott in this smashing musical memoir of a show about growing up half-Mennonite and becoming a semi-, semi-, semi-star on Broadway. Michael Mayer directs a production that captures the essence and allure of New York musicals (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)20100506
 'FELA!' This transporting musical biography of a Nigerian revolutionary of song doesn't so much tell a story as soak an audience to, and through, the skin with the style and sensibility called Afrobeat. There has never been anything on Broadway like Bill T. Jones's kinetic production, which stars the charismatic Sahr Ngaujah and Kevin Mambo (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'FENCES'Denzel Washington brings an arresting, troubled ambivalence to the starring role of this vibrantly acted revival of August Wilson's most accessible and least inventive work. Kenny Leon is the fluid director of this portrait of burned-out African-American dreams in 1950s Pittsburgh, and Viola Davis is superb as a stoic housewife (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'LEND ME A TENOR'Tony Shalhoub and Anthony LaPaglia are the frazzled impresario and the ailing tenor in this hard-working but laugh-light revival of Ken Ludwig's middling farce, directed by Stanley Tucci. Justin Bartha (''The Hangover'') plays the gofer thrown onstage to impersonate the star (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20100506
 'A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC'Trevor Nunn's nudgingly acted, lugubriously slow revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's erotic waltz of a musical is most notable for the participation of the lustrous Catherine Zeta-Jones, in a lively (if miscast) Broadway debut, and of the indomitable (and invaluable) Angela Lansbury (2:50). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'MEMPHIS' In the city of the title in the 1950s, a pioneering white radio D.J. (the endearing Chad Kimball) falls in love with R&B music and one of its comely practitioners (the lovely Montego Glover) in this slick but essentially soulless musical written by David Bryan and Joe DiPietro (''The Toxic Avenger'') and fleetly directed by Christopher Ashley (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20100506
 'MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET' A small-scale jukebox musical about a big day in rock 'n' roll history, when Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley all got together for an impromptu jam in the recording studio of Sun Records. The book resembles a standard-issue rock doc, but the music-making is fiery and the songs fun (1:30). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)20100506
 'NEXT FALL' The funniest heartbreaker in town. Geoffrey Nauffts's play about that odd couple, love and religion, transfers to Broadway with its quick wit and poignantly human characters intact. Patrick Breen and Patrick Heusinger, as partners in conflict over the existence of God, lead a terrific cast, directed by Sheryl Kaller (2:20). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'PROMISES, PROMISES' Despite athletic choreography by Rob Ashford, this revival of a dated 1968 musical about sex in the workplace -- with a book by Neil Simon and a score by Burt Bacharach -- never manages to push the evening's temperature much above lukewarm. Katie Finneran is the energizing standout in a cast led by Kristin Chenoweth and Sean Hayes (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'RACE'David Mamet's surprisingly slack examination of a hot-button topic registers well within the average Broadway audience's comfort zone. There are glimmers of the author's scalpel-edge intelligence, and James Spader is excellent as a white lawyer representing a white man accused of raping a black woman. David Alan Grier, Richard Thomas and Kerry Washington round out the able cast (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'RED'John Logan's intense bio-drama about the painter Mark Rothko, excitingly staged by Michael Grandage, doesn't entirely avoid the cliches of the anguished-artist genre. But in a thrilling performance as Rothko, Alfred Molina makes us see through an artist's eyes, and Eddie Redmayne is excellent as his embattled assistant (1:30). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'SONDHEIM ON SONDHEIM' A genial multimedia scrapbook on the life, times and career of you-know-who. Directed by James Lapine, the show never quite finds a sustained tone, but it has charming videotaped interviews with Mr. Sondheim and a polished ensemble that includes the great Barbara Cook (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)20100506
 Off Broadway
 'ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S THE 39 STEPS' This deliciously silly deconstruction of Alfred Hitchcock's 1936 classic film has been happily re-incarnated Off Broadway (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'THE ALIENS' Annie Baker's gentle, lovely play depicts the three-way friendship that forms between a couple of sweet but troubled misfits and the youngster who works at the coffee shop where they hang out. Delicate, artful and beautifully acted, this is Off Broadway theater at its best (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Isherwood)20100506
 'AVENUE Q' Even without legs of their own, the singing hand puppets of this Tony-winning musical are still standing tall in their new Off Broadway digs. This ''Sesame Street''-style show about being young and jobless in New York remains fresh, in all senses of the word (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'EL BESO DEL ADIOS/KISS BESSEMER GOODBYE' Tencha Avila's one-act comic drama is about a young Mexican-American woman who is the first in her family to graduate from college. It is given warmth and life by a talented multinational cast. But the real themes, racism and national identity, are explored all too simplistically (2:00). Repertorio Espanol at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street , (212) 225-9920, repertorio.org. (Anita Gates)20100506
 'BLACK ANGELS OVER TUSKEGEE' This effective tear-jerker tells the story of these trailblazing African-American pilots (2:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)20100506
 'BLOODY BLOODY ANDREW JACKSON' Alex Timbers and Michael Friedman's rowdy, dopey and devastatingly shrewd emo-rock musical about the seventh American president (played with raw charisma by Benjamin Walker) is the season's most entertaining -- and quite possibly most perceptive -- work of political theater (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village , (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)20100506
 'CAPTAIN PANTOJA AND THE SPECIAL SERVICE/PANTALEON Y LAS VISITADORAS' Peruvian soldiers in the Amazon need female companionship, so Captain Pantoja enlists a whole corps of prostitutes, complete with cute, midriff-baring uniforms. This rousing, sexy and surprisingly sweet new musical could give bawdiness a good name. In Spanish with simultaneous English translation. Repertorio Espanol at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street , (212) 225-9920, repertorio.org. (Gates)20100506
 'CIRCUMCISE ME' Yisrael Campbell's highly entertaining account of his conversion to Judaism -- not once but three times -- is elevated beyond shtick by the recognition that, aside from the jokes, this is Mr. Campbell's life, and that his quest for a ''relationship with God'' continues even after the house lights rise (1:30). Bleecker Street Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Daniel M. Gold)20100506
 'CREDITORS' This thrilling production of Strindberg's tragicomedy, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, puts each of its fast 90 minutes to cruel and careful use, leaving you feeling as if you'd had the breath knocked out of you. Alan Rickman directs Tom Burke, Anna Chancellor and Owen Teale as the members of a fatal sexual triangle (1:30). BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn , (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)20100506
 'FAMILY WEEK' The filmmaker Jonathan Demme directs Beth Henley's dreary comedy-drama set in ''the best treatment center in the country,'' where Rosemarie DeWitt has retreated to grieve the murder of her son and is visited by her mostly unhelpful sister (Quincy Tyler Bernstine), mother (Kathleen Chalfant) and daughter (Sami Gayle) (1:10). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village , (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)20100506
 'THE GLASS MENAGERIE'Judith Ivey gives one of the best performances of the season as an achingly real, unexpectedly funny Amanda Wingfield in this terrific revival of Tennessee Williams's breakthrough play. Gordon Edelstein's production skips the usual elegiac approach for something more tough-minded but powerfully effective (2:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)20100506
 'THE IRISH CURSE' This funny but formulaic play by Martin Casella looks in on a support group for men with small penises, a condition that supposedly is especially common among Irishmen. Mr. Casella goes to extremes to make the point that being less than average in this particular area can influence a life in all sorts of ways. Not all of it is credible, but at the play's best moments the jokes land perfectly (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village , (212) 691-1555, theirishcurse.com. (Neil Genzlinger)20100506
 'LOOKING FOR BILLY HAINES' Suzanne Brockmann and Will McCabe's lightweight tale of a gay 1920s movie star and a young actor auditioning for a part in a movie about him has heavy plotting, an amiable cast and tap dancing. But it needs a lot more (2:00). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton , (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Gates)20100506
 'LOVE, LOSS, AND WHAT I WORE' Or, shoes, bags and heartaches. A stuffed closet of comic or poignant stories, or both, collected by Nora and Delia Ephron, about women and their relationship to clothes. Featuring a rotating cast of five comics and actors (1:20). Westside Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20100506
 'MILK' Emily DeVoti's new play, set on a dairy farm in New England, doesn't quite work, but the writing has an engagingly original streak. Directed by Jessica Bauman, the production has fine touches, but the actors never catch fire (2:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village , (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Rachel Saltz)20100506
 'MY TRIP DOWN THE PINK CARPET' In his disarming solo vehicle, the pint-sized ''Will & Grace'' scene-stealer Leslie Jordan revisits his upbringing in Chattanooga, Tenn., his blossoming during the disco era and the challenge of accommodating what he calls an ''overt sissy nature'' in a show-business career (1:30). Midtown Theater, 163 West 46th Street , (212) 352-3101, theatremania.com. (David Rooney)20100506
 'PARENTS' EVENING'Julianne Nicholson and James Waterston play a married couple with child-rearing issues in Bathsheba Doran's two-hander directed by Jim Simpson. If you've spent an evening in company with oversharing spouses working through their grievances, you've more or less seen the play (1:20). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa , (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Isherwood)20100506
 '666' This brash show from the Spanish troupe Yllana isn't for everybody -- if ribald humor offends you, don't go -- but if you can stand the vulgarity, there are pleasures aplenty. The four cast members, portraying death-row inmates, never say a word but somehow manage to convey not only the humor in their series of scenes, but also the price of choosing the personal hell of lust and violence (1:20). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village , (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Genzlinger)20100506
 'STUFFED AND UNSTRUNG' Six puppeteers from the arm of the Jim Henson company that deals in work for grown-ups serve up a lively two hours of material, almost all of it improvised based on input from the audience. They work in full view of the crowd, playing to a video camera that projects their puppets onto two large screens, so you have the choice of either watching the skits as they would appear on TV or watching the act of creating them. It's great fun for most of the way, though all that improv eventually grows wearying and you wish for a few more set-pieces (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street , (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Genzlinger)20100506
 'THE TEMPERAMENTALS' Jon Marans's eminently likable docudrama about gay identity in the age of Eisenhower doesn't avoid the boilerplate devices of its genre, but it creates characters who surprise both us and themselves. Thomas Jay Ryan and Michael Urie are excellent as the central lovers. Jonathan Silverstein directs (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'THIS SIDE OF PARADISE' The beautiful and doomed Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald are resurrected to do the Charleston once more in this limp bio-musical with a score by the talented jazz singer Nancy Harrow (2:15).

 Extravaganzas
 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL: OVO' Cirque du Soleil imagines a colorful insect universe in this show under the big top at Randall's Island. The best acrobatic routines are dazzling, but others -- a unicyclist on a high wire, for instance -- seem familiar, and the humorous bits between the physical stunts are pretty drab. Best moment: a dance by what looks like a giant dryer hose (2:30). Under the big top at Randall's Island , (800) 450-1480, cirquedusoleil.com/ovo. (Genzlinger)20100506

 Last Chance
 'BLOODSONG OF LOVE: THE ROCK 'N' ROLL SPAGHETTI WESTERN'; closes on Sunday. A musical spoof of spaghetti westerns that could use a little more garlic in the Bolognese.

 'ENRON'; closes on Sunday. This flashy but labored economics lesson, written by Lucy Prebble and directed by Rupert Goold, works overtime to make entertaining spectacle out of a certain Texas energy company's self-destruction. But the realization sets in early that this British-born exploration of smoke-and-mirrors finances isn't much more than smoke and mirrors itself (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20100506
 'GIN AND ''IT'''; closes on Sunday. Blurring the line between film and stage, this multimedia adaptation of Hitchcock's ''Rope'' is formally ingenious if a little thin on content (1:00).

 'LIMONADE TOUS LES JOURS'; closes on Sunday. Austin Pendleton stars in Charles L. Mee's lightweight romance about a retirement-age American in Paris and a much younger Frenchwoman named Ya-Ya (Eleanor Handley). The two talk a lot, and Ya-Ya is constantly taking off her clothes, but sadly there's no enlightenment, no revelation and no chemistry.

 'THE ORPHANS' HOME CYCLE'; closes on Saturday. On the basis of the three-work production that begins this New York premiere, Horton Foote's heart-piercing nine-play family album about growing up lonely in early-20th-century Texas should be the great adventure of the theater season. Directed with cinematic fluidity by Michael Wilson (2:50). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton , (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Brantley)20100506
 'THE REALLY BIG ONCE'; closes on Saturday. A highly impressionistic evocation of the making of ''Camino Real,'' Tennessee Williams's highly impressionistic Broadway flop of 1953. Centered on the creative relationship between Williams and the director Elia Kazan, David Herskovits's production may bewilder the uninitiated, but it glows with an ardent empathy (1:10).

 'THE SUBJECT WAS ROSES'; closes on Sunday. Set in the Bronx in 1946, Frank D. Gilroy's well-made 1964 play (it won the Pulitzer Prize) probes one family's tensions and shifting alliances. With a fine cast led by Dan Daily, the Pearl Theater Company's thoughtful production, like the material, seems a bit old-fashioned, in ways both good and bad (2:00).

HEADLINE: Frayed Nerves, Trader Errors, Abrupt Panic

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Combine one part nervous traders, one part Greek crisis and one part trader error. Stir in one part central bank complacency. Bring to boil. Panic.
 That combination produced one of the wildest days ever in financial markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average, at one point, down almost 1,000 points while the euro sank to its lowest level in more than a year. There were substantial declines in emerging markets, whose economies had seemed to be booming, and in developed markets fearful of renewed recessions.
 Even though a substantial part of the worst plunge appeared to be linked to a trader error -- one $40 stock fell for a time to one penny -- prices had fallen around the world even before such mistakes began to happen.
 It appears that investors are again growing more hesitant to own assets like stocks and bonds, particularly since many now cost far more than they did only a few months ago. Another sharp retrenchment by investors, consumers and businesses could threaten the current global recovery by choking off financing and new orders for companies. 
 For much of the last 14 months, the prices of risky assets around the world have been rising rapidly. That recovery, from lows reached in March 2009 amid talk of a new Great Depression, both reflected and encouraged a revival in economic activity. Manufacturers in most countries this week reported rapidly growing order books.
 The most recent recession was made in the United States, and to a large extent it was unmade here as well. If it was the subprime mortgage market and other credit excesses that sent markets reeling, it was also a willingness of the American government, including the Federal Reserve Board, to plow in money when fears were at their highest that helped to bring those markets and economic activity back.
 For the last several months, worries have been alternately rising and receding that the next crisis would be made in Europe, where Greece has faced the possibility of default. Europe and the International Monetary Fund have announced plans for a bailout, but there have also been riots in Greece amid anger over the steep budget cuts being forced on the country.
 On Thursday, Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference that the bank's governing council had not even discussed the possibility of buying government bonds. That was taken as a disappointment by some traders, who had hoped the central bank would follow the Fed's lead in spreading liquidity around if conditions grew worse.
 Instead, fears are growing that Europe, which is worried that the crisis in Greece could be followed ones in Portugal and Spain, will follow the pattern laid down by the United States government in 2007, when officials offered frequent reassurances that the subprime mortgage problem was ''contained'' but delayed taking the bold action that finally did stop the panic.
 The height of panic on Thursday was reached shortly after lunchtime in the United States. First some currencies began to fall rapidly, with the euro suffering especially against the Japanese yen. 
 That could have been an indication that some large traders were unwinding positions. It has been popular to borrow yen at low interest rates and then use the money to speculate in higher yielding assets denominated in other currencies. Anyone unwinding such a trade would buy yen to repay the loan.
 Then, within a few minutes, the United States stock market appeared to be collapsing. Some of the decline was real, but another part of it was simply trading gone awry. 
 Temporary plunges in the price of Procter & Gamble and 3M, the former Minnesota Mining, cost the Dow about 300 points, and appeared to be the result of errors, not intentional sell orders. Similarly, Accenture, a large consulting firm, fell from more than $40 a share to one penny.
 By the close of the day, the Dow was down 347.80 points, or 3.2 percent, to 10,520.32.
 There were also substantial declines in most major European and Asian indexes. In Greece, however, the stock market put on a small rebound after falling to a 13-month low on Wednesday.
 Europe faces many obstacles in trying to deal with the growing crisis there. The European Central Bank, which handles monetary policy for the 16 countries in the euro zone, has fewer powers than the Fed does, and there is no Europe-wide government with powers to act quickly. Even now, after months of talking, the Greek bailout has not been approved by all whose approval is needed. The German parliament is expected to approve it on Friday.
 Moreover, the American crisis developed before budget deficits spiraled upward. Coming up with cash now would be harder, a fact Mr. Trichet pointed to when he called on European governments to cut their budget deficits.
 Spending large amounts of cash to bail out European governments is unlikely to be popular with voters in countries that are not in trouble, but a failure to do so could threaten many financial institutions around the continent.
 A traditional way to reduce debt is to devalue currencies, which leaves the outstanding debt worth less. Countries in the euro zone cannot do that, which is one reason Greece is in such difficulty. 
 But some investors seem to expect that eventually worldwide inflation will form a significant part of the solution, enabling governments and other debtors to pay back loans with currencies worth less than when the loans were made. In the last three days, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has lost 6 percent of its value, the price of 30-year inflation-indexed Treasury security has risen by almost 4 percent.
 There is no way to know whether this week's jitters will be put aside as more good economic news is released, or whether Europe's woes will create a repeat of the growing panic that engulfed American markets not that long ago.
 In the second case, this could be another one of those times when markets move from one extreme to the other. In the fall of 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent investors fleeing. The following spring, hopes that the bailouts and stimulus plans were working helped to begin a strong bull market in nearly every asset category.
 If this is another turning point, some of the winners will be those who, by luck or vision, managed to sell securities while the selling was easy. On Tuesday, Beazer Homes, a builder that was almost given up for dead in 2009 -- when its shares traded for less than 25 cents -- managed to raise $350 million selling new shares and new bonds. The money will go to refinance debt that otherwise could have forced the company into bankruptcy.
 By the close on Thursday, investors who bought shares at that offering, paying $5.81, had lost almost 10 percent of their money as the stock closed at $5.25.
 All this is taking place as the Senate debates financial reform amid considerable public hostility to banks. That no doubt will lead some on Wall Street to say that the markets are warning against making regulation too harsh, but the wild gyrations also serve as a reminder that the efficient markets hypothesis is not a very good model of what actually happens.
 Markets turn out to be very bad at assessing values under some circumstances. They were far too optimistic is 2006, and ridiculously pessimistic in early 2009.
 That is not a reason to get rid of markets, if only because any alternative, like letting judges and government officials set values, would likely be worse. But it does serve as a counterpoint to the infatuation with markets that led to the creation of a virtually unregulated shadow financial system. Those who believe in regulation will point to that, and say that if this wild ride continues, it will provide further evidence that markets need adult supervision.

HEADLINE: Suburbs Unite in Quest for Federal Housing Aid, but Are Shut Out

BYLINE: By JUAN-PABLO VELEZ

 BODY:
When a federal housing agency asked dozens of suburban cities in the Chicago area to band together to request a share of a $2 billion federal fund to help renovate foreclosed homes, they did exactly that.
 But when the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the awards as part of the federal stimulus program on Jan. 14, these cities got nothing, while Chicago -- which had fewer foreclosed homes in 2009 -- got $98 million.
 The disparity has left suburban mayors, real estate developers and residents with few resources to draw on as they address a growing number of boarded-up houses and overgrown lawns. The inability of the suburban cities to get federal money also raises questions about the effectiveness of an Obama administration effort to break down the crazy quilt of competing jurisdictions that often stands in the way of regional development.
 Foreclosures are ''a regional issue, where groups of communities can be negatively impacted by what's going on in one or more of those communities or in the broader region as a whole,'' said David Pope, village president of Oak Park, which has had a spike in foreclosures but has not been as hard-hit as other western suburbs. ''The federal response and state response have been inadequate to the task up to this point.'' 
 Suburban officials criticize the federal program, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which encouraged cities to unite to deal with regional problems but then sent the money to Chicago. The total number of suburban foreclosures is greater than that inside Chicago. In dozens of communities in South and West Cook County, the concentration of foreclosures -- the number of foreclosed homes per 1,000 residential properties -- is on a par with Chicago's.
 The Chicago metropolitan area has not been as hard hit as Las Vegas, Phoenix and several Florida cities where the real estate bubble expanded and then burst. Even so, foreclosed homes by the thousands -- in any area -- are a vexing problem because they invite vandalism and gang activity, depress values of surrounding properties and create upkeep and policing costs for towns.
 To address such problems, suburban city and county governments united last year to apply for rehabilitation money as part of the $2 billion stabilization program, a stimulus program intended to rehabilitate and resell the nation's glut of foreclosed homes. Suburbs that stood to benefit from the application, which was assembled by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, included Aurora, Berwyn, Cicero, Elgin and Joliet, as well as dozens of others in Cook, DuPage, Kendall, Lake and Will Counties. Combined, these suburbs had 41,321 foreclosures last year, while Chicago had 22,685.
 The suburban governments had big plans for their $78.7 million request. Had they received the money, they expected to rehabilitate 408 homes, demolish 121 blighted structures and develop 97 vacant lots.
 Officials at HUD, which ruled on the applications, would not discuss specifics, but did note that requests topped $15 billion nationally, more than seven times the $2 billion allotted by Congress.
 Chicago's $98 million award is the fifth largest in the country and the second largest among cities, after Los Angeles. Ellen Sahli, who oversees the housing agenda for Chicago's Department of Community Development, said the city distinguished itself in its application by involving community organizations with expertise in affordable housing.
 In an effort to ease a problem that crosses local jurisdictions, HUD asked neighboring counties and municipalities to submit joint applications. It also hoped cities would coordinate anti-foreclosure efforts into a regional strategy rather than laboring at cross-purposes. The suggestions aligned with President Obama's effort to promote local collaboration and strategic regional planning in metropolitan areas, which are the nation's economic powerhouses but are ruled by a patchwork of local governments that often compete at the expense of regional development.
 ''We did submit a regional, interjurisdictional proposal, but there was nothing in their scoring criteria that rewarded that,'' said Lee Deuben, a housing and community development planner at the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning who wrote the suburban proposal.
 Mr. Pope, the Oak Park village president, said: ''It's disappointing, but it's not surprising. We're getting a lot of happy talk and lip service out of the administration and HUD about working regionally. But up to this point, there hasn't been a whole lot of there there.''
 Without federal money, suburban municipalities are ill-equipped to counter the spread of a foreclosure crisis that had centered on Chicago but has recently engulfed the suburbs with more force than the city. Unemployment and underwater mortgages are now the leading causes of foreclosures and have widened the crisis' geographic reach, according to the Woodstock Institute, a research and policy group focused on community development. The earlier wave of foreclosures that began in 2006 hit poor and minority communities on the South and West Sides of Chicago, areas that were targets of reckless practices by subprime lenders.
 Foreclosures in these low-income areas remain near record levels: the city saw 22,685 new foreclosures in 2009, a 10 percent increase from the year before. The 41,321 foreclosures in the suburbs, meanwhile, were a 25 percent rise. Since the beginning of 2008, two of every three new foreclosures in the Chicago region have been in the suburbs.
 But foreclosures in Chicago are having an outsized impact as economically distressed minority neighborhoods face a years-long accumulation of decaying vacant buildings, Geoff Smith of the Woodstock Institute said.
 ''Without some intervention,'' he said, ''it's going to be a lot harder to bring back those neighborhoods than the suburbs.''
 Whether in suburbia or the inner city, foreclosed homes send ripple effects through neighborhoods. Boarded-up homes drive down nearby property values. They attract gangs and crime. They deepen blight.
 As home prices decline, tax revenues fall. Meanwhile, municipal spending on contractors to board up houses, on the police and on social services increases. Local governments get caught in the pinch.
 Federal neighborhood stabilization policies seek to contain this collateral damage. Local governments use federal money to snap up foreclosed homes, repair them and put them back on the market. The money can also be used to demolish abandoned homes and redevelop the lots.
 In two rounds of stabilization financing, Chicago has now received a total of $153 million. Suburban Cook County got $28 million in the first round. The city is repairing 11 homes and plans to rehabilitate up to 2,500 others spread across 29 of Chicago's most battered neighborhoods.
 Chicago Lawn, on the Southwest Side, is one. Neat rows of bungalowsare dotted with boarded windows. Behind the plywood door of a brick two-flat on a recent Wednesday, construction crews busily gutted the building.
 ''I think it's a great program,'' said Karry Young, the real estate developer revamping the pre-war house. ''I don't think the economy will be jump-started as swiftly without it.''
 One of 53 developers the city selected to turn federal dollars into bricks and mortar, Mr. Young is working on four houses in the neighborhood, employing 75 workers for four months. But there are hundreds more empty homes in this corner of the city and tens of thousands more across the metropolitan region.
 ''There is a significant need in our community on vacant, foreclosed properties,'' said Ms. Sahli, Chicago's first deputy commissioner of community development. ''This is a drop in the bucket.''
 Better a drop, perhaps, than nothing. State Representative William Davis's district in southern Cook County has the highest concentration of foreclosures in Illinois, yet has received a mere $9 million -- funneled through Cook County during the first round of the stabilization program. Since the suburban proposal was rejected, no new money is on the horizon.
 ''There's not even a Band-Aid to the situation right now,'' Mr. Davis said.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 2010, Friday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about suburban Chicago communities' receiving no federal stimulus money to rehabilitate foreclosed homes despite coordinating their applications, described incorrectly the application procedure for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. Staff members at the Department of Housing and Urban Development did take into account the fact that communities jointly applied, even though collaboration was not included as a specific scoring criterion.

HEADLINE: Putting Blame on Albany, Mayor Unveils Budget With Heavy Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled a bleak $63 billion budget on Thursday, he warned that it would cause a lot of pain to many New Yorkers and he did not mince words about where to lay the blame: on Albany.
 It was Gov. David A. Paterson, Mr. Bloomberg said, who proposed, in his original budget proposal, shortchanging the city by almost $500 million. That set the stage for Mr. Bloomberg's proposals on Thursday to reduce the city's teaching force by 6,700, and close 50 senior centers, 16 day care centers and perhaps 10 libraries. 
 And it was the legislators in Albany, Mr. Bloomberg said, who failed to pass a budget by April 1, as mandated by law, forcing him to reduce the number of firefighters by 400, the equivalent of 20 fire companies.
 ''We face a terrible price for Albany's irresponsibility,'' said Mr. Bloomberg, who referred to Albany or state officials more than 80 times during his budget presentation at City Hall.
 It is customary for Mr. Bloomberg to chastise state legislators as part of the annual budget process, and to do his best Cassandra impression about the perils of deep cuts. But this year, against a backdrop of economic uncertainty, Mr. Bloomberg's plans to help bridge a $5 billion deficit are being viewed by local officials, lobbyists and others as much graver, and much more realistic.
 As a result, the war of words between Albany and City Hall has escalated to an unusual intensity.
 Never was the verbal sparring more dramatic, or spontaneous, than toward the end of Mr. Bloomberg's 45-minute presentation, when a reporter asked the mayor to respond to a statement that had just been released by Robert L. Megna, the state's budget director. Holding up her BlackBerry, the reporter, Melissa Russo of WNBC, read aloud parts of Mr. Megna's statement, in which he said that ''the mayor's budget uses the state as a scapegoat to shirk responsibility for their own budget choices.''
 ''It's the most outrageous thing he could say,'' Mr. Bloomberg snapped. ''That's ridiculous.''
 Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president and a former Democratic assemblyman, summoned memories of the 1970s fiscal crisis after he was briefed about the budget. ''If Albany doesn't get their collective act together, they're going to destroy this city,'' he told reporters in the City Hall rotunda. ''This is the equivalent of 'Ford to New York: Drop Dead.' This is 'Albany to New York: Drop Dead.' '' 
 Under the mayor's proposal, which covers the fiscal year that starts on July 1, the city would lay off 6,400 teachers and 300 classroom aides, the first mass layoff of teachers since the 1970s. 
 The rest of the city's work force would shrink by more than 4,000 positions, mostly through attrition.
 Even if Albany comes to the rescue with additional aid later this year, Mr. Bloomberg said, the layoffs might be inevitable. 
 If the layoffs are carried out, the average elementary school class could grow by three students, said Joel I. Klein, the schools chancellor.
 ''The impact is awful,'' Mr. Klein said. ''We need more teachers, not fewer.''
 Mr. Klein renewed his call for an end to seniority rules that prohibit principals from laying off teachers solely based on performance. Mr. Klein said if layoffs were necessary, they should begin with the nearly 2,000 teachers who received unsatisfactory ratings from principals last year.
 But the city's powerful teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers, is unlikely to agree to such substantial changes. Michael Mulgrew, president of the union, said there had been no progress on the issue, and he said the city should instead concentrate its efforts on lobbying lawmakers for more money.
 ''We have to keep our focus on Albany, and that is the only thing we can do now,'' Mr. Mulgrew said.
 The layoffs are also likely to factor into the teachers' contract that is now being negotiated. ''I think it's just unrealistic that we can afford any raises,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
 Still, not all the news was dire. The Police Department is to be spared any cuts, in light of the recent bomb plot in Times Square, which the mayor said underscored the need for a robust security presence. Mr. Bloomberg had originally planned to cut the police force, which has dwindled over the last decade, by 892 officers.
 The budget would also offer a lifeline to the beleaguered Health and Hospitals Corporation, which is facing a $1 billion deficit. Mr. Bloomberg is providing $350 million to ease the corporation's debt to avoid the potential closing of treatment centers and specialty outpatient care at most hospitals. 
 The mayor's budget also does not contain any new taxes.
 But a group of liberal members of the City Council, echoing the populist anger that has swept through much of the country, suggested that the mayor impose taxes on hedge funds and stock traders.
 Melissa Mark-Viverito, a council member who represents East Harlem and parts of the Bronx and who is one of the leaders of the Council's Progressive Caucus, dismissed the mayor's budget as ''trickle-down economics'' and said it would do little to revive the economy.
 But Mr. Bloomberg scoffed at such suggestions, saying that additional taxes could drive businesses and the wealthiest New Yorkers out of the city.
 Given the dire economic news he was delivering, Mr. Bloomberg was asked if he was still glad he had pushed to overturn term limits so he could gain a third term. Seeming a bit surprised, Mr. Bloomberg said: ''Yes. I believe we're going to get through this better than any other city, and we'll look back and say it was tough, but we pulled together.''

HEADLINE: Paulson Backs Stronger Oversight of Markets

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary who led the Bush administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis, on Thursday endorsed calls for greater scrutiny and regulation of capital markets. 
 In testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Mr. Paulson called the regulatory system that he confronted as secretary, from 2006 to 2009, ''archaic and outmoded.'' The commission, which is examining the cause of the financial crisis that pushed the country into recession, has a Dec. 15 deadline to report to Congress.
 Mr. Paulson said that when he started as Treasury secretary, ''I saw immediately the huge gaping holes in the regulatory system, and so I took several actions immediately.'' The actions included trying to identify regulatory gaps and revive long-stalled reform of the mortgage-finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 But Mr. Paulson admitted: ''Most of the toothpaste was out of the tube and there really wasn't the proper regulator apparatus to deal with it.'' 
 The financial reform legislation being debated in the Senate would direct regulators to require higher capital and liquidity for financial institutions -- a step that Mr. Paulson endorsed.
 ''Everybody talks about capital, but to me the biggest lesson I learned out of all the crisis was the lack of focus by so many market participants and by regulators on the importance of liquidity,'' he told Bill Thomas, the commission's vice chairman. ''And you cannot place huge reliance on any short-term overnight market if you don't ask yourself, 'What am I going to do if that market doesn't function as normal? How much of a cushion do I have?' ''
 As a former chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Paulson faced skeptical questions about the so-called shadow banking system, the network of investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other institutions that largely went unchecked by a regulatory system designed to focus on deposit-taking banks. 
 ''A number of times, I have said that I believe that we had excessive complexity in financial products and that, as I think about it, it's very hard to regulate against innovation,'' Mr. Paulson told Phil Angelides, the chairman of the commission 
 Mr. Paulson called for heightened attention to securitization, the bundling of debts by underwriters who sell the assets to investors; repurchase agreements and commercial paper, a major source of short-term financing; derivatives contracts; and money market mutual funds. 
 In response to a question by Brooksley E. Born, a former regulator whose calls to regulate derivatives were rebuffed in the late 1990s during the Clinton administration, Mr. Paulson said of derivatives: ''They didn't create the crisis, but they magnified it. They exacerbated it.'' 
 Mr. Paulson also called for greater transparency in derivatives trading, telling Heather H. Murren, a retired stock analyst who serves on the commission: ''No one had any idea how many credit default swap contracts were out there on General Motors bonds.'' 
 When Ms. Murren asked whether Wall Street's campaign contributions and lobbying had distorted government policy, Mr. Paulson instead blamed legislative inaction.
 ''I do know that it is very, very difficult to get anything that's fundamental, controversial, difficult done at Congress without a crisis,'' he said.
 He added: ''A systemic risk regulator, if it had been in place, would have had more authority to deal with over-the-counter derivatives much earlier, or would have had purview and authority to deal with the repo market.''
 Mr. Paulson showed little sympathy for the argument that colossal financial companies -- which have grown only larger since the crisis -- should be broken up. 
 ''The level of concentration where we have 10 big institutions with 60 percent of the financial assets, this is a dangerous risk,'' he said. ''Now I believe these institutions are necessary. They perform a valuable role, so the way I get at your question is this. I say, first of all, I know we can have better regulation -- absolutely know -- better, more consistent, bigger capital requirements, bigger liquidity requirements. But then I come to the conclusion that regulation will never be perfect.'' 
 He added: ''There will continue to be failures. There have been since the beginning of time. Since the time we've had capital markets, institutions have failed, we've had financial crises.''

HEADLINE: A Week in the Life of the Economy

 BODY:
For all the recent talk about recovery, the economy's vulnerability was on full -- at times stomach-dropping -- display this week. 
 Job growth was up sharply in April, but unemployment also rose, as the number of out-of-work job seekers overwhelmed the number of jobs on offer. The stock market, which had surged most of this year, gyrated and sold off steeply, driven down mainly by fears of contagion from the Greek debt crisis. 
 For several minutes on Thursday, the market went into a tailspin, apparently accelerated by computerized trading strategies. By the end of the day on Friday, it had suffered a 771-point drop over four days and was down 5.7 percent for the week, its worst weekly decline in more than a year.
 Political leadership also was put to the test this week, with uninspiring results. European leaders finally agreed to a rescue package for Greece, but there are serious fears that it may be too little and too late to stop the crisis from spreading.
 In the United States, senators began a series of votes on a bill to reform the financial system; more votes are to come and a strong bill could still emerge. But for now it's not clear if lawmakers will do all that is needed to protect the taxpayers from another meltdown or bow to the banks and their lobbyists. 
 Both Congress and the White House need to show strong leadership. Congress has yet to make good on its promise to pass broad legislation to boost employment. What is needed is bolstered aid to states and an extension of unemployment benefits through the end of the year, as well as programs targeted on small-business lending, infrastructure projects, green technology and summer youth jobs. 
 Without a concerted job creation effort, recovery cannot take hold. The economy added an impressive 290,000 jobs in April, but job losses from 2008 to 2010 were so deep that it would take more than four years of monthly growth of that magnitude just to fill the hole. 
 On the Greek debt crisis and the threat of spillover damage, Europeans must take the lead. But Washington must use its considerable influence, as well as the strength of its example. 
 Bailouts and stimulus are contentious here. Republicans are determined to play their faux deficit hawk role -- despite the utter hypocrisy and destructiveness -- through the November polls. Expansionary policy, and its corollary, higher inflation, are especially distressing to European powers given their dark history. The potential alternatives -- renewed, deep recession and rifts in the euro-era -- would be even worse. 
 Market regulators must also act quickly to monitor and rein in trading techniques that may provoke the kind of volatility seen on Thursday. So-called high-frequency trading, flash trading and dark pools all employ a combination of speed, privileged information and opacity -- violating principles of market fairness, transparency and efficiency. That is unacceptable under any circumstances, but especially dangerous now, when nervous markets are prone to panic. 
 And, yes, all this must occur against the backdrop of debate on financial reform. The past week provided more evidence, if any more were needed, that the system is still in need of repair.

HEADLINE: Lease Deal Near for Empty Times Square Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A prominent law firm is expected to sign a lease next week for a new home in the vacant 40-story tower called 11 Times Square, ending months of speculation about the deal and providing another sign that the commercial real estate market may have hit bottom.
 The developer of the 1.1-million-square-foot glass tower, which is nearing completion at the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, is also negotiating with several companies who want to build an aquarium filled with sharks, rays and penguins on the lower floors of the building. 
 It remains unclear whether those companies can raise the estimated $100 million needed for such a tourist attraction. But real estate executives who have been briefed on the deal with the law firm, Proskauer Rose, said that it was finally ready to commit.
 Proskauer plans to lease about 380,000 square feet, or roughly 40 percent, of the $1.2 billion tower, which has until now stood as a symbol of the tattered financial and real estate markets, said the executives, who requested anonymity because the deal had not been signed. Proskauer's name would be displayed at the entrance to the tower, and possibly at the top.
 ''It's a really positive sign for New York,'' said Joseph R. Harbert, chief operating officer of Cushman & Wakefield New York, a real estate broker. ''It's a new building, and it's Times Square.''
 Both Proskauer and the developer, Steven J. Pozycki, chief executive of SJP Properties, declined to comment through spokesmen. CB Richard Ellis, the real estate broker representing both parties, also declined to discuss the pending deal.
 Real estate executives said that the lease could be signed as early as Wednesday. Still, they cautioned against any exuberance about a sudden turnaround in the market over all. 
 The Proskauer deal is being propelled by what is in effect a subsidy worth tens of millions of dollars from Morgan Stanley, the giant bank that is Proskauer's current landlord at 1585 Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets, which is also Morgan Stanley's world headquarters. Morgan Stanley has from time to time offered Proskauer millions of dollars to vacate the 12 floors it occupies.
 Proskauer is using the undisclosed sum from Morgan Stanley to offset the cost of moving seven blocks to 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue and building new offices in the unfinished space it is getting. SJP Properties is also offering substantial concessions. Other tenants would probably not be able to reap the same benefits. 
 Peter G. Riguardi, president of the real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle's New York region, said he was ''cautiously optimistic'' about the state of the Manhattan commercial market. The Proskauer deal, he said, would be symbolically important, but it would probably not result in a net reduction of vacant space, since Morgan Stanley will move employees to its headquarters from nearby buildings.
 The deal would, however, remove one of the few large blocks of vacant space from the Midtown market, which brokers said could eventually lead to an increase in rents. Morgan Stanley's move to expand at 1585 Broadway is another good sign. 
 Real estate executives and the Bloomberg administration have been anxiously scanning the Manhattan skyline for signs that the market has rebounded. After the financial industry collapsed in 2008, commercial rents and values plunged by as much as 40 percent.
 Rents are still falling, albeit at a slower pace, and most real estate brokers say that Manhattan is still mostly a ''renter's market.'' But, they added, there are signs of life. 
 Companies that had hesitated to make a move last year are starting to sign long-term leases. Indeed, Avon, Hachette Filipacchi Media and six other companies signed leasing deals in the first quarter of this year for over 100,000 square feet of space each. The pool of surplus office space offered by corporate tenants is also shrinking.
 ''It's another major relocation deal getting signed this year,'' said Mitchell Stier, chairman of Studley, a real estate broker. ''There were very few in 2009.''
 Proskauer almost reached a deal at another planned tower on Eighth Avenue at the top of the market in 2008, when Morgan Stanley offered it about $100 million to move, according to two brokers. But the deal collapsed. Now the bank is offering substantially less.
 Brokers say that Proskauer will pay about $75 a square foot for floors in the middle of the tower on 42nd Street, about 30 percent less than what the developer had hoped to get in 2008. The developer could still charge higher rents for the top floors.
 The pending deal would be a relief for both the developer and his financial partner, Prudential Real Estate Investors.
 ''Obviously, the market is completely different than when we put the first shovel in the ground three years ago,'' said Kevin Smith, a portfolio manager for Prudential. ''We had a great recession. The rent economics are not nearly as positive as when we started, but we're confident about the long-term value of this property.''

HEADLINE: Greek Debt Crisis Raises Doubts About Both the Euro and the European Union Itself

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Nadim Audi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Europe's consistent inability to move quickly enough to get ahead of the financial markets during the Greece crisis is shaking the euro and the foundations of the European Union itself, as critics of the euro have long predicted would happen.
 The question being raised with increasing urgency is whether the European Union can fashion a mechanism to speed decision-making before irreversible damage is done and the euro itself slips into history.
 The delays are inevitable, most experts say, stemming from the nature of the European Union and its own institutional voids: no single government, no single treasury, no effective fiscal coordination, no mechanism for crisis management.
 Every major decision on the euro must be negotiated among member states and European institutions, a torturous process that also plays up political fissures both within and among member countries. That breeds uncertainty and even panic among investors, who already doubt that the Greek deal that the European leaders finally sealed on Friday night will forestall an eventual restructuring of Athens' crippling debt. 
 ''The European Union is running behind events,'' said Anne-Marie Le Gloannec, a political scientist at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. While, for example, the United States could ''shock and awe'' the markets early in the global financial crisis with the TARP bailout money and a huge stimulus program to restart the economy, there is no single European institution that can do the same. By contrast, every decision about Greece has been a painful, time-consuming bargain among the different national governments, with their own political requirements and concerns, and their own views of economic virtue.
 ''There are no more bullets in the gun right now,'' said a senior French official who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the Brussels summit meeting on Friday that confirmed the $140 billion relief package for Greece. The deal was reached over a period of months with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. ''Markets are reacting now because they think it's too little, too late,'' Ms. Le Gloannec said. ''And because it's too late, it's too little.''
 The European Central Bank, too, has been largely inadequate to the task. On Thursday, the head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, failed to calm the markets with his assurances that Greece would not default and that the bank was not considering buying up Greek, Portuguese or Spanish bonds, which many analysts consider an obvious next step.
 Investors dismissed Mr. Trichet's words as insufficient, saying that politicians were in denial. They say that governments have no credible exit strategy, that Greek debts will need to be restructured and that the budget rules that are supposed to limit member nations' budget deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product have been used as a floor, rather than a ceiling.
 Instead of dealing with these substantive matters, however, European leaders have sharply attacked the markets and the ratings agencies that have downgraded Greek, Portuguese and Spanish bonds, calling them improperly regulated, unjust and greedy. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, called it ''a battle of the politicians against the markets'' and vowed, ''I am determined to win.''
 Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, attacked financial ''speculators.'' Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero of Spain told traders to look at economic data instead of ''unfounded off-the-wall suggestions and speculation.''
 Pierre Lellouche, the French minister for European affairs, said in an interview about the ratings agencies: ''I'd be interested to know what these 30-year-old boys know about the disaster they are causing to people in Spain or Portugal or anywhere else. Where states have to renationalize the losses and people are out of a job and out of their houses. Where's the accountability of these judges?'' 
 European leaders have talked of a European Ratings Agency and a European Monetary Fund, at least for the future, and are slowly moving to trim budget deficits. But the problem is more fundamental, said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. ''Most of the time, the gap between European rhetoric and reality is just an annoyance,'' he said. ''But that gap is simply lethal when it comes to the euro.''
 Instead of attacking markets and forming a new European agency, he said, ''the leaders need to focus on the issue that is driving the markets: the dire growth prospects for the southern rim'' of the euro zone, meaning Greece, Portugal, Spain and even Italy. No matter how big the loan package, ''the only way to ensure debt sustainability is to get them growing,'' he said, and that means significant structural changes to the euro zone.
 The southern countries are so uncompetitive compared with the others, especially Germany, that there are permanent trade imbalances that will destroy the euro, Mr. Tilford said, unless European leaders either fix the imbalances or accept more political and fiscal integration. ''But the course we're on is unsustainable,'' he said, and Germany seems uninterested in changing its economic model to benefit the poorer south. 
 While individual countries will bear continual transfers of funds to poorer areas within the nation -- to eastern Germany, for example, or to Corsica or Wales -- ''I don't see the necessary social solidarity in the wider euro zone to provide this kind of fiscal supranationalism,'' Mr. Tilford said. ''The myth of European integration and solidarity has been exposed as wishful thinking.''
 On Friday, the Austrian finance minister, Josef Proll, took a firm northern line. Asked if Greek debt needed to be restructured, he said: ''Most certainly not. We are providing 110 billion euros in loans. Greece has to plow through. I see no reason whatsoever to let the Greeks off the hook.'' 
 Asked about necessary reforms, Mr. Proll, who is on a European Union task force to propose them, was restrained. He talked about tough rules for national budgeting, even to the point of personal accountability in cases of outright fraud. But even these measures, he said, cannot be implemented until at least next year. 
 Sunday is the 60th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, the proposal by France's foreign minister, Robert Schuman, to create a supranational organization of states in war-ravaged Europe. It is now celebrated as Europe Day, and while it led first to a French and German trade zone on coal and steel, the European Union still lacks a common energy policy. And while that early pact led to the free-trade zone known as the European Economic Community, the European Union still lacks serious economic cohesion. 
 ''Sixty years later, where is Europe?'' Ms. Le Gloannec asked. ''A lot has been built, but a lot has been taken for granted. Europe is living out of old policies and sleeping on its laurels. There is no love lost for Europe, but there is also no way out.''

HEADLINE: As Kyoto Attractions, Wave Pools vs. Temples

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
KYOTO, Japan -- A dolphin pool, a penguin park and a giant wave pool could soon join the imperial-era townhouses and ancient Buddhist temples in Kyoto, Japan's former imperial capital.
 As early as June, work will begin on a mammoth aquarium complex in central Kyoto, in leafy Umekoji Park at the center of the city. A brainchild of the Orix Real Estate Corporation, the project could breathe new life into Kyoto's tourism industry by attracting more than two million visitors a year, developers say.
 But to opponents, the proposed aquarium, set to open in 2012, is a misguided enterprise that threatens to destroy Kyoto's historic ambience. Adding to the disgrace, they say, is Orix's plan to showcase dolphins in a 19,000-square-foot pool at a time when the nation is under fire for hunting thousands of dolphins and porpoises each year.
 ''Kyoto should not be building concrete boxes,'' said Shinsho Kajita, head priest at the Honen-in Buddhist temple in Kyoto and leader of a growing local protest movement against Orix's plans. 
 ''Kyoto's residents and its visitors care more about preserving old neighborhoods,'' he said. ''We have the wrong idea of economic development, and it is destroying our city.''
 Whether or not Kyoto gets the 118,000-square-foot aquarium, experts say that Japan clearly needs to re-examine its approach to tourism, a $944 billion industry worldwide -- bigger than autos, bigger than steel.
 Despite choice destinations like ancient Kyoto and modern, bustling Tokyo, as well as beach and ski resorts, Japan attracted just 8.4 million foreign visitors in 2008 -- a small fraction of France's 79 million, the United States' 58 million or China's 53 million, according to the World Tourism Organization. In 2009, the number of foreign visitors to Japan dropped an additional 18.7 percent, to 6.79 million, amid the global recession, according to Japan's government. 
 Japan earned just $10.8 billion from foreign tourism in 2008, a tenth of the $110 billion the United States earned from overseas tourists that year. Ukraine and Macau each attract more foreign tourists a year than Japan. 
 ''Japan has the potential to be a tourism superpower,'' said Hiroshi Mizohata, who took over as commissioner of the Japan Tourism Agency in January.
 Mr. Mizohata, former president of a popular local soccer team, has set an ambitious goal of increasing the number of foreign visitors to Japan to more than 10 million in two years and to 20 million by 2016. ''With new ideas and initiatives, I believe we can meet these targets,'' he said.
 Government officials blame the lack of budget-travel options in Japan, as well as its high costs, for the country's unpopularity as a tourist destination. 
 But critics point out that until now, the tourism market has been geared almost exclusively to domestic travelers, which means that much of Japan's tourist infrastructure does not meet the expectations of foreign tourists. 
 Japan's tourism strategy has also been driven by investment in engineering projects and theme parks rather than the protection of the country's natural and cultural riches, an oversight that some experts say has cost the country dearly in tourism dollars. 
 Nowhere is Japan's weakness in tourism more evident than in Kyoto, said Alex Kerr, a longtime resident and founder of Iori, a company that since 2004 has restored 10 old townhouses, or machiya, in the city to rent out to visitors.
 In the postwar period, Kyoto has shown little concern for preserving the traditional neighborhoods that would most appeal to foreign tourists, he said. The pace of destruction gathered speed in the 1990s; more than 40,000 old wooden homes disappeared from central Kyoto that decade, according to the International Society to Save Kyoto. 
 Though ancient temples and gardens remain in the city, they are overwhelmed by the sprawling mass of gray buildings and neon signs that dominate the skyscape -- the product of ineffective zoning policies in the city, Mr. Kerr said.
 Visitors to Kyoto are greeted by the peculiar, needle-shaped, red-and-white Kyoto Tower, as well as the Kyoto Hotel Okura, a 16-floor granite building in the heart of the city that had to seek a waiver from local height restrictions when it was rebuilt in 1994. Three years later, Kyoto Station -- a structure nearly half a mile long, with a glaring glass facade in its latest incarnation -- opened in the city center. 
 Besides the aquarium, local politicians are pushing for more big projects in Kyoto's city center, including a new 323,000-square-foot Railroad Museum built by the West Japan Railway Company, slated to open in 2014. The deals are expected to bring the city lucrative rent income.
 All the modern construction can obscure the city's charms, especially for foreign visitors. ''This all looks the same as Tokyo,'' said Delaina Hutchinson, a tourist from Australia, after a hike up the Kyoto Tower in February. She and her husband and two young daughters planned to spend just a day in Kyoto before returning to their Tokyo hotel that evening. ''I wish we could get away to somewhere quieter,'' she said.
 According to Mr. Kerr, the government has long neglected investment in tourism, which it sees as an industry that supports only menial, low-paid jobs. Officials overlook the economic activity generated by architects, landscape architects and similar professions, he said.
 ''Making things has been a Japanese obsession, something that advanced economies do, while tourism was for poor countries,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''Now the importance has flipped: in today's economy, it's software over hardware. But they have been asleep in Tokyo.''
 Kyoto officials say that tourism can coexist with modern development.
 ''Of course, we care about Kyoto's scenery and will work to preserve it,'' Keiji Yamada, governor of Kyoto Prefecture, told a group of visiting foreign reporters earlier this year. ''But we must also compete with the world.''
 Local officials say that the aquarium will be especially good in attracting tourists from China, more of whom have come in recent years. The Chinese have many ancient temples of their own, Miyako Murozaki, a tourism official at Kyoto's chamber of commerce, noted. ''They like new things,'' she said.
 Orix says the aquarium will be an ''interactive and educational space'' that will showcase both local and exotic marine life. ''We have been holding many meetings with local residents, and we intend to consider their views,'' said Tetsuya Nagai, a company spokesman. 
 Anger ran high among local residents at a recent protest meeting. ''I want them to leave Umekoji Park as it is,'' said Yasuko Hirano, a 60-year-old homemaker. ''As a little child, I remember playing in the garden of a local temple, but now it's turned into a car park,'' she said. ''What's being destroyed and what's being built -- they are both tragedies.''

HEADLINE: Los Suns

 BODY:
We don't often get a chance to congratulate athletes for truly being role models. But watching the Phoenix Suns' players wearing their ''Los Suns'' jerseys this week made us proud. 
 The Suns' managing partner, Robert Sarver, left no doubt about the message. He said that Arizona's harsh new illegal immigration law calls into question ''our basic principles of equal rights and protection.'' And he warned that the state's ''already struggling economy will suffer even further setbacks.'' 
 Mr. Sarver and his team weren't the only ones speaking out against the law that invites racial profiling by giving police broad power to stop people on vaporous suspicions of being in the country illegally. 
 The major league baseball players' union warned that ''if the current law goes into effect,'' it ''will consider additional steps necessary to protect the rights and interests of our members.'' The union flexed its considerable economic muscle, noting that hundreds of league players are foreign citizens and fully half of the 30 major league ball clubs use Arizona for spring training. 
 There are growing demands to move next year's All-Star Game from Arizona. Assorted cities and a coalition of 20 unions and civil rights groups have announced boycotts of the state's lifeblood convention industry. 
 While others protest, the Obama administration remains too much on the sidelines in the face of Arizona's foolishness. What's needed is swift action by the Department of Justice to challenge the law in court. In the meantime, federal immigration databases should be denied to police attempting to enforce a law that would usurp federal powers. 
 Before this goes any further, Arizona should check the scars of the early '90s when the state arrogantly rejected Martin Luther King's Birthday as a holiday and prompted cancellations of more than 100 lucrative conventions and events, including the Super Bowl. It's pathetic that Arizona's politicians would put the state through that once again. Arizona should repeal this law immediately.

HEADLINE: In New York, Some Judges Are Now Skeptical About Debt Collectors' Claims

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
As New Yorkers have tumbled into credit card debt in large numbers during the great recession, bill collectors have inundated the courts to get what they say is due. In turn, the courts have issued hundreds of thousands of orders against residents. Some consumer groups argue that by doing so, the courts have become little more than an arm of the debt collection industry. 
 Now, a few judges in New York State are suggesting that they agree, at least in part, with the consumer groups. They have fumed at debt collectors and their lawyers, scolding them for interest as high as 30 percent a year and berating them for false statements and abusive practices. 
 Some of the rulings have even been sarcastic or incredulous. In December, a Staten Island judge said debt collectors seemed to think their lawsuits were taking place in a legal Land of Oz, where everyone was supposed to follow anticonsumer rules invented by some unseen debt-collection wizard. 
 Last month, a Manhattan appeals court threw out a credit card case, saying a debt collection company had sued the wrong person but pursued the case anyway. 
 ''I think these judges are outraged at the status quo, and they're trying to change it,'' said Janet Ray Kalson, a Manhattan lawyer who is the chairwoman of a City Bar Association committee that has studied the deluge of credit card cases. 
 Debt-buyer businesses purchase debts -- along with lists of names and amounts supposedly due -- for pennies on the dollar from credit card companies and sometimes have no real evidence about whom they are suing or why. They then file tens of thousands of suits, often with little to back up their claims.
 A Nassau County District Court judge said recently, for example, that one of New York City's high-volume debt collection law firms, which has close ties to a debt-buying company, did not provide ''a scintilla of evidence'' that there was even a debt in a case against a Long Island woman. 
 The suit received an unusual amount of attention. The judge, Michael A. Ciaffa, said that it ''regrettably, involves a veritable 'perfect storm' of mistakes, errors, misdeeds and improper litigation practices.'' Judge Ciaffa said the law firm, Eltman, Eltman & Cooper, ignored court orders, made a ''demonstrably false'' assertion and harassed the woman for payment even after its suit was dismissed. 
 The case before Judge Ciaffa ended with an order that is far from typical in a credit card suit. The woman who had been sued, Patricia Bohnet, a bookkeeper and single mother, did not have to pay anything. But Eltman, Eltman & Cooper had to pay $14,800 in sanctions for violating ethical rules at least 18 times. Under the judge's order, $4,800 is to go to Ms. Bohnet and the remainder to a state fund that works to reimburse clients for dishonest conduct by lawyers.
 ''They don't care if you're sick; they don't care if you're poor,'' Ms. Bohnet said in an interview at her job in Woodmere. ''Their only job is to collect money, and they'll do it in any way possible.''
 In response to questions, the law firm said in a written statement that Judge Ciaffa had not had all the facts but that the firm would not appeal. ''As with any firm or business that handles this type of volume,'' it added, ''there exists a potential for errors or omissions in the normal course of business.'' 
 Eltman, Eltman & Cooper was one of 35 law firms sued last July by the state, which claimed that they had improperly obtained more than 100,000 judgments in consumer-debt cases. Separate files in Federal District Court in Brooklyn show that without admitting fault, the Eltman law firm settled a class-action suit in 2006 that claimed it used ''false, misleading and deceptive means'' to collect debts. 
 Privately, some judges say they are embarrassed that in many New York courts, debt-collection lawyers have grown so comfortable that they give the impression they are in charge of the proceedings and do not need prove their claims with strong evidence.
 In the recent pro-consumer rulings, skepticism of the debt collectors' claims has been obvious. A Civil Court judge in Brooklyn, Noach Dear, has written decisions that come close to saying that the collection cases are sometimes based on falsehoods.
 In a case in August, Judge Dear observed that there was nothing to substantiate a lawyer's claim that she somehow remembered mailing a document to the credit card holder that was the foundation of the collection suit. The document, Judge Dear noted archly, had been mailed three and a half years earlier.
 Behind the legalese of the credit card suits, some judges have suggested, there is often a disorganized jumble of documentation. A Mount Vernon City Court judge noted that one case was based on little more than ''a self-serving computer printout.'' A Manhattan judge said one company that bought debt claims from credit card companies had filed suit against a cardholder although it did not own that particular debt. 
 In the Staten Island case, the judge, Philip S. Straniere, said a credit card company was claiming interest of 28 percent on the balance due, which would be illegal as usury under New York law. The company argued that the credit card issued to a New Yorker that seemed to be from a national company had actually been issued by a one-branch bank in Utah, which had no usury law. 
 ''Like the Land of Oz, run by a Wizard who no one has ever seen,'' Judge Straniere wrote, ''the Land of Credit Cards permits consumers to be bound by agreements they never sign, agreements they may never have received, subject to change without notice and the laws of a state other than those existing where they reside.'' 
 The judge ruled that the supposed agreement allowing unlimited interest charges was not enforceable in New York. 
 Industry officials said that tales of abusive collection cases were misleading. ''There are certainly colorful stories,'' said Joann Needleman, an officer of the National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys. ''People think that handful is the rule, not the exception, but it's not.''
 But Ms. Bohnet, the Long Island woman who was sued by a New York law firm, said just one case could be harrowing. When she received a call last year at the charity where she keeps the books for $39,000 a year, the voice on the other end told her the debt collectors had a five-year-old court judgment against her for a $4,861 debt. She had to pay, or they would start taking money out of her salary, she said she was told.
 The address of the debt-collection firm and its lawyers at Eltman, Eltman & Cooper seemed to be the same, she noticed. 
 Ms. Bohnet did not know she had ever been sued. She started to cry, she said, worried that with a chunk of money taken every month, she might lose the modest apartment she needed to share custody of her teenage daughter. 
 ''I was in all-out fear,'' she said, adding, ''After I got off the phone, I realized I didn't even know what the debt was for.'' She might have had an old credit card debt, but she had had some years of problems with alcohol and drugs and tangled financial problems. In recovery, she said, she had worked to clean up her financial affairs. 
 The next time the collectors called, she said, she told them that she was willing to pay if she owed any money but that she needed to see some proof that they had the right person. Then, without a lawyer, she went to the court, in Hempstead, to check into the order the debt collectors said they had against her. 
 After some digging, she found the case. The debt-buyer's lawyers had filed a sworn statement that they said was proof she had been given notice of the suit. A process server for Eltman, Eltman & Cooper claimed she had been given a copy of the suit personally on July 30, 2004.
 Judge Ciaffa doubted that. Ms. Bohnet, he wrote, ''hadn't lived at that address since 1998.''

HEADLINE: Early Derby Favorite Is Sold and Then Retired

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
Eskendereya, once considered an early favorite to win the Kentucky Derby, was retired Friday after his owner reached a deal with Jess Jackson, the wine impresario who co-owns the reigning Horse of the Year, Rachel Alexandra. 
 Eskendereya was scratched a week before the Derby with soft tissue in his left front leg. He was the runaway winner of the Fountain of Youth and the Wood Memorial. His owner, Ahmed Zayat, who owns Zayat Stables, is in bankruptcy proceedings after Fifth Third Bank said his racing operation defaulted on a $34 million loan.
 Jackson now owns 75 percent of the colt - his latest high-profile acquisition. He bought Rachel Alexandra shortly after she won the Kentucky Oaks last spring and embarked on an ambitious campaign in which she beat the boys in the Preakness Stakes to become the first filly in 85 years to win the second leg of the Triple Crown. She beat colts again in the Haskell Invitational, and then older males in the Woodward Stakes. Her championship year, however, may have taken a toll. However, she has finished second in her two comeback races. 
 Eskendereya's purchase price has not been revealed, but bloodstock agents and recent purchases in what is a dismal equine economy, indicate his value at $3 million to $5 million.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Origin of Scare On Wall Street Eludes Officials

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
A day after a harrowing plunge in the stock market, federal regulators were still unable on Friday to answer the one question on every investor's mind: What caused that near panic on Wall Street? 
 Through the day and into the evening, officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal agencies hunted for clues amid a tangle of electronic trading records from the nation's increasingly high-tech exchanges. 
 But, maddeningly, the cause or causes of the market's wild swing remained elusive, leaving what amounts to a $1 trillion question mark hanging over the world's largest, and most celebrated, stock market. 
 The initial focus of the investigations appeared to center on the way a growing number of high-speed trading networks interact with one another and with venerable exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Most investors are unaware that these competing systems have fractured the traditional marketplace and have displaced exchanges like the Big Board as the dominant force in stock trading. 
 The silence from Washington cast a pall over Wall Street, where shaken traders returned to their desks Friday morning hoping for quick answers. The markets remained on edge, as the uncertainty over what caused Thursday's wild swings added to the worries over the running debt crisis in Greece. 
 In a joint statement issued after the close of trading, the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said they were continuing their review. And the two agencies indicated they were looking particularly closely at how different trading rules on different exchanges, which temporarily halted trading on some markets while activity in the same stocks continued on other markets, might have contributed to the problem. 
 ''We are scrutinizing the extent to which disparate trading conventions and rules across various markets may have contributed to the spike in volatility,'' the statement said. 
 A government official who was involved in the investigation said regulators had moved away from a theory that it was a trading mistake -- a so-called fat finger episode -- and were examining the links between the futures and cash markets for stocks. 
 In particular, this official said, it appeared that as stock trading was slowed on the New York Exchange when big price moves started, orders moved automatically to other, electronic exchanges that did not have pricing restrictions. 
 The pressure in the less-liquid markets was amplified by the computer-driven trades, which led still other traders to pull back. Only when traders began to manually respond to the sharp drop did the market seem to turn around, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was not complete. 
 On Friday evening, another government official directly involved in the investigation said that regulators had not yet been able to completely rule out any of the widely discussed possible causes of the market's gyrations.
 This official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that regulators had collected statistical and trading data from stock and futures exchanges, and had begun cross-analyzing that with trading reports from brokerage firms and large market participants. Regulators have also gathered anecdotal accounts of what happened from hedge funds and other trading firms.
 The two major regulatory agencies -- the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- have generated multiple memos detailing what they have found and offering possible causes for the market events. Among the issues discussed in the memos, the official said, were the disparate rules that different stock exchanges have for dealing with large price movements on the same securities and how prices on futures markets and stock exchanges appeared to lead or follow each other's movements down and back up. 
 The lack of a firm answer, more than 24 hours after the market's plunge Thursday, left some on Wall Street frustrated.
 ''The problem is you don't come in and find out what the clear answer is,'' said Art Hogan, the New York-based chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. ''We don't have the clear explanation for how it happened.''
 Others, however, said it would take time to pinpoint what happened given the increasingly complex nature of modern stock trading. 
 Over the last five years, the stock market has split into a plethora of new competing hubs and trading outlets, a legacy of deregulation earlier this decade and fast-paced technological change. On Friday, the rivalry between the two main exchanges erupted into view as each publicly pointed the finger at the other for being a main cause of the collapse on Thursday, which sent shockwaves around the globe.
 ''This is the sort of situation that has been a worry for a long time, but the markets have changed in a way that has made things more difficult,'' said Robert L. D. Colby, former deputy director of trading and markets at the S.E.C. ''They've become more fragmented, so it's harder for any one exchange to see the full picture and take action.''
 On Friday, President Obama sought to provide reassurance that regulators were working to find the root of the problem.
 ''The regulatory authorities are evaluating this closely with a concern for protecting investors and preventing this from happening again,'' the president said. 
 The absence of a unified system to halt trading in individual stocks led to bitter accusations between exchanges on Friday. Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, appeared on CNBC to criticize the New York Stock Exchange for halting trading for up to 90 seconds in half a dozen stocks on Thursday.
 ''Stopping for 90 seconds in time of crisis is exactly equivalent to not picking up the phone,'' Mr. Greifeld said.
 A few minutes later, Duncan L. Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, responded in an interview on CNBC, blaming Nasdaq's computers for continuing trading while the market was in free fall.
 ''These computers go out and just find the next bid they can find,'' he said.
 Mr. Niederauer acknowledged the need to introduce circuit-breakers along the lines of those already in place on the Big Board, and his views were echoed by some chief executives of the new exchanges.

HEADLINE: U.S. Shows Surprising Gain in Jobs

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Despite growing unease in the financial markets, the American economy is gathering steam, adding an unexpectedly large number of jobs last month. 
 The Labor Department's monthly snapshot of the job market, released on Friday, showed that employers added 290,000 jobs in April -- the largest gain in four years -- and that they did so across a broad swath of industries. The United States has now added jobs for four consecutive months. 
 The unemployment rate, however, crept up to 9.9 percent, from 9.7 percent in March, mostly because of a significant increase in the number of people who had previously given up deciding to look for work again. 
 Major stock gauges in the United States rose briefly on the unexpectedly strong job growth report before gyrating in a trading day marked by continuing fears about spreading European debt woes and concern about structural weaknesses in the stock markets that may have contributed to a terrifying sell-off on Thursday. 
 European leaders were meeting in Brussels over the weekend on ways to reassure investors that the heavily indebted countries within the euro zone would not face debt defaults and to restore confidence in European banks.
 The stock market has raced higher this year, before retrenching the last few days, and some American companies have posted record profits. But stock investors increasingly fret that the economic recovery in the United States could be threatened by a European-led debt crisis.
 Economists suggest that as long as the debt crisis is primarily contained to Greece, or even a few other countries, the effect on the United States will be minor. 
 A full-blown financial crisis across Europe, however, could affect banks in the United States, and in turn, how much credit they offer American companies or consumers. 
 Another potential risk for the American economy is foreign investors fleeing to the dollar and abandoning the euro. That would strengthen the dollar, making it difficult for American companies to sell their goods abroad.
 ''I think at this point the U.S. economy has a very good chance of being able to continue its recovery despite the uncertainty in Europe,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''But the threat is real, and we have to be vigilant and very nimble.''
 President Obama called April's job report ''particularly heartening.'' He noted that ''this week's job numbers come as a relief to Americans who've found a job, but it offers, obviously, little comfort to those who are still out of work.'' 
 All manner of businesses were hiring, including those in manufacturing, leisure and hospitality and health care. One of the strongest gains occurred in manufacturing, which added 44,000 jobs, the largest increase since 1998.
 The Census Bureau contributed 66,000 temporary jobs last month. 
 Yet, in a sign that many people will struggle to find a job even as the economy improves, the number of people who have been out of work for more than six months hit 6.7 million, nearly 46 percent of the unemployed. ''The economic recovery and expansion is entrenched, sustained and sustainable,'' Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics, said. But he warned that the economy faced numerous challenges, including the need for the United States to deal with its own domestic debt and a possible downturn in exports to Europe.
 ''It's like having symptoms of a heart attack,'' Mr. Sinai said, ''either you ignore them or take preventive action to make sure there will be no heart attack.''
 The increase in April was accompanied by a revised gain for March of 230,000 jobs, up from 162,000. While the levels of the last two months exceeded the 150,000 jobs a month that many economists say is necessary to accommodate new entrants to the job market, they were still not nearly as high as the average after previous recessions.
 The number of unemployed people actually rose slightly from March, to 15.3 million. And the so-called underemployment rate -- which includes people whose hours have been cut as well as those working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs -- rose to 17.1 percent, from 16.9 percent in March. 
 At the current rate, the economy will take years to absorb the more than eight million people who lost their jobs during the recent downturn. 
 Thomas J. Duesterberg, president and chief executive of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a trade association, said that increases in exports as well as consumer demand for automobiles and computers were driving part of the rebound. But he pointed out that 16 percent of all manufacturing jobs were lost during what has come to be known as the Great Recession and that a tiny portion of those had been added back so far.
 Mr. Duesterberg said the alliance was forecasting that slightly more than half of all manufacturing jobs lost during the recession would return -- but not until 2014. 
 On the home front, he said consumers were only cautiously returning to the market, battered by declines in housing and personal savings.
 Leisure and hospitality added 45,000 jobs, and the health care industry, which has shown growth throughout the recession, added 20,100. 
 Economists were of two minds about whether to be worried about the rise in the unemployment rate. Some suggested that it was a temporary move associated with transitions in the labor market, while others saw extended pain for the unemployed.
 The rise in the unemployment rate was associated with a growing willingness by people who sat on the sidelines during the recession to once again look for work as the economy picked up. The government figures showed that 195,000 people returned to the work force in April.
 ''The unemployment number went up for the right reasons,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR. ''It was a sign of strength, because you just had more people reentering the labor force, which is typically what happens in turning points.''
 As expected, state and local governments lost 6,000 jobs in April. Their budget cuts probably foreshadow further job losses in the public sector. 
 Labor market experts also focused on wages and average hours worked in a week. Although the average workweek inched up to 34.1 hours, suggesting that workers are taking home slightly bigger paychecks, actual hourly wages were up only 1 cent, to $22.47, in April. Average hourly earnings were up 1.6 percent over the last 12 months.
 Economists suggested that such anemic wage increases, if they were to slow any further, could contribute to a deflationary environment. And labor market specialists said they were concerned about what would happen as the effects of the government stimulus package wound down and unemployment benefits began to run out.
 Such fears confront Antoinette F. Vitacco, a 53-year-old Queens woman who worked as the supervisor at a New York call center in 2007 when her company downsized. 
 In early 2008, she found herself unemployed and, for the first time in her life, receiving unemployment benefits. ''I went from making $65,000 a year to making $430 a week,'' said Ms. Vitacco.
 Over the last two years, she said, she has sent out 200 to 300 resumes, tailoring each one to fit the potential job. 
 She has been unable to find any work, she said, and her unemployment benefits ran out this month. She has no health insurance and she fears she is aging out of the work force.
 ''I have worked my whole life,'' Ms. Vitacco said. ''Now I have no more safety net, and it terrifies me.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Lower Property Taxes on a House of Sinking Value

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT seems as if every week I get a postcard or letter that reads something like this: ''Save money by reducing your property tax. 100 percent risk-free. No Reduction, No Risk.'' 
 Wow, really? Is it legitimate? Should I check it out? We have high property taxes -- after all, we live in Westchester County, which according to figures from the nonprofit group Tax Foundation, has the highest property tax in the country. But could we really get it lowered at no risk? And should we hire someone to do it?
 Challenging property taxes is becoming a national sport, as homeowners contend they are paying too much as their houses decline in value. Some, too, have lost their jobs or have seen their salaries cut and can no longer afford their hefty property taxes.
 In Cobb County, Ga., 16,200 homeowners filed notices between Jan. 1 and April 1 that they wanted their property tax reviewed, said Phillip Y. Hogsed, director and chief appraiser of the county assessor's office. Last year, about 12,000 homeowners requested a property tax review, and the average in previous years was about 5,000, Mr. Hogsed said. That's out of 250,000 real estate parcels in the county. 
 Steven Palm is among the Cobb County residents who say they are paying too much property tax.
 ''Our house was built in 2004 for $1.25 million'' and is taxed at that rate, Mr. Palm said. But he has seen comparable houses now valued at less than $1 million. ''We tried to lower it last year, but got rejected,'' he said, and ''the market just got worse.'' Mr. Palm, by the way, is president of SmartNumbers, a Marietta, Ga., company that provides residential real estate information, analysis and forecasting for brokers. ''This time, we'll go all the way through the appeals process.'' 
 Here in Mamaroneck, N.Y., where I live, about 850 appeals were filed last year, compared with an average of 350, said the town assessor, Susan M. Thomas. The grievance period for this year starts in June.
 And many of my friends and neighbors say they have responded to those direct-mail offers to lower their property taxes -- and have been thrilled by the results.
 One friend, who asked not to be named because he did not want everyone in town knowing his financial information, paid $1.3 million for his home. Because it was newly rebuilt, the tax had doubled to $24,000 when the house was sold.
 He called Joseph H. Picone, one of the many people who offer to do the paperwork to reduce taxes, and after several months, he learned he had received an 11 percent tax cut. Mr. Picone will take 50 percent of the first-year savings and 40 percent of the second year's savings.
 My friend suggested that I try it, saying, ''I hope you're as happy as I am.''
 Over the last few years, many more people have gotten into the business of offering to appeal property taxes for a percentage of the discounts. Caryn Luntz, on the other hand, runs Westchester Real Property Tax Reduction, and has been doing this for 17 years. Last year, she filed about 400 grievances, and she estimated that she won reductions 90 to 95 percent of the time. 
 ''Last year was a phenomenal year,'' she said.
 This year, however, as she faces more competition, she figures she will file no more than 250 grievances.
 Ms. Luntz requests 85 percent of the first year's savings, but she warned that even if she appeared to charge more than some others, she asks only for an additional $30 court filing fee on top of the contingency. 
 ''I do my own appraisals,'' she said. ''Some others might charge you for an appraisal, and that can run you hundreds of dollars.''
 But the process is so simple that homeowners shouldn't pay anyone to do it, said Peter Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit group based in Alexandria., Va., that works for lower taxes and smaller government.
 ''The advice we tend to give is to approach this as if you were arguing a parking ticket,'' Mr. Sepp said. ''Get the facts and evidence. You need to show errors or irregularities.'' It is very rare that your property tax will go up if you appeal, he said.
 Getting access to your property record varies by town, but in my town it is remarkably simple. I went to the assessor's office, asked for the assessor's card and got it within a minute. The card is really two worksheets, with a photo of my house, the list of previous owners, and details indicating that we have seven rooms, roof shingles, plaster interior and hardwood floors. Yup, that's our house.
 The first step is getting that record and seeing if anything is obviously amiss -- more bedrooms listed than you have, say, or larger square footage than is accurate.
 Even though the process has gotten easier with more information online, Mr. Sepp said, in most places only about 5 percent of homeowners go through the grievance process. His organization offers information on its Web site, www.ntu.org, about how to appeal your assessment yourself. 
 Besides getting your property, or assessor's, card, make sure you learn the deadlines for filing grievances and appeals (all that information should be readily available through your town), find at least five other comparable properties to measure your taxes against and do not give up if your initial grievance does not work. And make sure you pay your tax bill while the appeal is in process. If you win, you can get a retroactive refund or credit.
 Of course, for all those homeowners overjoyed to have their property taxes lowered, there are county officials who worry about the economic impact. Two surveys completed last year by the National Association of Counties found that 76 percent of large urban counties and 52 percent of small and midsize counties said falling property tax revenue was significantly affecting their budgets.
 In addition, municipalities have to spend more money as more grievances and appeals roll in.
 After a state-ordered revaluation of homes in 2006 in Lakewood, N.J. -- a state with notoriously high property taxes -- appeals by homeowners climbed from an average of 100 to a high of 4,500 last year, said Ed Seeger Jr., the town's tax assessor. 
 The administrative costs of handling such appeals ran into the tens of thousands of dollars, he said. Besides Mr. Seeger, a town lawyer must be present at every appeal.
 ''Last year we spent approximately 30 days in appeals,'' Mr. Seeger said.
 In response to the flood of appeals, the township reassessed the property values last year, and this year appeals fell to 700. A reassessment, unlike a revaluation, does not necessarily involve on-site inspections, Mr. Seeger said. 
 In Cobb County, property values will be down 9 to 11 percent from last year. That will affect the budget, Mr. Hogsed said, but it's not clear yet how.
 ''I don't think people see the connection between lower taxes and services the county offers,'' he said. ''As a property owner, I see what's going on in the market, but as a member of government staff, I also see the impact on budget.''
 So will we appeal our property tax? Well, it's high, but doesn't seem much different from our neighbors'. For now, we'll set aside those generous offers to help reduce our taxes. But I won't throw them out. After all, there's always next year.

HEADLINE: Vetting The Nets' Suitor Is No Easy Task

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sandor@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The Mikhail D. Prokhorov era should start next week for the Brooklyn-bound New Jersey Nets.
 On Tuesday, nearly eight months after Prokhorov came to the fiscal rescue of the Nets' owner, Bruce Ratner, the N.B.A. board of governors is expected to give him its approval to become an owner. The following day, Prokhorov's $200 million deal to buy 80 percent of the worst team in the league and 45 percent of the Barclays Center in Brooklyn is likely to close.
 If nothing goes awry, Prokhorov, a Russian billionaire and adrenaline-seeking athlete, will be able to attend the May 18 draft lottery as the Nets' majority owner, giving him enough time to practice his celebratory back flips if his team gets the No. 1 pick. 
 What took so long to get here? Vetting him did not take too much time. Last October, a month after he agreed in principle to buy the team, Commissioner David Stern said nothing negative had surfaced. 
 Then, in mid-December, Stern said that multiple investigations had found nothing to prevent Prokhorov from becoming the first overseas owner of an N.B.A. team. 
 The league has refused to say which outside investigation firm, or firms, handled the vetting.
 More recently, league officials said that the owners' vote on Prokhorov would be delayed until the departure of the last three property owners at Atlantic Yards, where the arena will be the showpiece of Ratner's 22-acre, $4.5 billion Brooklyn development. The owners were scheduled to vacate their respective premises Friday.
 Leagues generally do not say much about the details of vetting prospective owners. It is a sensitive personnel process most often involving very wealthy people. But Prokhorov is a special case. 
 First, a foreign owner of a major league United States team is a rarity (the only other one is the Nintendo money that went into acquiring the Seattle Mariners). Second, no American league has vetted anyone like Prokhorov, who has benefited mightily from Russia's frenetic transformation to capitalism.
 Last month, The New York Post reported that Prokhorov was doing business in violation of American and European economic sanctions against Zimbabwe and its dictator, Robert Mugabe.
 The league and Prokhorov said he was not violating any sanctions. But the report was seized on by Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, who demanded that the Treasury Department, which administers the sanctions first imposed by President Bush in 2003, investigate Prokhorov. Pascrell, who has parochial interests in opposing the team's move from New Jersey, said the real issue was who the N.B.A. did business with.
 Here is where things get a little murky because we're dealing with a Russian billionaire with global business interests that are not as transparent as prospective owners with extensive public holdings. Certainly, it was easier to vet Michael Jordan's finances before he was approved to own the Charlotte Bobcats.
 Onexim Group, the company through which Prokhorov is buying the Nets, last year bought nearly 50 percent of an investment bank called Renaissance Capital, a division of Renaissance Group. 
 Quinn Martin, a spokesman for RenCap, as it is called, said it owned no Zimbabwean companies and that its only presence in the country was in stock research. Attempts to independently verify Martin's claims were unsuccessful.
 He pointed to the sister company Renaissance Partners as the division of the group that he said was active in Zimbabwe. It owns a substantial part of the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe, which until 2003 was run by Gideon Gono, now the nation's central banker. (Various reports at the time of the purchase of shares point to RenCap, not Renaissance Partners, as the purchaser.)
 Gono, who is known as Mugabe's banker, is himself on the sanctions list. Some Zimbabwean banks are on it. But the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe is not on the list. Robert Reid, managing director of Renaissance Partners, said in a statement that his company ''has had no dealing with individuals or companies on the sanctions list.''
 Pascrell chooses not to draw distinctions between the different parts of Renaissance Group, believing they are intertwined and thereby complicit in possibly flouting sanctions in Zimbabwe. Last week, he said in a telephone interview: ''Prokhorov owns 50 percent of Renaissance, it's actively invested in Zimbabwe, and it's got a stake in CBZ, which is a chief prop for Mugabe.'' 
 He also said that Stern had not taken any of this seriously enough. 
 ''He jokes this off,'' Pascrell said. ''This is a big joke to him.''
 Mike Bass, a league spokesman, said, ''We have no further comment on the congressman's factually unsupported allegations.''
 Pascrell's larger concern is whether the vetting of Prokhorov was thorough enough. 
 Last fall, Stern said the investigation into Prokhorov would be ''very extensive, stringent, some would say, invasive.'' On Friday, Bass said that generally, ''it is fair to say that we do not routinely investigate the business operations of every company in which a prospective owner has invested.''
 It makes you wonder what the league did not investigate about Prokhorov.

HEADLINE: Wild Days on Wall Street

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Sonia Kolesnikov-Jessop and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It was The Day After on Wall Street -- the uneasy end to a hair-raising week that, for a few terrifying moments, left the financial world stunned.
 After Thursday's near panic, shaken traders returned to their desks Friday morning to grapple with the aftermath of one of the wildest days in Wall Street history.
 But even as the exact cause of the 1,000-point plunge on Thursday remained unclear, many traders seemed to put the episode behind them -- if only to confront some terrible ''ifs'' now weighing on the world's market. 
 Can Greece pay its debts? What about Portugal or Spain? Can a new prime minister reduce Britain's gaping budget deficit? Will the crisis rocking Europe spread? And what about the American economy?
 Investors hate uncertainty, but uncertainty -- lots of it -- is what they are facing. Add to that Thursday's white-knuckled ride and the result, for some, is a case of high anxiety that could cause more wild market swings.
 ''Clearly there is still an aftershock from yesterday,'' said Uri Landesman, the president of Platinum Partners. ''People are scared of the magnitude of the panic that caused, and they are realizing, 'Hey, people are really nervous.' ''
 The stock market rounded out the week with what was, next to Thursday, a relatively modest decline. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 139.89 points, or 1.33 percent, to 10,380.43, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 17.27 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,110.88. The Nasdaq composite dropped 54 points, or 2.33 percent, to 2,265.64. European indexes closed sharply lower.
 It was the culmination of a week in which the Dow lost about 5.7 percent, the S.& P. 500 fell 6.4 percent, and the Nasdaq 7.5 percent.
 Investors remained on edge on Friday, and the stock market continued to be buffeted by bouts of volatility. The Dow sank briefly after the opening bell but within minutes began to rally and for a moment pulled into the black before tumbling anew. It slipped into positive territory twice more before lunch time, and then ground lower through the afternoon.
 The unease was reflected in the VIX -- a volatility measure sometimes referred to as the ''fear index.'' On Friday the VIX reached its highest level since March 2009, when the stock market reached its low point.
 In such an atmosphere, better-than-expected jobs data that would have normally moved markets were brushed aside, even though the 290,000 jobs added to the economy in April exceeded expectations. Or some adapted their investment strategy to take into account the changed mood.
 Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said he and others in his firm expected that after Thursday's plunge the market would not be as receptive to the better jobs figures. So on Friday, after the data came out, they organized a hurried conference call.
 One colleague came in from a day off. Another called in from home. ''We had sort of an emergency meeting,'' said Mr. Orlando. ''Ordinarily we might have bought into a jobs report like that instead of selling into it,'' he said. ''We were going to have to conduct ourselves differently than we ordinarily might have because of this change in psychology.''
 The lingering queasiness from Thursday's fall made it even harder for investors to overcome their concerns over the financial situation in Europe, let alone react to the favorable jobs data.
 ''The elements you have seen over the last few days have injected fear back into the equation,'' said Doug Roberts, the chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research. ''People are looking for an excuse to go to the doors.''
 ''This is what you saw in 2008,'' said Mr. Roberts. ''As the great Yogi Berra once said 'It is deja vu all over again.' ''
 Gold rose sharply for a second day as investors sought refuge from the volatile stock market. Oil fell $2, to $75.11 a barrel.
 ''People are almost looking at the stock market as a casino, and it turns people off a bit,'' William J. Schultz, chief investment officer of McQueen, Ball & Associates, said. ''They would rather stay on the sidelines or flow into bond funds.''
 ''I sort of feel like the market is really overhung by this,'' said Tom di Galoma, of Guggenheim Capital. ''And it is going to take some time for the market to gain some upward direction again.''
 Wall Street had negotiated some of the turmoil caused by the European debt crisis in the last few weeks. It has managed to close higher on some days, largely springing off promising domestic economic figures.
 On Friday, uncertainty eased somewhat when the German Parliament voted to play its part in the Greek aid package.
 But the exact answer as to why the market reeled Thursday remained elusive.
 President Obama, in remarks at the White House, said the authorities were looking into it.
 But 24 hours later, Wall Street had yet to receive an official answer as to what caused the stock biggest intraday drop on record. The lack of answers, some said, was bound to undermine investors' confidence in the market.
 ''Here is the problem,'' said Art Hogan, the New York-based chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. ''We don't have the clear explanation for how it happened.''
 Mr. Hogan said traders, analysts and sales people arrived at Jefferies on Friday morning and immediately began swapping stories about Thursday's plunge. As the day wore on, he and others tried to reassure anxious clients.
 Mr. Hogan said: ''We need clarity on what caused it. We need clarity on what happened in the U.K., and we need clarity on the European debt.''
 Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for Russell Investments, said he was on the New York Stock Exchange floor on Thursday when the drop occurred.
 On Friday, he said the market was still grasping for an explanation as strategists looked to ''iron out the short-term volatility'' and put it behind them.
 ''Two weeks ago we had a raging bull-market mentality,'' Mr. Hogan said. Now, on top of Greece, comes a startling market plunge, possibly one caused in part by a glitch or trader error, he said. ''It was a volatile, fragile environment going in.''

HEADLINE: 2 at Faith-Based Bank Are Indicted Over Bribes

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- When government regulators here shut down Integrity Bank at the height of the recession, in August of 2008, the bank was seen as just another failed lender that had overvalued the real estate market and collapsed. 
 But a federal indictment unsealed on Friday accused two former vice presidents at the bank of hastening its downfall by selling fraudulent loans to a hotel developer in exchange for bribes. 
 The two executives, Douglas Ballard and Joseph Todd Foster, were charged with conspiracy, insider trading and bank fraud, according to the indictment. Mr. Ballard was also charged with bribery. The developer, Guy Mitchell, who received $80 million in loans, was charged with conspiracy and bribery. 
 Founded on Christian principles in 2000 in an Atlanta suburb, Integrity used the motto ''In God We Trust.'' The bank gave customers free Bibles, and employees prayed together at meetings. Onetime investors included a Georgia state senator and the former CNN host Lou Dobbs.
 But in announcing the indictment, the United States attorney Sally Quillian Yates said Mr. Ballard and Mr. Foster had not lived up to the bank's name or mission.
 ''A number of banks have suffered from the plummeting real estate market, but this bank was robbed from the inside,'' she said.
 Mr. Ballard, 40, and Mr. Foster, 42, could not be reached for comment on Friday and will be arraigned at a later date. Mr. Mitchell, 50, pleaded not guilty at a federal courthouse in Atlanta. 
 A lawyer for Mr. Mitchell, Edward Garland, said his client had been a law-abiding, profitable customer for the bank. ''The collapse of the economy caused the bank failure, not his activity,'' Mr. Garland said. 
 Georgia leads the nation in bank failures, with 38 banks having closed since 2007, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The state's woes have generally been blamed on underregulation and overinvestment in real estate. But the Integrity case is a different matter. 
 ''These indictments are very unusual,'' said A. James Elliott, associate dean of Emory University School of Law, an expert in banking law. 
 From 2004 to 2006, Mr. Mitchell, who lives in Coral Gables, Fla., and has developed hotels, shopping centers and other commercial real estate, received the $80 million in loans from Integrity, the indictment says. His holdings include the upscale Casa Madrona Hotel and Spa in Sausalito, Calif., and the Royal Palm Hotel near Miami.
 The indictment charges that he obtained much of the money under false pretenses and deposited nearly $20 million in a personal checking account, with which he bought luxury items, including a $1.5 million private island in the Bahamas. 
 The indictment charges that Mr. Mitchell made few, if any, payments on the loans. Instead, it says, he took additional loans, and his debt ballooned. In return for lenience, Mr. Mitchell paid Mr. Ballard more than $230,000 in bribes, the indictment says. It also accuses the two bank executives of engaging in insider trading by selling Integrity stock.
 ''After passing out $80 million to the developer like it was Monopoly money, both officers dumped their Integrity stock before the failed loans came to light,'' Ms. Yates said. 
 But Mr. Garland, the defense lawyer, said Mr. Mitchell was in compliance with banking regulations and merely used a central bank account for both personal and business expenses, adding, ''We expect to show that he is completely innocent.'' 
 Integrity reported assets of $1.1 billion when it was sold to a unit of the Regions Financial Corporation in 2008. The bank had been a prominent example of faith-based banking in Georgia, with five locations.
 The bank's founder, Steven M. Skow, a Lutheran, said it gave away 10 percent of annual profits to churches and faith-based charities, donating $1.7 million in 2007. Mr. Skow said it did not discriminate against non-Christians.
 ''We weren't selling religion,'' he said. ''We just managed the bank on godly principles, like the golden rule.'' 
 Mr. Skow, who left the bank in 2007 and was not implicated in the indictment, said he knew nothing about the activities at the heart of the indictment. He said he had lost $22 million in stock when the bank failed. 
 Ms. Yates, the United States attorney, said the investigation into Integrity was continuing.

HEADLINE: WORLD BRIEFING ASIA; North Korea: Kim Reported Open To Resumption of Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, told officials in Beijing that his government would try to restart talks on ending its nuclear weapons program, Chinese news media reported on Friday, as Mr. Kim wrapped up his five-day trip.
 Mr. Kim's comment, which did not specify when the North would return to the six-nation talks, did not appear to be a step forward from what his government had already said. 
 But its timing, and Mr. Kim's meeting with President Hu Jintao of China this week, could put South Korea and the United States in an awkward position.
 Both Seoul and Washington had called for the resumption of the talks. But after a South Korean warship sank on March 26 in an explosion many South Koreans attribute to North Korea, Seoul has insisted on finishing the investigation of the sinking -- and if the North is culpable, punishing it -- before engaging the country in denuclearization-for-aid talks. Washington has indicated its agreement. Thus, Mr. Kim's seeming eagerness to return to talks, if genuine, could disrupt Seoul's plans.
 South Korea watched this week as Beijing invited Mr. Kim, gave him a tour of the Chinese industrial cities of Dalian and Tianjin and reportedly promised economic aid.
 ''The North Korea side stated that its stance in favor of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has not changed,'' the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua said, referring to Mr. Kim's meetings with Chinese leaders. ''The North Korean side is willing, together with all parties, to discuss creating favorable conditions for restarting the six-party talks.''
 It remained unclear whether Mr. Kim has eased his government's conditions for returning to the talks, which it angrily abandoned a year ago. The conditions include lifting United Nations sanctions and a commitment from the United States to undertake negotiations on a peace treaty to replace the truce that ended the 1950-3 Korean War.
 China's ''warm welcome and cordial hospitality'' to Mr. Kim this week, as described by the North's official news agency, K.C.N.A., deepened South Korean misgivings about the China policy. It also compelled South Korea to speed up its investigation of the ship sinking.
 On Friday, South Korean news outlets carried leaks from government investigators who reportedly found traces of gunpowder and metal pieces from the sunken ship that are consistent with a torpedo. Officials here privately say that they were increasingly sure that a North Korean attack sank the ship, which killed 46 sailors.
 Once the investigation was over, ''the Chinese government will understand and play a role'' in dealing harshly with North Korea, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea was quoted as telling ruling party officials on Friday.
 Footage run by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV showed Mr. Kim, 68, hugging Mr. Hu. Mr. Kim, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, looked frail with thinning hair.
 K.C.N.A. said Mr. Kim was ''deeply impressed'' and expressed ''great appreciation of the tremendous changes'' in Dalian and Tianjin, models of China's rapid economic growth. Xinhua quoted him as saying that he welcomed Chinese investment in his country ''based on the principles of mutual benefit and win-win.''
 The impoverished North's economic dependence on China deepened after South Korea, once a major provider of aid and trade, adopted a hard line under Mr. Lee.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Name for Newborns Thanks to the Undead

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
For baseball fans, 2009 was the year of the Yankees. For job seekers, it was the year of the Great Recession. And for people who track baby names, it was the year of the vampire. 
 The Social Security Administration released its annual rundown of the most popular names for newborns on Friday, and flying up the list was an ancient name with modern fame: Cullen, the surname of one handsome bloodsucker, Edward, in the frighteningly popular vampire films ''Twilight,'' based on the best-selling novels by Stephenie Meyer.
 Cullen materialized at 485, leaping almost 300 spots from 2008 for the biggest increase of any boy's name; it wedged firmly between Braiden and Kason. 
 But the nation's fascination with the undead may not end there. The most popular boy's name was Jacob, an eternal favorite that happens to be the name of the buff rival of paler-than-thou Edward: Jacob Black. The most popular name for girls was Isabella, the progenitor of Bella, the love interest of both Edward the vampire and Jacob the werewolf. Just plain Bella logs in at 58. 
 Mark Hinkle, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said that about 22,000 children were named Isabella, out of 4.1 million babies, and nearly 21,000 new Jacobs are toddling about. Mr. Hinkle noted that Jacob had held the crown for most popular boy's name for 11 years -- something he suggested Ms. Meyer might have noticed. 
 ''Maybe she got the name from checking our Web site,'' Mr. Hinkle added, pointedly. 
 Cullen was the choice of an eerily repetitive 555 couples. They included Brad Lafferty and Michelle Mikkelsen, who live in the Bronx. Ms. Mikkelsen said she read the last book in Ms. Meyer's series, ''Breaking Dawn'' -- which includes the birth of a half-vampire, half-human child -- while pregnant. 
 ''I like old names,'' said Ms. Mikkelsen. ''And most of those characters in there are vampires. So they are really, really old names.''

The head of Goldman Sachs, at his first meeting with shareholders since the government accused the bank of defrauding some clients, vowed on Friday to conduct an internal review of the company's business practices to make sure it was serving its customers and the public interest.
 ''We understand that there is a disconnect between how we as a firm view ourselves and how the broader public perceives our role and activities in the market,'' the bank's chief, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said at the company's annual meeting in downtown Manhattan. ''To address this, we need a rigorous self-examination.'' 
 It was a much friendlier audience than the one Mr. Blankfein faced 10 days earlier at a Senate committee hearing, where he was questioned about the bank's trading activities and a fraud suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Few shareholders at the meeting questioned Mr. Blankfein or the bank's board about investigations of its past mortgage trading or lawsuits filed by clients in recent weeks, after the S.E.C. filed suit. And most of them voted exactly as the bank's board advised them to. That included a rejection of a motion that would have disallowed the bank's chief to also serve as chairman of the board. 
 Mr. Blankfein, who holds both titles, led most of the meeting, striking a firm but conciliatory tone. He said multiple times that he had no plans to resign. Still, he also unveiled a plan to appoint a committee to review the bank's business dealings.
 A Goldman spokesman, Lucas van Praag, said a board member would be named to oversee the committee. That person will devise a process for appointing members to the committee and will determine how much of the committee's work should be made public. The goal is for at least some of the findings to be public, Mr. van Praag said. 
 The support for Mr. Blankfein, of course, came from investors who had chosen to hold onto their Goldman shares even after the S.E.C. filed a securities fraud case against the bank last month and after the Justice Department started an investigation of possible criminal activity. Goldman's stock has fallen about 20 percent since then, indicating that many shareholders expressed their views by simply selling their stock.
 As a group, Goldman employees are the bank's largest shareholder. Partners at the bank own about 7 percent of its stock, and other employees own more.
 The meeting had its light moments. After several investors criticized the recent board nomination of H. Lee Scott, the former chief executive of Wal-Mart, Mr. Blankfein rested his hand on his chest and said, ''Actually, I like shopping at Wal-Mart.''
 When one critical shareholder told Mr. Blankfein that he was not as smart as he looked, the chief quipped, ''That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.''
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was there representing his social change group, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, spoke several times to express concern that Wall Street -- and Goldman -- had recovered while the rest of the economy was still struggling. He encouraged Goldman to think broadly about how it could better serve the public and the economy.
 Mr. Blankfein responded that the current pressure on Goldman had had a ''silver lining.'' 
 ''It certainly affords us an opportunity to be introspective,'' he said.
 All of Goldman's board members, including Mr. Blankfein, were re-elected. The firm's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was also approved. A bank-driven motion to allow shareholders to approve the bank's compensation principles also passed.
 The meeting lasted about three hours, with Mr. Blankfein pledging at the end that Goldman would continue to increase its outreach to the general public.
 ''We have very little contact with the consuming public,'' he said. ''We recognize that we need to reach out.''

HEADLINE: Pythons in Florida Stalked by Hunters And Tourists Alike

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
FLORIDA CITY, Fla. -- Thousands of Burmese pythons, the offspring of former pets, have invaded the Everglades, eating birds, bunnies, even alligators. It has gotten so bad that Congress is considering an outright ban on buying or selling nine kinds of giant snakes.
 But an odd thing has happened here in the swamp: the pythons have become celebrities. The snakes are fast becoming an element of Florida lore, attracting ''oohs'' and ''ahhs'' from tourists, along with groans from biologists and even python hunters like Bob Freer. 
 ''It's a little frustrating and very strange,'' said Mr. Freer, who figures that his 40 captured pythons -- most of which he has euthanized -- make him the state's top private hunter. ''They're asking about pythons that don't even belong here, instead of alligators.''
 Trouble is, the newfound fascination obscures what biologists and Mr. Freer describe as a serious problem. In their view, python proliferation -- still significant despite a cold winter that might have killed half the population -- is simply the sexiest example of widespread disrespect for pets and the wilderness.
 ''People need to view exotic species invasions as pollution -- biopollution,'' said David E. Hallac, chief of biological resources for Everglades and Dry Tortugas National Parks. ''In some cases, this form of biopollution can be even more difficult to remedy than chemical pollution, mainly because in most cases, we have no way of cleaning up exotic species from our natural environments.''
 Nowhere is the problem more visible than in the open expanse of southwestern Dade County, where tract housing gives way to sawgrass and airboat engines. Mr. Freer, a grandfather who cuts the sleeves off his T-shirts, has lived here for a decade, giving animal presentations to tourists and running a wildlife refuge that doubles as his home.
 He grew up in rural New York on a dairy farm with a pet alligator, and he used to live north of Miami with another gator (named Lazy) until his neighbors complained. Now Mr. Freer and his third wife are free to mix with whatever animals they like, and there are plenty.
 Near the back of their five-acre property, for instance, sits Rocky, a tiger once owned by a stripper. Buc, an arthritic grizzly bear, lies in a cage next door near the hyenas, Chewy the camel, birds the color of daiquiris, and a lemur from Madagascar whose previous owner pulled out its teeth, so that all its food must now be mashed.
 In nearly every case, pet owners gave the animals up or had them taken away by county officials. Pythons, Mr. Freer said, have been part of the mix since the mid-1980s.
 ''It was very exciting then to think about these giant snakes and being able to find them here in Florida,'' he said. ''I never really thought there would come a time when you would actually go out and hunt pythons.''
 State officials say they had no choice -- especially after last July, when an eight-foot python sneaked out of its cage north of Orlando and strangled a 2-year-old. It led to a six-week hunting season to reduce the python population.
 ''We really wanted the help, and still need it, to get rid of these things,'' said Tony Young, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
 With all the attention, the snakes became bigger stars. Reporters have interviewed officials at Everglades National Park around 300 times. Mr. Freer, meanwhile, has turned up on Animal Planet and the History Channel's ''Monster Quest,'' after an episode about the Hillbilly Beast of backwoods Kentucky.
 He said that he initially understood the alarm. Pythons are what biologists call ''apex predators'' that eat nearly everything, including endangered species. And there were financial benefits, too: a group of Canadian snake enthusiasts paid him to help find pythons.
 But on a hunting trip in the Southern Glades, a 30,000-acre tract that abuts Everglades National Park, Mr. Freer struggled to shake a sense of melancholy.
 The area has become a dumping ground littered with both human ruin -- a shuttered fish farm, a closed juvenile detention camp and a former rocket test site -- and abandoned animals. In addition to the pythons, Mr. Freer said he had come across cobras and black mambas, emus and ostriches. Since the recession started, he said, he has seen more horses that owners can apparently no longer afford to feed.
 The python craze, he said, only illustrated a problem far larger than most people recognize. Mr. Hallac, at Everglades National Park, agreed.
 ''We have well over a dozen exotic fish that have invaded the park and may pose a threat to our native aquatic organisms,'' Mr. Hallac said. ''But being that they're underwater, and not particularly scary to humans, their stories are rarely told.''
 At Everglades Alligator Farm, an adventure park where Mr. Freer manages the animals and puts on shows for visitors, python presentations are still a hit. Rangers at the national park are regularly asked about how to avoid or see the famous pythons.
 Mr. Freer said he now looked forward to a day when pythons were scrubbed from his routine. ''People will be asking me about alligators again,'' he said, ''And that'll make me happier.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about Burmese pythons invading the Everglades misidentified the home country of a lemur owned by Bob Freer, who runs a wildlife refuge and has captured 40 pythons. The abandoned lemur that Mr. Freer took in is from Madagascar, not Kenya.

HEADLINE: Albany's No. 2 Is Now Stewing On the Sidelines

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- While Gov. David A. Paterson met inside his office with aides to prepare for a recent news conference, his lieutenant governor, Richard Ravitch, was milling around outside, waiting for the appearance to begin. 
 ''I don't know what he is going to say,'' Mr. Ravitch told a reporter. 
 A few minutes later, an aide beckoned Mr. Ravitch to join the governor in the office. But the door turned out to be locked, leaving the lieutenant governor of New York fumbling with the knob as cameras rolled. A week later, Mr. Ravitch referred to the episode as ''the day that I couldn't get through the door.'' 
 Ten months after he was brought aboard the administration to bring it new seriousness and depth, Mr. Ravitch, 76, has been relegated to the sidelines, an awkward position for a man accustomed to being at the center of the action. 
 He has been unable to spur progress on the key assignment Mr. Paterson handed him: a long-term restructuring of how the state spends its money. The fiscal year ended a month ago, and it is unclear whether lawmakers will enact his plan. 
 Mr. Ravitch played a key role in the rescue of New York City from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970s and hoped to offer similar assistance in the state's hour of need. But an interview found him frustrated, impatient and at times almost astonished by how little alarm there was in the Capitol about the state's grim financial outlook. 
 ''This is like slow strangulation,'' Mr. Ravitch said this week. 
 ''Sure, I'm frustrated,'' he added, ''because, as of today at least, we're not very close to solving this problem, and the problem compounds itself day to day, week to week, and there's no way of avoiding pain. 
 ''I don't like to be the Cassandra all the time. It's not fun.''
 The lieutenant governor spends his days talking to lawmakers, budget staff members, labor leaders -- corralling them in his lofty office abutting the Senate chamber or in the halls of the Capitol.
 In March, Mr. Ravitch released his five-year financial rescue plan for the state, a broad proposal that called for a number for changes, including requiring the state to balance the budget under tougher accounting rules. 
 But to Mr. Ravitch's consternation, much of the attention accorded the plan has focused on one aspect of it -- a provision that would allow the state to borrow up to $2 billion this year to deal with its short-term financial distress. He says the plan is not simply a green light to borrow. 
 Though Mr. Paterson asked him to develop the plan, the governor never fully embraced it, setting off speculation in the Capitol that the relationship between the men was strained.
 Mr. Ravitch and Mr. Paterson, who not so long ago was himself the lieutenant governor, say they have maintained a cordial personal relationship and socialize, often having dinner or drinks together at the Executive Mansion.
 ''He was over here for dinner two nights ago,'' Mr. Paterson said in an interview Wednesday. 
 ''I think he is frustrated because he is starting to recognize the special sort of currents on planet Albany, in that as he has pointed out, the state's going to run out of money in June. We really can't afford to let this budget just stagnate, and I think he is frustrated.''
 ''I don't think he's frustrated with me,'' the governor added. ''He's trying to get this message to the Legislature that this is serious business.''
 Still, Mr. Ravitch's take-charge nature and his freelancing cause friction. Blunt and quotable, he has made pronouncements on diverse subjects, like the fate of St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan or a proposed tax on sugary sodas, that have not been aligned with the administration's posture. 
 Part of the difficulty of prompting any action in Albany is the absence of working coalitions, even though the Democratic Party, at least nominally, is in control. The governor is a lame duck, and the Senate is largely ungovernable and ideologically distant from the liberal Assembly. 
 And Mr. Ravitch argues that grappling with the deep structural problems confronting New York is not something lawmakers have had to do in the past.
 ''They have never had to deal with a problem of this enormity before,'' he said. ''There were always escape valves -- securitizing tobacco revenues, privatizing Blue Cross. I could give you a list of $20 billion worth of one-shots used to balanced budgets in the last 10 years.''
 ''They're confronted by the fact they have to cut nine and a half billion dollars,'' he added, ''and that is an absolutely mind-blowing experience for people who have only been spending money all these years. 
 ''It's going to get much, much tougher, and next year it's going to be much worse.''
 The latest recession, Mr. Ravitch likes to say, is not like recessions past, when bust cycles were reliably followed by boom times that could bail out the spending addiction. The state faces deficits of $9.2 billion this year and $15 billion next year. 
 ''We're not going to go back to where we were,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''The economic paradigm has fundamentally changed in New York and the United States. Our economy, in my opinion, has been receding for some time -- it was kept alive by the credit bubble, and when that exploded, it exposed the fact that the competition, particularly in Asia for manufacturing, has devastated our economy.''
 State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat who is the deputy chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee, said some lawmakers shared Mr. Ravitch's feelings. 
 ''There's angst, there's anger, there's frustration, but what there is not is obvious and simple solutions,'' Ms. Krueger said. 
 ''Everyone wants an answer, everyone wants a budget, everyone wants to go home and say, 'Here are the answers,' but are incredibly frustrated and frightened about going home to say, 'We had no choice; we had to cut you to the bone.' ''

HEADLINE: They Call It a Hung Parliament

 BODY:
Gordon Brown has lost his long-odds bid to lead the Labour Party in Britain to its fourth straight parliamentary majority, but it is not yet clear which party has won. 
 That's not going to be a big problem for American foreign policy. Both Mr. Brown, and the Conservative Party leader, David Cameron, support President Obama's strategy in Afghanistan, where Britain is the second largest troop contributor. The inconclusive result could be bad news for Britain's ailing economy, which needs strong and coherent leadership.
 The Conservatives now have the largest party in Parliament, but they are expected to be about 20 votes short of an outright majority. They cannot hope for more than a fragile minority government, or an uncomfortable coalition with the center-left Liberal Democrats, who do not share their positions on crucial issues like tax reform, financial regulation and the timing of needed spending cuts. 
 If the Tories cannot put together a new government, Labour might try to assemble its own coalition. After its poor faring at the polls, it would likely have even more trouble putting through a credible program demanding sacrifices -- and even a Labour-Liberal Democratic coalition would not add up to a majority. It could take an interim government and another election to get a clear governing mandate. 
 Whoever leads the next government, the top priority must be reducing Britain's 11.5 percent budget deficit. That will require painful cuts. Public sector jobs, wages and contracts must all be on the table. Schools, job training and the National Health Service must not. 
 Labour suffered at the polls because, after 13 years in power, it had run out of ideas, energy and luck. The Conservatives fell short because many voters doubted the depth of the party's conversion from its harsh Thatcherite past. The Liberal Democratic leader, Nick Clegg, generated real excitement. In the end, most voters decided not to take a chance on an inexperienced party, lacking fleshed-out policy positions. 
 Something is surely wrong with an electoral system that translates Labour's 29 percent of the popular vote into more than 250 seats in Parliament and the Liberal Democrats 23 percent into more than 50 seats. Electoral reform is needed, and the Liberal Democrats will seek it as part of any coalition deal. Britain's first need is a government that can bring down the deficit without choking off economic growth or placing the heaviest burdens on those least able to bear them.
