HEADLINE: Why Tax Policy Assumes People Are Richer Than They Think

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Because of the different ways in which income is defined, tax policy often assumes people to be better off than they themselves think they are, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The deceptively simple term "income" is at the heart of much of the debate about taxation. That was illustrated in a recent column in The New York Times, which provocatively reported that a certain James Ross of New York City paid 102 percent of his income in taxes in 2010. 
But to be precise, that rate was what he paid on his taxable income - a figure considerably less than the definition of income used to calculate federal income taxes, which is "adjusted gross income." (Taxable income is adjusted gross income minus personal and dependent exemptions and various deductions, such as for mortgage interest and state and local taxes.)
Looking at Mr. Ross's taxes as a share of adjusted gross income yields a much lower effective tax rate of 20 percent, which is actually on the low side for someone whose income is probably in the top 1 percent. According to the Tax Policy Center, those in the top 1 percent paid an average of 24 percent of their adjusted gross income in federal income taxes alone in 2011.

Because Mr. Ross was also including payroll, state and local taxes in his 20 percent tax rate, he should actually consider himself quite lucky. In fact, his effective tax rate is even lower than that of the person who wrote the article.
My point is that one's "tax rate" is very much a function of what concept of income one is using. Changing the definition can radically alter one's concept of whether a given tax payment is high or low relative to other taxpayers'.
Indeed, even if we start with adjusted gross income, we are leaving out of a lot of what most people would consider income. For example, interest earned on tax-free municipal bonds is excluded, as are distributions from some Individual Retirement Accounts and most Social Security benefits.
But even if we calculate tax rates based on gross income, which would include those items excluded from adjusted gross income, we still wouldn't necessarily have a good picture of one's true income. 
That is because certain forms of income are completely excluded from the income tax base. These would include gifts, inheritances, employer-provided benefits and unrealized capital gains.
Economists generally favor a definition of income that is broader than adjusted gross income and reflects an individual's full command over economic resources. We may not tax unrealized capital gains, but people unquestionably feel better when their house or stock portfolio rises in value. They know that they can tap this income either by selling assets or borrowing against them in order to buy things that they consume or that give them pleasure.
Thus, economists prefer a definition of income that consists of all consumption throughout a year plus the change in one's net worth. That is, it reflects consumption plus what one could consume in a year without reducing the net worth she or he started with.
The two economists most identified with this definition of income are Robert M. Haig and Henry C. Simons. Hence it is often called the Haig-Simons definition of income. Generally speaking, when one sees a table showing the distribution of taxes by income class, the underlying concept of income is something like Haig-Simons. 
On Feb. 8, Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation issued a useful study explaining how it adjusts incomes for analytical purposes to conform as much as possible to a Haig-Simons tax base. It starts with adjusted gross income and adds a long list of nontaxable forms of income, including tax-exempt interest, workers' compensation, the insurance value of Medicare and other items.
The three biggest items that are added to adjusted gross income to get what the committee calls "expanded income" are the value of employer-provided health insurance, which increases aggregate incomes by $787 billion; the portion of Social Security benefits excluded from taxation, which adds $467 billion; and the employer's share of the payroll tax, which adds $426 billion. The last is included because it is part of the total cost of employee compensation.
Some items of income are not included in the committee's calculations, even though they are part of a Haig-Simons definition, because it's too difficult to get accurate data. These include the annual increase in unrealized capital gains, the "rent" that homeowners effectively pay to themselves by virtue of being both landlord and renter of their own homes, and various forms of income that are unreported for both legal and illegal reasons.
The following table shows how the Joint Committee on Taxation calculations affect the distribution of income. In general, income distribution tables assume people are wealthier than what the income reported on their tax returns shows. 
The inclusion of nontaxable Social Security benefits is most pronounced at the bottom of the distribution, adding $205 billion to the aggregate income of those making less than $10,000 based on adjusted gross income. Including the value of employer-provided health insurance is most pronounced at the upper end, adding $166 billion to the income of those making $100,000 to $200,000 based on adjusted gross income.
The percentage of households with incomes below $10,000 drops by almost half when a broader concept of income is applied, to just 13 percent of all filers from 24 percent. The percentage of households in the middle of the distribution doesn't change too much, but the number of those considered well-to-do rises significantly. The percentage of those making $100,000 to $200,000 rises to 14.1 percent from 9.8 percent of all returns based on expanded income.
It's difficult even for experts to keep track of all the ways different writers and organizations use the word "income" when discussing taxes. Unfortunately, there is no standard definition and even those embedded in law, such as adjusted gross income, change over time because the law changes.
Generally speaking, unless a distribution table is clearly based on adjusted gross income, as are those from the Internal Revenue Service, it's reasonable to assume that it is based on some type of expanded income that doesn't necessarily reflect what people see on their tax returns. 
The use of expanded income means that people are assumed to be better off than they think they are, as they try to find themselves in a given distribution table to see how a proposed tax change would affect them.

HEADLINE: Snow Job

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A Dartmouth College study finds that ski resorts exaggerate snowfall -- especially on weekends -- but skiers are wise to it. 

 BODY:
What do economists at Dartmouth College do in the winter?
They write about skiing, naturally.
And what they found at first may not seem so very surprising: Ski resorts exaggerate their holdings of fresh, natural snow. In fact, resorts on average report 23 percent more snow on weekends.
But here's the mystery: There is little evidence that this false advertising is working. To the contrary, the authors found that "consumers are skeptical of resorts' weekend reports of fresh snowfall."
So why are resorts lying about snow?
Well, the authors, Jonathan Zinman and Eric Zitzewitz, suggest that the cost of lying may be quite low.

Oh, a resort that said it had snow would surely be punished by customers who arrived to find none, but perhaps a resort that says it has an extra inch of fresh powder draws a few more customers without drawing much ire.
Perhaps, in other words, the difference is too small to be measured.
And that's where the iPhone comes in. (In the sense that no business article is complete these days without a nice little anecdote about the iPhone.)
It turns out that in January 2009, SkiReport.com introduced an iPhone application that made it easy for people already on the slopes to file "first-hand reports."
For example: "Jackson Hole/Teton Village DID NOT get 15" today more like 0."
Better yet, from the perspective of a researcher, this new source of information was available only at resorts that had AT&T coverage. (You will doubtless be surprised to learn that this coverage is a little spotty.)
And it turns out that resorts where cellphones worked well soon stopped lying.

HEADLINE: Mysterious Supper Club Serves Up Gujarati Food Spiced with Stories

BYLINE: SARAH KHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Ms. Geeta has served more than 500 diners from a "secret location" in Washington D.C. 

 BODY:
I've always been a slave to intrigue - I was raised on a steady diet of Nancy Drew novels, and secret passwords, hidden passages and cryptic clues were my domain. So when I heard about Hush, an underground dining experience in Washington, D.C., the pint-size sleuth still lurking within me was immediately on the case.
The Web site reveals the basics: Hush is an Indian-inspired supper club, held at the residence of one masked Madame Geeta whose last name is conspicuously absent, and an evening of storytelling and vegetarian food is promised. A donation of $75 is requested at the end of the meal, and diners are welcome to bring their own wine or beer. I reserved a spot and received an e-mail confirming my seat at the supper, but with crucial details - an address, for example - to follow only on the day of the event.
I liked the sound of this already.
Shortly after 7 p.m. on a Saturday I arrived at my destination in D.C.'s U Street neighborhood. I knocked and was greeted by Kaci, who, much to my dismay, neglected to ask me for the secret password. (It was "saffron," according to that morning's missive). I joined my fellow diners in the elegantly appointed living room awash in blues and beiges and dotted with eclectic Art Deco and mid-century modern accents. Awkward small talk over cocktails ensued while we wondered what would happen next.
What unfolded was an evening of seemingly never-ending courses of authentic Gujarati Jain cuisine, peppered with anecdotes and laced with heavy helpings of history, all set to the lilting strains of a Taal soundtrack. The woman of the hour was petite and in her late 30s, with a cherubic face and an ebullient personality. "I started Hush because of one thing: India is on the move," Ms. Geeta declared. "I want to get America and India to know each other, to take the two-dimensional view of India and make it three-dimensional."
Ms. Geeta began Hush on Valentine's Day two years ago, as the result of the usual series of twists and turns that lead to most great ideas. After her father died, a few weeks before her 30th birthday, she became gripped by a desire to preserve her heritage, not knowing how long she would have her mother in her life. "I had this anxiety that I wouldn't know how to make her dhokla," she recalled. "I started cooking all the time, to mitigate this fear that things were going to get lost."
Despite a long career in such quintessentially D.C. institutions as the World Bank, Ms. Geeta was also something of a serial entrepreneur-"I'm Gujarati; business is in my blood," she said with a laugh - and a chance mention at a party led to her spending a late night feverishly researching underground dining experiences. She launched a Web site on a whim while snowbound during one of that winter's worst blizzards, and suddenly found herself featured on the area's top food blog; the Washington Post and other major media outlets jumped on the story, resulting in 300 reservations in a matter of days - all before she had even served a single guest.
More than 500 mostly happy diners later, Ms. Geeta has perfected her formula to an art. She proudly unveiled kachori, pulao with kadhi, spinach parathas, makai no chino, masala chai and more, serving each with a story conveying its historical context (the heat that characterizes Indian food today was only introduced in the 1500s by the Portuguese, who brought peppers from their South American conquests) or sprinkled with a fun anecdote about her mother, known around the convivial table as Mama Geeta. Even a tale about her server breaking her foot that afternoon, leading to a series of mishaps in the kitchen, is relayed with narrative finesse. 
Halfway through the evening she led us to a hallway where she had set up a pseudo street cart, and re-created the experience of an authentic chaat stall in India. Later on, she invited us back to the living room to take us on a spice tour, relishing in sharing with us the secrets of an Indian masala dabba. It's here that Ms. Geeta made the night's biggest reveal: In an eloquent soliloquy about the core values of Jainism, she explained that the nonviolent principles of the faith led to one of the key aspects of Jain cooking: the absence of root vegetables like garlic, potatoes, or onions. On this evening, people seemed to take this disclosure in stride. In the past, said Ms. Geeta, guests had actually jumped in shock. "All that gasping, I love it!" she said.
Now this was true dinner theater. "I decided the best way to tell a story is by feeding people, delighting them, and making the story delicious," she said.
Most Hush attendees come in couples or groups of two or three, but solo diners are more than welcome, and are likely to head home with a few new friends. The 10 guests on this night ranged from PhDs to finance professionals and, except for my friend and me, were all white - the standard makeup of most of Ms. Geeta's dinners, which fits in well with her goal of educating the uninitiated. New devotees of Jain cuisine are created over helpings of capsicum tinged with jaggery and besan. "As a vegetarian, I eat a lot of Indian food, and it's always the same dishes," said a fellow diner, Mark Taparauskas. "But it was really nice not knowing what to expect tonight."
But Ms. Geeta says some of her proudest moments have occurred when other Indian-Americans - people that even Mama Geeta was surprised to hear were attending, asking, "Why would they come? Don't they have mothers?" - were thrilled to see what she was doing to put an underrepresented cuisine and culture in the spotlight. "It's very important for me not to have my people be treated as a circus sideshow," she said. "This was not meant to be any professional goal for me, but then I realized I could do everything I've dreamed of, I could put Jains on the map."
Mystery solved.

HEADLINE: Fed Clears Capital One's Deal for ING Direct

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: But the Federal Reserve, in its ruling on the Capital One Deal, acknowledged that the acquisition of ING Direct USA may pose some risks to the broader financial system. 

 BODY:
9:10 p.m. | Updated 
Regulators on Tuesday approved Capital One's $9 billion acquisition of ING Direct USA, casting aside criticism that the deal would create the next too-big-too-fail banking behemoth.
The deal provides the first glimpse at how the government will use its new powers to oversee bank mergers, authority granted in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
The Federal Reserve's consent came with some conditions. Citing consumer complaints and legal actions against the bank, the Fed ordered Capital One to revamp its internal controls, specifically around its lending and debt-collection practices.
"The Board expects that Capital One will ensure that its risk-management framework and methodologies, including its compliance functions, are commensurate with its new size and complexity," the Fed said in an order on Tuesday.
Some predicted that the Fed would rubber-stamp the deal. But the central bank was deliberate in its approach, delaying approval to hold public hearings and twice postponing plans to announce the fate of the acquisition.
In the end, the Fed was unconvinced that the union of two midsize players would cause the next Wall Street crisis.
"We are very pleased that the Federal Reserve has approved our acquisition," a Capital One spokeswoman, Tatiana Stead, said in a statement.
The bank, according to Ms. Stead, plans to close the deal in the next few days. It will have 90 days to outline its plan to strengthen its compliance and other risk-management controls.
The legacy of the financial crisis has loomed over Capital One's bid to buy ING Direct. As part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, the Fed must now weigh the potential hazards of big bank mergers and kill any deal in which the systemic risks outweigh the rewards.
The Capital One takeover presented the first major test case.
With the addition of ING's online banking unit in the United States, Capital One will transform into the fifth largest bank by deposits. The bank does not currently rank in the top 10. The combined institutions will have more than $200 billion in deposits, making it bigger than regional powerhouses like PNC and TD Bank.
The potential for such a seismic shift has alarmed community bankers and consumer advocates who cast the deal as a risk to taxpayers and painted Capital One as an aggressive subprime lender. By blessing the deal, the Fed delivered a blow to such critics, including the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, capping an unusually contentious eight-month battle that featured multiple public hearings and fiery debates.
"We're extremely disappointed in today's decision," said John Taylor, head of the community coalition, adding that his group was considering challenging the decision. "It appears the Federal Reserve waited until Valentine's Day to give Capital One a box of chocolates."
Capital One argued that consumers would reap the benefits of the deal, as the bank rolls out a broader range of loan products to ING Direct customers.
"With the Fed's approval, Capital One has the opportunity to build upon the strong foundation of ING Direct for the benefit of our customers, associates, shareholders and local communities," said Ms. Stead, the bank spokeswoman.
In June, Capital One agreed to pay $6.2 billion in cash for ING Direct USA. Under the terms of the deal, Capital One would also issue $2.8 billion worth of new shares to ING, giving the Dutch firm a 9.9 percent stake.
It is the latest move by Capital One to build a national banking franchise, in an effort to expand beyond credit cards. 
In the midst of the housing and financial crisis, the bank scooped up three regional firms, including Chevy Chase Bank in Maryland and North Fork Bank's mortgage business in California. Last August, Capital One announced plans to buy HSBC's American credit card business for $2.6 billion. Capital One expects the HSBC acquisition will gain regulatory approval in the second quarter of 2012.
But as the bank ballooned in recent years, it became caught in the crosshairs of a public outcry. Capital One has had to contend with loyal ING customers who feared change.
Competitors and consumer groups also assailed the acquisition spree for creating a subprime lending giant, a notion that Capital One disputes. About a third of Capital One's credit card portfolio carries the subprime label, defined as loans to borrowers with credit scores below 660, according to the company.
Moving to blunt the criticism, Capital One offered some concessions in its bid for ING Direct. The bank promised a 10-year, $180 billion commitment to community lending and investments. Capital One also unveiled plans to create 500 jobs in Delaware, where ING Direct is based.
But the deal continued to draw ire. A bigger bank, critics reckoned, is likelier to leave taxpayers responsible for bailing out the company. With much at stake, the Fed last fall took the unusual step of holding three public hearings about the deal, providing a forum for critics.
Capital One used the hearings to defend its record. While Wall Street banks deal in derivatives and other risky businesses, Capital One said it focused on mom-and-pop consumers, leaving it immune to the volatility of the investment banking business.
The Fed appeared to agree.
In a 40-page order, the Fed detailed its standards for systemically risky acquisitions. The Fed analyzed the size and complexity of Capital One and ING Direct, the interconnectedness between the banks and the broader economy, and whether competitors could easily step in to replace the bank should it encounter "severe financial distress." The Fed also examined how difficult it would be to unwind the combined banks should they show signs of collapsing.
"These measures suggest that Capital One would be significantly less complicated to resolve than the largest U.S. universal banks and investment banks," the Fed said.

HEADLINE: Nothing but Net - And Hotter Than Tiger Balm

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: We're waiting for a diktat from the schoolmarms and ayatollahs of All Things Hip, declaring that "Linsanity'' is already pass&#233;, overdone, uncool. For now, though, we're staying with it, especially because the remarkable Jeremy Lin won a game for the New York Knicks on Tuesday night with a three-pointer just before the buzzer. Mr. Lin, who finished with 27 points and 11 assists, is the first Taiwanese-American and just the fourth Asian-American to play in the N.B.A. He's also just the fourth Harvard alumnus to make it to the show. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - We're thinking that a diktat will soon come around from the schoolmarms and ayatollahs of All Things Hip, declaring that "Linsanity'' is already passé, overdone, uncool. 
For now, though, we're staying with it, especially because the remarkable Jeremy Lin won a game for the New York Knicks on Tuesday night, draining a three-pointer just before the buzzer. Nothing but net. Hotter than Tiger Balm. 
There's a brief video clip of the final play here. And not to rain on the Lin parade, but José Calderón, the Toronto Raptors' defender, sagged well off the ball on that last play and let Mr. Lin take his shot largely uncontested. Still, it makes anyone's highlight reel.
Mr. Lin, who finished with 27 points and 11 assists, is the first Taiwanese-American and the fourth Asian-American to play in the N.B.A. He's also just the fourth Harvard alumnus to make the show. (Howard Beck's game story for The Times is here.)
My colleague Keith Bradsher fired off a tweet just as the game was over. Keith's profile of Mr. Lin and the frenzy over him in China is here.
Lin wins it at the buzzer - twitvid.com/204DX via @EsmeraldoC
- Keith Bradsher (@KeithBradsher) February 15, 2012
And Gady Epstein, who works for The Economist in Beijing, tweeted this during the game:
Beijing Sports TV, in cynical gesture, showed a Chinese Basketball Assn game during the exact time Knicks-Raptors was on. More Linexpensive.
- Gady Epstein (@gadyepstein) February 15, 2012
The Raptors, by the way, are known in China as the Fierce Dragons, as Charlie Melvoin explains at Baidu Beat.The N.B.A. is wildly popular in China and many of the teams have conventional translations of their names - Warriors, Pistons, Rockets, Thunder, Bobcats.
Other names are a little more fanciful. 
The Philadelphia 76ers are "the 76 People"; the Miami Heat are "Hot Fire"; the NBA champion Dallas Mavericks are the "Calf"; the Los Angeles Lakers are known as the "Lake People"; the Boston Celtics are the "Celtic People"; and the Indiana Pacers are the "Walkers."
I interviewed N.B.A. commissioner David Stern some years ago as the league was first testing the waters in Asia, looking to hang its nets on the Pacific Rim. He had just returned from a trip to China and said basketball fans were particularly enamored with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. 
"Please, Mr. Stern,'' he said one Beijing fan pleaded. "Please bring the Red Oxen to China.''
An addendum: Excuse this plug for a colleague, but it's apropos. Jim Yardley, the Times's South Asia bureau chief, has a new book out this month - "Brave Dragons," which chronicles a year with a professional basketball team in China. Jim had a related piecein the Times magazine two weeks ago.

HEADLINE: John Doerr's Patient Health Care Start-Up Gains Momentum

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: John Doerr, the venture capitalist, has financed an expensive, small-scale effort in the Midwest to create a health system with incentives for better care and one that uses new technology tools. A partnership with three large insurers announced on Tuesday suggests that the experiment is gaining support. 

 BODY:
Remember Healtheon, the dot-com company that was going to bring the hidebound health care industry into the Internet era? Well, it didn't work out that way, and the best-known remnant is WebMD, a Web site for health information and news.
"We had the right idea, and it was a serious effort," recalled W. Michael Long, former chief executive of Healtheon. "But it was disappointing."
The Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers was one of Healtheon's backers. And long after Kleiner had parted ways with Healtheon, health care remained an abiding interest for one of the firm's senior partners, John Doerr. That interest had a family connection as well, since his younger brother, Dr. Tom Doerr, is a physician in suburban St. Louis, where they grew up.
Mr. Doerr began investing his own money in health, applying technology and altering economic incentives for a Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization acquired, largely with his own money, in 2007. Doctors were paid for helping make patients healthier instead of the traditional approach of paying for each procedure, treatment and test performed -- the so-called fee-for-service system. Mr. Doerr's venture started in the St. Louis area, and today Essence Healthcare covers more than 50,000 people in six states.
The idea was to start small, and create a microcosm of a health care system that works, according to four goals: improved clinical outcomes, reduced costs for the patient population as a whole, higher patient satisfaction and higher physician satisfaction. One innovation: primary care physicians, who guide so much of medical care, are paid more twice the national average.
That initial experiment has grown, into a private holding company, Essence Group, and three operating companies: Essence Healthcare; ClearPractice, a maker of electronic health records; and Lumeris, a supplier of analytic software that tracks procedures and patient results for insurers and physicians.
The experience has required patience. In a 2010 interview, Mr. Doerr described it as "a long, slow march."
Mr. Doerr has invested many millions. "John put in a lot of his own money, and was willing to lose it in this experiment," said Mr. Long, who had been an investor earlier, but became chief executive of the holding company and Lumeris last year.
But there are signs the experiment is bearing fruit, in stellar quality and lower costs for Essence Healthcare, support for its approach to health care and demand for its technology products. Last year, for example, the Essence Group raised $70 million from investors including Passport Capital, Camden Partners and Blue Cross Blue Shield Venture Partners.
On Tuesday, three large health insurers -- Highmark, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, and Independence Blue Cross -- are joining with Lumeris to buy NaviNet, a large communications network that links doctors, hospitals and insurers. The price of the NaiNet purchase was not disclosed.
Today, the NaviNet technology is used mainly by doctors to answer administrative queries, like whether a patient's insurance covers a procedure. The Lumeris clinical intelligence software, Mr. Long said, will be layered on top of the NaviNet network, adding new capabilities. The doctor sees Lumeris as a Web site. It pulls information from a patient's various records -- prescriptions, tests and diagnoses -- and presents the physician with recommendations and alerts; for example, a lapse in prescription refills signal that a heart patient is not taking his or her medication.
Dr. Steven Udvarhelyi, executive vice president of Independence Blue Cross, said that adding the Lumeris technology would be a "leap forward in giving physicians clinically actionable information so they can better manage patients' care." Independence Blue Cross, based in Philadelphia, covers 2.4 million people in southeastern Pennsylvania, its main market. And 99 percent of the physicians in its Pennsylvania network use NaviNet, Dr. Udvarhelyi said.
Such tools, experts say, are critical to transforming hospitals and clinics into "accountable care organizations," the drift of current policy in which providers are paid for health outcomes -- healthier patients -- instead of inputs -- procedures, tests and pills. That is, mimicking the approach at Essence Healthcare, the experiment Mr. Doerr largely financed for years.
"The goals are better outcomes, improved safety and lower costs," said Dr. Denis A. Cortese, former chief executive of Mayo Clinic and a professor at Arizona State University, who is also a board member of Essence Group. "And doctors might finally be paid to do that."

HEADLINE: The Santorum Surge: Goodbye Ron Paul Territory

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The former senator from Pennsylvania speaks excellent right-winglish. 

 BODY:
We now know of at least two tactics that work really well in the 2012 Republican nominating contests - negative ads fueled by deep corporate pockets, and appeals to the most intolerant, hard-right elements of the party.
Once upon a time (like a month ago), attack ads helped Newt Gingrich mount a real challenge to Mitt Romney, and then helped Mr. Romney beat back that challenge. The second dynamic is propelling Rick Santorum from also-ran to statistical dead heat with Mr. Romney for first place.
Two polls that came out on Monday - by the Pew Research Center and Gallup - show that Mr. Santorum, who was languishing near Ron Paul territory only a couple of weeks ago, is now the choice of around 30 percent of Republican primary voters. A New York Times/CBS News poll released this morning confirmed these results-it pegs Mr. Santorum at 30 percent to Mr. Romney's 27 percent.

If you think I'm exaggerating when I say "most intolerant" and "hard-right," I suggest you read up on this past weekend's CPAC conference. That gathering of right-wing political activists is mandatory attendance for Republican candidates like Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney. Sarah Palin is still a huge favorite there.
For the candidates, the idea is to persuade the right wing that you always have and always will believe every single thing they believe with all your heart and soul. No deviation is permitted. You have to be as anti-abortion as possible, as well as anti-tax, anti-immigration, pro-death penalty, and pro-spending cuts. You don't necessarily have to demand a repeal of child labor laws, but it couldn't hurt. And you have to hate Barack Obama much, much more than everyone else there.
Mr. Romney had a really hard time pulling this off, because he didn't claim to be a right-winger until fairly recently and everyone knows he's done that to secure the nomination. Mr. Santorum, on the other, speaks fluent right-winglish.
He started out his speech by arguing that it was past time to "compromise, to do what's politically reasonable," and that the presidency wouldn't be worth winning for the Republicans if Mr. Romney were the nominee. "We will no longer abandon and apologize for the policies and principles that made this country great in exchange for a hollow victory in November," he said.
Mr. Santorum, who came on stage with most of his large family, including his wife Karen, "the rock on which I stand upon," couched much of his speech in the language of Reagan-style trickle-down economics (at one point suggesting that cutting taxes for the very rich would help the very poor). He also pushed hard on an extreme social agenda.
Mr. Santorum warned that President Obama's health care reform would "crush economic freedom." He said Americans would "have to pay tribute to Washington in order to get the care you need for your children." He said Mr. Obama was forcing the Catholic Church to pay for birth control services. He said liberals had invented the idea of man-made global warming.
That none of this is true did not bother Mr. Santorum's audience one bit. The crowd cheered each of those lines.
I've never thought Mitt Romney was much of a candidate, but will the Republicans actually nominate someone as far along on the loony fringe as Mr. Santorum? It will be interesting to see how far Mr. Santorum can take this new surge of his. I'm sure that Mr. Obama's team is hoping he can take it very far indeed.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Peekaboo by North Korea, Part Deux?

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Every diplomat from Foggy Bottom to Smoggy Beijing is anxious to see what Kim Jong-un's foreign policies are going to look like. The new North Korean leader does possess, after all, a handful of nuclear weapons. A glimpse into his inclinations could come next week, when U.S. and North Korean envoys meet for direct talks in Beijing. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - In Pyongyang, there's a new sheriff in town, and every diplomat from Foggy Bottom to Smoggy Beijing is anxious to see what his foreign policies are going to look like. The young man does possess, after all, a handful of nuclear weapons. 
It's just that not very much is known about him. He's a plus-sized young fellow, we do know that - about a 48 portly medium from the look of him. He dresses like a funeral chauffeur and apparently enjoys NBA basketball. But we're not even exactly sure how old he is. 
Most importantly, we don't know if he intends to keep playing nuclear peekaboo with his neighbors and the West. 
"We know more about distant galaxies than we do about North Korea," a Western diplomat said. 
A glimpse of Kim Jong-un's foreign policy posture could come next week, when U.S. and North Korean envoys meet for talksin Beijing. It will be the first direct meeting of the two sides since the death of Kim Jong-il and the succession of his roly-poly son. Think blind date.
The U.S. side will be led by Glyn Davies and the North Korean team will be headed by its veteran nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan. The dauphin-become-Sun King almost certainly will not attend. Too low-level for a general of his brilliance. 
For all their international implications, the talks involve two policy wrinkles, one in Pyongyang, the other in Washington. 
"How will Kim Jong-un look if he talks friendly to Washington?'' Rudiger Frank, a North Korea scholar and professor at the University of Vienna, told Rendezvous. "Will this be appreciated as a smart policy that will eventually lead North Korea out of its isolation, or will it be seen as weakness?''
Of the American angle, Mr. Frank said: "I can easily imagine how a deal with North Korea, especially if it is criticized by South Korea, will be used by the Republican candidate to successfully accuse Obama of softness and whatnot. Hard to believe that he would take that risk.''
The Beijing meeting, lest we get ahead of ourselves, will be talks about talks. That is, they will aim to perhaps revive the so-called six-party talks, a prospect that the Chinese Foreign Ministry endorsedon Tuesday. (The participants are the United States, Japan, Russia, China and the two Koreas.)
The six-nation negotiations, which began in 2002 and have been in suspended animation since 2008, focused on shutting down the North's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions and increased shipments of fuel and food aid. 
North Korea certainly needs the help. People aren't eating grass and starving to death like they were in the 1990s, but the nation's economic arteries are hardening. The North might not be the runt of the socialist litter - that distinction belongs to Guyana and Laos - but its economic reforms (with Chinese characteristics) have been tepid at best. Its trade policy, in particular, is dangerously lopsided, increasingly beholden to Beijing.
For much of the past two decades, Kim Jong-il handily manipulated South Korea and the West into forking over rice, cement, medicine, fuel oil, you name it. This was the drill: Pyongyang would make threats, then promise concessions, then receive aid, then renege. Threaten, promise, receive, renege. And repeat. Negotiations with the North always seemed to have a dark, Sisyphean quality to them. 
One foreign aid official in Seoul has called it "the feed-us-or-we'll-shoot-you approach.'' 
More recently, however, the United States, South Korea and Japan have nailed a list of preconditions to Pyongyang's door - essentially their threshold demands before they'll agree to resume the six-party talks. Namely, they want a freeze on all nuclear activity and the admission of inspectors to verify the halt. Here's a guess about the North's likely response: "No way.'' 
Indeed, the official North Korea news agency blasted Washington, Seoul and Tokyo on Tuesday, saying their militaries had formed a "triangular alliance for aggression" against the North. 
"The question is whether they are prepared to respond to what we are looking for in order to get back to talks, so that's what we're looking to find out in Beijing," said Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokesperson. "We thought that it was a good time to see where they are."
Most analysts are convinced that North Korea will never surrender its nuclear ambitions, especially given a new paradigm that might be called the Qaddafi Rules. 
Pyongyang has drawn a sobering lesson from what happened to the Soviet Union, Iraq and Libya when they acceded to the West's surrender-your-weapons demands.
"To put it bluntly, in the eyes of the North Korean leadership all three countries took the economic bait, foolishly disarmed themselves, and once they were defenseless, were mercilessly punished by the West," Mr. Frank said in a commentary on 38 North. He also suggested that anyone in North Korea who favored denuclearization "will now be silent." 
A footnote: Two bronze statues of Kim Jong-il and his father, the Eternal President, Kim Il-sung, were unveiledTuesday in central Pyongayng. (Raw video of the ceremony is below). The statues show the Kims on horseback, a vibe that Kim Jong-un himself has echoed: Propagandists placed him astride a white stallion for photos and video news footage. Thursday is the Day of the Shining Star, a national holiday in North Korea, marking Kim Jong-il's 70th birthday.

HEADLINE: Downgraded Europe Goes Hat in Hand

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Another ratings agency has downgraded a raft of Euro zone economies and even has Britain in its sights. As Europe continues to battle a worsening debt crisis in Greece, leaders look to China for possible relief. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Another day, another downgrade. That is fast becoming the refrain for the battered economies of Europe as Moody's Investors Service became the latest international ratings agency to cut its assessments of European sovereign debt.
The news kicked off another potentially bleak week for European officials struggling to contain the Continent's chronic debt crisis. 
Against a background of smoldering, riot-struck buildings in Athens, capital of Europe's undisputed economic basket case, finance ministers of the 17-member Euro zone prepared to hold yet another meeting on Wednesday to discuss a (EURO)130 billion bailout for Greece.
European Union leaders meanwhile took their begging bowl to Beijing on Tuesday where they received the discomfiting assurance that China had no ambition to "buy out" Europe. European leaders have been urging the Chinese government to buy more European sovereign debt.
On the eve of an E.U.-China summit, postponed from October as European leaders met to confront the debt crisis, Feng Zhongping, European studies director at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, wrote in the People's Daily that China's cooperation with the E.U. on its debt crisis should not be interpreted as "the poor saving the rich."
"China does not have the ambition or capacity to 'buy out' or 'control' Europe like what some European media said," Mr. Feng wrote. "China always supports the euro and the European Union, which is a sharp contrast to the negative international voices on the prospect of Europe."
Perhaps he had in mind the ratings agencies. Moody's downgrade of six European nations announced on Monday night followed similar action last month by Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings. 
All three agencies are based in the United States and European politicians have accused them of talking down Europe's economies and making it even harder for European nations to finance their debts.
It is a debate in which Europe frequently seeks to have it both ways. Government and opposition spokespeople have tended to embrace or dismiss the assessments of the ratings agencies, depending on how these reflect on their economic policies.
French opposition politicians last month ridiculed President Nicolas Sarkozy for having set such store on maintaining France's triple A rating, only to see it taken away by S&P. 
France escaped a similar downgrade from Moody's. But, along with Britain and Austria, two other AAA-rated nations, its outlook was revised downward to negative.
The inclusion of Britain confirmed a perception that the contagion of the Euro crisis had spread beyond the Euro zone to affect economies that do much of their business with it.
Britain's opposition Labour Party seized on Moody's assessment to lambast the ruling Conservative-Liberal Democratic coalition for putting public spending cuts - to placate the markets - ahead of stimulating economic growth, which requires spending and temporarily increasing the debt, which the markets don't generally like. 
Although Labour spokespeople had previously criticized the ratings agencies for exercising an overweening influence on governments and markets, on Tuesday they cited Moody's assessment of weak British growth to accuse the government of heading in the wrong direction.
"Unless you have growth, if your plan is unbalanced it becomes self-defeating and today is the first evidence that even the ratings agencies are waking up to the fact George Osborne's plan is not working," Ed Balls, Labour's shadow financial minister, told the BBC. George Osborne is the finance minister. 
Mr. Osborne put a brave face on the announcement from Moody's, insisting it was a further signal Britain must stay on its current financial course. "It was a reality check for the whole political system that Britain has to deal with its debts, that we can't waiver in the path of dealing with our debts," he told the BBC.

HEADLINE: Five Questions for Jill Stein of the Green Party

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Talking with Jill Stein, a candidate for the Green Party's presidential nomination. 

 BODY:
This week's subject is Jill Stein, a candidate for the Green Party's presidential nomination. Ms. Stein, a former physician and teacher of internal medicine, writes and speaks about the connections between the environment and health. She ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 against Mitt Romney.
Q. 
A. We are in crisis and people are losing their jobs and their homes and their health care and affordable higher education and civil liberties. You name it, they are losing it. We have got a 1 percent that's rolling in dough as much as ever and the political establishment is not fixing it. The establishment got us into this mess, in both parties. And that's clear as day. Over 10 years, I have been a recalcitrant political challenger, a recurrent alternative that would not go away.
Q. 
A. Occupy is very much a part of a broader move for democracy and economic and social justice. That is alive and well around the world. Just look at what is going on in Wisconsin which is directly linked to Occupy. It doesn't have the name of Occupy, but they slept for three weeks in the statehouse. If that's not Occupy, what is? The Occupy movement, beneath the surface, represents a political coming of age of a younger generation who have been on the receiving end of a generally exploitative economy. One of those groups to exploit has been young people. They have been exploited in education. The unemployment crisis hits them the hardest. They are bearing the burden for the climate disruptions that are coming down the pike.
Q. 
A. Small time, sure. There are minor improvements. But on the other hand, he took single-payer off the table. He absolutely took a public option off the table. As we found on issue after issue - the war, reappointing George Bush's secretary of defense, sticking to George Bush's timeline on Iraq, expanding the war, expanding the drone wars all over the place. And how about bringing Wall Street in, the guys who created the problem, among his first appointments. It was pretty clear right then that this was going to be business as usual on steroids. We're certainly not more secure, more equitable, more healthy or safer internationally, with what Obama has brought.
Q. 
A. He responds to his electorate. When he's running in Salt Lake, he's anti-abortion. When he's running in Massachusetts, he's pro-abortion. He responds to his electorate, broadly, except that he remains basically pro-business in a very narrow sense of the word - that is a pro-one-percent big, corporate multinational business. You know what, that's not so different from the way Larry Summers and Tim Geithner are running the country under Barack Obama. When our governorship changed from Mitt Romney and it went directly to Deval Patrick, who is another poster child for progressive Democrats, no difference. Nothing detectable. Nothing changed in Massachusetts whatsoever.
Q.
A. You might look at one party as a rapidly sinking ship and say we're going to vote for the other guy because the ship's not going down so fast. We don't like him but he's not sinking the ship so fast. But the real question is, if both of those ships are heading for the bottom of the ocean, do you want to be on either of them? No. There's no question about where those ships are heading if you are looking at the economy.

HEADLINE: Romney Highlights Michigan Ties in New Ad

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: In a new advertisement, Mitt Romney ties the decline of the auto industry to President Obama. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney began pushing his message to Michigan voters on Tuesday as he released a new 30-second television commercial and published an op-ed in The Detroit News, both of which were highly critical of President Obama's handling of the crisis facing the auto industry.
Mr. Romney's ad was set to begin on Wednesday, according to a Republican who tracks media spending and who said the advertising cost a modest $178,000 on the NBC station in Detroit.
The new ad, called "Growing Up," highlights his Michigan roots. "When I grew up in Michigan it was exciting to be here," Mr. Romney says during video of him driving a car (presumably an American one) down a residential street. "How in the world did an industry and its leaders and its unions get in such a fix that they lost jobs, that they lost their future?"
Old footage of auto workers and classic cars, including one with a young Mr. Romney sitting playfully behind the wheel, flashes on the screen as Mr. Romney makes an oblique reference to the federal loans that helped rescue General Motors and Chrysler, saying, "President Obama did all these things that liberals have wanted to do for years. The fact that you've got millions of Americans out of work, home values collapsing, people here in Detroit are distressed. I want to make Michigan stronger and better. Michigan's been my home, and this is personal."
In the Detroit News op-ed, he strikes a sharper tone, calling the auto industry rescue "crony capitalism on a grand scale" because of its provisions that granted labor unions ownership stakes in the car companies.
How the ad will play in Michigan, a state where the ravages of the recession are evident but signs of a turnaround have started to emerge, is unclear. While the loans to the auto industry are deeply unpopular with many conservatives, the feelings about them in Michigan are more complicated.
The auto industry has rebounded since the federal government stepped in with the loans, which both Mr. Obama and President Bush supported.
The ad also takes a risk by showing scenes of urban decay, images that are familiar but unhappy reminders of how distressed Michigan is. Detroit's inhabitants in particular are sensitive to perceptions that their city is a wasteland. Yet Mr. Romney's campaign appears to be hoping that when people see them, they will associate the decline with Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Callista Gingrich Takes to the Microphone

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: The Gingrich campaign looks to Callista Gingrich to soften her husband's sharp edges. 

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- As Newt Gingrich looks to reboot his struggling campaign, he has turned to an ally who has always been there but in an almost entirely mute and, to the public, mysterious role: his wife, Callista.
Mrs. Gingrich delivered a three-minute introduction of her husband at a conservative conference in Washington last week, including humanizing details about the contents of his Kindle ("an entire library'') and his golf game ("he gets in and out of more sand traps than anyone I have ever seen'').
And on Tuesday, Mrs. Gingrich took to the microphone again, speaking to the San Diego County Federation of Republican Women during a break from a fund-raising swing her husband is making through California.
The campaign clearly hopes that Mrs. Gingrich will soften her husband's sharp edges and perhaps prompt voters to take another look at him, even as he has fallen far behind Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in recent polls. Although Mrs. Gingrich is a familiar figure posed beside her husband during his speeches, she has been one of the least heard-from spouses in the Republican presidential field. In December she recorded a holiday greeting with her husband for a television ad in Iowa, and she has made a video for the campaign's Web site promoting music education.
But voters know little about Mrs. Gingrich other than that she is her husband's third, much younger wife -- a circumstance that has led to speculation that she remains silent because the campaign does not want to call attention to the marriage. But absent hearing from Mrs. Gingrich herself, a void has been filled by former campaign aides, who -- speaking anonymously in the press -- portray Mrs. Gingrich in a sometimes harsh light.
Now the campaign seems to have overcome earlier hesitations and is unfettering Mrs. Gingrich, who still seems a bit shy in public.
"I enjoy meeting people, I enjoy speaking,'' she told reporters after her appearance here, which was in the somewhat incongruous setting of a Smashburger fast-food restaurant. "This is a good time to do it. I'm looking forward to it.''
She appeared before a group of about 30 women at a quickly organized gathering, held after a breakfast fund-raiser at a nearby country club for her husband. Awaiting her arrival, the women signed a Valentine's Day card for Mrs. Gingrich.
Her talk was billed as a discussion of "American exceptionalism,'' but it had none of the politicized edge that phrase has acquired for Mr. Gingrich, who accuses President Obama of not believing that the United States has a leading role among nations.
As her audience sat at a row of tables and booths before the lunch crowd arrived, Mrs. Gingrich stood at a wooden lectern, in a blue suit and a gold necklace, reading from notes. There was a slight nervousness in her voice.
"Over the last few months, the campaign has been wild,'' she said. "We have been on a real roller-coaster ride as front-runners seem to come and go.''
Her remarks were a mix of light personal details and praise for civic virtues.
"One of the things I've enjoyed most on this campaign is the chance to meet so many wonderful Americans across this country,'' she said.
In her most pointed political comment, she said, "Our only opponent is Barack Obama, and we are committed to removing him from the White House,'' a line that drew light applause.
Winding up, she said: "Thank you for the many contributions each of you make to support conservative leaders and policies. I truly appreciate that opportunity to be with you here today.''
And then she was finished, less than five minutes after beginning. "Let's do some meet and greet,'' a host said. Her audience lined up to shake her hand and pose for photos.
Joan Pernicano, 64, a restaurant owner, said she was still deciding between Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum, with the candidates' positions on the economy and abortion her chief concerns.
"I thought maybe it would be a little deeper, there'd be a little more,'' she said of Mrs. Gingrich's remarks.
"She's very, very, well spoken; she should speak more," said Lynn Ann Reagan, the president of the women's group.

HEADLINE: Rick Santorum's Pincer Movement

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney is getting hit from his left and his right by the same opponent. 

 BODY:
It's been clear since Iowa that Rick Santorum, of all the Republican contenders, posed the most serious challenge to Mitt Romney. Now we're seeing why.
In a sense, Romney is in roughly the same position that he was three weeks ago, in the fraught period between his defeat in South Carolina and his sweeping win in Florida. Then, as now, he'd seen his aura of inevitability clouded by an unexpectedly stinging setback. Then, as now, the not-Romney vote seemed to be consolidating around a single rival candidate. Then, as now, the former Massachusetts governor needed to leverage his advantages - money and infrastructure - to turn back a threat from the party's grass roots.
But there are two big differences between Romney's post-South Carolina situation and his campaign's present pass. The first is that whereas Newt Gingrich dealt him a blow in a state and region that was always likely to be cool to the front-runner's ambitions, Santorum's surprising run of victories last week came in the Midwest and Mountain West, where Romney's support should have been deeper and his record (and religion) less of a deal-breaker. 
The second is that while it was easy to design an anti-Gingrich ad assault that would render the former speaker radioactive, Santorum doesn't present half so ripe a target. (It helps that he's had only a third as many wives.) Romney's millions can buy another big television campaign, but they can't write it for him.
If Santorum were simply the latest "true conservative" alternative to Romney - another Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain, a brazen ideologue without a hint of moderation - then the script would be clear enough. Romney would emphasize his experience, his competence and his electability and gradually box out Santorum the way that, for example, Jesse Jackson in 1988.
But Santorum's advantage is that he can get to Romney's right and to his left at once. On the one hand, Santorum isn't responsible for a health care bill that looks an awful lot like "Obamacare" and he doesn't have a long list of social-issue flip-flops in his past. This makes his candidacy a plausible rallying point for the voters who previously turned Bachmann and Cain and the pre-debate Rick Perry into conservative flavors of the month. 
At the same time, though, Santorum's persona, his record and his platform all have a populist tinge that plays well in states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where swing voters tend to be socially conservative but economically middle-of-the-road. (Hence the Michigan poll that showed him leading among independents and Democrats who plan to vote in that state's open primary.) 
This means that Santorum can play the same anti-Bain, anti-rich-guy, blue-collar card that Gingrich tried to play in New Hampshire and South Carolina - but subtly, implicitly, in ways that don't make him sound like he belongs in Occupy Wall Street instead of the Republican primary.
So what script should Romney choose as a response? Many conservatives have urged him to rebrand himself with primary voters by embracing a more rigorously right-wing policy agenda - endorsing Paul Ryan's budget more explicitly, outlining a more aggressively supply-side approach to tax policy or even a pure flat tax, echoing furious attacks on the Federal Reserve by Ron Paul and Gingrich, and so on. 
But this kind of lurch would look more desperate than sincere (especially coming from a politician with a reputation for transparent pandering), and by endorsing upper-bracket tax cuts Romney would probably only ratify many middle-of-the-road voters' impression of him as an out-of-touch rich guy. 
Besides, while ideas like a flat tax may excite conservative interest groups, there's little evidence that they're actually the ticket to winning over conservative voters. (If they were, Rick Perry would be coasting to the nomination.)
Instead, Romney needs to find a way to portray his latest rival (fairly accurately) as the consummate Bush-era Republican - as the kind of politician that moderates rejected in 2006 and Tea Partiers turned on in 2010. This line of attack has the potential to answer Santorum's left-right pincer movement with a pincer movement of its own - one that simultaneously plays to right-wing disillusionment with Bush-style "compassionate conservatism" and to the broader public's disappointment with the Bush presidency in general. 
Romney's campaign has taken steps in this direction by citing Santorum's Bush-era votes for debt-ceiling increases and earmarks. But these are small-bore issues that won't resonate outside the party's activist core. What Romney needs, instead, is a message that hangs Bush-era spending, Bush-era deficits, and K Street excess around Santorum's neck - but that does so, crucially, without implying that the former Pennsylvania senator was personally corrupt. 
That line worked on Gingrich, but Santorum's reputation for rectitude is probably strong enough to survive a focus on his own post-Senate paydays. Instead, the argument needs to be that Santorum was too improvident, too trusting, too utopian and too naive: Not a bad actor, but a decent guy in way over his head, and thus not chief executive material.
This strategy, though, will require a kind of finesse that Romney's campaign hasn't demonstrated to date. The howitzer worked to dispatch Gingrich, but it won't work a second time. Instead, to beat Santorum and close out the nomination contest, Romney will need to learn how to campaign with a stiletto.

HEADLINE: Lumière | Les Infidèles

BYLINE: ELAINE SCIOLINO


HIGHLIGHT: Reactions to a new film illustrate the divide between French and American attitudes toward adultery. 

 BODY:
At the inauguration of the Warner Brothers screening room in the Paris residence of the American ambassador Charles Rivkin the other night, the buzz among the American guests was less about the state-of-the art film technology than whether politically incorrect street posters advertising Jean Dujardin's new comedy had sunk his chance to win the best-actor Oscar for "The Artist."
Dujardin has been referred to as the "Gallic Clark Gable" and "France's answer to George Clooney." The film "Les Infidèles" is a series of sketches about adultery. One advertising poster shows Dujardin dressed in a suit and tie, holding open a woman's bare, high-heeled legs, with the caption: "I'm going into a meeting." After complaints - and fears that Dujardin's image could be damaged - the posters were ordered to be taken down.
But that's not all. Dujardin and his co-star Gilles Lellouche posed on the cover of the latest issue of Premiere magazine in suit jackets, dress shirts, ties and hairy legs, their hands covering their privates. In an interview in the magazine, Dujardin explained that infidelity has not been explored deeply enough in films and that he "wanted to go all the way, even if it has to hurt." Asked whether he had ever been unfaithful, he replied, "Everyone knows it. That's how my relationship with Alex started." (Dujardin and Alexandra Lamy, his current wife who is featured in the film, fell in love and left their respective spouses in 2003.) The film's trailer includes images of the two actors with women who are not their wives in various stages of comic nakedness and lovemaking. (Fortunately for Dujardin, the film opens after Oscar night.)
The stereotype was played with - mildly - earlier this month, in a well-scripted exchange between Dujardin and Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show." Dujardin described how during the filming of "The Artist" he lived in a big white house in Los Angeles and drove with his American girlfriend in a white car. "But I read in your biography that you were married," Leno said. "Yes," Dujardin deadpanned, "but I had a mistress. I'm French." He went on to explain that he was referring to the voice of the "G.P.S. lady."
Dujardin's remarks in Premiere and the Jay Leno episode illustrate the divide between French and American attitudes toward adultery. In France, Dujardin can brush off his own adulterous past; in the United States, he used the stereotype of the adulterous French lover to make a joke about it.
Beyond pop culture, the cultural divide plays out in both country's presidential politics. The Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich carried on a secret six-year extramarital affair with a much younger woman who became his third wife. The infidelity was something for which he said he needed "to go to God for forgiveness."
In France, the I-word hardly ever comes up. During the 2007 presidential campaign, many in the French elite, including some French journalists, knew but did not reveal that the Socialist party candidate Ségolène Royal and François Hollande, then the Socialist party leader and Royal's partner and the father of their four children, were no longer a couple; the fact that he had been having an affair with a French Paris Match journalist for more than a year was also kept secret. Now Hollande, the Socialist Party candidate this time around, is leading the polls in this year's presidential election; his past transgression doesn't figure in the campaign. (He and the journalist present themselves as a very-much-in-love, although unmarried, couple.)
Tolerance of infidelity is commonplace in nearly all aspects of French life. One week in the advice column of Femina, the women's magazine supplement of a popular weekly newspaper, Anne B. from Alsace asked a straightforward question: "Should I leave my husband?"
"Married for 30 years, we haven't had sex for five years," she explained. "Recently, I met up with an old flame. We've had a secret affair for 10 months. I am very happy with him, but he's married as well, and he can't leave his wife. I don't feel brave enough to leave my husband. I don't want to hurt him and financially, it's impossible."
The columnist's advice was to be romantic, self-indulgent and mature - by being dishonest: "In fairy tales, heroes love each other passionately and exclusively in nights without end; in real life, it happens that you sincerely love your husband or wife at the same time that you have an affair for a while. Live your relationship one day at a time, without rushing to make an irrevocable decision that you may regret."
Keeping a mistress in a chateau, as did the French kings, or even in a government-financed apartment, as François Mitterrand did with his mistress and their daughter when he was president, is a practice of the past. But the very acceptance of adultery in French culture may be eroding. "We are witnessing the return of the value of fidelity among the young," said Philippe Brenot, a psychiatrist and author of a book on men, sex and love, in an interview with France Inter radio. Frenchmen over 50 who lived through the sexual revolution, he added, are "a lot more flexible" than their offspring.
Some experts credit the financial crisis with restoring classic French virtues of restraint, modesty and familial responsibility. (Who can afford to support a lover, anyway?) And it could be that infidelity is impossible to quantify when so many young people choose to enter into a French civil solidarity contract that contains fewer responsibilities than marriage, or not to marry at all. In any case, a C.S.A. poll for Madame Figaro in 2009 concluded that 80 percent of the French between 18 and 25 years old - versus 66 percent of the general public - believe that fidelity is of indispensable value in the life of a couple.
"Our generation came of age in an unstable, precarious, hostile world - with unemployment, AIDS, an anguished vision of life," said Myriam Levain, 29, co-author of "Generation Y by Itself," a new book about French youth between 18 and 30 years old. "We've lived through divorce among our parents. So it's difficult to find a model. The idea of 'the couple' has become a refuge, one of the rare points of reference that exists for us."
A previous version of this post misidentified Newt Gingrich as the Republican presidential nominee.

HEADLINE: Romney Defends Opposition to Auto Industry Bailout

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney, in an Op-Ed in The Detroit News, seeks to explain why he supported managed bankruptcy for American automakers. 

 BODY:
As he heads toward a crucial primary contest in Michigan, Mitt Romney is once again trying to explain what may have been the worst headline in years for a presidential candidate trying to secure a victory in the home of the American auto industry.
Published just two weeks after the nation chose Barack Obama to be president in 2008, the Op-Ed by Mr. Romney in The New York Times had the simple headline "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."
On Tuesday, The Detroit News published a new opinion article by Mr. Romney in which he sought to explain to the state's voters -- the same ones he is now courting -- exactly what he meant.
The explanation is a complicated one, especially given the industry's remarkable turnaround in the last three years.
Mr. Romney says that he always favored what he calls a "managed bankruptcy" for the car companies that would have allowed the businesses to restructure and emerge stronger than before. He slams President Obama for choosing what he calls a "bailout" of the industry that benefited big labor unions.
But Mr. Romney next acknowledges that General Motors and Chrysler did in fact go through a "managed bankruptcy" at the urging of Mr. Obama's administration -- and he takes credit for being the one to have the idea first.
"Managed bankruptcy may sound like a death knell. But in fact, it is a way for a troubled company to restructure itself rapidly, entering and leaving the courtroom sometimes in weeks or months instead of years, and then returning to profitable operation," Mr. Romney wrote on Tuesday. "The course I recommended was eventually followed." 
Officials in Mr. Obama's administration, and many economists in both parties, scoff at Mr. Romney's suggestion that a managed bankruptcy was possible without the billions of dollars in government aid to the car companies. They say that Wall Street and private equity firms in early 2009 were in no position to lend the kind of money that the companies needed to manage the bankruptcy process in an orderly fashion.
They also point out a fact that Mr. Romney neglects to mention in Tuesday's opinion article: that it was Bush administration that made the initial loans to General Motors and Chrysler, starting the "bailouts" that Mr. Romney derides.
"Does anyone believe what Mitt says: that the American auto industry would be better off today if the president hadn't intervened in 2009?" David Axelrod, a top strategist for Mr. Obama, wrote in a Twitter post on Tuesday morning.
They also accuse Mr. Romney of trying to rewrite the history of his earlier positions. 
In the first paragraph of his 2008 article, Mr. Romney made an unmistakable prediction: "If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye. It won't go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed."
In fact, General Motors announced last month that it had earned $8 billion in profits in 2011. Chrysler this month reported a profit of $225 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. 
That economic reality poses a risk for Mr. Romney if voters in Michigan simply remember the headline of his earlier article and conclude that he was -- and remains -- indifferent to the plight of the workers there, and wrong about what should have been done in Detroit. And Democrats are doing everything they can to cement that perception.
A recent e-mail from the Democratic National Committee's rapid-response team said that "Romney lined his pockets by firing workers, shipping jobs overseas and forcing companies into bankruptcy. And let's not forget that he famously said 'Let Detroit go bankrupt,' which would have decimated the auto industry."
Last May, Brad Woodhouse, the communications director of the committee, said that "Mitt Romney must think that the entire country has fallen into a state of amnesia if he believes he can get away with this revisionist history."
Mr. Romney now argues that the auto industry would be even better off if it had not received government money. And he accuses Mr. Obama of "crony capitalism" because the Chrysler bailout included provisions that gave the United Auto Workers an ownership stake in the company after it emerged from bankruptcy.
Mr. Romney calls that an "$85 billion sweetheart deal disguised as a rescue plan" and argues that it was done to benefit the president's political supporters.
"While a lot of workers and investors got the short end of the stick, Obama's union allies - and his major campaign contributors - reaped reward upon reward, all on the taxpayer's dime," Mr. Romney wrote. 
He argues that the federal government should "divest itself" of its remaining ownership position in General Motors and should turn the proceeds "over to the nation's taxpayers." 
In fact, the restructuring of Chrysler during the bankruptcy process did involve agreements between the labor unions and the administration that led to a much smaller union, plant closings and a two-tier wage system that has helped to trim costs. The company also trimmed health care costs that have long been called an impediment to profitability.
Officials for Mr. Obama's administration have long argued that such concessions from the unions were only possible because of the leverage that the government wielded through the bailout and bankruptcy process.
For Mr. Romney, the next two weeks will be critical. Michigan voters go to the polls on Feb. 28, and Mr. Romney faces a strong challenge in the state from Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania. 
In his Tuesday article, Mr. Romney notes that he was born in Detroit and that his father served as president of the American Motors car company in the 1950s. Mr. Romney says that he was 7 years old when he "got my love of cars and chrome and fins and roaring motors" from his father.
"The dream of the Motor City is and always has been one of ideas, innovation, enterprise, and opportunity," Mr. Romney writes. "And with a Detroiter in the White House, that dream can be realized once again."
The question for Mr. Romney is whether voters in Detroit and elsewhere around Michigan will conclude that he has their best interests at heart.

Auden noted that, in the opening verses of the Book of Genesis, the vast watery expanses of the world served as a ''symbol for the primordial undifferentiated flux, the substance that became created nature only by having form imposed upon or wedded to it.''
''The Forgotten Space,'' an engrossing and provocative essay film by Noel Burch and Allan Sekula, approaches the sea from the opposite direction. Neither as chaotic nor as romantic as it may have appeared to our ancestors or to Auden, the modern sea of this documentary has come fully under the sway of global capitalism. 
Maritime trade is almost as old as humanity itself, of course, but Mr. Burch, a film critic, and Mr. Sekula, a historian and photographer, are concerned with its present manifestations. ''The Forgotten Space'' offers a more politically inclined, less dashing exploration of some of the territory navigated by the journalist William Langewiesche in his amazing 2006 book, ''The Outlaw Sea.''
The filmmakers are especially interested in the impact of shipping containers -- those brightly colored, corrugated metal boxes that have changed the way goods are transported around the world -- on land. The consequences of containerization reach into every aspect of modern life and, in Mr. Burch and Mr. Sekula's view, are almost never benign.
A visit to Rotterdam in the Netherlands discovers an impressively automated port with a diminished work force, most of whose members labor in isolation in front of screens rather than wrangle cargo with hands and hooks. Containers are lifted by cranes onto barges, railroad cars and trucks to be hauled inland, and every phase of their journey seems to involve the exploitation of labor and the degradation of the environment.
Small farms in the Dutch countryside have been chopped up to make way for a new publicly financed, privately managed freight line. In Southern California drivers find their standards of living eroded, now that they are independent contractors rather than unionized workers. The Indonesian and Filipino crews on board the giant container ships, and the workers in the Chinese factories that fill them, come from a vast pool of the poor and the displaced, willing to work long hours in harsh conditions for a chance to buy into the consumer economy they serve.
''The Forgotten Space'' is unabashedly polemical and rigorously pessimistic, a sustained Marxian indictment of 21st-century capital. The narration, by Mr. Sekula, is at times lyrical and rarely subtle, but the film is most graceful and moving when its argument slows down or wanders into an interesting tangent.
At other points, like an extended rhetorical attack on the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, Spain, the filmmakers seem to be riding an ideological hobby horse down a dead-end street. But they have a good visual instinct for the sublimity, as well as the ugliness, of the industrial and postindustrial environments, and a patient and generous interest in what people have to say about their own lives.
Various experts offer informative analysis, but the testimony of seamen, factory workers and residents of a California homeless encampment is at the heart of the film's guiding ethical and aesthetic principles, which have to do with the defense of human dignity in the face of a system that so often appears hostile or indifferent to it.
The Forgotten Space
Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan.
Written and directed by Allan Sekula and Noel Burch; narrated by Mr. Sekula; directors of photography, Attila Boa and Wolfgang Thaler; edited by Menno Boerema; music by Riccardo Tesi and Louis Andriessen; produced by Frank van Reemst and Joost Verheij; released by Doc.Eye Film.

HEADLINE: A Product To Add Sparkle and Pop To Laundry Day

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
PROCTER & GAMBLE is about to start spending an estimated $150 million to turn Americans into pod people.
No, Procter, the nation's largest maker of packaged goods, is not getting into the movie business and reviving ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' What Procter plans is an extensive marketing campaign to persuade consumers to try a new type of laundry product, sold in single-use tablets called pods that combine liquid detergent, stain remover and brightener.
The pods are being introduced under the brand banner of Tide, which is Procter's, and the country's, best-selling detergent. The colorful campaign for Tide Pods -- to appear in traditional, digital, mobile and social media, as well as in stores -- will carry the theme ''Pop in. Stand out,'' playing upon the multiple meanings of ''pop,'' as in popping a pod into a washer or making colors pop with brightness. 
Tide Pods is indicative of a trend that is gaining traction in the marketing of mainstay household brands, which could be termed Apple envy. Giants like Procter, Clorox, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever are seeking to continually deliver distinctive new products that pique the curiosity of consumers who dote on high-technology items like smartphones and tablets (the iPad kind, not the laundry kind).
''We want to shake this category up with innovation,'' said Sundar Raman, marketing director for North American fabric care at Procter in Cincinnati. ''What you're going to see from us is a little more risk-taking.''
The goal is to ''disrupt the 'sleep-washing' '' among consumers, he added, who ''automatically pick up the product they usually pick up'' when shopping for detergent.
Tide Pods will be priced between regular Tide liquid and a more expensive variety known as Tide Total Care. The cost of Tide Pods is important because Procter has been struggling in categories like detergent to woo back budget-conscious shoppers who have been switching to cheaper alternatives, like Arm & Hammer, Purex and Xtra.
In a research note last week, Caroline Levy of Credit Agricole Securities (USA) wrote that Arm & Hammer and Xtra, sold by Church & Dwight, ''are beneficiaries of the consumer trade-down that is hurting Procter & Gamble (Tide).''
Executives at Procter are confident that the benefits offered by Tide Pods, like convenience, will outweigh qualms about cost.
''There has definitely been a value commentary from consumers,'' Mr. Raman said, who, before buying a product, now ask ''Is it worth it?'' and ''Is this going to deliver the results it promises?''
Tide Pods is ''designed to succeed, even in a tough economy, if it delivers value,'' he added.
The campaign has an upbeat, youthful attitude that is meant to underline the differences between Tide Pods and conventional detergents. There are no piles of laundry compared side by side, or didactic demonstrations of the performance of Tide Pods versus Brand X.
Instead, attractive models -- hunky men along with stylish women -- are shown popping out of washers in fashionable outfits after joining the pod squad.
The look of the campaign is inspired by the work of four pop artists: Miles Donovan, I Love Dust, Kari Moden and Steve Wilson. Fast-paced commercials feature a remixed version of ''Pop Goes the World,'' a 1987 song by Men Without Hats.
The ''pop'' motif is repeated in phrases that appear in the ads, among them ''Get ready to pop your laundry,'' ''Pop of fresh,'' ''Pop of clean'' and ''Pop of hello gorgeous.''
The last remark may be appropriate because Barbra Streisand -- who said, ''Hello, gorgeous'' in ''Funny Girl,'' and repeated it when she accepted her Oscar for Best Actress for ''Funny Girl'' -- also appeared in ''The Prince of Tides.''
(Coincidentally, a commercial for Tide Pods is to run during the ABC broadcast on Feb. 26 of the 84th annual Academy Awards ceremony.)
The campaign also has a microsite, or special Web site, at tidepods.com, along with content on the regular Tide Web site, at tide.com; a presence on the Tide fan page on Facebook, at facebook.com/Tide; messages on the Tide feed on Twitter, at twitter.com/Tide, with suggestions to use the hashtag #TidePods; and video clips on YouTube.
And print ads will include QR (quick response) codes that can be scanned to produce information about Tide Pods.
The goal is to make the campaign ''look and seem like nothing you've seen in laundry,'' said Maru Kopelowicz, senior vice president and global creative director for Tide at Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, and the cheeky tone is intended to echo ''the playfulness of popping'' a pod into a washer.
The high-tech approach is intended to signal that Tide Pods are ''the future of laundry,'' she added, and each pod is presented as if it were ''this precious little gadget, almost.''
The campaign is the most recent initiative by Procter, once known for being a staid, even stodgy, marketer, to make it ads more contemporary.
For instance, Procter began running ads last year for two other laundry brands, Downy and Era, with Amy Sedaris and Chuck Norris.
Among the agencies working on the Tide Pods campaign are others that, like Saatchi & Saatchi, are owned by the Publicis Groupe, including Digitas and the Starcom MediaVest Group.
Procter spent $176.5 million to advertise Tide in major media in 2010, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, compared with $133.8 million in 2009 and $103.3 million in 2008.
In the first nine months of 2011, Kantar Media reported, spending totaled $74.7 million, compared with $135.9 million in the same period in 2010.

HEADLINE: When Tents Rise in Park, Residents See A Takeover

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
While it may not have much name recognition, Damrosch Park is inextricably linked to a place that does: Lincoln Center. Nestled into the southwest corner of the center's campus, the 2.4-acre park is the setting for free outdoor concerts in the summer, as well as a place where performers and neighborhood residents alike go to relax. At least they did.
Since 2010, when the New York Fashion Week shows moved to Damrosch Park from Bryant Park, residents say, Damrosch Park has been all but taken over by one special event after another, making it off-limits nearly 10 months of the year. Setup for the spring fashion shows, which take place in September, begins in August; those shows are followed by the Big Apple Circus's annual show, which runs from mid-October to January; the fall fashion shows are held in February (this year's end on Thursday); and then there are private parties, also under tents, throughout the spring. 
''It's an assault on the neighborhood,'' said Michael Graff, a lawyer who lives in the nearby Alfred condominium tower. He had to shout over the din of generators along West 62nd Street that provided power to a series of white tents for the fashion shows.
On Tuesday, a group of residents and NYC Park Advocates, a nonprofit group, announced that they had sent a ''cease and desist'' letter to the city and to Lincoln Center demanding that Damrosch Park be returned to its proper use as a city park.
City officials brushed aside the criticism, saying that Damrosch Park was a hard-surface plaza with few visitors in winter. They argued that residents had ample access to nearby parkland, including Central Park, and said that many thousands of New Yorkers were able to enjoy the circus and the fashion shows.
''Fashion Week generates $865 million in economic activity each year and helps create jobs in one of our city's most important industries,'' said Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
A representative of Lincoln Center did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
At a news conference on Tuesday outside Lincoln Center, Geoffrey Croft, president of NYC Park Advocates, criticized the city over the terms of its agreement with Lincoln Center, which allows the center to keep all the revenue generated by subleasing the park to outside groups. Fashion Week alone will pay $17.2 million over five years to use the park, Mr. Croft said.
Lincoln Center is also allowed to keep the money from a city-owned parking garage beneath the park, said Reed W. Super, a lawyer representing NYC Park Advocates and several residents. From 2006 to 2010, the garage yielded $26.7 million, he said.
''It's illegal,'' Mr. Croft said. ''According to the City Charter, all of that money has to go back to the city's general fund.''
The group argues that the deal with Lincoln Center amounts to the removal of parkland, a process that only the State Legislature can undertake. The letter said that ''whether, how and when any portion of a New York City park may be used for nonpark purposes are decisions to be made by the State Legislature, not the mayor, not the parks department and certainly not Lincoln Center.''
City officials defended the agreement with Lincoln Center, pointing out that the cultural institution was solely responsible for the upkeep of the park and paid to maintain other public areas on its campus, including the signature fountain in its plaza. Lincoln Center, Ms. Wood said, ''has spent millions to improve these areas, create new green spaces and program them for public enjoyment.''
Residents and some members of Community Board 7 said that in the past they had not looked forward to the four-month takeover of the park by the Big Apple Circus, but that they had grown used to it. Their frustration mounted, however, when Fashion Week arrived.
''It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back,'' said Susan Levy, a resident of the Alfred.
To make way for the Fashion Week tents, the city removed 67 trees from the park.
City officials say that many of the trees that were cut down were in poor health and that their roots were creating cracks in the ceiling of the parking garage. The city has planted 220 trees within a mile radius of the park, while Lincoln Center has installed an additional 88 trees on its campus.
But residents say that a tree half a mile away does not make up for the loss of shade and green in Damrosch Park. ''Sadly,'' said the letter to city officials and Lincoln Center, ''Damrosch Park has been decimated. Even the parks department sign with the iconic leaf logo identifying 'Damrosch Park' was removed.''
Mr. Super, the lawyer for NYC Park Advocates, said that litigation was a possibility. ''We prefer not to run right into court,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Test of New Powers, Bank Merger Approved

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
9:10 p.m. Updated
Regulators on Tuesday approved Capital One's $9 billion acquisition of ING Direct USA, casting aside criticism that the deal would create the next too-big-too-fail banking behemoth.
The deal provides the first glimpse at how the government will use its new powers to oversee bank mergers, authority granted in the aftermath of the financial crisis. 
The Federal Reserve's consent came with some conditions. Citing consumer complaints and legal actions against the bank, the Fed ordered Capital One to revamp its internal controls, specifically around its lending and debt-collection practices.
''The Board expects that Capital One will ensure that its risk-management framework and methodologies, including its compliance functions, are commensurate with its new size and complexity,'' the Fed said in an order on Tuesday.
Some predicted that the Fed would rubber-stamp the deal. But the central bank was deliberate in its approach, delaying approval to hold public hearings and twice postponing plans to announce the fate of the acquisition.
In the end, the Fed was unconvinced that the union of two midsize players would cause the next Wall Street crisis.
''We are very pleased that the Federal Reserve has approved our acquisition,'' a Capital One spokeswoman, Tatiana Stead, said in a statement.
The bank, according to Ms. Stead, plans to close the deal in the next few days. It will have 90 days to outline its plan to strengthen its compliance and other risk-management controls.
The legacy of the financial crisis has loomed over Capital One's bid to buy ING Direct. As part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, the Fed must now weigh the potential hazards of big bank mergers and kill any deal in which the systemic risks outweigh the rewards.
The Capital One takeover presented the first major test case.
With the addition of ING's online banking unit in the United States, Capital One will transform into the fifth largest bank by deposits. The bank does not currently rank in the top 10. The combined institutions will have more than $200 billion in deposits, making it bigger than regional powerhouses like PNC and TD Bank.
The potential for such a seismic shift has alarmed community bankers and consumer advocates who cast the deal as a risk to taxpayers and painted Capital One as an aggressive subprime lender. By blessing the deal, the Fed delivered a blow to such critics, including the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, capping an unusually contentious eight-month battle that featured multiple public hearings and fiery debates.
''We're extremely disappointed in today's decision,'' said John Taylor, head of the community coalition, adding that his group was considering challenging the decision. ''It appears the Federal Reserve waited until Valentine's Day to give Capital One a box of chocolates.''
Capital One argued that consumers would reap the benefits of the deal, as the bank rolls out a broader range of loan products to ING Direct customers.
''With the Fed's approval, Capital One has the opportunity to build upon the strong foundation of ING Direct for the benefit of our customers, associates, shareholders and local communities,'' said Ms. Stead, the bank spokeswoman.
In June, Capital One agreed to pay $6.2 billion in cash for ING Direct USA. Under the terms of the deal, Capital One would also issue $2.8 billion worth of new shares to ING, giving the Dutch firm a 9.9 percent stake.
It is the latest move by Capital One to build a national banking franchise, in an effort to expand beyond credit cards.
In the midst of the housing and financial crisis, the bank scooped up three regional firms, including Chevy Chase Bank in Maryland and North Fork Bank's mortgage business in California. Last August, Capital One announced plans to buy HSBC's American credit card business for $2.6 billion. Capital One expects the HSBC acquisition will gain regulatory approval in the second quarter of 2012.
But as the bank ballooned in recent years, it became caught in the crosshairs of a public outcry. Capital One has had to contend with loyal ING customers who feared change.
Competitors and consumer groups also assailed the acquisition spree for creating a subprime lending giant, a notion that Capital One disputes. About a third of Capital One's credit card portfolio carries the subprime label, defined as loans to borrowers with credit scores below 660, according to the company.
Moving to blunt the criticism, Capital One offered some concessions in its bid for ING Direct. The bank promised a 10-year, $180 billion commitment to community lending and investments. Capital One also unveiled plans to create 500 jobs in Delaware, where ING Direct is based.
But the deal continued to draw ire. A bigger bank, critics reckoned, is likelier to leave taxpayers responsible for bailing out the company. With much at stake, the Fed last fall took the unusual step of holding three public hearings about the deal, providing a forum for critics.
Capital One used the hearings to defend its record. While Wall Street banks deal in derivatives and other risky businesses, Capital One said it focused on mom-and-pop consumers, leaving it immune to the volatility of the investment banking business.
The Fed appeared to agree.
In a 40-page order, the Fed detailed its standards for systemically risky acquisitions. The Fed analyzed the size and complexity of Capital One and ING Direct, the interconnectedness between the banks and the broader economy, and whether competitors could easily step in to replace the bank should it encounter ''severe financial distress.'' The Fed also examined how difficult it would be to unwind the combined banks should they show signs of collapsing.
''These measures suggest that Capital One would be significantly less complicated to resolve than the largest U.S. universal banks and investment banks,'' the Fed said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Where the Colorado Runs Dry

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WATERMAN. 
Jonathan Waterman is the author of ''Running Dry: A Journey From Source to Sea Down the Colorado River.''

 BODY:
CARBONDALE, Colo.
MOST visitors to the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon probably don't realize that the mighty Colorado River, America's most legendary white-water river, rarely reaches the sea.
Until 1998 the Colorado regularly flowed south along the Arizona-California border into a Mexican delta, irrigating farmlands and enriching a wealth of wildlife and flora before emptying into the Gulf of California.
But decades of population growth, climate change and damming in the American Southwest have now desiccated the river in its lowest reaches, turning a once-lush Mexican delta into a desert. The river's demise began with the 1922 Colorado River Compact, a deal by seven western states to divide up its water. Eventually, Mexico was allotted just 10 percent of the flow. 
Officials from Mexico and the United States are now talking about ways to increase the flow into the delta. With luck, someday it may reach the sea again.
It is paradoxical that the Colorado stopped running consistently through the delta at the end of the 20th century, which -- according to tree-ring records -- was one of the basin's wettest centuries in 1,200 years. Now dozens of animal species are endangered; the culture of the native Cocopah (the People of the River) has been devastated; the fishing industry, once sustained by shrimp and other creatures that depend on a mixture of seawater and freshwater, has withered. In place of delta tourism, the economy of the upper Gulf of California hinges on drug smuggling operations that run opposite to the dying river.
In 2008 I tried to float the length of the 1,450-mile river to the sea but had to walk the last week of the trip. Pools stagnated in the cracked riverbed. Like the 30 million other Americans who depend on the river, I worry about drinking water -- but I also worry about the sorry inheritance we are leaving future generations.
Demand for water isn't the only problem. Climate change also threatens to reduce runoff by 10 to 30 percent by 2050, depending on how much the planet warms, according to a 2009 paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Although the river delta can't yet be pronounced dead, its pulse is feeble and its once-vital estuaries and riverside forests are shrinking.
But a delicate beauty hangs on. Coyotes still bawl across the briny tang where a mirage-laden sky appears to pull the distant Sierra el Mayor down to sea level. The organic matter of this delta once sprawled 3,000 square miles to join Mexico and the United States in a miraculous mixture of fertility and desert; these sands have been washed out of the Rockies, carved from the Grand Canyon and tumbled through more than three million acres of river-dependent farms.
If the final reaches of this six-million-year-old delta were in the United States, they would have been declared a national park, with a protected free-flowing river. But because the river terminates in a foreign country, beyond the reach of the Endangered Species Act and most tourists' cameras, it is suffering a slow death.
Yet even in its last gasp of fecundity, the delta is larger than the human imagination. Spring tides sweep, like heartbeats, from the upper Gulf of California and the Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve two dozen miles up the salt-crusted and rock-hard riverbed. From Arizona a canal runs farm wastewater about 50 miles south into the Mexican delta, creating an accidental, but now critical, bird sanctuary. Groundwater infuses verdant marshlands; newly planted trees line restored riverbanks; and an earthquake last spring destroyed farm irrigation canals, allowing the river to flow seaward again, but all too briefly.
The problems have been neglected amid attention on illegal immigration, the drug war and the debated border fence. But by the time this winter's fogs burn off the delta, American and Mexican members of the International Boundary and Water Commission aim to complete negotiations on conserving water, responding to climate change and dedicating more water to the delta and its riverside forests instead of only to farms and distant cities.
These talks have gone on for years, but before Mexico's election this summer, there is a rare ecological opportunity, if only political forces seize it. I hope the commissioners can transcend their differences and recall the wisdom of ancient empires, when civilizations flourished only as long as the Nile and the Euphrates and the Yangtze continued to flow. By strengthening the treaty between the United States and Mexico that governs the Colorado River, we have the opportunity to revive the river and show the world, as it is suggested in Ecclesiastes, that all rivers shall run to the sea.

HEADLINE: Americans Increase Retail Spending

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Americans rebounded from a weak holiday season and stepped up spending on retail goods in January, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The increase, though, was not as much as analysts had anticipated. 
Retail sales rose at a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent last month, although spending on autos fell, the report showed.
Consumers spent more on electronics, home and garden supplies, sporting goods, at department and general merchandise stores and at restaurants and bars. They also paid higher prices for gas.
The retail sales figures, which are adjusted to reflect seasonal variations, showed that January was an improvement from December's figures, which were downwardly revised to show a flat reading. Excluding autos, building materials and gasoline station sales, core retail spending jumped 0.7 percent.
The ''retail sales data are better than they look, but they don't suggest that consumption growth is about to set the economic recovery alight,'' Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
The government's retail sales report is its first look each month at consumer spending, which represents 70 percent of economic activity. The positive data suggested that hiring gains have raised confidence and were encouraging more people to spend.
Economists had expressed concerns that consumers might pull back on spending this year because their wages hadn't kept pace with inflation. But the report suggested consumers were managing to increase spending at the same pace they did late last year.
''The good news is that the strong January gain establishes that the consumer trend is not folding,'' said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics.
Retail sales have risen about 21 percent since hitting a recession low. And they're nearly 6 percent above their pre-recession high.
Sales on autos dropped 1.1 percent, which was a surprise given that dealers reported sales increases in January.
The retail sales figures from auto dealers and the automakers' sales numbers don't always match up. Dealers may have also offered discounts in order to bolster sales. Low interest rates, better loan availability and new car models have helped drive sales higher in the last three months.
Sales at gasoline stations rose 1.4 percent last month, the most in 10 months. Gas prices have risen steadily in recent months. The national average price for a gallon of gas was $3.51 on Monday, up 12 cents from a month earlier.
Consumers spent much more at general merchandise stores, a category that includes big chains like Wal-Mart and Target and department stores like Macy's. Sales at those stores jumped 2 percent, after declining 0.7 percent in December.
And Americans spent 0.6 percent more at restaurants and bars.
Sales at online and catalog retailers fell 1.1 percent, the most in almost two years, as shoppers likely pulled back after the holiday shopping season.

HEADLINE: Born Abroad, Well Off and Using Public Schools

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Miriam and Christian Rengier, a German couple moving to New York, visited some private elementary schools in Manhattan last spring in search of a place for their son. They immediately noticed the absence of ethnic diversity, and the chauffeurs ferrying children to the door.
And then, at one school, their guide showed them the cafeteria.
''The kids were able to choose between seven different lunches: sushi and macrobiotics and whatever,'' Ms. Rengier recalled. ''And I said, 'What if I don't want my son to choose from seven different lunches?' And she looked at me like I was an idiot.''
For the Rengiers, the decision was clear: Their son would go to public school. 
''It was not the question if we could afford it or not,'' said Ms. Rengier, whose husband was transferred to the city because of his job as a lawyer and tax consultant. ''It was a question of whether it was real life or not.''
In New York, the affluent typically send their children to private schools. But not the foreign-born affluent. In a divergence, a large majority of wealthy foreign-born New Yorkers are sending their children to public schools, according to an analysis of census data.
There are roughly 15,500 households in the city with school-age children where the total income is at least $150,000 and both parents were born abroad. Of those, about 10,500, or 68 percent, use only the public schools, the data show.
That is nearly double the rate of American-born parents in the city in the same income bracket.
The census data include both immigrants and those temporarily stationed in the city for work. The disparity is even sharper for foreign-born parents with household incomes of $200,000 or more. About 61 percent send their children only to public schools, compared with 28 percent of native-born couples in the same income bracket.
As a result, some public elementary schools in wealthier parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn are experiencing an unexpected increase in foreign-born students, especially Western Europeans.
''We have never had the numbers that we have,'' said Elizabeth Phillips, the principal at Public School 321 in Park Slope for 13 years. ''But we've never had so many affluent foreign families in the neighborhood, either.''
A similar divergence exists in other major cities, the census data show. For example, in Los Angeles and Chicago, roughly 60 percent of foreign-born couples with at least $150,000 in household income send their children only to public schools, a rate far higher than that of native-born parents.
In the United States over all, there is almost no difference between the two groups, apparently because wealthy people outside of urban areas are much more likely to show allegiance to the public schools. Nationally, 73 percent of native-born couples and 76 percent of foreign-born couples send their children only to public school, according to the data, which was analyzed by Andrew A. Beveridge and Susan Weber-Stoger, demographers at Queens College.
In interviews, affluent foreign-born New Yorkers said that like all conscientious parents, they weighed various criteria in choosing schools, including quality, cost and location. But many said they were also swayed by the greater ethnic and economic diversity of the public schools. Some said that as immigrants, they had learned to navigate different cultures -- a skill they wanted to imbue in their children.
''When they go to public school, they're in a whole new world, a whole world of different people and different values, which is what the world is like,'' said Lyn Bollen, who grew up in Birmingham, England, and attended -- and taught at -- state-run schools. ''Shielding them from that is doing them a disservice.''
She and her husband, who works for Citigroup, moved to Manhattan with their children two years ago and now send their eldest son to public school near their home in Battery Park City.
Mamta Prakash-Dutta, the finance manager at a nonprofit organization for young South Asians, and her husband, an executive at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, are from India. Ms. Prakash-Dutta said their upbringings had taught them how to thrive in a globalized world.
''We're always back and forth, but our kids will probably be in many more nations, so it's important for them to be able to deal with multicultural exposure,'' she said. ''Many more street-smart skills are developed in public schools.''
The couple settled on a public school near their home on the Upper West Side.
Of course, affluent foreign-born New Yorkers tend to live in relatively well-to-do neighborhoods, which often have better public schools.
Still, some said that because they grew up in countries with strong public school systems, they arrived in New York with a more open mind about public education.
Immigrants from Canada and several Western European countries said that back home, private schools were often viewed as places for children with special learning needs. Most of the wealthy families they knew sent their children to public schools, they said.
''I grew up in Denmark, which is a society in which everything is public, everything is state-financed,'' said Morten Degnemark, who arrived in the United States in 2004 and runs a diamond and jewelry company in Manhattan. ''I'm from the public schools myself. It went O.K. for me, so, already, I started with an attitude that public school could be a good thing.''
He and his wife, who have two young children, chose Cobble Hill, a relatively affluent Brooklyn neighborhood, in part because it had a highly regarded public elementary school, he said.
''There are areas where we would never send them to public school,'' Mr. Degnemark said.
For some newly arrived families, public school has served a practical purpose.
Gilles Bransbourg moved with his family to New York City from France in 2009, unsure how long they would stay. He sought a French-English program for his children, to give them a smoother transition to the English-speaking world and to help them maintain their native tongue.
''Foreigners are not always here for a long time,'' said Mr. Bransbourg, a former investment banker who is now a research associate at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. ''They have other issues that Americans don't have.''
He and his wife considered the private Lycee Francais de New York in Manhattan, but were also attracted to the public system's dual-language programs. (There are currently four French-English programs and dozens of others offering English with Chinese, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian and Spanish.)
The couple settled on a public school in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, that offered a French-English language curriculum with a good reputation -- and the opportunity to become more deeply involved in the neighborhood.
''We thought it was great because our children would be part of an American community,'' Mr. Bransbourg said. ''It's important to be a part of a community where you live and not to be estranged from your environment.''
Mr. Bransbourg, who has an infant and two children in elementary school, said he was also relieved to avoid the Lycee's annual tuition of $26,100.
Private school tuition in the city has risen sharply over the past decade, with at least one elementary school topping $40,000 a year, and several foreign-born parents said they found such prices startling.
Ashima Dayal, a lawyer who arrived from India as a child, said her parents had instilled in her an immigrant's toughness and resourcefulness. She said this experience had probably made her less demanding of certain amenities and more accepting of some of the public system's shortcomings.
''Speaking to my American friends, they say, 'The cafeteria is not nice,' '' Ms. Dayal said. ''I don't give a damn if the cafeteria is nice! I would like there not to be splinters in the gym.'' She paused, adding, ''I just come from a different place.''

HEADLINE: Explosions In Thailand Cast Suspicion On Iranians

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and RICK GLADSTONE; Thomas Fuller reported from Bangkok, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Reporting was contributed by Poypiti Amatatham from Bangkok, Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem, John H. Cushman Jr. from Washington, and Kevin Drew from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- A series of explosions rocked a residential neighborhood here on Tuesday, leading the Thai authorities to a cache of bombs in a rented house and the capture of two men who the Thai police said carried Iranian passports. Thai officials said that two other suspects, whom they believed to be Iranians, were being sought, and that one of them had fled to neighboring Malaysia.
Witnesses said three men, who appeared to be foreigners, fled a house in the Sukhumvit neighborhood of Bangkok after an explosion in the early afternoon destroyed the house's roof. One escaped and another was detained at the city's main international airport. 
The fourth suspect, a woman, was not at the house at the time of the explosion, but is being sought because she rented the house and was occasionally seen there, the police said. Witnesses and the police said the third man who left the house, bleeding and seemingly disoriented, lobbed two explosive devices, one at a taxi and later another at approaching police officers, and the second blast severed the man's legs and wounded several Thais.
It was possible that the men were simply arms smugglers, drug traffickers or gangsters in a city known as a hub of illicit activity. But the reported nationalities of the two captured suspects raised suspicions that the suspects were part of what Israel has called a terrorist campaign by Iran and the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah aimed at Israeli targets, an accusation denied by Iran and Hezbollah.
Thai authorities said on Wednesday that the type of explosives found in the house could be used to ''target individuals.''
''The destructive power did not reach the level of being able to target groups of people or big buildings,'' Wichean Potephosree, the head of Thailand's national security council, said at a briefing for reporters on Wednesday.
The events in Bangkok came a day after Israeli diplomatic personnel were targeted by bombers in the capitals of Georgia and India with methods that were remarkably similar to attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years, for which Iran has blamed Israel. Both countries, avowed enemies, are locked in an increasingly tense dispute over Iran's nuclear program.
Thai officials said it was premature to speculate on the purpose of the explosives cache. But Israeli officials blamed Iran. Outside experts did not rule out that possibility, but some expressed skepticism, partly because of the seeming amateurishness of the suspects.
''The attempted terrorist attack in Bangkok proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to perpetrate terrorism,'' said Ehud Barak, Israel's defense minister. Mr. Barak, who had been in Bangkok for a few hours on Sunday, made his comments in Singapore, according to a statement from his office.
In Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said the episodes in Thailand, Georgia and India ''come on the heels of other incidents that clearly had links back to Iran.''
She also said, ''We are going to await the results of these investigations.''
Yitzhak Aharonovitch, Israel's public security minister, issued the country's bluntest warning of retaliation so far, though without naming Iran. The Associated Press quoted him as telling Israel Radio on Tuesday, ''We know who carried out the terror attacks, we know who sent them, and Israel will settle the score with them.''
Some terrorism experts expressed caution about what they called a rush to judgment. Will Hartley, the editor of Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center in London, said in an e-mail, ''The attacks in India, Georgia and now Thailand have all been highly amateurish, and lack the sophistication that would normally be expected from an operation'' by either Hezbollah or Iran's external operations wing, the Quds Force.
Others also took note that it seemed illogical for Iran to carry out an attack on Indian soil precisely when it is seeking to cultivate good relations with India, which has been resisting American pressure to join a Western-led effort to isolate Iran economically.
Others said there was nothing surprising about the amateurishness of some of the attacks, noting that operatives from other countries, including Israel, have botched work in the past.
Israeli officials said that Israeli forensic teams were in New Delhi and Tbilisi, Georgia, helping the local authorities investigate the bombings, a standard practice whenever Israelis are the targets of attacks abroad.
For the past month, Israeli and Thai security forces had been cooperating on a separate case of a possible planned terrorist attack. The Thai authorities said Israeli intelligence agents had warned that a group of people who appeared to be from Hezbollah were planning to strike tourist sites. Shortly after that warning, a Lebanese man was arrested at Bangkok's main airport as he tried to leave the country.
Thai officials said they could not fully explain Tuesday's events.
The three men had rented and occupied the house for the past several weeks, said Laxme Kondan, a housecleaner who lives on the same street. The police searched the house and discovered C4 explosives and at least two improvised explosive devices, said Maj. Gen. Wichai Sangprapai, the deputy metropolitan commissioner.
A passer-by on a motorcycle, Wichai Tiwaree, said that soon after the explosion in the house, he saw ''a guy walking in a very unusual way.''
''I saw blood coming out of his ears,'' Mr. Wichai said. He then heard another blast, he said.
The police said that the man tried to hail a taxi and threw an explosive device, possibly a hand grenade, when it did not stop, destroying its front half.
Mr. Wichai said he then saw the man running up a busy street. ''People were yelling, 'Get him! Get him!' '' he said.
Thai news media reports identified him as Saci Morabi. Among his belongings, the police found a receipt from a hotel in the Thai city of Chonburi, said Col. Varavudh Thaweechaikarn, a police officer. ''The man put his nationality as Iranian when he checked into the hotel,'' he said. The police also found Iranian currency in the man's wallet and said he was carrying an Iranian passport.
In the early evening, a second suspect, identified in the Thai media as Mohammad Hazaei, 42, was detained at Bangkok's main international airport. Thailand's immigration police said he was carrying an Iranian passport and was in Thailand on a tourist visa.

HEADLINE: Criticism of FreshDirect Deal Is Off Base, City Officials Say

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration on Tuesday staunchly defended its decision to provide the online grocer FreshDirect with an unusually large $127.8 million package of cash and tax breaks to move to the Bronx rather than New Jersey.
As New York officials voted to approve the deal on Tuesday morning, Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, insisted that the agreement would allow the city to retain nearly 2,000 blue-collar jobs and enable FreshDirect to expand at a new headquarters on long-dormant land in the Harlem River Yards.
FreshDirect, which started in Queens in 2002 but has outgrown its buildings there, was a ''New York success story'' deserving of support, Mr. Pinsky said. 
''FreshDirect will make a private investment of tens of millions of dollars in the poorest Congressional district in the country,'' he said. ''Not only will the city's investment help create hundreds of construction jobs and up to a thousand incremental industrial jobs for New Yorkers in a still-challenging economic environment, but it will also generate incremental economic activity that will yield a substantial positive return for the city's taxpayers.''
The deal has come under increasing criticism from government watchdog organizations, some Bronx community groups and the city comptroller, John C. Liu, for what they call its overly generous terms and the fact that the deal was announced by the city last week, before a public hearing and the vote by the city's Industrial Development Agency.
Mr. Liu described the agreement as one of the biggest deals of its kind by the Bloomberg administration, which has often prided itself on being stingy in giving subsidies for companies threatening to relocate.
''The E.D.C. has not clearly justified why this much money should be used to subsidize this company,'' Mr. Liu said. ''For the cost of this benefits package, the city could give 4,385 students full, four-year scholarships to CUNY or hire 1,458 new teachers or pay for 350,000 G.E.D. test-prep programs or launch a microlending program for minority and woman entrepreneurs.''
FreshDirect had threatened to move its operations to Jersey City after receiving a $100 million incentive from New Jersey. State and city officials in New York countered with a bigger package that included $20 million in cash.
Although the bulk of FreshDirect's customers are in New York, officials there say they found the company's threat to move across the Hudson River credible. But critics doubted that a company dependent on timely deliveries would risk having to use the Hudson's often-clogged tunnels and bridges.
The company now plans to build a $112 million complex in the Bronx and over the next 10 years add almost 1,000 jobs to its work force of 1,963. City officials said they were willing to pay a premium for industrial jobs. But before FreshDirect fulfills that promise, the company will have used most of the benefits.
Most economists are critical of states' competing for jobs by offering ever-larger subsidies and depleting public resources. It is far better, they say, to improve transportation networks and education that benefit all businesses.
Michael Eberstadt said he was dismayed by the city's decision to ''subsidize my competitor's advancement over me.'' Mr. Eberstadt started Monster Savings, a relatively small online food and supply service in Manhattan. But just as his company is starting to grow, government handed his larger rival another advantage.
''There's something fundamentally unfair about that,'' Mr. Eberstadt said. ''They're huge. I'm tiny, but starting to grow.''
Mychal Johnson, a Bronx resident and a member of the local Community Board 1, was highly critical that the city struck a deal without talking to residents about jobs, wages and truck traffic. And, he added, ''They don't even deliver to our community.''
Since the deal was announced, the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., cobbled together a nonbinding agreement in which FreshDirect promised to ''make its best efforts'' to expand its service in the Bronx and to ensure that 30 percent of the new jobs go to borough residents.

HEADLINE: Patrick J. Foye

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Foye, 55, is the new executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages more than 63 million square feet of real estate, including the World Trade Center site. Earlier, he was the deputy secretary for economic development under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
A. There was a comprehensive review and audit of the agency; it started around the time that I got here.
The first phase was focused on capital spending, compensation, World Trade Center history and cost-to-complete schedule, and the overall organization. There will be a final Phase 2 completed around the middle of the year. This will establish a platform for reform and a lot of fundamental changes around here.
A. When the World Trade Center nears completion there will be a peace dividend -- in the sense that Port Authority has borrowed about $7 billion to put into the World Trade Center, and total spending is more than that. As One World Trade Center is completed at the end of 2013, we'll be able to stop investing at that level. That will enable us to return to our core mission -- airports, ports, bridges and tunnels -- not real estate development. Government is not good at real estate development.
Q. Larry Silverstein, the developer of the surrounding buildings, said that, too, essentially, when I interviewed him more than two years ago. He complained about the agency's excessive slowness in redeveloping ground zero.
A. Larry's statement that the pace of progress has been too slow is accurate. And it's one of the things I'm focused on changing. We can do better. There is too much process at the Port Authority, and it slows us down. All the steps and protocols and forms were put in for the best of reasons -- to avoid fraud, waste and abuse, and to increase transparency -- but we've overstepped it. So one of the things we're going to be looking at in this review and audit of the Port Authority is how to better balance the need for process with accelerating action.
Q. One World Trade Center is an extremely complicated project, though.
A. It's the largest, most complicated construction project in the world.
Q. Can you give a progress report of the construction and leasing?
A. We're up to the 92nd floor. The schedule, obviously, over the years has slipped. Right now completion will be the end of 2013.
The building is nearly 60 percent leased, and given the fact that we're not going to be completed until the end of 2013, that's a terrific position to be in. We expect there will be some positive leasing news in the weeks and months to come.
As we go through the rest of '12 and into '13, rents generally in Manhattan, including at the World Trade Center, are going to be trending up.
Q. What kind of rates, and revenue, are you looking to get?
A. I think it's premature to predict rents, expenses and net operating income.
Q. What's going on with the retail portion of the project?
A. We expect soon to enter into a joint venture with Westfield, the Australian real estate investment trust mall operator. We're going to be 50-50 joint venture partners. It's about 460,000 square feet of retail and Westfield will be running it for us.
Q. What is its capital investment?
A. It's $600 million-plus, which will be the largest single sector investment in the World Trade Center site.
Q. Any other updates?
A. We issued an R.F.P., or request for proposal, for the observation deck at One World Trade Center. We think there will be substantial interest both nationally and international for designing, operating and managing the observation deck.
It will be the leading observation deck in the world. Given what happened at the site on 9/11, this can't be frivolous entertainment. So there's going to be the elements of entertainment, but there will be educational and historical elements consistent with what happened on the site in the aftermath of 9/11.
Q. Port Authority will be relocating to the area as well.
A. We're actually moving to Four World Trade Center. It was a deal that was made a number of years ago.
Q. What drew you to government work?
A. Government has been an attraction to me for a long time. I'm a first-generation American -- both of my parents were from Ireland. This country has been very good to my family. And I like the action, the intellectual challenge of government and the ability to give back.
Q. You were a close aide to Governor Spitzer. Do you still keep in touch with him?
A. Yeah. He and his wife and I practiced law together a long time ago. Eliot and his wife and family are doing well.
Q. You also served with Paul McCartney's new wife, Nancy Shevell, on the Metropolitan Transit Authority board. Did you go to her wedding last fall?
A. No I did not, unfortunately. Nancy was an unsung hero -- pun intended -- on the M.T.A. board.

HEADLINE: Europe v. World

BYLINE: By EDWIN M. TRUMAN. 
Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, was director of international finance at the Federal Reserve Board from 1977 to 1998 and assistant secretary of the Treasury for international affairs from 1998 to 2001. He served as a counselor to the Treasury secretary in 2009.

 BODY:
Washington
FOR the third time in a century, a bitter conflict fueled by historic grievances has erupted in Europe, with the United States looking from afar and hoping not to get involved. Of course, this is not being fought on the battlefields but in the arcane arenas of international finance. But as in World War I, which President Woodrow Wilson once dismissed as ''a drunken brawl,'' and in World War II, which America formally stayed out of until Pearl Harbor, the crisis over the euro will require further American involvement -- whether we like it or not.
Currently, the United States is discouraging the International Monetary Fund and its non-European members from promising additional financial assistance to Europe. 
The American posture is understandable and, at one level, sensible. With our own debt and deficit problems, we and other countries can be forgiven for feeling that it not up to us to extricate Europe from its mistakes and excesses. President Obama, facing a tough re-election fight, is hardly in a position to offer financial aid to Europe. Just as Washington wants Europe to do more to enhance its political and military security, so is it appropriate to demand that Europe do more on its own with respect to its economic and financial security.
But policy passivity risks exacerbating the European crisis and its macroeconomic effects. The United States must show more leadership. First, it must be bolder and more public in setting conditions on Europe's loan programs. Then, if Europe finally responds convincingly, the United States should rally the rest of the world in a supporting role.
For two years, Europe has dithered over creating a financial firewall to prevent the financial meltdown's spreading from Greece. Little has come of the discussions. Europe now needs a financial safety net to rescue itself from a self-made conflagration that threatens itself and the rest of the world.
As a measure of the consternation outside of Europe, the economic forecasts released recently by the I.M.F. projected global growth this year at 1.2 percentage points lower than last spring, a deterioration that is largely attributable to mismanagement of the euro crisis. No region of the world has been spared. The loss in global output amounts to $1 trillion.
Two months ago, European leaders asked the I.M.F. and the rest of the world for help, while pledging to make their own financial contribution, channeled through the I.M.F. The United States does not need to put up money, but it has been slow to respond positively. It is time for Washington to insist that I.M.F. assistance be accompanied by conditions on economic and financial policies in the euro area. There should be conditions attached not just to programs to support Greece, Ireland, Portugal and potentially Italy and Spain but also to euro-area policies more broadly because this is a euro-area crisis.
Four conditions are appropriate.
First, countries that can -- that is, those where the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product is 90 percent or less -- should reverse their projected budget tightening in 2012 and 2013. Those countries are Austria, Finland, France, Slovenia -- and, above all, Germany.
Second, the European Central Bank should lower its refinancing rate to 0.25 percent from 1 percent -- an action that it has resisted because of an unjustified fear of inflation.
Third, euro-area authorities should set aside at least $1 trillion for a European financial safety net -- a far larger amount than what has been publicly discussed so far -- to persuade markets to stop betting against debt markets of solvent countries.
Fourth, new loans from the euro area, channeled through the I.M.F back to the euro area, should not be repaid until all existing I.M.F. loans to euro-area countries have been entirely repaid. A change in this treatment is necessary before China, the Persian Gulf countries and other potential contributors are comfortable with throwing a lifeline to a region more prosperous than their own countries.
If these four conditions are met, then the United States should drop its tacit opposition to a proposal by Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F. and a former French finance minister, to raise $500 billion to support Europe and actively encourage those countries with the political and financial capacity to participate in the I.M.F. component of a European financial safety net.
Ironically, the I.M.F. will be turning to these emerging markets and developing countries for help just as the euro debt crisis has delayed the timetable for long-promised increases in voting power for those nations at the I.M.F. Given the economic and financial damage inflicted by Europe on the rest of the world, the United States must insist that these promises be strengthened, and speedily fulfilled.

HEADLINE: One Very Tough Travel Schedule

BYLINE: By PAT BORZI

 BODY:
Last summer, as their two basketball-playing sons approached their final seasons of eligibility, Rich and Vicki McNally vowed to watch them play in person as often as possible -- a last hurrah, they said, before their boys entered the real world and careers away from the court.
It was a fine notion, with one problem: their sons attend universities on opposite coasts, 3,000 miles apart.
Two weekends ago, the McNallys flew from their home in San Francisco to Boston to see their youngest son, Oliver, play two games for Harvard, the team he co-captains. On Feb. 7, they drove across the Golden Gate Bridge to the campus of tiny Dominican University of California, in San Rafael, to watch their middle son, Xander, a tri-captain who is tied for the Division II lead in steals. 
Then, last weekend, the McNallys boarded flights in different directions -- Vicki heading west to see Dominican play in Hawaii, and Rich east for Harvard's Ivy League games at Penn and at Princeton. Both plan to attend Harvard's remaining home games, with Rich also going to a couple on the road, as the Crimson (21-3) seek the program's first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 1946.
''This year, with both of them seniors and Harvard on the verge of maybe doing something pretty unbelievable, we didn't want to miss it,'' Vicki McNally said in a telephone interview last week.
Rich McNally's job as a managing partner of a private equity firm, which has clients in Asia, Hawaii and the continental United States, allows the family the resources and frequent-flier miles to make the travel a reality. Miles cover only some of the cost, however, and Rich McNally declined to estimate what the final tally for this season's travel would be.
''I probably couldn't even answer that,'' he said in a telephone interview from his office in San Francisco. ''I don't even want to know what the price tag is. But that doesn't mean to imply we don't care about it, either.
''We're not in a situation where we don't need to watch what we spend. But we're going to see this through, meaning both of our boys' careers, and we're going to be there whatever it takes.''
The McNallys have concentrated on attending conference games for both teams, though they turned Harvard's appearance at a tournament in the Bahamas over Thanksgiving into a family vacation. The family's oldest son, Peter, an advertising account executive, flew in from New York. Only Xander, playing in California, missed out.
Vicki handles much of the logistics, booking hotels far in advance to save money and scanning travel Web sites for the best airfares. When convenient, they stay with relatives. Rich often adds his travel to Harvard games to the end of business trips. Next week, he plans to fly nonstop from Honolulu to Newark on the way to Harvard home games against Penn and Princeton.
Harvard's Ivy League games are mainly on Fridays and Saturdays, while Dominican plays about half its games on weeknights, meaning the McNallys frequently see their sons play within days of each other.
''It just gets down to planning,'' Rich McNally said. ''We really start sitting down and planning out our winters before Thanksgiving. At that point, we start looking at airline tickets and hotel reservations. We don't have the means to fly whenever we want and stay wherever we want, so we are as economical as possible.''
Neither Oliver nor Xander is considered a scorer -- Oliver averages 6.8 points a game, Xander 6.2 -- but each is a key contributor on his team. Xander, a 6-foot-2 guard who is a year older than the 6-3 Oliver, played a season at Denver before transferring. He took a year off, putting him in the same class as Oliver.
Xander found a niche at Dominican, and averages a team-best 3.6 assists for the 8-16 Penguins, a nickname that is a nod to the black-and-white habits of the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael, who founded the college in 1890. (A university spokesman said the sisters considered the nickname an honor.)
Oliver, as a sophomore, briefly shared the Harvard starting backcourt with Jeremy Lin, the current Knicks sensation. Last season, he finished second in Division I by making 92.6 percent of his free throws, a team record, and ranks third on Harvard's career list (86.1 percent) among players with at least 250 attempts. He is also third in games played (111).
The brothers are close; they text or talk nearly every day. Xander said he encouraged his parents to see Oliver play more often. ''The first couple of years, they went out there maybe two times a year,'' he said. ''The nice thing is, they're not missing too many of my games. I keep telling them: 'Go out there. You've seen me play enough.' ''
Oliver's one regret is that he never saw Xander play for Denver or Dominican. Xander did catch one of Oliver's Harvard games, at Santa Clara two years ago. But if Harvard makes the N.C.A.A. tournament, Xander said he planned to attend, as Dominican's season would be over. Neither parent would talk about that possibility, fearing they could jinx the Crimson, and Oliver is equally cautious.
''That would be the really special part, if it works out,'' he said.
Luckily, his parents specialize in short-notice travel.
Last week, with Vicki feeling melancholy about missing six of Xander's final seven games because of trips to see Oliver play, she set out to find a cheap, last-minute ticket to Hawaii for Dominican's annual weeklong jaunt to play four Pacific West Conference opponents. She uncovered a $380 fare to Honolulu, less than half the usual price, and saw two of the four games.
Last March, when Harvard faced Princeton, Rich's alma mater, in a one-game playoff at Yale for the Ivy League's automatic N.C.A.A. berth, Vicki refused to go. ''Too nerve-racking,'' she said. But Rich cobbled together a three-stop flight itinerary from Aspen, Colo., where he was skiing, and reached New Haven in time to see Harvard lose in the final seconds, 63-62.
''The worst day of our lives,'' Rich said. Nevertheless, he was glad he made it.
''I know some of our friends don't really understand the amount of time we spend on this, and effort and priority,'' he said. ''It should be obvious. It's been a part of our lives for years. It did get more complicated when Oliver went to school across the country.''

HEADLINE: Amid Image of Ire Toward U.S. Bases, Okinawans' True Views Vary

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
HENOKO, Japan -- At first glance, this tiny fishing village can appear a hotbed of the sort of Okinawan anger that has damaged America's ties with Japan. Near Henoko's docks, demonstrators in tents recently marked the 2,850th day of their vigil against construction of a United States Marine airfield.
But wander up Henoko's narrow streets, and the villagers will tell you a different story. They say the activists are outsiders. Most residents, they say, still support the village's ''painful decision'' of more than a decade ago to accept the planned air base, with its noise and risk of crashes, in exchange for jobs and compensation payments.
''Of course, it would be better not to have the air base, but we are not dogmatic like them,'' Masaaki Shiroma, a community association leader, said as he nodded toward the tent encampment. 
This southern island can often seem united in its resistance to the new airfield at Henoko and, more broadly, to the large number of military bases that the United States has maintained here since the end of World War II. But look more deeply and a nuanced picture emerges, one that seems to offer a possible chance of some sort of compromise.
There is much truth to the image of an angry Okinawa, an island of 1.4 million residents about two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. Much of the resentment over the large American military presence is focused on one base, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, a busy heliport that has come to symbolize the island's burden because of its dangerous location in the middle of a city, Ginowan. The United States and Japan first agreed to move the base in 1996 to appease Okinawan outrage over the rape of a schoolgirl by three American servicemen, later choosing Henoko, in the island's less populated north, as the site to build a replacement airfield.
But construction never started because, local leaders say, the Henoko agreement failed to address Okinawans' resentment at the oversize American presence on the island, which is host to two-thirds of the 37,000 shore-based United States military personnel in Japan. The biggest setback came two years ago, when the prime minister at the time, Yukio Hatoyama, broke an election promise to move the base off the island entirely, which only seemed to confirm Tokyo's willingness to allow the Americans to remain on Okinawa.
Both the American and the Japanese governments still formally support the original plan to move the Futenma base to Henoko. However, opinion polls show that about 80 percent of voters on Okinawa now oppose it, enough for many analysts and politicians to proclaim the agreement to be as good as dead.
But look across Okinawa's divided political spectrum and the depth of that opposition varies. For those on the left, the Futenma base had become a symbol not only of an unfair base burden but also of a history of discrimination by Japan, going back to its 1879 annexation of this once independent Kingdom of the Ryukyus.
A similarly large bloc of voters on the right, though sharing some of this anger, supported the Futenma relocation plan until recently. They voice more concern about national security issues and support the bases as a way to help offset the rising threat of China, just across the East China Sea. They say they also want the jobs and other money the bases bring to Okinawa, by many measures the poorest of Japan's 47 prefectures.
Many conservatives turned against the Henoko plan two years ago, in the popular outrage that followed Mr. Hatoyama's broken promise. The Okinawa chapter of the right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party broke ranks with the party's national headquarters in Tokyo and opposed moving the base to the village. In late 2010, the island's L.D.P.-backed governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, won re-election by switching to an antibase platform.
''We had to reverse our position for political survival,'' said Sunao Ikema, the secretary general of the L.D.P.'s Okinawa chapter.
In interviews, Mr. Ikema and other L.D.P. members did not exclude the possibility of changing their position once again, this time in support of the base, once public passions showed signs of cooling. But at best, conservative leaders and political analysts said that allowing construction of a new air base on Okinawa would take time, and would probably require scrapping the current agreement for some other approach.
The governor, Mr. Nakaima, declined a request for an interview, but Vice Governor Kanetoshi Yoseda indicated that it would be difficult to go back to supporting the relocation without clearer signs of receding public passions. Some analysts say that could come in June, when conservatives will try to regain control of the 48-seat prefectural assembly, where they now hold 22 seats. That prospect has many on the left alarmed that their side may be losing momentum.
''We need to keep up the pressure on Governor Nakaima to prevent him from backsliding,'' said Yoichi Iha, the Communist Party-backed anti-base candidate who lost the Ginowan mayoral election. ''If Okinawa keeps saying no, then Tokyo and America have no choice but to give up.''
Conservatives agreed that a new relocation deal might be possible if the Japanese government took new steps to lower the overall base footprint on Okinawa. But many Okinawans were pessimistic, saying that would require a level of political leadership that is lacking in Tokyo and Washington.
Some analysts said that the two nations did make a promising gesture earlier this month, when they announced an intention to continue with a nearly two-decade-old agreement to remove 8,000 of the 18,000 Marines on Okinawa. While analysts said that more concessions were needed, the reduction in Marines might be a step toward eventually softening Okinawan resistance to relocating the Futenma air base elsewhere on the island.
The still potent political forces in support of a compromise are visible in Nago, the city whose jurisdiction includes Henoko. An anti-base candidate won the mayoralty in Nago two years ago by a narrow margin, but many people there say now that a slowing local economy could revive support for moving the base, and the resulting jobs, from Ginowan. Last October, the previous mayor and other local L.D.P. leaders held a rally of 2,200 local business owners to support the planned base.
Those sentiments were echoed here in Henoko, where many of the 1,800 residents said that opinions were split about three-to-one in favor of construction. But residents warned that further delays could erode that support. Mr. Shiroma, the neighborhood leader in Toyohara, which includes part of Henoko, said that villagers were weary of being left dangling by Tokyo's inability to build the base after nearly two decades.
''If Tokyo doesn't really want the Marines here, then just tell us,'' said Mr. Shiroma, 67. ''The hardest part is this lack of direction.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Central Bank Marks A Goal for Higher Inflation

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Hoping to win its long-futile battle against falling prices, Japan's central bank on Tuesday said it would try to kindle inflation, setting a goal of 1 percent, by pumping tens of billions more dollars into the economy.
While central bankers usually worry more about keeping inflation in check than trying to stoke it, Japan's economy has labored for more than two decades against the stagnating effects of falling prices, or deflation. 
The Bank of Japan on Tuesday said it would expand a program of buying government bonds as a way to inject additional money into the economy. And it set a goal of continuing the effort until inflation had reached 1 percent.
Although some analysts question whether the effort will be enough to achieve the desired effect, the Bank of Japan is responding to increasing political pressure to make a clearer commitment to raising prices, as an economic rebound after last year's natural and nuclear disasters is running out of steam.
The government said Monday that the Japanese economy shrank at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the October-to-December quarter, reversing robust gains in the previous three months, as weak overseas demand and a strong yen hurt manufacturing.
Excessive inflation was a cause for concern for Japan during its rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and emerging economies are still careful to prevent prices from rising too quickly. But as the Japanese economy stalled over the last two decades, prices have instead fallen in the reverse phenomenon, called deflation -- the damaging downward spiral in prices that saps corporate profits and wages.
Politicians and economists have long criticized the Bank of Japan for not doing enough to combat falling prices. That criticism became louder after the United States Federal Reserve -- facing economic pressures of its own -- set a 2 percent inflation target last month. Adding to the concern has been the gloom that Europe's debt crisis continues to cast over the global economy.
At its policy meeting Tuesday, the Bank of Japan's board showed a more explicit commitment to ending deflation, voting to set consumer inflation at an annual rate of 1 percent as its price goal, at least for the time being. The bank had previously defined 1 percent only as its ''understanding'' of a desirable rate of inflation.
Prices in Japan have not risen at an annual pace above 1 percent since 1997, when deflation set in.
The central bank on Tuesday also added 10 trillion yen, or $130 billion, to a 65-trillion-yen asset buying and lending program, a measure meant to stimulate the flow of money into the moribund economy. Under the program, the bank buys government and private debt and lends out money, increasing the amount available for economic activity. Buying the government bonds also help sustain Japan's huge public debt burden.
As widely expected, the bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a range of zero to 0.1 percent.
''We welcome the Bank of Japan's policy measures, which constitute aggressive steps to beat deflation,'' the finance minister, Jun Azumi, told reporters after the decision. ''We hope the bank's bold monetary easing will boost the economy.''
Tokyo stocks rose modestly, yields on Japanese bonds fell and the yen weakened against the dollar on the news. A weaker yen is good news for Japan's economy because it strengthens the competitiveness of its exports. The yen's recent strength has battered the country's exporters like Panasonic, which predicts record losses for the year.
Takuji Aida, a Japan-based economist at UBS, said the Bank of Japan's move was too subtle, saying perhaps the bank was trying to appease its critics rather than make an effective policy move. Mr. Aida said he was not persuaded the bank would take a strong enough stance toward inflation.
In a note to clients, he pointed out that in the English version of its policy statement, the bank used the word ''goal,'' but that it used an ambiguous word in the Japanese version of the statement.
''The B.O.J.'s decision today to clarify its 'price stability goal' and expand the asset purchasing program was a positive surprise for the markets,'' the note said, ''but we think that the B.O.J.'s monetary policy will not essentially change even after today's decision.''
The bank's message was also clouded because it maintained expectations for a moderate recovery, causing confusion among some analysts over why bank officials had chosen to act now. The yen has recently come off record highs and economists expect better numbers this quarter as reconstruction demand takes off in earnest.
Comments from Masaaki Shirakawa, governor of the Bank of Japan, appeared to further play down the actions' significance. He told reporters after the decision that the bank merely wished to better communicate its antideflationary stance to markets.
''We have already implemented powerful monetary easing to beat deflation,'' said Mr. Shirakawa. ''But as our stance was not communicated fully, we saw room to revise our wording.''
He said that the bank's decision was not in response to political pressure, and that its increased asset purchase program was not a way to help Japan finance its debt.
Mr. Shirakawa has long argued that monetary policy alone cannot bring an end to deflation in Japan, a situation that he says is caused by a lack of demand. Economists say the bank is running out of options, since interest rates are already effectively at zero and because it has little leeway to expand its asset-buying program.
No amount of money can energize a recovery, Mr. Shirakawa has said, without measures to restructure and expand the real economy. But the Japanese government, saddled with a debt twice the size of its economy, has struggled to spend enough to sustain strong economic growth, and economic reforms have fallen short.

HEADLINE: A Tower's New Owner Hears the Hum of Data

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
The New York Telephone Company building at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge is not among the city's most loved, to put it charitably. It was built in 1975 as a switching control center for the phone company but has been largely vacant for years, despite the large ''Verizon'' sign that adorns its forbidding facade.
Come this fall, while the building may look much the same on the outside, on the inside it will be pulsing with thousands of terabytes of data. The Sabey Corporation, a developer and operator of data centers based in Seattle, acquired the condominium that makes up a majority of the building for $120 million last year with a minority partner, the developer Youngwoo & Associates. (Verizon will continue to occupy and own three of the 32 floors.)
The seller was M&T Bank, which took control of the property from Taconic Investment Partners after that developer's $350 million plans to convert the building into an office tower fell through. 
The condominium, at 375 Pearl Street, will be one of the city's largest data centers when it opens, at roughly one million square feet, with access to up to 40 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 2,000 average-size homes.
''We like to think about our data centers as just one large computer, and this computer is going to help drive the New York economy into the 21st century,'' said David A. Sabey, the company's president.
There are a handful of other data centers across the city, notably several that lease space at 111 Eighth Avenue, the huge Chelsea office building that Google acquired last year. In the wake of that deal, there is growing concern that as these data centers' leases expire Google will take over the space for its own use, said Wes Rudes, a senior vice president at the New York branch of the brokerage company Cresa.
''There have been more than five million square feet of data center deals done in the tristate area in the last three years,'' Mr. Rudes said, ''so there is a ton of demand and a lot of companies are in the market.''
Google declined to comment.
Another large data center is at 60 Hudson Street, the landmark Western Union building in TriBeCa. DataGryd, the company that runs the building's data center, is offering four 60,000-square-foot floors with four megawatts of power available per floor, ''although more power is available if needed,'' said Peter Feldman, the company's chief executive. DataGryd is also building a cogeneration plant, which will make more power available at the site.
A third data center site is at 32 Avenue of the Americas, the historic former AT&T building. Also a landmark, it has 20,000 square feet of space and 15 megawatts of power currently available, according to John J. Gilbert III, the chief operating officer for Rudin Management, the landlord.
Michael G. Morris, a senior managing director at Newmark Knight Frank and part of its data center consulting group, said there were few opportunities in Manhattan to build modern data centers. Of the Verizon building, Mr. Morris, who is representing the building, said: ''The introduction of a purpose-built data center with new systems will be well met in a marketplace with limited supply and antiquated product.''
Mr. Sabey said the company spent two years searching for a facility in the Northeast before it settled on 375 Pearl Street. Because the company was not proposing to turn it into an office tower, he said, ''we could mine an intrinsic value that other users couldn't, and as a result we got a wonderful property at a very low cost.''
The building works perfectly as a data center, Mr. Sabey said, because its floor plates can withstand 200 to 400 pounds per square foot, compared with just 100 pounds per square foot for most office towers. It also has access to a large amount of power, and its location in a high-density area is ideal.
Proximity to data centers is important for several industries, including Wall Street traders, where speed is critical and an additional nanosecond for data to travel over a longer distance would put the traders at a disadvantage. In addition, moving large amounts of data requires extensive bandwidth, and this can be expensive. ''If you have everything in one building, moving data from a sequencer to a disk drive is much cheaper if you aren't running over a leased carrier line. As distance increases, you must take into account the price of maintaining the bandwidth you need,'' Mr. Sabey said.
Even the building's much-maligned facade, with its heavy vertical lines and small windows, is an advantage. ''It is ironic, because we like the look of the building,'' Mr. Sabey said. ''It has a good cover that won't let in a lot of heat gain, and it is very stout -- it is really very data-centeresque.''
While Sabey plans to leave the facade alone, it is gutting the inside of the building. ''This is definitely the tallest data center, and maybe the largest high-rise data center in the world,'' Mr. Sabey said.
The building should be ready for occupancy by the fall. In some cases, the company will lease directly to tenants, like large financial institutions or hospitals, and also possibly to outside data center companies that can run their own data centers inside the building. While no occupants have signed a lease, ''we are negotiating business terms with a number of prospective tenants,'' Mr. Morris said.
As for the rent, data center occupants sign agreements much like traditional office leases, but the pricing is often based on kilowatts used per month rather than square feet occupied. While he declined to give an asking rent, Mr. Morris said several factors went into pricing: the amount of power that is available, the reliability of the power based on battery backups and generators, and services offered like maintaining an ambient temperature to keep the computers working at optimal speeds. Average rents in Manhattan range from $275 to $350 per kilowatt per month, he said. In addition, tenants pay for their electricity consumption.
Industries like financial services, law firms and online commerce companies now demand the use of data centers. The Sabey Corporation hopes to tap into the city's growing life sciences industry, which Mr. Sabey said ''could eventually make up as much as 20 percent of our business in New York.''
The city has begun several efforts to spur the technology and life sciences industries, including the recent announcement of a technology campus at Roosevelt Island. The data center at 375 Pearl Street could help provide the infrastructure to support the city's initiatives, said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a network of business leaders.
''We are top in the world when it comes to scientific research,'' she said, ''but what we haven't done is commercialize this research, and this data center will help us do this.''

HEADLINE: Hopes for Greek Debt Talks Spur Late Rally

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market rallied in the last half-hour Tuesday, seizing on reports that suggested the Greek debt talks might be saved. Stocks finished flat after languishing in the red for most of the day.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 4.24 points, or 0.03 percent, to close at 12,878.28, about 12 points shy of its best finish this year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.27 points, or 0.09 percent, to close at 1,350.50. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.44 point, or 0.02 percent, to 2,931.83.
Stocks in the United States were weighed down as European finance chiefs decided to meet by teleconference Wednesday to discuss a second international bailout for the country. 
Athens failed to deliver on several demands made by its partners in the euro currency union. Greece needs a bailout of 130 billion euros by March 20 to avoid a default that could upset the world financial system.
Stocks were also hurt by a discouraging report on retail sales. Bank of America led the Dow lower, dropping 3.3 percent.
The Dow was down as much as 87 points at its low for the day. But the market found hope in reports quoting Greek government officials as saying party leaders would promise by Wednesday to adopt deep spending cuts and other reforms.
The stock market has been rising slowly but steadily most of this year, despite the unresolved debt crisis in Europe and a stalemate over domestic tax policy and benefits for the long-term unemployed.
For most of Tuesday, investors appeared to be waiting for more clarity on all those issues before sinking more money into stocks, said Colleen Supran, a principal at an investment adviser, Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough.
The late-day rally was a sign that investors expect the next round of Greek debt talks to resolve some of those questions. The talks have brought incremental and sometimes contradictory developments that have confused some investors.
The country has already passed some of the deep spending cuts its lenders were demanding, but it has not really satisfied anyone. Greeks have rioted, saying the cuts are too harsh, and Greece's neighbors have expressed concern that the cuts are not enough.
Downbeat economic news from Europe reinforced the danger. Greece said its economy shrank drastically at the end of last year, and Europe is expected to report Wednesday that the economies of the 17 countries that use the euro shrank 0.4 percent after growing 0.1 percent the quarter before.
News out of the United States was also disappointing. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month, but analysts were expecting 0.7 percent, and spending on auto sales was down. Automakers had reported higher sales, so Tuesday's numbers could mean they have had to offer more discounts to persuade customers to spend.
Yahoo fell 5 percent after reports that its plans to sell its Asian assets fell apart. The move was a critical strategy for turning around the troubled company.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber fell 5 percent after its fourth-quarter profits missed analysts' expectations.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 15/32, to 100 18/32, and the yield fell to 1.94 percent from 1.98 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Iran Leader Is Expected To Announce Atomic Steps

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Artin Afkhami contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Iran signaled on Tuesday that it had made further advances in the country's disputed nuclear energy program, announcing that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would reveal ''key nuclear achievements'' on Wednesday. An Iranian news agency said he was likely to proclaim that a new uranium enrichment plant built inside a mountain near the holy city of Qum was ''fully operational.''
The announcement appeared timed to convey the defiant message that the increasingly harsh Western economic sanctions imposed on Iran were having no effect on the government's determination to proceed with its nuclear program. The United States, Europe and Israel have all called the program a cover for Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons capability, an accusation that Iran denies. 
The new uranium enrichment plant, known as Fordo, has raised Western concerns because it is buried deep underground, making it more impervious to scrutiny. The Fordo plant also has elevated distrust of Iran because the plant's construction had been kept a secret until Western intelligence confirmation of its existence forced the Iranians to acknowledge the plant in September 2009, just as President Obama and European allies were announcing it. The Iranians said at the time that they had always intended to reveal the plant's existence.
Last month, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, confirmed that Iran had started uranium enrichment at Fordo.
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said that Mr. Ahmadinejad, who has made Iran's nuclear energy autonomy a signature issue, would ''unveil a number of key nuclear achievements on Wednesday to demonstrate the scientific capabilities of Iranian scientists to world nations.'' The agency did not further specify the nature of the achievements but said that ''Iranian scientists are never afraid of global arrogance and are determined to conquer peaks of success and progress.''
The semiofficial Mehr News Agency, quoting what it called informed sources, said it was ''more than likely that the president will announce that the Fordo enrichment facility has become fully operational.''
Fordo is Iran's second major uranium enrichment plant, with an older one in the central desert city of Natanz, first revealed in 2002. The Fordo plant takes uranium fuel that has been enriched to 4 percent purity at Natanz and further enriches it to 20 percent purity, a level that can make fuel for a research reactor in Tehran. But it is far easier to make bomb-grade fuel from the 20 percent purity concentration than from 4 percent, which has been one source of Western concern about Iran's ultimate intentions.
In a dispatch from Tehran, Russia's RIA Novosti News Agency reported that Iran's announcement on Wednesday would also include the insertion of its first domestically produced nuclear fuel rod into the Tehran research reactor in a ceremonial event attended by Mr. Ahmadinejad. The agency quoted Ali Bagheri, deputy chief of Iran's national security council, as the source of its information.
Ria Novosti said the insertion of such rods ''would make a significant step forward in Iran's nuclear program.''
Iran has often exaggerated its nuclear achievement claims as part of an effort to frustrate the sanctions effort and gain negotiating leverage with the West. But those negotiations have been suspended for more than a year, and the Iranians have sent mixed signals on whether, and when, they want to renew them.
Word of Iran's impending announcement came as tensions have escalated in particular with Israel, which regards Iran as an existential threat and has hinted at the possibility of a pre-emptive military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities to forestall its suspected ambitions.
Iran insists that the nuclear program is peaceful and it has accused Israel, a nuclear weapons state, of responsibility for a clandestine campaign aimed at sabotaging Iran's nuclear ambitions, including the assassinations of at least four Iranian scientists since 2010. Israel has counteraccused Iran in recent days of retaliatory plots aimed at Israeli targets in Georgia, India and Thailand, which Iran has denied.

HEADLINE: Juggling Act for Obama In Land of Big Wallets

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Election years always bring with them tough balancing efforts for presidential candidates trying to stay on the good side of powerful constituencies. But few can come close to the high-wire act that President Obama must perform in the next two days as he seeks to soothe Hollywood, that longtime bastion of fund-raising dollars for Democrats, while not alienating the high-tech industry that has itself surged to the top of the Obama money list.
First, the soothing. Mr. Obama is flying to Los Angeles on Wednesday to attend three fund-raisers, including one hosted by the actor Will Ferrell and Bradley Bell, a soap opera executive (''The Bold and the Beautiful''). The Foo Fighters will be on hand to perform; expect to see a number of other glitterati. 
Problem: Mr. Obama is in the doghouse with the show-business people, who are mad because the White House didn't support them on the antipiracy bill that got squashed in Congress in January after Google and other Internet high fliers descended on Washington to pressure the White House and Congress to oppose it in a standoff that left Hollywood reeling. But the president has also come to rely on cash from Hollywood, which contributed $9.2 million to his 2008 campaign coffers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Christopher J. Dodd, the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, created a stir -- and ruffled White House feathers -- just after the drubbing last month when he threatened to turn off the spigot, saying in an interview with Fox News: ''Those who count on quote Hollywood for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who's going to stand up for them.'' The White House acknowledged privately that his comment was not received warmly.
But, as if to prove Mr. Dodd's point, the Center for Responsive Politics reports that money for Mr. Obama from Hollywood was down last year, coming in at just $1.2 million, compared with $2.8 million during the same period in 2008.
White House officials have been doing some stroking of Hollywood to prevent a further erosion; Mr. Obama began the effort during his State of the Union speech last month when he threw the motion picture association a bone, promising to work to protect intellectual property in China. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. picked up the effort on Tuesday, using a lunchtime toast at the State Department with China's vice president, Xi Jinping, to further raise the intellectual property protection issue -- giving his boss the perfect entree to say at Mr. Ferrell's fund-raiser that the White House is fighting hard for Hollywood.
But at the same time, administration officials say they don't plan to reverse their position that major elements of the piracy legislation sought by Hollywood go too far.
On that battle, Google and the techies, so far, have been the clear-cut winner, and they will be able to thank Mr. Obama on Thursday when he heads to San Francisco for Part 2 of his balancing act: he is headlining a fund-raiser at the home of Nicola Miner, daughter of the Oracle co-founder Robert Miner.
And there, Mr. Obama must assure well-heeled attendees that he will take the interests of the new economy to heart. And the high-tech industry at the heart of that new economy has surpassed Hollywood in fund-raising muscle, not to mention overall contribution to the national economy.
In many ways, the fight puts Mr. Obama in a script that could be conceived only in Hollywood. An online piracy bill backed by the big studios was chugging along until it ran into a firestorm in January when Web powerhouses backed by Internet activists rallied opposition to the legislation through Internet blackouts. The White House had a few days earlier released a statement that some parts of the bill went too far, adding wind to the Web storm. By the time the dust cleared, lawmakers had backed off, and the old guard in Hollywood was fuming.
''It's the Rebellion versus the Empire,'' said Donnie Fowler, a Democratic consultant who was Al Gore's national field director in the 2000 campaign, with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook as Luke Skywalker and Mr. Dodd as Darth Vader.
''The problem for Hollywood here,'' Mr. Fowler said, ''is that they contribute only about 1/10th as much to the national economy'' as technology. ''Plus their stars and starlets can't match up against hundreds of thousands of netizens who go nuts when their Wikipedia and Google go dark for a day.''
Despite Mr. Dodd's comments about payback, some political observers note that at the end of the day, it is unlikely that Hollywood will suddenly turn to the Republicans.
''I think this is yet another large industry that has been a consistent supporter of Obama, that has to handle some disappointment from time to time,'' said Matt Bennett, a vice president at Third Way, a Democratic policy institute. ''They'll swallow hard and contribute.''
But they may not contribute quite so much.
Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Dodd's spokeswoman, did offer up a clarification of his remarks. Mr. Dodd, she said, ''was making the obvious point that people tend to support politicians whose views tend to match their own.''
Mr. Dodd himself has since been more circumspect. ''We hope the president will use this opportunity in both communities,'' he said in an e-mailed statement, ''to reiterate the important point that he made in the State of the Union: that online content theft is a problem, that it harms U.S. workers and U.S. business and that now is the time to come together to find meaningful solutions to protect American intellectual property from foreign criminals.''
He added that Hollywood and the tech industry ''need each other to succeed and grow.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Share Cautionary Tale of Trade Secret Theft With Chinese Official

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- China's next leader, Xi Jinping, may never have heard of American Superconductor Corporation before he arrived here Monday, but by the end of his visit United States officials hope to make the small Massachusetts wind-energy company an object lesson in the impact of Chinese trade secret theft on American business.
Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Massachusetts Democrat, plans to raise personally with Mr. Xi the case of a company that saw 70 percent of its business evaporate last year after a Chinese partner enticed one of its employees to steal the crown jewel of its technology. 
''It's a very clear and, in our judgment, egregious, palpable demonstration of the practice that we are deeply concerned about,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''but it's not the only one. There are so many things: cyberattacks, access-to-market issues, espionage, theft. These are major points of discussion between us and China.''
Both President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. warned Mr. Xi on Tuesday that they had been hearing more and more from United States businesses about intellectual property and trade secret theft, but they did not specifically mention American Superconductor. However, background material on the company's experience was included in briefing papers distributed before the arrival in Washington of Mr. Xi's delegation, and a top administration official said the Chinese were aware of United States frustration over the case.
With anger toward Chinese trade and industrial practices emerging as a major theme for the 2012 campaign season, American Superconductor's story seems ripe for the moment.
The facts are difficult to dispute, given the volume of evidence. Last March, China's Sinovel, the world's second largest wind turbine manufacturer, abruptly refused shipments of American Superconductor's wind turbine electrical systems and control software. The blow was devastating; Sinovel provided more than 70 percent of the firm's revenues.
The value of undelivered components on existing contracts exceeded $700 million, Daniel Patrick McGahn, the company's president and chief executive, told investors. Its share price plunged by more than 80 percent in six months.
Last summer, evidence emerged that Sinovel had promised $1.5 million to Dejan Karabasevic, a Serbian employee of American Superconductor in Austria.
Company officials say they found hundreds of e-mails and messages between senior Sinovel staff members and Mr. Karabasevic detailing the property to be stolen from the company, offering the money, and showing the actual transfer of the software. They even found signed contracts for the transaction.
Mr. Karabasevic was arrested, confessed to the crime, was convicted and is now serving time in an Austrian prison.
American Superconductor filed multiple lawsuits against Sinovel, seeking more than $1.2 billion in damages, cease and desist orders and copyright remedies.
In October, Sinovel countersued, saying it stopped accepting components because of quality problems and asking an arbitration commission to award it about $58 million for a breach of contract. The company is also demanding that American Superconductor pay its lawyers' fees, expenses and the cost of the arbitration.
This month, a court in Hainan, China, dismissed the smallest of the suits and said it should be heard by an arbitration commission in Beijing. The first arbitration hearing is scheduled for Feb. 24.
Company officials would not discuss their push for attention in Washington, but in a conference call with analysts in November, Mr. McGahn was open about his view of the case.
''While we acknowledge that this is a commercial matter, many have pointed to this case as an important litmus test for future energy cooperation between China and the West,'' he said, according to a transcript of the call.
Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation who has been leading a roundtable on such cases for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, called the case particularly egregious. But, he added, ''This is not a one-shot deal that affects one company in Massachusetts. It is unbelievably endemic.''
A lengthy paper by the foundation, due out in two weeks, will detail what Mr. Atkinson says has been the systematic pilfering of United States technology. ''The Chinese have U.S. companies over a barrel because of the pressure for short-term earnings. They've got renminbi dancing in their eyes,'' Mr. Atkinson said, referring to China's currency. ''But nine years later the Chinese are eating your lunch.''
The United States-China Business Council, which encourages economic cooperation, is more sanguine. Its survey of companies doing business in China found that only 18 percent said they had been asked to transfer technology as a condition for a business transaction. Three percent said they were able to scale back the request but did hand over some of their technology. About 2 percent said they met the request so they could stay in business in China.
But stories like American Superconductor's are rampant. Japanese and European companies like Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Siemens AG say they are competing against their once-junior Chinese partners and their own technology for the global high-speed rail business. Automobile writers have waxed indignantly about a new Chinese pickup truck that looks uncannily like the Ford F-150.
Such concerns are meshing with Mr. Obama's stern new push to make China play by the rules of international commerce. ''I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules,'' the president said during his State of the Union address in January, announcing the creation of what he has called a Trade Enforcement Union ''that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China.''
Mr. Atkinson is not convinced that the administration will hold to that pledge. ''They've got to stop pretending that this engagement that they're in right now with China is yielding results,'' he said. ''For every mole they whack, three more pop up. They need to vocally call out China on these egregious practices and say enough is enough.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Pitch on Energy

 BODY:
President Obama's new budget lays down a clear and much-needed challenge to the Republican House's large number of climate-change deniers and all of the Republican Party's many panderers to Big Oil. 
The budget calls for spending $6.7 billion on clean-energy programs in fiscal-year 2013 -- 13 percent more than Congress appropriated for this fiscal year. It also calls for an end to $4 billion in annual tax cuts and subsidies now enjoyed by the oil and gas industry.
Mr. Obama's proposals are essential for addressing global warming, reducing America's dependence on foreign oil and giving American workers a fighting chance in the global competition for clean-energy jobs.
Here are several programs included in the budget that the White House must fight for:
Increased financing for the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which underwrites a broad range of energy efficiency initiatives. The budget asks for $2.3 billion, up from $1.6 billion. Support for the department's advanced research program would rise from $275 million to $350 million.
Reauthorization of cash grants to wind, solar and other renewable energy companies. The program, first authorized in 2009, expired at the end of last year. It has been critical to keeping the solar industry competitive globally; another year of financing could create nearly 40,000 new jobs in the solar industry alone.
Extension of a vital production tax credit for the wind industry that is scheduled to expire this year. Without some assurance that the credit will continue, investments in wind turbines and other equipment will dry up.
The budget would also encourage the building of more energy efficient commercial buildings; promote tough new fuel-economy and greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles; and support the Interior Department's aggressive program of permitting new renewable energy projects on public lands. The Interior Department has approved more than two dozen such projects since 2009.
Last year, the five biggest oil companies racked up $137 billion in profits. They and their allies in Congress will fight to maintain their subsidies. Mr. Obama will have to push back. The cuts would not cost jobs or slow exploration. What they would do is save the government $4 billion to spend on the country's energy future.

HEADLINE: The Enablers

 BODY:
China, Russia and India see themselves as global leaders. So why have they been enabling two dangerous regimes, Syria and Iran, to continue on destructive paths?
On Tuesday, President Bashar al-Assad showed again his willingness to use brutal force to crush the pro-democracy opposition. He brushed aside stinging criticism by Navi Pillay, the top United Nations human rights official, and resumed the shelling of the city of Homs. The government has barred independent reporting for most of the yearlong unrest, but activists said rockets and tank shells had pummeled the city.
The violence has gotten worse in the 11 days since Russia and China vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution, sponsored by the Arab League, calling for a peaceful transfer of power. India was on the right side that day, voting for the resolution. But, for months, it had worked to block action. The resolution was no panacea, but, if it had passed, it would have sent a compelling message of international solidarity against Mr. Assad and the elites who keep him in power. 
Many Syrian deaths later, China may be reconsidering its stance. As an oil-hungry nation, it could not have failed to hear the rebuke issued to China and Russia on Friday by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia for opposing the resolution. ''We are going through scary days and unfortunately what happened at the United Nations is absolutely regrettable,'' he said.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China, speaking at a European-China summit meeting in Beijing, said, ''What is most urgent and pressing now is to prevent war and chaos'' in Syria. There is no evidence Russia has had similar second thoughts, but China is showing renewed interest in working with the Arab League. Beijing's shift could shame Moscow into reconsidering its support for Mr. Assad, and approving United Nations action, including sanctions.
China and India are also hampering the effort to ratchet up sanctions on Iran even as penalties imposed by the Security Council, the United States and the European Union appear to be affecting Iran's economy and politics. (The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is expected to announce on Wednesday that a new uranium enrichment plant is fully operational.)
China cut its purchases of Iranian oil this year and secured alternative supplies from Russia and Saudi Arabia. But it is still a major purchaser. India is also still buying and is now Iran's biggest oil customer. Because of American sanctions, these deals are not as lucrative as they could be for Iran.
The two countries' need for oil is real, but they should take full advantage of Saudi Arabia's offer to ramp up production to offset any losses from Iran. The International Energy Agency says there is enough oil supply worldwide to prevent a price shock from an embargo.
We do not know if sanctions can force Iran to give up its nuclear program or force it to negotiate a compromise deal. But the international community is finally at a moment when serious sanctions are in place and beginning to bite. Iran is finding it hard to pay for food imports and has resorted to bartering. It's time for Russia, China and India (which desperately wants a Security Council seat) to meet the test of leadership.
That means all three need to work to find ways to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions. For Russia and China, it means standing against Mr. Assad's siege on his people.

HEADLINE: $5 Billion Offered to Revisit Teacher Policies

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The Obama administration will propose a $5 billion competitive grant program to encourage states to overhaul the teaching profession, federal education officials said Tuesday, using its Race to the Top school improvement competition as a model. 
The new program, which needs Congressional approval, is part of President Obama's budget proposal and expands upon a call in his State of the Union address last month to give schools more resources ''to keep good teachers on the job and reward the best ones.''
Federal education officials said the program would seek to bring together state and district officials, union leaders, teachers and other educators to address a range of issues, among them tightening tenure rules, increasing salaries and improving professional development.
The secretary of education, Arne Duncan, will formally unveil the proposal at a meeting with teachers on Wednesday in Washington. He plans to enlist teachers from an Education Department fellowship program to help promote the proposal, called the Respect (Recognizing Educational Success, Professional Excellence and Collaborative Teaching) Project.
''Our goal is to work with teachers in rebuilding their profession and to elevate the teacher voice in federal, state and local education policy,'' Mr. Duncan said in a statement.
The new program would follow the general format of Race to the Top, with states designing their own proposals for teacher improvement and the federal Education Department selecting the most promising ones for multiyear funding. It would focus only on teaching, though, while the Race to the Top program had a broader agenda for kindergarten to 12th-grade education.
Officials said the new program, which has been in development for a year, was not a response to any current efforts to install teacher evaluation systems in specific states, including New York. They said it was intended to address the needs of experienced teachers and to make the teaching profession more appealing over all -- through salary increases, more selective teacher colleges and other measures -- to attract a new generation of teachers.
''We need to change society's views of teaching from the factory model of yesterday to the professional model of tomorrow, where teachers are revered as thinkers, leaders and nation-builders,'' Mr. Duncan said. ''No other profession carries a greater burden for securing our economic future.''
Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, the nation's largest union of teachers and education professionals with more than three million members, said he supported the Obama administration's wide-ranging approach to a systemic problem. He said he had long emphasized the need for attracting top-tier teaching candidates, maintaining competitive salaries and promoting professional development.
''It incorporates what we believe is necessary to transform the system,'' Mr. Van Roekel said. ''We need to do all of these things.''
Timothy Daly, president of the New Teacher Project, a nonprofit group that recruits new teachers for school districts, including New York City, said the use of a competitive grant program would encourage states to come up with innovative ideas.
''Teachers are treated as interchangeable parts -- they're not honored as highly skilled professionals -- and this has gone on for decades,'' he said. ''Everyone knows we have to make teaching better, but they have put their money where their mouth is.''

HEADLINE: With Edge, U.S. Greets China's Vice President

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and EDWARD WONG; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- China's vice president and likely future leader, Xi Jinping, embarked on a get-to-know-you tour of the United States on Tuesday, with a day of meetings from the White House to the Pentagon. But he was met with blunt criticism from his host, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who declared that the United States and China could cooperate ''only if the game is fair.''
Mr. Biden presented a long list of grievances -- ranging from theft of intellectual property and human rights abuses to China's refusal to back United Nations sanctions against Syria -- during a toast at a State Department lunch, striking a sober and businesslike mood in a stately dining room decorated with pink and red roses for Valentine's Day.
''As Americans, we welcome competition,'' Mr. Biden said as the Chinese vice president listened with a poker face. ''But cooperation, as you and I have spoken about, can only be mutually beneficial if the game is fair.'' 
On the list of American concerns, Mr. Biden said, were China's artificially depressed currency and conditions imposed by the Chinese that require foreign companies to turn over technology in return for doing business in China. He raised the issue of jailed Chinese dissidents and said about Syria, ''We strongly disagreed with China and Russia's veto of a resolution against the unconscionable violence being perpetrated'' by the government.
Mr. Xi's toast -- a standard diplomatic script that repeated Chinese demands for ''mutual respect'' and urged the United States to avoid protectionism -- added to the sense of an American lecture, as did the ensuing translation of Mr. Biden's remarks, which stretched out his points in the pin-drop silence. Mr. Xi stood by with clasped hands and smiled. There were moments, though, when the room broke up in laughter at some of Mr. Biden's quips.
The United States has been stiffening its language toward China in recent months, most notably in President Obama's visit to Asia last November, and again during his State of the Union address last month, when he challenged China to play by the same economic rules as other countries.
But Mr. Biden's remarks were a vivid reminder that Mr. Xi's visit comes during an election year, when the White House is eager to appeal to manufacturing workers who view China's trade policy with deep suspicion. It also wants to avoid being painted as weak on China by Republican challengers.
Some of Mr. Biden's message echoed the meeting Mr. Xi had with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office, an administration official said. The president pressed him on trade practices and China's currency, as well as on Syria, though he thanked China for its support of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program.
In a brief appearance with Mr. Xi, Mr. Obama was more diplomatic, though he, too, said he wanted to make sure ''everybody is working by the same rules of the road when it comes to the world economic system.''
Balancing domestic political concerns over China with the desire to cultivate relations with a future Chinese leader was never going to be easy. Part of the challenge, officials said, was that the Chinese government did not want Mr. Xi, who is facing his own delicate political transition, to be exposed to questions. So it fell to Mr. Biden to register America's complaints in the somewhat incongruous setting of a Champagne toast.
''How do you have a visit where we don't get into a tit-for-tat with the man who is going to be running China for the next 10 years, which is something we don't want to do, but is tougher to avoid during an election year?'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China policy maker in the White House. ''Both sides are aware of that risk.''
Administration officials had earlier put particular emphasis on Mr. Xi's stop at the Pentagon, where he met with Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey. Mr. Xi holds the title of vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission, but remains a civilian official, making his visit to the Pentagon unusual, officials said.
China and the United States have had a strained military relationship, with China balking at Mr. Obama's reassertion of the American military presence in Asia. But the Pentagon said Mr. Xi and Mr. Panetta reaffirmed the need for a ''healthy, stable and reliable military-to-military relationship.''
Mr. Xi's trip also comes at a delicate moment in Chinese politics. Except for Mr. Xi and one other senior official, Li Keqiang, the members of the most powerful policy-making group in the Communist Party, the nine-member Standing Committee of the Politburo, are expected to leave their posts in the fall. The selection of their replacements is a secretive process.
So a kind of court intrigue is the backdrop for Mr. Xi's trip, and even Mr. Xi, 58, does not have his position locked up yet. He is expected to replace President Hu Jintao, who has fulfilled the understood limit of 10 years in office. But a serious misstep could derail his political ambitions, which have been carefully nurtured from his first political job in Beijing as an aide to an army general to stints in top party posts in the booming provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang.
Above all, it was economic issues that American officials were keen to address with Mr. Xi. After visiting the Pentagon, he showed up with Mr. Biden at the United States Chamber of Commerce to preside over a meeting of more than 20 business leaders from both countries. Outside, hundreds of protesters held up signs and flags and shouted for the Chinese to end their repressive policies in Tibet and Xinjiang.
Inside, Mr. Biden again reiterated his desire that ''the rules of the game are understood, agreed upon and followed.''
Mr. Xi acknowledged the economic concerns and said: ''The Chinese side has taken steps to address them and will continue to do so. We hope the U.S. side will take steps to address Chinese concerns.'' That included lifting restrictions on high-tech exports to China, he said.
Cheng Li, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said: ''I think we should remember that he has two different audiences. One is the international audience, the U.S. audience, and the other is the domestic audience. For him, the domestic audience is more important.''
Mr. Xi's visit began causing an uproar in parts of Washington on Monday, when he flew into town and attended a dinner whose guests included Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft. That day, hundreds of people gathered outside the White House to denounce Chinese policies in Tibet. Several protesters were arrested after they unfurled a large banner at Arlington Memorial Bridge that said, ''Tibet Will Be Free.'' Some held up photos of Tibetans who had self-immolated in recent months out of frustration at Chinese rule; the most recent act was by a monk, Lobsang Gyatso, 19, on Monday.
Other dissident voices have been making plans to be heard. Among them is Yu Jie, a prominent writer who left China for Washington with his family last month because he feared for his life, he said. Mr. Yu said he had been tortured by security officers and had lived under house arrest.
''I want to express my opinion freely now that I'm in a free country,'' Mr. Yu said in an interview.
Like several prominent Chinese dissidents, Mr. Yu was a member of an unofficial Christian church in China.
Suzan D. Johnson Cook, the United States ambassador for international religious freedom, was denied a visa to visit China earlier this month, Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican, said Tuesday at a Congressional hearing on two Christian dissidents imprisoned in China, Gao Zhisheng and Guo Quan.

HEADLINE: Support Is Found for Birth Control Coverage and Gay Unions

BYLINE: By MARJORIE CONNELLY; Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Despite the deep divide between some religious leaders and government officials over contraceptives, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll found most voters support the new federal directive that health insurance plans provide coverage for birth control. 
In addition, most voters said they favored some type of legal recognition for same-sex couples, at a time when the New Jersey Legislature is set to vote on gay marriage and after a federal appellate court ruled that Proposition 8's ban on same-sex marriage in California was unconstitutional.
While same-sex marriage and coverage for contraceptives have generated significant debate this month, the poll suggests that voters do not place social issues high on their agenda. When asked to name one issue that presidential candidates should discuss, most voters, including Republicans who described themselves as primary voters, mentioned an economic problem, like unemployment or the budget deficit. Few said they wanted to hear the candidates talk about abortion or gay marriage, for example.
On contraceptive coverage, 65 percent of voters in the poll said they supported the Obama administration's requirement that health insurance plans cover the cost of birth control, and 59 percent, said the health insurance plans of religiously affiliated employers should cover the cost of birth control.
In a compromise last week, President Obama said insurance companies could shoulder the costs required under the new federal health care law, but the Conference of Catholic Bishops and other religious leaders continue to oppose the rule.
A majority of Catholic voters in the poll were at odds with the church's official stance, agreeing with most other voters that religiously affiliated employers should offer health insurance that provides contraception. Jennifer Davison, 38, a Catholic from Lomita, Calif., agrees with the federal requirement. ''My opinion is that it is a personal issue rather than a religious issue,'' she said in a follow-up interview.
Unlike Catholics, white evangelical Christian voters were more divided, with half objecting to requiring the health insurance plans of religious employers to cover contraceptives; 43 percent supported it. ''It is a religious issue with me,'' said Jessica Isner, 22, an evangelical Christian from Elkins, W. Va. ''I believe that providing birth control is O.K. if the hospital is not religiously affiliated.''
Gay marriage is another debate in which the Catholic laity disagrees with church doctrine. More than two-thirds of Catholic voters supported some sort of legal recognition of gay couples' relationships: 44 percent favored marriage, and 25 percent preferred civil unions. Twenty-four percent said gay couples should receive no legal recognition.
Again, white evangelical Christian voters expressed more conservative views. A majority said there should not be legal recognition of a gay relationship, while 18 percent said they should be allowed to marry and 25 percent supported civil unions.
The nationwide telephone poll included 1,064 registered voters, of whom 226 were Catholic and 238 were white evangelical Christians. The margins of sampling error are plus or minus three percentage points for all voters, plus or minus seven points for Catholics, and plus or minus six points for white evangelical Christians.

HEADLINE: As It Improves, Economy Lifts Obama in Poll

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and ALLISON KOPICKI; Dalia Sussman, Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama's political standing is rising along with voters' optimism that the economy is getting better, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, a shift that coincides with continued Republican disquiet over the field of candidates seeking to replace him.
Consecutive months of job growth, the bullish stock market and improving consumer demand appear to be benefiting -- for now, at least -- a president who stated outright three years ago that his chances for a second term would depend on his ability to persuade the country that its economy was on the mend by this very month.
In what could be a turning point, the percentage of people who said they believed the economic outlook was improving is now greater, by double digits, than the percentage of those who said they believed it was getting worse, a reversal from a low point in September, when pessimists outnumbered optimists by more than three to one.
Showing steady improvement since early December, Mr. Obama's approval rating has reached the 50 percent mark in The Times/CBS News poll -- an important baseline in presidential politics and his highest approval rating since May 2010 (excepting the brief bump he received after Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011). 
For the first time since the election season began in earnest in the late summer, as many Democratic voters as Republicans said they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting in the 2012 presidential election. That would appear to wipe out the ''enthusiasm gap'' that promised to help Republicans greatly next fall.
Their combative contest remains in flux, with former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania now in a statistical tie with Mitt Romney after Mr. Santorum's victories in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri. Mr. Santorum's sharp rise in the polls underscores some of Mr. Romney's perceived weaknesses, with voters saying that Mr. Santorum shares their values and that they connect to his blue-collar economic message.
Polls can capture only a specific moment in time. To the extent that Mr. Obama's improved standing is tied to the economy, it is tenuous. Grim economic news continues to trickle out of Europe. Iranian saber rattling is increasing the sense of instability in the Middle East. Even the White House warns that jobless numbers are as likely to rise in the coming months as they are to dip.
More people said they disapproved of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy, 50 percent, than said they approved, 44 percent. And he received poor marks on his handling of the federal budget deficit, with 59 percent of poll respondents expressing disapproval.
Mr. Obama led all four remaining Republican presidential candidates in theoretical one-on-one competitions, including the presumed front-runner, Mr. Romney But the president's general election prospects could change drastically when the opposition finally settles on a nominee, who will most likely win an immediate boost of support and enthusiasm, if history is a guide.
Yet the poll results show how hard it is to predict how quickly the Republicans will reach that juncture.
Eight nominating contests, about 20 closely watched debates and several months of heavy state-by-state campaigning have seemingly failed to settle a restive Republican electorate that is highly motivated in its goal of limiting Mr. Obama to a single term but shows lingering signs of nervous indecision about whom it wants to assign the task of taking him on.
Republican primary voters indicated they were less than satisfied with their choices, with more than 6 in 10 saying they wished there were more candidates to choose from, and nearly the same number saying they could change their minds. The instability of the Republican presidential race is now redounding to the benefit of Mr. Santorum, whose new strength points up the persistent weaknesses that Mr. Romney has with those who describe themselves as evangelical Christians, supportive of the Tea Party or conservative, all of whom favored Mr. Santorum in the latest poll.
Republicans who described themselves as primary and caucus voters still overwhelmingly view Mr. Romney as the candidate best equipped to defeat Mr. Obama, but that was not the most important quality for them in the poll; it ranked far behind ''strong moral character.''
That mood has appeared to help Mr. Santorum, who frequently promotes his family life with his wife, Karen, and their seven children, and has long had a reputation for his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage.
''Rick Santorum seems by and large the most truly conservative candidate, instead of just portraying himself as a conservative,'' Jonathan Reed, 52, of Sylvester, Ga., said in a follow-up interview.
But Republican primary voters also chose economic issues as paramount over social issues, and they viewed Mr. Santorum as the candidate who would most help middle-class Americans. In addition, more than two-thirds of them said his political philosophy was just right, not too conservative or too liberal.
Conversely, nearly a third of Republican primary voters said Mr. Romney would favor the rich, roughly the same number that said he was not conservative enough, a perception that could nonetheless help him in a general election: In theoretical contests against Mr. Obama, he performs best among the Republican field.
But the poll showed that even Mr. Romney would lose to Mr. Obama by six percentage points among all registered voters if the election were held today. The past couple of months appear to have greatly harmed Mr. Romney's standing with independent voters, who favored him over Mr. Obama in January by 46 percent to 39 percent but now favor Mr. Obama over Mr. Romney by 49 percent to 38 percent.
Mr. Romney does have an apparent opening against Mr. Santorum. Nearly half of all registered voters said they had not yet formed an opinion about him, which Mr. Romney's team is likely to exploit by trying to define him in negative terms in the lead-up to remaining primaries and caucuses. And only one in seven Republican primary voters said Mr. Santorum had the best chance of defeating Mr. Obama.
Roughly the same number named Newt Gingrich, who was in a statistical tie for third place with Representative Ron Paul of Texas, though both lagged far behind Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney.
The nationwide poll was based on telephone interviews conducted Feb. 8 to Feb. 13 on land lines and cellphones with 1,197 adults, including 331 self-described Republican primary or caucus voters, and has margins of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all adults and five percentage points for Republican voters.
Mr. Romney still did well in the poll when it came to his No. 1 campaign theme of the economy. More than 7 in 10 Republican primary voters said they were very or somewhat confident that Mr. Romney, who once headed the investment firm Bain Capital, could be trusted to make the right decisions about the economy.
''I think with his background of making money he can make the nation some money,'' said Daniel Wiechart, 21, of Danville, Ky., who is preparing to begin law school. ''He exudes an economically responsible aura, if you will.''

HEADLINE: Spousal Support: Gingrich's New Tactic: His Wife

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- As Newt Gingrich looks to reboot his struggling campaign, he has turned to an ally who has always been there but in an almost entirely mute and, to the public, mysterious role: his wife, Callista.
Mrs. Gingrich delivered a three-minute introduction of her husband at a conservative conference in Washington last week, including humanizing details about the contents of his Kindle (''an entire library'') and his golf game (''he gets in and out of more sand traps than anyone I have ever seen''). 
And on Tuesday, Mrs. Gingrich took to the microphone again, speaking to the San Diego County Federation of Republican Women during a break from a fund-raising swing her husband is making through California.
The campaign clearly hopes that Mrs. Gingrich will soften her husband's sharp edges and perhaps prompt voters to take another look at him, even as he has fallen far behind Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in recent polls. Although Mrs. Gingrich is a familiar figure posed beside her husband during his speeches, she has been one of the least heard-from spouses in the Republican presidential field. In December she recorded a holiday greeting with her husband for a television ad in Iowa, and she has made a video for the campaign's Web site promoting music education.
But voters know little about Mrs. Gingrich other than that she is her husband's third, much younger wife -- a circumstance that has led to speculation that she remains silent because the campaign does not want to call attention to the marriage. But absent hearing from Mrs. Gingrich herself, a void has been filled by former campaign aides, who -- speaking anonymously in the press -- portray Mrs. Gingrich in a sometimes harsh light.
Now the campaign seems to have overcome earlier hesitations and is unfettering Mrs. Gingrich, who still seems a bit shy in public.
''I enjoy meeting people, I enjoy speaking,'' she told reporters after her appearance here, which was in the somewhat incongruous setting of a Smashburger fast-food restaurant. ''This is a good time to do it. I'm looking forward to it.''
She appeared before a group of about 30 women at a quickly organized gathering, held after a breakfast fund-raiser at a nearby country club for her husband. Awaiting her arrival, the women signed a Valentine's Day card for Mrs. Gingrich.
Her talk was billed as a discussion of ''American exceptionalism,'' but it had none of the politicized edge that phrase has acquired for Mr. Gingrich, who accuses President Obama of not believing that the United States has a leading role among nations.
As her audience sat at a row of tables and booths before the lunch crowd arrived, Mrs. Gingrich stood at a wooden lectern, in a blue suit and a gold necklace, reading from notes. There was a slight nervousness in her voice.
''Over the last few months, the campaign has been wild,'' she said. ''We have been on a real roller-coaster ride as front-runners seem to come and go.''
Her remarks were a mix of light personal details and praise for civic virtues.
''One of the things I've enjoyed most on this campaign is the chance to meet so many wonderful Americans across this country,'' she said.
In her most pointed political comment, she said, ''Our only opponent is Barack Obama, and we are committed to removing him from the White House,'' a line that drew light applause.
Winding up, she said: ''Thank you for the many contributions each of you make to support conservative leaders and policies. I truly appreciate that opportunity to be with you here today.''
And then she was finished, less than five minutes after beginning. ''Let's do some meet and greet,'' a host said. Her audience lined up to shake her hand and pose for photos.
Joan Pernicano, 64, a restaurant owner, said she was still deciding between Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum, with the candidates' positions on the economy and abortion her chief concerns.
''I thought maybe it would be a little deeper, there'd be a little more,'' she said of Mrs. Gingrich's remarks.
''She's very, very, well spoken; she should speak more,'' said Lynn Ann Reagan, the president of the women's group.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Romney Defends His Auto Bailout Stance to Detroit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit, and Jeremy W. Peters from New York.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney on Tuesday moved to shore up support in his boyhood home of Michigan, preparing a new television commercial and writing an opinion article defending his 2008 position to let the auto industry go bankrupt.
The campaign's new focus on Michigan, which will hold its Republican primary on Feb. 28, comes as new national polls, including a New York Times/CBS News survey, show Rick Santorum surging to a tie with Mr. Romney.
Mr. Romney's new advertisement, called ''Growing Up,'' shows him driving a car and reminiscing about life in Detroit. He criticizes President Obama and concludes by saying: ''I want to make Michigan stronger and better. Michigan's been my home, and this is personal.'' 
The commercial is to begin running on Wednesday, according to a Republican who tracks media spending and who said the advertising cost a modest $178,000 on the NBC station in Detroit.
A ''super PAC'' backing Mr. Romney also began an advertisement in Michigan attacking Mr. Santorum for voting as a senator to raise the debt limit, to increase spending, to request earmarks and to let convicted felons vote. ''Rick Santorum. Big Spender. Washington Insider,'' proclaims the ad, from Restore Our Future.
Mr. Romney also sought to highlight his connections to Michigan in the opinion article published in The Detroit News on Tuesday, while also deflecting potential criticism about his opposition to federal loans to rescue the auto industry.
Noting that he was born in Detroit and that his father was president of the American Motors car company in the 1950s, Mr. Romney wrote that he was 7 years old when he got his ''love of cars and chrome and fins and roaring motors'' from his father.
But the main message of the piece was to defend an Op-Ed article Mr. Romney wrote just two weeks after the nation chose Barack Obama as president in 2008. Published in The New York Times, it had the simple headline ''Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.''
Mr. Romney's explanation is a complicated one, especially given the industry's remarkable turnaround in the last three years.
Mr. Romney says he always favored what he calls a ''managed bankruptcy'' for the auto companies that would have allowed the businesses to restructure and emerge stronger than before. He criticized Mr. Obama for choosing what he called a ''bailout'' of the industry that benefited big labor unions.
But Mr. Romney next acknowledges that General Motors and Chrysler did in fact go through a ''managed bankruptcy'' at the urging of Mr. Obama's administration -- and he takes credit for being the one to have the idea first.
''Managed bankruptcy may sound like a death knell. But in fact, it is a way for a troubled company to restructure itself rapidly, entering and leaving the courtroom sometimes in weeks or months instead of years, and then returning to profitable operation,'' Mr. Romney wrote in the piece. ''The course I recommended was eventually followed.''
Officials in Mr. Obama's administration, and many economists in both parties, scoff at Mr. Romney's suggestion that a managed bankruptcy was possible without the billions of dollars in government aid to the car companies. They say Wall Street and private equity firms in early 2009 were in no position to lend the kind of money that the companies needed to manage the bankruptcy process in an orderly fashion.
They also point out a fact that Mr. Romney neglects to mention in Tuesday's opinion article: that it was the Bush administration that made the initial loans to General Motors and Chrysler, starting the ''bailouts'' that Mr. Romney derides.
In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Jennifer M. Granholm, a former Democratic governor of Michigan, accused Mr. Romney of ''stabbing us in the back'' despite being from Michigan.
''I think he should say: 'I'm sorry. The president was right,' '' Ms. Granholm said. ''Instead, he is justifying what he said, which turned out to be a terribly wrong piece of advice.''
Democrats also accuse Mr. Romney of trying to rewrite the history of his earlier positions.
In the first paragraph of his 2008 opinion article, Mr. Romney made an unmistakable prediction: ''If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye. It won't go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed.''
In fact, General Motors announced last month that it had earned $8 billion in profits in 2011 and had set a target of $10 billion in profits for 2012. Chrysler this month reported a profit of $225 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Mr. Romney now argues that the auto industry would be even better off if it had not received government money. And he accuses Mr. Obama of ''crony capitalism'' because the Chrysler bailout included provisions that gave the United Auto Workers an ownership stake in the company after it emerged from bankruptcy.
Mr. Romney called that an ''$85 billion sweetheart deal disguised as a rescue plan'' and argued that it was to benefit the unions, which were the president's political supporters. He wrote that the federal government should ''divest itself'' of its remaining ownership position in General Motors and should turn the proceeds ''over to the nation's taxpayers.''
In fact, the restructuring of Chrysler during the bankruptcy process did involve agreements with the United Automobile Workers and the administration that led to a much smaller union, plant closings and a two-tier wage system that has helped to trim costs. The company also trimmed health care costs that had long been called an impediment to profitability.
Officials for Mr. Obama's administration have long argued that such concessions from the unions were possible only because of the leverage the government wielded through the bailout and bankruptcy process.

HEADLINE: Conservatives Sowed Idea of Health Care Mandate, Only to Spurn It Later

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
It can be difficult to remember now, given the ferocity with which many Republicans assail it as an attack on freedom, but the provision in President Obama's health care law requiring all Americans to buy health insurance has its roots in conservative thinking.
The concept that people should be required to buy health coverage was fleshed out more than two decades ago by a number of conservative economists, embraced by scholars at conservative research groups, including the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, and championed, for a time, by Republicans in the Senate.
The individual mandate, as it is known, was seen then as a conservative alternative to some of the health care approaches favored by liberals -- like creating a national health service or requiring employers to provide health coverage.
''In 1993, in fighting 'Hillarycare,' virtually every conservative saw the mandate as a less dangerous future than what Hillary was trying to do,'' Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, said at a debate in December, casting his past support of a mandate as an antidote to the health care overhaul proposed by Hillary Rodham Clinton during her husband's administration. 
Since then the politics of health care have grown more twisted and tangled than the two snakes entwined around the staff in a caduceus, which is sometimes used as a symbol of medicine. It is now Republicans and conservatives who oppose the individual mandate, arguing that it is unconstitutional, while Democrats, who were long resistant to it, are its biggest defenders.
Democratic health care analysts have been taken aback by the speed with which Republicans have made the individual mandate a symbol of socialist totalitarianism to much of their base.
''I noted the irony of a Republican idea being the source of Republican opposition,'' said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group, who served in the Obama administration and as the policy director for Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign in 2008. And longtime supporters of the mandate, who for years had believed the biggest obstacle to enacting it was attracting Democratic support, saw Democrats become its last supporters. ''It totally flipped,'' said Peter Harbage, a health care analyst who has advised Democratic and Republican supporters of individual mandates.
These shifting political winds have become a major factor in the presidential campaign. Mitt Romney is often challenged by Republican rivals about the health care law he signed as the governor of Massachusetts, which also contains an individual mandate. Mr. Gingrich is often asked about his years of support for the idea. And Mr. Obama -- who opposed the individual mandate four years ago as a candidate, but came to accept it as president -- is now waiting to see whether the Supreme Court upholds the idea or strikes it down.
Some conservatives originally saw the individual mandate as a way to make certain that uninsured people who became ill or were injured -- but were still entitled by law to medical treatment -- did not push the cost of their care onto others.
''If a young man wrecks his Porsche and has not had the foresight to obtain insurance, we may commiserate, but society feels no obligation to repair his car,'' Stuart Butler, a distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said in a 1989 lecture on how to ensure affordable health care for all Americans. ''But health care is different. If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance.''
Part of Mr. Butler's solution back then? ''Mandate all households to obtain adequate insurance.''
But Democrats were leery of the idea. In 1993, when President Bill Clinton put forward the broad outlines of his health care proposal in a speech to the National Governors Association in Tulsa, Okla., he called for requiring employers to buy coverage for their workers. The idea of an individual mandate, he noted in the speech, ''has found some favor in the United States Congress, primarily among Republicans, but not exclusively, because it has the appeal of not imposing a business mandate, which has a bad sound to it.''
To combat President Clinton's proposal, a large group of Republican senators, including the minority leader at the time, Bob Dole, and several who are still in office, proposed a bill that would have required individuals, and not employers, to buy insurance.
After Mr. Clinton's health care proposal died, Democrats began searching for more politically palatable solutions.
But there was still little Democratic support for an individual mandate, as Senator John Breaux of Louisiana found when he proposed one several years later. But officials, centrist policy groups and even liberal research organizations slowly warmed to the idea.
When Senator John Edwards sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, he proposed an insurance mandate for children, but not adults. The politics of the mandate really began to change when Massachusetts enacted its health care law. That effort united Mr. Romney, a Republican, with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a liberal stalwart who got involved in part to protect the state's share of federal Medicaid money, and Democratic lawmakers on Beacon Hill. All wound up supporting a plan with an individual mandate.
''Democrats, based on the Massachusetts experience, became much more comfortable with the idea of an individual mandate,'' said John McDonough, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who was a health care advocate in the state at the time.
When Mr. Edwards ran for president again in 2008, his health plan called for an individual mandate for all. Mrs. Clinton followed suit. But Mr. Obama resisted the idea as a candidate, calling for a mandate for children only.
But as president, Mr. Obama changed his mind.
Many conservatives changed their minds too, however. Some of the Republican senators who once supported versions of the individual mandate railed against Mr. Obama's plan. Mr. Romney, despite signing a similar plan into law in Massachusetts, has made a pledge to try to ''repeal Obamacare'' central to his presidential campaign.
Mr. Butler, of the Heritage Foundation, said in an interview that his views had evolved over the years. He said that he now believed that near-universal coverage could be achieved without a mandate, and added that the mandate he once supported was for basic catastrophic coverage, not comprehensive insurance.
The Heritage Foundation has taken pains to distance itself from its past support of an individual mandate: it wrote a court amicus brief noting its change of heart, and Mr. Butler wrote an op-ed article in USA Today this month headlined ''Don't blame Heritage for 'ObamaCare' mandate.''
But not all of the early conservative proponents have changed their minds. Mark V. Pauly, a professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who was a co-author of an influential 1991 paper that called for an individual mandate, said that he was discouraged to see so many Republicans shunning an idea they had once supported.
''My view was, I still agree with myself,'' he said in an interview. ''And I was pleased that this thought was getting bipartisan appeal where the whole thing was declared dead on arrival by Democrats 18 years before.''

HEADLINE: Britain Defends Its Austerity Measures

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British government came under more criticism on Tuesday for its far-reaching austerity program after Moody's Investors Service warned that the country could be next in line to lose its AAA credit rating.
The opposition Labour Party and some business groups saw the threatened downgrade as evidence that the government's deep spending cuts were hindering growth and called for a change of course. George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, defended the cuts and said the idea that he had abandoned growth was ''nonsense.'' 
''This warning from Moody's comes as something of a reality check to the U.K.,'' said David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas in London. ''It serves as a reminder that the country does not have much room for any fiscal slippage if it is to keep its top credit rating.''
Moody's also lowered its outlook for the Austrian and French economies to negative and cut the debt ratings of six other European countries, including Spain, Italy and Portugal.
Investors seemed to brush off the latest downgrades, however. Borrowing costs for Italy and Spain dropped Tuesday in successful debt auctions. Italy raised about 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in a bond sale that was 1.4 times oversubscribed, and at a substantially lower rate than the previous sale. Spain sold 5.4 billion euros' worth of 12-month and 18-month bills, also paying less than at an earlier auction.
The warning on the British economy surprised the Treasury, which had repeatedly said that its ability to maintain its top credit score -- even after the United States and France lost theirs -- was an endorsement of the belt-tightening it began soon after the coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats took office in May 2010.
Moody's cited ''the weaker macroeconomic environment, which will challenge the government's efforts'' to reduce the deficit, and ''the high risk of further shocks within the currency union'' as the main reasons for the change in Britain's outlook. Mr. Osborne, who is expected to give his annual update on the economy next month, has already had to push back his initial goal of eliminating the budget deficit by 2015.
Moody's said that Britain's ''outstanding debt places it amongst the most heavily indebted of its AAA-rated peers, alongside the United States and France, whose AAA ratings also carry a negative outlook.'' The two countries, along with Austria, have already lost their AAA status with Standard & Poor's, another rating agency.
Moody's supported Britain's efforts to reduce the deficit but noted that slower economic growth could threaten such plans.
Ed Balls, the Labour Party's candidate for the top Treasury post, said he ''consistently argued that the chancellor's gamble -- raising taxes and cutting spending too far and too fast -- would backfire because without a balanced plan that promotes jobs and economic growth, the government will not succeed in getting the deficit down.''
''It is clear,'' he added, ''that austerity around the world alone doesn't work.''
Mr. Osborne disagreed and said that Moody's announcement was ''a reality check for the whole political system that Britain has to deal with its debt.''

HEADLINE: Tentative Deal Preserves Cut In Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Members of a House-Senate committee charged with writing a measure to extend a payroll tax reduction and provide added unemployment benefits reached a tentative agreement Tuesday evening, with Republicans and Democrats claiming a degree of political victory in a fight with significant election-year implications.
One day after House Republican leaders said they would offer a bill to extend the $100 billion payroll tax rollback for millions of working Americans without requiring spending cuts to pay for it, the Congressional negotiators struck a broader deal that would also extend unemployment benefits and prevent a large cut in reimbursements to doctors who accept Medicare. 
A vote on the measure would most likely happen by Friday, when Congress is set to recess for a week. But senior aides warned that negotiators still had to sign off formally on the agreement and that obstacles could surface given the long-running tensions over the measure.
Democrats, elated after winning the Republican tax concession after months of clashes, said they had also been able to beat back new conditions that Republicans had wanted on jobless pay, like requiring beneficiaries to seek high school equivalency degrees, and had found middle ground on Republican attempts to significantly reduce the number of weeks in which the unemployed could draw benefits.
Republicans did make Democrats pay for the added unemployment benefits through changes to federal pensions, aides said. More important, Republican leaders and their advisers said that they had removed an election-year hammer from the hands of President Obama and Congressional Democrats, depriving them of the ability to keep pounding on the idea that Republicans were resistant to tax cuts for the middle class.
The deal also appeared to solidify Speaker John A. Boehner's shift in leadership strategy, signaled at the end of the last year when he forced a short-term payroll tax extension on his fractious rank and file. The agreement on Tuesday suggested that he would spend the balance of the year doing what he thought was best for his party and its chances of holding on to the House, and less time fretting over whether the most conservative corner of his members were with him. In fact, the plan emerging from the negotiating committee could require the acquiescence of House Democrats to secure the 218 votes it needs for passage.
The tentative accord emerged after Mr. Obama earlier on Tuesday welcomed signs of progress in extending a payroll tax cut but urged Americans to continue to press their representatives to approve the tax break quickly, before it expires at the end of the month.
''As you guys know, you can't take anything for granted here in Washington -- until my signature is actually on it,'' the president said in an appearance in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. He was apparently referring to last December, when Senate Republicans initially agreed to a two-month payroll extension only to have House Republicans balk. The president ended up winning that fight after House Republicans buckled under political pressure and an onslaught of calls and e-mails from constituents.
Republicans said that the House leadership decided to capitulate on paying for the tax cut because it appeared that Democrats were going to hold out in the talks and blame Republicans for the impasse if there were no resolution.
''I can understand why the House leadership, exasperated with the lack of progress in the conference, is looking around at other alternatives,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, told reporters on Tuesday.
While many rank-and-file members said they needed more time to study the agreement, and leaders in both parties preferred to stay mum until they were ready to make formal announcements, Democrats were privately crowing Tuesday night that the deal reflected far more of their priorities than those of their counterparts. Republicans, acknowledging that there were few substantive policy victories to claim, said they believed that it was worth it to avoid a protracted fight over benefits that together touch the lives of nearly every American.
''Leadership clearly has a positive desire to put this behind us,'' said Representative Bill Huizenga, Republican of Michigan, who left a meeting of House Republicans looking grim, ''and are not as open to listening to the rest of the conference to find out what the conference thinks.''
But he, like some other Republicans, seemed resigned to approval of the agreement. ''We're going to get an extension of the middle-class tax cut,'' said Representative Michael G. Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, shrugging slightly. It was also clear that there were many members who would not support the measure. ''I know enough to know I'm not voting for it,'' said Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah.
The highest priority for Democrats beside the payroll tax cut was to have a significant extension of unemployment benefits. Republicans wanted to move down from the maximum of 99 weeks to 59 weeks, while Senate Democrats proposed 93 weeks. In the tentative deal, the maximum number of weeks would be 73, a level that would be largely reserved for states with high unemployment. That extension will be paid for with the pension change for federal workers coupled with the sale of radio spectrum licenses and other smaller producers of revenue.
The piece of the deal that would protect doctors from a huge cut in Medicare reimbursement fees would do so through cuts in the new prevention and public health fund established in the health care law, combined with reducing help for hospitals with bad debt and other health-care-related spending trims.
The agreement was almost totally brokered by the two top tax writers in Congress, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan.

HEADLINE: Cash-Back Credit Card Rewards Offers Going Strong

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: More credit card issuers offer cash-back rewards of at least 1 percent of spending. 

 BODY:
Debit-card reward programs may be fizzling, but cash-back credit card rewards are going strong, a new analysisfrom Bankrate.com finds.
In fact, cash-back credit card rewards improved "modestly" over the past year, according to Bankrate, which looked at 50 credit cards, from 19 large issuers, in early January. Roughly half of the cards included in the study pay 1 percent cash back, up from 44 percent in last year's study. And some even pay more than 1 percent.
(Higher rewards, though, are often limited to certain categories of purchases or have special conditions. Capital One's No Hassle Cash Rewards credit card, for instance, offers 2 percent back on gas and groceries, and 1 percent on everything else. And the Fidelity Investment Rewards American Express Card, for instance, offers 2 percent back -- if you have the rewards deposited into a Fidelity account.)
The majority of the cards come with no annual fees, and more than two-thirds offer rewards without expiration dates. So if your card costs money and offers rewards that evaporate, you might want to see what other cards are offering.
"If you find yourself earning less than 1 percent, or if you're paying an annual fee, it's time to shop around," said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst with Bankrate.com.
What's behind the better credit-card deals? Banks have scaled back debit-card rewards programs in response to the Durbin amendment, part of federal legislation that restricts the "swipe" fees banks can charge merchants for processing purchases made with debit cards. Lower fees translate to less money available for reward programs for debit cards. But credit cards aren't covered by the Durbin amendment, so banks are still offering perks for shopping done on credit cards.
Banks see credit-rewards customers as low risk; they tend to use the card frequently to earn rewards, which results in fee-processing income from merchants, while they paying their balances in full each month and thus not creating credit risk. It's true that banks don't make money from charging interest to those customers, since they don't carry a balance. But after the past several years recovering from high defaults due to the recession, card issuers "are not in a hurry to put risk back on their books," said Mr. McBride.
He suggests that if you are a big credit-card spender, you should hunt for a card that pays more than 1 percent, or cards that offer a bonus reward based on annual spending.
What sort of cash rewards card do you use?

HEADLINE: Don't Call Them Payday Loans, but Watch the Fees

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Online start-ups are offering short-term loans that can carry high fees. 

 BODY:
Even as short-term loansfrom payday lenders and banks get greater scrutiny from federal regulators, online start-ups are introducing new versions of these loans that also carry significant fees.
The new offerings include BillFloat, which pays customers' bills of up to $200 each, and ZestCash, which makes larger loans for longer periods of time.
Both companies insist that they are not payday lenders and that their loans are structured with protections that help customers avoid getting overwhelmed by debt. But fees and interest rates on their loans still can be quite high.
BillFloat, based in San Francisco, doesn't pay any money directly to the customer. Rather, it pays its customers' bills -- say, a utility bill or cellphone bill -- and then automatically deducts the amount of the bill, plus fees and interest, from the customer's bank account within 30 days.
To use the service, customers don't undergo a traditional credit check. Instead, they register on the Web site and provide their bank account number. BillFloat analyzes their financial information to determine whether they are eligible. "We look at their source of income and the consistency of income," said Ryan Gilbert, BillFloat's founder and chief executive.
The company said it had registered about 190,000 users over the last year and made 80,000 loans, with the average loan about $160. BillFloat works with more than 2,500 companies nationwide. The typical borrower, Mr. Gilbert said, is a suburban mother whose husband is unemployed, and who wants to keep the heat on and the telephone working. "We're able to work with customers who should be served by banks, but who aren't, and who want to keep their financial house in order," Mr. Gilbert said.
The loans don't come cheap, however. The interest rate charged can be as high as 36 percent APR, and that's in addition to a service fee that ranges from about $9 up to $18. (Mr. Gilbert, along with some banks that make deposit advance loans, said it was not appropriate to add the fee into the calculation for the annual percentage rate. But if the fee were included, the resulting interest rate would be much higher.) He noted that the rates and fees were clearly disclosed on BillFloat's Web site.
In an example on BillFloat's Web site, a customer borrowing $125 for 30 days would end up paying $142, or a total of $17 extra (the example uses a Florida borrower). By comparison, a borrower using a "typical high-interest loan" with a rush payment would pay $165, or $40 extra.
If customers can't repay within 30 days, they can call to request an extension of time to repay. But there is a late fee of $2 to $25, depending on the state. More than a third of loans are paid back ahead of time, Mr. Gilbert said. The company's default rate is about 10 percent.
Asked whether he expected his company to receive scrutiny from regulators, Mr. Gilbert said he thought that "everybody dealing with consumer data and finance should be scrutinized by the regulatory authorities."
ZestCash also says it is not a payday lender, although it does deduct payments on borrowers' paydays. But it maintains that its loans are cheaper than those made by storefront payday lenders, largely because borrowers from traditional payday outlets are often unable to pay off their loans in the brief time allotted, and so end up re-borrowing the money and paying more fees.
"If you don't have $500 today, will you have it in two weeks?" asked ZestCash's founder, Douglas Merrill, a former chief information officer at Google. His co-founder is Shawn Budde, who formerly managed subprime credit cards at Capital One. ZestCash is based in Los Angeles and currently operates in four states -- Utah, Idaho, Missouri and South Dakota -- and has about 10,000 users.
Mr. Merrill said ZestCash aims to serve under-banked customers -- people who have a bank account, but don't have credit good enough to qualify for even a subprime credit card. The average credit score of ZestCash borrowers is about 500.
Customers apply by filling out an online questionnaire, and are then contacted by a ZestCash representative to complete the process. ZestCash, Mr. Merrill said, uses a proprietary underwriting process that looks at hundreds of variables to determine if the customer is likely to pay back the loan. If approved, the customer chooses an amount to borrow -- up to $800 -- and selects not only the length of the loan, but also the amount of the payments. The payments are automatically withdrawn from the customer's account when a paycheck is deposited.
The approach gives borrowers more flexibility, but still comes with stiff costs. Typically, the fee is $15 for each $50 borrowed, and the average interest rate is 180 percent. "Short-term installment loans like ZestCash loans are not the cheapest way to borrow money," the site explains. And then it gives the following example. A customer borrowing $500 from ZestCash for five months would pay back a total of $924.21, meaning the loan cost them $424. The annual percentage rate on the loan is about 334 percent -- though the site says that using A.P.R. is confusing and unhelpful for short-term loans, and so prefers to use the term "loan cost" instead. (The Center for Responsible Lending recently noted that a typical A.P.R. for payday loans from a storefront lender is more than 400 percent.)
By comparison, Mr. Merrill said, a $500 loan from a storefront payday lender would typically cost $90 for two weeks, but most loans get rolled over. If the same $500 was rolled over for five months, with a $90 fee every two weeks, the total cost in fees would be about $900, Mr. Merrill noted, roughly twice the cost of using ZestCash.
ZestCash says its loans are expensive because it specializes in making loans to people with poor credit, so higher fees are necessary to cover the higher risk. But Mr. Merrill said that the fees were clearly disclosed and that customers could get a deferral for a payment if they were short on cash when it was due. (Interest accrues but there are no late fees, he said. The company does charge a $10 fee if there isn't enough money in the customer's account to cover a scheduled payment.) "Everyone knows what the loan will cost," Mr. Merrill said. "There are no surprises."
Most customers do miss or defer one payment, but a "vast majority" repay the loans in full, which is what ZestCash wants, Mr. Merrill said.
Would you use one of these short-term loan sites, knowing the fees involved?

HIGHLIGHT: Unemployment benefits and other evils. 

 BODY:
Notes (pdf).
About those last two slides: they're an attempt to briefly summarize the state of play on unemployment benefits and actual unemployment. There is some indication that extended UI has raised the unemployment rate associated with any given inflation rate over the next few years (NAIRU yada yada, I know, but downward nominal rigidity; this is shorthand for taking all that into account -- if you don't know what I'm talking about, consider yourself lucky) In normal times, with the Fed unwilling to let inflation rise, this would translate into higher actual unemployment. But in a liquidity trap, with the Fed unable to hit its targets, it has no effect.
But what happens when the economy emerges from the liquidity trap? At that point extended UI will have gone away.

HEADLINE: India - Iran - Israel: A Fine Balance

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: India has strong ties with both Iran and Israel, thanks to trade links and history. 

 BODY:
The recent attack on an Israeli Embassy car in New Delhi has put the Indian government in a difficult spot - it needs to maintain relationships with two key allies, Israel and Iran, which are important trading partners, while investigating the attack thoroughly. Officials from Israel say they have proof Iran was behind the New Delhi attack, while officials from Iran claim the Israelis were responsible.
Tuesday's blasts in Thailand, which have resulted in two arrests of men Thai authorities say carried Iranian passports, has ratcheted up Israel's public statements against Iran, and will put even more pressure on India. So far, India has been careful not to assign blame. On Tuesday, Home Minister P. Chidambaram called the New Delhi explosion, which left four injured, a "terrorist attack" perpetrated by a "well-trained person." He also said it would be premature to assign blame to any country or group.
Israel's ambassador to India, Alon Ushpiz, stressed the strength of the India-Iran relationship on local news channels Tuesday: "If by targeting an Israeli woman in the heart of Delhi, if somebody thinks he is going to undermine this relationship between the two important powers, he should wake up and smell the coffee," he told NDTV.
India's relationships with Israel and Iran are very different.
A newly created India established diplomatic ties with Iran in 1950, following centuries of shared trade and culture. While India is highly dependent on Iran for oil (some reports say it is the largest customer of Iran's oil) and as a market for rice exports, the relationship between the two has not substantially developed in other ways in recent years. Earlier this month, India announced a new trade delegation would travel to Iran seeking to increase economic ties in the wake of sanctions imposed against Iran by Europe and the United States.
In contrast, India established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992, after opposing the United Nations vote that created Israel in 1947. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, though, relations warmed, and ties in agriculture, research and development are being forged. Defense trade between the two countries still dominates, though. In December 2011 it was estimated to reach $10 billion during the past decade, as India ordered everything from low altitude radar systems to surface-to-air missiles.
A look at India's relationship to both countries by the numbers:
IRAN
Indian exports, April 2011 to October 2011: $1.4 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago
Indian imports, April 2011 to October 2011: $5.9 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago
Major trade:
Petroleum products - India imported 22 million tons of Iranian crude oil in 2009-2010, worth about $10 billion, making it Iran's third-largest crude market, the last official data available. Recent reports say India's imports increased to 550,000 barrels a day in January, making it Iran's largest petroleum consumer. India is reported to be Iran's largest rice supplier.
Indian community in Iran: About 240 families and 800 students.
ISRAEL
Indian exports, April 2011 to October 2011: $2.3 billion, up 49 percent from a year ago
Indian imports, April 2011 to October 2011: $1.4 billion, up 11 percent from a year ago
Major trade: Defense, diamonds
Indians in Israel:
Non Resident Indians: About 300
Persons of Indian origin: An estimated 45,000, mostly immigrants and descendents of Indian Jews who migrated to Israel in the 1950s and 1960s.

HEADLINE: Not White Enough, Not Black Enough

BYLINE: EUSEBIUS MCKAISER


HIGHLIGHT: The fate of the colored community will be a litmus test of whether South African democracy can treat fairly all the victims of apartheid or will perpetuate a racial hierarchy of suffering. 

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG - A few weeks ago, a British friend of mine served a sumptuous confession as a starter for dinner, "I only realized recently that you're not actually black!" We had met several years back in the English midlands, where, judging by her remark, I had passed as black. But now that she has lived in South Africa for a few months, she is fluent in the local racial vocabulary: things are not quite black and white.
Let me explain. In South Africa I'm referred to as "colored," a term that does not have the same derogatory denotation here as it does in the United States when it is hurled at black Americans. I am not black. I am of mixed racial heritage, as my parents are and their parents were.

When racist colonial settlers arrived at the southern tip of Africa during the 17th century, their racism did not preclude sexual relations with the locals. Several generations later, the colored community is ostensibly an ethnic group just like the Xhosas or the Zulus or any of the other myriad groupings within South Africa's borders. It makes up 9 percent of the country's population of 50.6 million.
South Africans are adept at broadly classifying one another as black, white, Indian or colored, despite often complicated lineages. Some colored families, especially in the Cape Town region, have Malay origins, courtesy of the historic slave trade that brought Asians to South Africa; others have roots in the local indigenous Khoi community. Our discriminatory skills are so fine-grained that Barack Obama would not pass as colored here; the U.S. president is "biracial."
My own half-brother, whose mother is Xhosa but whose father -- our father -- is colored, is also not colored; he is "mixed race," the local linguistic marker for biracial. The criterion for being classified as colored is clear: both your parents must be colored.
This nimble racial footwork, which often baffles outsiders, is the noxious result of racism's history. It is also the kind of result that has some people think all race talk is undesirable. I disagree. I think the language of race is honest because it captures how many of us here experience racial identities in South Africa post democracy: in terms of skewed access to economic justice.
During apartheid, the National Party government reinforced racial identity among coloreds by forcing the community to live separately from black African groups. It passed laws such as the Population Registration Act, which defined each race group, and the Group Areas Act, which mandated geographic segregation.
Colored communities lived in their own neighborhoods -- most still do -- and spoke Afrikaans as their mother-tongue, a language similar to Dutch and dissimilar to indigenous African languages. We were not white, and we were not treated as white. More money was spent on us than on the average black African community but less than on the average white one. Thus the racial hierarchy was legally, politically and economically entrenched.
However unflattering the politico-historical origins of race talk, though, they cannot eliminate its phenomenological relevance in 2012. Rather than mandate nonracial identities, we must eliminate racism. Colorblindness is the wrong antidote.
Today, 18 years into democracy, many colored people feel that they benefit less from policies designed to redress past discrimination than black Africans, who are seen as worthier victims. For example, "black economic empowerment" policies, some of which grant preferential access to state tenders for companies with a mostly black ownership, mostly serve well-connected black African men and women. This leaves many of my colored friends and relatives frustrated: "We weren't white enough before, and now we are not black enough!"
The lack of adequate economic opportunity for coloreds since the dawn of democracy here -- combined with their lingering, paralyzing sense of victimhood -- explains why the colored community is the most class-homogenous racial grouping in South Africa: an essentially poor, lower-working-class community. Very few of its members escape that stereotype.
In the Western Cape, the province with the largest concentration of colored people in the country, rates of fetal alcohol syndrome are some of the worst in the world. This community is like the drunken uncle of the South African family, the relative you tuck away when posh visitors come around. Paradoxically, many more colored people are worse off than black Africans now than were during apartheid.
Democracy was bound to spread abject poverty across races. On the other hand, too many coloreds have compounded their invisibility by failing to develop a sense of can do-ism. At times I feel like the accidental survivor of the coloreds' curse; at others, like a role model of how to defeat the self-fulfilling hopelessness of my community. I swing between feeling angry at the state and feeling angry at my own people.
Either way, the fate of the colored community will be a litmus test of whether South African democracy can treat fairly all the victims of apartheid or will perpetuate a racial hierarchy of suffering.

HEADLINE: Parents: Toy Marketers Have Our Number

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: What I learned at the Toy Fair: More than I ever imagined, marketers know what we're thinking - and how to persuade us to buy. 

 BODY:
If there was one single, overriding conclusion it was possible to draw from the big Toy Fair in New York City this week, it was this: We're probably not, as a nation, going to run out of toys anytime soon.
I probably could have drawn the same conclusion from any toy store, but there is something about the magnitude of the Toy Fair - row after row, floor after floor of toys - that really brings home the magnitude of the industry devoted to entertaining, and sometimes educating, our children, while persuading adults to part with our money. We're not going to run out of toys, and the subtle and not-so-subtle forces that lure us into buying rather more of the things than we might, based on a purely rational and economic analysis of their utility, aren't going away anytime soon, either. They know when we're weakest. They know why we buy. And (like supermarkets and department stores) they design and place their products to take advantage of our impulses.
We're most likely to cave to a toy request at the end of a long shopping trip, so nearly every familiar toy line offers something - a tiny package of plastic figures, a branded flashlight, a pack of cards - to cluster up at the cash registers when we're most prey to "decision fatigue." We're nostalgic for the toys of our youth, and so many small, once faddish items like Squirmles (those fuzzy worms on a fishing wire) have reappeared.
We round prices down, which is why so many end in .99, and we gravitate toward that which combines the familiar and the novel, resulting in simple product lines like Ugly Dolls transforming wildly into bags and umbrellas. These are all basic principles of marketing, and things any savvy shopper is aware of (which doesn't necessarily make them easier to resist).
But last weekend I was standing in a big box store, restocking my supply of birthday gifts, when I came across the newly expanded Lego display. Right at eye level was an assortment of smaller boxes, all priced from $5.99 to $9.99, all with a character of some kind, a vehicle or a small house, and a few assorted accessories. I was captivated: they were perfect for a small treat - there was enough in the package to give a child something new to play with; they work, of course, with the other Lego sets we already own; and they're relatively inexpensive. I didn't set out to buy Valentine's Day gifts for my children, but those went into the cart.
A few days later, standing in front of a similar display at the Toy Fair, a Lego representative explained the reasoning behind the products. "We think of these as 'reward toys,' " she said. "There's just enough in the box to give a child a fresh play experience, they work on their own or with the other sets a family has at home, and they're relatively inexpensive."
It's disconcerting when you realize the marketing people are reading your mind. I started to hear myself echoed again and again across the fair, always referred to as the emblematic "Mom." "Mom is looking for more storage." "Mom wants a place for the child to carry something small to play with." "Mom likes toys that promote learning and playing."
I love toys, or I wouldn't have been roaming the halls of the Toy Fair in the first place. I know I'm prone to buying my children the things that I either loved as a child or would have loved if they'd been around when I was a child. I know I like to surprise and delight them. And I also know that the more often I buy them things, the less the things mean, that the charming Lego "rewards" will soon be in the bin with all the rest, and that if I just dropped the dollar bills in instead of the pieces of plastic, I'd be pretty dismayed by how quickly it all adds up.
How much are you contributing annually to the $21 billion worldwide toy industry (a market that essentially defines "discretionary spending")? Probably more than you'd think, and less than they'd like. I'm not kidding myself that I won't be buying more toys, or that I'll never again find myself thinking exactly what the marketing forces hoped I'd think when I stand in front of a colorful toy display. But maybe (for all of us) a little more knowledge of how we're supposed to respond will mean a little longer pause before we do.

Usually, people who make important decisions for countries never live long enough to see the effects of their choices. It is almost always future generations who bear the burdens of the past.
In 1978, the Chinese government created a political policy that would change the face of China. Under pressure to control a ballooning population in a country that was too poor to support it, the "One Child Policy" was created. From that moment on, every Chinese family could only have one child. Though families of minority races, those living in rural areas and parents who were from a single-child family were excluded, the policy was far-reaching and strictly enforced.
Now, more than 30 years later, we have seen some of the ramifications of the policy. We know that by limiting the number of births for each family in a culture that valued boys, female infanticide became rampant. "Little emperors," male children coddled by their parents, ruled families. And as the male-majority generation entered adulthood, eligible wives became harder and harder to find. 
Around the same time as the "One Child Policy" was changing families in China, the mujahideen (freedom fighters) in Afghanistan were fighting a war against a Soviet Union-installed government, and eventually against the Soviet Army itself. 
The mujahideen could not have known that more than 30 years later, Afghanistan would still be at war, though one involving a different cast of foreign troops. 
What are the ramifications of more than three decades of war in Afghanistan? Some things are obvious: poverty, low life expectancy, devastated infrastructure, little economic or political stability, psychological wounds and rampant corruption. 
But there has been a silver lining, one not evident to the naked eye poetry.
Though some say that Afghans have always been poets, I think that the strain of war has pushed all people to express themselves in newly eloquent ways. Words have become their release.
As a teacher here, I have interacted with at least one person from every generation that has lived during the last 30 years of war. From the oldest professors who were mujahideen, to the youngest university students who were born under Taliban rule, I have spoken to and befriended them all. In getting to know these people, I have found that they have one thing in common: they all love to talk, to create another reality with their words.
One professor in the English Department speaks poetically when he is trying to express even mundane things. "On the wings of a dove you came here to show us that you are peace," he told me. "Your eyes express the concern of your country. You are the brightness in their dark past. You are the dove. You are peace."
The students have described their personal trials, tribulations and emotional turmoil in my writing class. One senior student at the university wrote the following poem about love:

Given a pattern for a poem, this student completed the prompted lines with his owns thoughts and ideas:
I am a sensitive boy
I wonder why people don't like each other
I hear the broken sound of unity
I see the day when everyone is united
I want no borders in this world
I am a sensitive boy
I pretend the world has no conflict
I feel the sunny days of peace
I touch the walls without barbed wire
I worry whether or not I will see another day
I cry when there is no reason to laugh
I am a sensitive boy
I understand one day everything will be calm
I say, "Peace will bring love, long live peace!"
I dream of that lovely day
I hope that all wars end
I am a sensitive boy

In their free writing journals, many students tell about their lives using some form of poetry. This student chose haiku to express his feelings about civil war:
I have left my peace-loving students for a few months to return to the United States to continue teaching English as a Second Language at Santa Barbara City College. But I will not stay away for long. 
Come summer of 2012, Afghanistan will welcome me back. My friends and students will be waiting with coffee and kofta (meatballs), ready to teach and talk. Hopefully, when I return in the summer, things will look the same as when I left; girls and boys will be learning side by side in now warm, half-lit classrooms. 
By that time, summer will have arrived and with that, roses will be growing from every crack in the city. At that time, I hope to feel safe enough to pause as I walk by those vibrant flowers, breathe in their sweet smell, and imagine this place at peace.

HEADLINE: The Volcker Rule's Unusual Critics

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: While Wall Street is the chief critic of the rule, which bans banks from trading with their own money, the financial industry is finding sympathy from some unexpected quarters, including the owners of Red Lobster, Macy's and Safeway. 

 BODY:
What does Goldman Sachs have in common with Red Lobster and Macy's? They all loathe the Volcker Rule.
While Wall Street is the chief critic of the rule, which bars banks from trading with their own money, the financial industry is finding sympathy from some unlikely quarters.
A patchwork of nearly 30 companies -- from industries as disparate as retail, energy and medical research -- has weighed in with their own anti-Volcker Rule sentiments. The companies, organized by the United States Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter to regulators on Tuesday that outlined their objections to a draft proposal of the rule. Goldman this week sent two letters to regulators.
At the root of their disdain is fear. Adopting one of Wall Street's central talking points, Corporate America is worried that the rule will suck liquidity out of the financial system, which provides financing to companies big and small.
"The undersigned companies and organizations, representing a diverse range of industries, believe that the Volcker Rule will have far-reaching negative consequences that will impede our ability to raise capital and manage risk," said the letter, one of several hundred pleas made to regulators this week as the public comment period closed.
The authors included Macy's, Arch Coal and Abbott Laboratories, the medical device and pharmaceutical giant. The restaurant industry was represented by Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Safeway, the grocery store chain, also signed on, raising the question of who does not have a view on the Volcker Rule.
The companies, taking another cue from Wall Street, pleaded with regulators to scrap the draft version of the rule and start from scratch. The delay will "provide additional time to identify unintended consequences and craft policies to avoid them," the letter said.
Of course, a delay would also run out the clock on the current Congress, which includes many supporters of the regulatory crackdown. Some foes of new financial regulation have high hopes for life after the 2012 election, in which the Democrats could lose control of the White House and Senate.
A collection of regulators -- the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- must now sift through the comment letters before crafting a final rule. The rule is supposed to take effect in July, but most people close to the debate expect regulators to miss that deadline.
Named for Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve who championed restraints on Wall Street risk-taking, the rule prohibits banks from trading with their own money rather than for clients. Supporters of the rule, a centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul that was passed in response to the financial crisis, argue that banks should not make risky wagers while the government guarantees their deposits.
Critics, including the collection of nonfinancial companies, focus their complaints on the definition of proprietary trading. The line can be blurred between proprietary trading and legitimate market-making, a practice in which banks hold securities with the purported plan to later sell them to a customer. Such activity is "crucial for businesses to issue bonds and securities," the companies said in their letter.
Dodd-Frank exempted market-making from the Volcker Rule, but the companies worry that the exemption is too narrow.
"Because these consequences may negatively impact business growth and job creation we strongly urge you to thoroughly evaluate the impact of additional regulation on American businesses and the broader economy and not move forward with the implementation of the Volcker Rule in its current form," the letter said.
An array of supporters of the proposed rule, including Mr. Volcker himself, pushed back against the escalating rhetoric.
"This criticism is deeply misguided," Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit group that favors Wall Street regulation, said in a comment letter. The group said that too much of a good thing, or "excessive market liquidity," drove the financial system to the brink of collapse in 2008.

HEADLINE: Comcast's Net Income Increases, Lifted by Internet Subscriptions

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: The performance of the NBC broadcast network was a drag on the company's otherwise sold performance in the fourth quarter; revenue at the network fell 3.7 percent. 

 BODY:
A decline in the number of customers canceling their cable service coupled with additional high-speed Internet subscriptions contributed to a 26.4 percent increase in quarterly net income at Comcast, the nation's largest cable provider.
In the three months that ended Dec. 31, the company said Wednesday, Comcast generated $1.29 billion in net income, up from $1.02 billion in the same period in 2010.
Revenue jumped 54.7 percent, to $15.04 billion, driven largely by 336,000 new high-speed Internet customers and a 37 percent increase in revenue in the company's business services division, which mostly sets up small businesses with Internet, phone and cable service. Operating income at the company, which is based in Philadelphia, soared 45 percent, to $2.9 billion.
The results point to a slightly improved economic climate in which more consumers are able to afford their monthly cable service, which is still the essence of the rapidly expanding Comcast.
"Cable had another terrific year of improving customer metrics," Brian L. Roberts, the chairman and chief executive at Comcast, said in a statement. He added that a new high-tech cable brand and an "intensified focus on service and innovation are making a real difference."
Still, Comcast and its satellite and cable competitors have recently diversified away from video service as viewers increasingly watch television via the Internet. Comcast lost 17,000 video customers in the quarter, compared with 135,000 in the same period a year earlier.
Meanwhile, revenue from residential high-speed Internet subscriptions was up 10.1 percent in the quarter, a harbinger of how the company will shape its strategy as it adapts to new technologies. Last month, Comcast struck a 10-year deal with Disney that allows customers to stream shows and sports in and outside the home.
One drag on the otherwise solid quarter was the NBC broadcast network, which Comcast took on as part of its acquisition of a majority stake in NBCUniversal. Revenue at the network fell 3.7 percent in the quarter and 7 percent for the year. Revenue at the media company's filmed entertainment unit, which includes Universal Pictures, fell 1.8 percent in the quarter, to $1.3 billion.
Despite NBC's widely reported struggles, Comcast has said that it bought NBCUniversal primarily for the value of its cable networks. Those networks, including USA, CNBC and Bravo, had a 5.3 percent revenue increase in the quarter.
Revenue at the Universal Studios theme parks, a division Comcast plans to expand, was up 4 percent.
On Wednesday, Comcast said it would increase its annual dividend by 44 percent, to 65 cents a share. The company also announced a $6.5 billion stock repurchasing plan, with $3 billion worth of those buybacks set for 2012.
The share buybacks reflect a trend in the media and cable industries. Last month, Time Warner Cable, the largest cable provider after Comcast, said it would buy back $4 billion worth of stock, and News Corporation has undertaken a $5 billion stock buyback.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Members of a House-Senate committee charged with writing a measure to extend a payroll tax reduction and provide added unemployment benefits reached a tentative deal Tuesday evening, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. Congressional negotiators struck a deal that would extend the payroll tax rollback without requiring spending cuts to pay for it, while also extending unemployment benefits and preventing a large cut in reimbursements to doctors who accept Medicare.

        
President Obama's political standing is rising along with voters' optimism that the economy is getting better, Jim Rutenberg and Allison Kopicki report. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows a shift in Mr. Obama's approval rating that coincides with continued Republican unease with the field of candidates seeking to replace him.

        
Over the next two days, President Obama will be trying to soothe Hollywood, that longtime bastion of fund-raising dollars for Democrats, while not alienating the high-tech industry which has surged to the top of the Obama money list, Helene Cooper reports. Mr. Obama is in the doghouse with the show-business people, who are mad because the White House didn't support them on their anti-piracy bill that got squashed in Congress after pressure from Google and other Internet high-fliers.

        
The Romney campaign's new focus on Michigan comes as the latest national polls show Rick Santorum surging to a tie with the former governor, Michael D. Shear reports. Mr. Romney wrote an opinion article in The Detroit News on Tuesday defending his 2008 position to "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."
Around the Web

        
An ambulance was called to the White House to tend to a household worker who suffered an on-the-job injury that may have cost the employee some fingers, Politico reports.

        
Politico is also reporting on a new kind of political entity called "hybrid PACs," which get to function as both a traditional political action committee and as a "super PAC."
Happenings in Washington

        
Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden will join Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at the Pentagon to unveil a new report on their efforts to support military families.

HEADLINE: Santorum Tests the Big Campaign Theory

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum's campaign has had success with a tiny staff, no infrastructure, little connection to the Republican establishment and very little money. 

 BODY:
A basic tenet of presidential politics is that the process rewards campaigns that assemble a large, nationwide infrastructure, financed by huge fund-raising teams.
The idea is that creating such an operation during the primaries will prove whether a candidate can do it during the general election. And even more broadly, the question of whether a candidate can build - and then run - a large, unwieldy organization is seen by some political observers as a test of his or her ability to run the country.
(Think Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2008; George W. Bush in 2000; Bob Dole in 1996.)
But the 2012 campaign is challenging those assumptions.
Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have each surged to become serious threats to Mitt Romney's presidential juggernaut despite having ragtag campaign operations and a fraction of the money that Mr. Romney has had at his disposal.
Mr. Santorum, in particular, has kept his shoe-string campaign alive for months with a tiny staff, no campaign infrastructure, little connection to the Republican establishment and a pot of campaign cash that is more like a breadbox than a war chest.
Late last year, a New York Times graphic compared Mr. Santorum's campaign entourage to those of his rivals; other campaigns had buses and cars and planes and dozens of staffers that stretched forever. He had a pickup truck and a single aide.
Mr. Santorum bragged about the graphic repeatedly.
"We're very, very proud of the fact that we've done this the way you would think that Republican candidates would run a campaign - like every dollar mattered and that we weren't going to go out and waste a lot of money on a bunch of people running around with earpieces in their head and clipboards not doing anything," Mr. Santorum said during the final days before his Iowa victory earlier this year.
But Mr. Santorum's win in Iowa is one thing - the state routinely rewards candidates who spend plenty of time in the state (Mr. Santorum did), and Iowa's caucus tradition helps candidates who tap into the church and home-schooling networks that exist in the state (he did that, too).
What has happened with Mr. Santorum's campaign more recently is the real surprise.
He weathered weeks of relative obscurity (and losses) as Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich battled each other in South Carolina, Florida and Nevada. He resisted calls from Mr. Gingrich and others to drop out for the good of the party. He stuck to the idea that his campaign wasn't finished.
And last Tuesday, Mr. Santorum made it clear that a small campaign - even small by the standards of some U.S. Senate contests - could potentially capture the nomination.
His victories in Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota have vaulted him back into a tie with Mr. Romney in at least four national surveys in the last week. And Mr. Santorum's campaign has begun raising money and adding some staff as he turns his attention to the bigger contests in Michigan, Ohio and elsewhere.
If Mr. Santorum were to snatch the nomination from Mr. Romney, it would undermine the assumptions that bigger is always better. And it could inspire future presidential hopefuls to mount long-shot bids in the hopes of repeating Mr. Santorum's improbable success.
"We don't travel with a lot of staff. We have a very lean machine and we focused on putting lead on the target," Mr. Santorum explained last month. "We spent our dollars wisely on radio and television, as limited as we had. That's what we did. We believed, ultimately, that money didn't really matter in this race."
Of course, the race is far from over, and the financial and structural limitations of Mr. Santorum's campaign may yet emerge as the deciding factors in the Republican nomination fight.
The lack of a muscular fund-raising operation could leave Mr. Santorum with too little money to respond to the avalanche of advertising that Mr. Romney and his "super PAC" allies are likely to unleash in the next 13 days leading to the primaries in Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 28.
His "lean machine" could find itself outmatched by early March, as the race expands to 11 states on Super Tuesday and Mr. Romney's state-by-state operation kicks into gear across the country. Ultimately, it is - as both campaigns have said recently - a chase for enough delegates to clinch the nomination.
Donors could begin to fear that choosing Mr. Santorum would mean trusting the nomination to a candidate who has not proven that he can assemble the kind of political machine that can withstand the financial and organizational challenges of going up against Mr. Obama's re-election campaign.
And voters may decide that running a small, upstart campaign does not give them confidence in Mr. Santorum's ability to run the country at a time of economic uncertainty and complicated world dynamics.
If any or all of those factors doom Mr. Santorum, that would reaffirm the conventional wisdom that Mr. Romney and so many candidates before him have tried to follow. 
But if he succeeds in stopping Mr. Romney's march to the Republican nomination, Mr. Santorum will have demonstrated a new kind of path to victory in the primaries.
If that happens, the money will no doubt pour in, and his general election campaign would probably be as big and unwieldy as any before it. But if he defeated Mr. Obama in the fall, there might just be more one-pickup-truck presidential campaigns in the future.

HEADLINE: David's Awesome Tie Story

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: And what it tells us about the Republican nominating process, China and the future of the United States. 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Gail, recently we had a Chinese exchange student staying with us. She was funny, charming and of course reminded me that we're doomed. I'd go to bed at midnight and she'd be in the kitchen doing her homework. I'd wake up at 6:30 and she'd be in our kitchen doing her homework.
Gail Collins: The Chinese work ethic is amazing. So much so that I believe it'll be only a short time before their standard of living matches ours, and their kids are spending 10 hours a day updating their Facebook pages and playing computer games.
David: But her stay heralded something else, a sign from the gods. On the day she arrived she handed me a small box as a present for hosting her. I opened it and there was a lovely gold tie that she had brought from China. I wore it the next day and as I put it on I was curious to see what kind of Chinese lettering was on the label. I turned it over and read the following: "Compliments of Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels." 
It turns out that Daniels had visited China on a trade delegation. He had handed out ties to the dignitaries who hosted him. At least one of the ties was sold, bought and then re-gifted back to me. I took this as a sign from the Oracle of Beijing that Mitch Daniels really should be running for president.
Gail: I know how you feel about Mitch Daniels, but you need to come to grips with the fact that we haven't put anybody that boring in the White House since Grover Cleveland.
The tie story, however, is wonderful. I think you need to make it into a movie. Brad Pitt could play Mitch Daniels. Or Kevin Spacey, if you don't require a happy ending.
David: This goes along with the mood at the moment that the presidential election is as good as over. Obama is surging in the polls. Romney is collapsing. Joe Biden can redo the bathrooms at his mansion if he likes because it looks like he'll be staying there another four years. Is that your mood too?
Gail: No, I am only optimistic when everybody else is miserable. There are tons of things that could sink Obama - gas prices, Iran, Europe, plagues of frogs and locusts. Although at this precise moment Mitt Romney winning anything does seem sort of hard to envision.
David: The Republican race is being turned upside down once again with Santorum's surge. I find myself thinking tactically. If the Republicans are going to lose anyway, shouldn't they lose with the Tea Party candidate? That would at least spark change in the right direction. If Romney is nominated and he loses then the party will take the lesson that they should never nominate a moderate again. Welcome to Nominee Bachmann in 2016!
Gail: Wow, and I thought we'd seen the last of Herman Cain.
I like your scenario, but it's my policy never to root for outrageous candidates to be nominated for president, just because I think they will suffer crushing defeats. That's the way I once felt about Ronald Reagan.
David: The most immediate fact is the Santorum surge in Michigan. If Rick wins there then that would be a knockdown blow to Romney. Not knock out, but it might turn Super Tuesday into his final night. All year long the Tea Party types have been telling us in a thousand different ways that they don't want Romney. Maybe they actually mean it.
Gail: I can appreciate the Tea Party's feelings. And they've certainly tried to find an alternative - Bachmann, Cain, Perry, Gingrich and now Santorum. The only problem is that those are all ghastly options and as soon as the voters get a serious look at them, they're toast. The one thing about Mitt Romney you can always count on - really, the only thing - is his ability to get his friends to finance tons of advertising that will highlight his opponents' every flaw.
David: I should add that Bill Kristol has been arguing all year that Romney is not inevitable and that things could get wild when he falters. Kristol may turn out to be the only prescient pundit in America.
Gail: The people who cover politics for a living always yearn for the wild and crazy year. Which could lead to a brokered convention! We could all vie to see who could figure out which way the North Dakota delegation was going to go! I have wanted to do that ever since I covered my first convention, when I was working for my own news service in Connecticut and had a rank of floor pass so pathetic I was on the same line as the people from Encyclopedia Britannica. Even as we are conversing about the wonderfulness of this possibility, however, I am thinking: never gonna happen.
David: I'm developing a fascination with Santorum. As you know I'm ambivalent about him. I like the fact that he takes Catholic social teaching seriously and talks about aiding the poor. I don't like his black or white view of politics. Everybody is either on God's side or on Satan's side.
Gail: I am recalling some lyrics from "My Fair Lady" - I'd prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition.
David: What interests me about him is his willingness to look into the abyss. Most of us just kind of glide by setbacks and avoid dwelling on negative events. We want to focus on the positive.
Santorum has a tropism toward the unpleasant. After 9/11, when he was still in the Senate, he fixated on Islamic extremism. After he lost his Senate re-election race in 2006, he fixated on the unfair media criticism he received and on the unhappiness of Pennsylvania voters with President Bush. In the Senate he could be a dour presence because he focused on what was going wrong.
Not many people are like that, especially in America.
Gail: The dark negativity Rick Santorum is willing to focus on is people who disagree with him. Senators who didn't want to cut Social Security benefits, women who don't want to extinguish Planned Parenthood, Islamic extremism, media criticism of Rick Santorum - they're all forces of Satan.
David: If Obama wins I'm afraid it will reward the wrong kind of policy making. In his recent speeches and in his budget he has begun replicating the downside of Clintonism. He's got a bunch of moderately positive small policies. Each individual policy seems reasonable, if bite-sized.
They seem to be winning the favor of independent voters, who are drifting back to him. The problem is that together they are out of proportion to the size of our problems-the debt, inequality, wage stagnation, family decay and so on.
Gail: David, it's Santorum who's Mr. Negative around here. You are our ray of Republican sunshine. So cheer up. Until the Tea Party craziness fades, nobody's going to be able to do any great reforms in Washington. The American people are smart enough to know that. So you go for the little, doable stuff.
David: If Obama wins on the strength of these policies then all future candidates are going to predicate their campaigns on nice sounding micropolicies. Ugh.
Gail: I'm beginning to buy into the theory that, wars excepted, a president only has one big domestic lift in him, and he has to do it early in his first term. Obama did health care reform and if he can hang onto that and expand upon it, it could go a long way toward deficit reduction and controlling the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. Which would be huge. More than any president has done since Lyndon Johnson. But I can't pretend I imagine he could do it a second time with, say, tax reform or global warming.
David: My solace is that this is a moment in time. In a couple of weeks, if the rest of the European economy nosedives suddenly, Obama will look doomed, and the Republicans will look like a juggernaut. I expect 7.5 mood swings between now and November.
Gail: You're right. Plenty to look forward to. Including, of course, the Indiana Tie Movie. You'll probably need a better title. And a love interest. We can work all that out while we're waiting to see what the North Dakota delegation does at the brokered convention.

HEADLINE: Getting More Liberal With Age

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney says that "living a life tends to make you more conservative." But relative to themselves as young people, today's older folks have generally become more liberal, a study finds. 

 BODY:
4:47 p.m. | Updated 
[BIO]On Fox News this morning, Mitt Romney explained that his positions today are more conservative than those when he was the governor of Massachusetts because "living a life tends to make you more conservative." This echoes a saying often attributed (perhaps apocryphally) to Winston Churchill. It usually goes something like this: If you're not a liberal at 20 you have no heart; if you're not a conservative at 40 you have no brain.
Whatever the heartlessness or brainlessness of any given ideology, the conventional wisdom that people get more conservative as they age is wrong, according to sociological research.
At any given time older people are likely to be more conservative than contemporaneous young people. But relative to as young people, today's older folks have generally become more liberal than they once were.
A 2007 study published in the American Sociological Review examined General Social Survey data from 1972 to 2004, looking specifically at beliefs within a given age cohort about: historically subordinate groups, like whether women should be breadwinners and why African-Americans are poorer than whites; civil liberties for groups outside the mainstream, like homosexuals, communists and atheists; and boundaries of privacy, related to things like premarital sex and divorce.
The authors found that a given age cohort's attitudes changed over time -- more often later in life -- and that "the direction of change is most often toward increased tolerance rather than increased conservatism."
How about you? How would you finish the sentence "Living a life makes you more...."?
: I've gotten a few questions from readers about the use of the word "tolerance" in the sentence I quoted.
The authors seem to be using "tolerant" interchangeably with "liberal" throughout the paper (as well as in subsequent interviews). Note though that the authors are primarily looking at social issues (albeit ones with economic implications), and are interested in "tolerance" for behaviors deviate from traditional social values and family roles. As I read the study, "conservative" and "liberal" are not necessarily synonymous with Republican or Democratic platforms, but refer to preferences for conserving things as they are or have been, versus liberalizing existing norms and tolerating behaviors that deviate from those norms.
Here are a few sample questions, to give you a flavor of the kinds of metrics the authors were using:

        
Now I'm going to read several more statements. As I read each one, please tell me whether you strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree with it. For example, here is the statement:

        
Should [a homosexual] person be allowed to teach in a college or university, or not?

        
There's been a lot of discussion about the way morals and attitudes about sex are changing in this country. If a man and woman have sex relations before marriage, do you think it is always wrong, almost always wrong, wrong only sometimes, or not wrong at all?

HEADLINE: Finally, a Stimulus Deal

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Lawmakers reach a tentative deal on the payroll tax cut extension, and the president's approval rating edges up. 

 BODY:
It looks like Republican and Democratic lawmakers are going to make a deal on some actual economic stimulus. They will likelyextend the $100 billion payroll tax holiday without the cuts that Republicans usually demand in exchange for spending-which can end up diluting the intended effect.
In the past, President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress have trembled before Republican drum-beating and gone along with voodoo economic-thinking. But this time they stood relatively firm and it's paid off.
I say relatively because the expected deal will also extend unemployment insurance, and-unlike with the payroll tax holiday-Democrats have agreed to pay for it with changes to federal pensions. That's a bad precedent, since unemployment insurance is an emergency measure that has not been offset in the past.

What's changed in Washington? Perhaps it's the realization that popular opinion seems to be moving, ever so slightly, in favor of the Democrats.
According to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, the president's approval rating is up to 50 percent. Nothing his team should get too excited about, but still better than his low-forties performance in the fall.
The poll also shows that Americans are feeling slightly more optimistic. In a January survey, only 29 percent said the country was going in the right direction. Now that's up to 35 percent. Again, that shouldn't set champagne corks popping in the White House, but it's something.
What should be truly encouraging to the White House, in a life-is-a-zero-sum-game sort of way, is that things are going badly for the Republicans. The G.O.P.'s reputation is closely tied to the House of Representatives (where they have a majority), and the Congressional approval rating may soon fall within the margin of error of zero.
A more significant finding is that Republican primary voters are underwhelmed so far, to put it charitably.
Sixty percent of them say it's too early to have made up their minds, despite the tens of millions of dollars spent on TV ads and what seems like tens of millions of hours of debates. Only 26 percent of those who have decided on a candidate could muster the enthusiasm to say they strongly support their choice.
What puzzles me is that 62 percent of Republican voters say they are not satisfied with the candidates. They have fake right, real right, extremely right and way-out-on-the-fringe whacky right. How much more choice could they want, or expect from the current G.O.P.?

HEADLINE: Paterson Is Honored in a Return to the Capitol

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: David A. Paterson returned to the Capitol on Wednesday, and was honored in a new exhibition for Black History Month featuring profiles of 29 distinguished black New Yorkers. 

 BODY:
ALBANY - Former Gov. David A. Paterson stood in the mural-ceilinged War Room of the state Capitol on Wednesday, just down the hall from the governor's office. With a crowd of legislators gathered before him, he approached a lectern bearing the state seal.
"I told you all I would be back," Mr. Paterson deadpanned.
Mr. Paterson left office at the end of 2010, but he was once again front and center in Albany on Wednesday, traveling here to be honored by his successor as part of a celebration of Black History Month.
So there Mr. Paterson stood, walking into the War Room with his onetime bitter rival, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who was widely expected to mount a Democratic primary challenge if Mr. Paterson, who automatically became governor when Eliot Spitzer resigned, had not abandoned his bid to be elected to a full term. 
Mr. Paterson and Mr. Cuomo ascended the dais together, Mr. Paterson placing his right hand on Mr. Cuomo's back. Mr. Cuomo's counsel, Mylan L. Denerstein, welcomed Mr. Paterson by lavishing praise on his fiscal stewardship, saying, "His foresight helped to put our state on a more stable financial ground today." 
Then Mr. Cuomo approached the lectern, listed his predecessors' firsts - first black legislative leader, first black lieutenant governor, first black governor - and called him his friend.
In a brief speech, Mr. Paterson was ebullient. He praised Mr. Cuomo for increasing participation by minority-owned businesses in state contracting, and then moved on to teasing the other official honored at the event, H. Carl McCall. (Mr. McCall, the chairman of the board of trustees for the State University system, is another former Cuomo rival: he bested Mr. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002.)
The event celebrated the unveiling of an exhibition at the Capitol for Black History Month that features profiles of 29 distinguished black New Yorkers - including Mr. McCall and Mr. Paterson, whose write-up credited him with guiding the state through a recession and managing its growing budget shortfalls.
Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Mr. Paterson, who now hosts a radio program on WOR-AM (710), acknowledged that there were stumbles during his administration and said it was "very difficult for me to come into office with the lack of preparation that I had." 
But he nonetheless offered a warm recollection of his time as chief executive, describing the job as "an honor that you don't really feel because when you're in the process, it's just getting up and going to work."
"But when you have a few months to reflect about it," Mr. Paterson added, "I can't think of a better way to have spent my time." 
Asked what he missed most about Albany, he cited the Executive Mansion, saying, "Entertaining people there and having people visit it was very exciting." He would not say what he missed least.
While Mr. Paterson was visiting, Mr. Cuomo gave him a tour of the newly refurbished Hall of Governors, the corridor that houses the governor's offices and whose walls are filled with portraits of past governors. Mr. Paterson said Mr. Cuomo asked him when he would sit for a portrait; Mr. Paterson told reporters that he would eventually get around to it.
True to form, Mr. Paterson added, "I thought they could take an old picture from one of the tabloid newspapers and put that up there."

HEADLINE: Michigan's Governor to Endorse Romney

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan is set to endorse Mitt Romney Thursday afternoon, two Republican sources confirmed. 

 BODY:
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan is set to endorse Mitt Romney Thursday afternoon, two Republican sources confirmed.
Mr. Snyder will throw his support behind Mr. Romney at a luncheon at the Livonia Chamber of Commerce in metro Detroit. 
On Monday, Mr. Snyder told reporters that he would endorse this week, and many political watchers expected that he would get behind Mr. Romney. The two men are both former businessmen-turned-politicians, and Mr. Romney endorsed Mr. Snyder when he was running for governor in 2010.
It is unclear how much weight the endorsement of Mr. Synder will carry here. But Mr. Snyder, a political newcomer who was elected just two years ago, has been riding a wave of good news, including an increase in state revenues, some improvement in what has been a dismal unemployment rate, and even an unexpected $457 million surplus left over from last year's state budget.
And Mr. Romney, who is locked in a tight race here with Mr. Santorum, is eager for any help he can get. On Wednesday, his campaign released a list of 129 local officials in Michigan who have endorsed his candidacy, which aides said was part of a strategy to showcase the breadth and depth of his support across the state.
In recent days, Mr. Romney has been reintroducing himself to Michigan voters and showcasing his local roots. His campaign released an ad called "Growing Up," which features images of a young Mr. Romney - a boy grinning behind the wheel of a car; a young man with his wife, Ann - as the current day Mr. Romney drives around reminiscing about Detroit. 
At a rally in Kentwood Wednesday night, Mr. Romney also reminded voters of his state ties. 
"I'm just delighted to be back in Michigan, to see some old friends," Mr. Romney said, before joking, "Any old girlfriends here?" 
Later, he added: "I visited every county in Michigan, I think more than once, on my dad's campaign, and my mom's campaign. I love Michigan."

HEADLINE: Communist Party to U.S.: Stop Your Whining

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The leading Communist Party newspapers in China have been quite restrained and straightforward in their reporting on the U.S. visit of Vice President Xi Jinping. On their op-ed and opinion pages, however, it's game on. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The future leader of the unfree world was in the house, and his visit was expected to be so polite, so scripted, so anodyne. Let a hundred platitudes bloom. Air kiss. Air kiss. 
Then Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. got up and gave a luncheon toast that mentioned human rights, trade scams, jailed writers, currency manipulation, Beijing's and Moscow's on sanctions against Syria - pretty much the full combo platter of American gripes about China. Not to put too blunt a point on it, but Mr. Biden definitely got up in the grille of his lunch guest, Vice President Xi Jinping. 
Mr. Xi listened with a poker face, as my colleagues Mark Landler and Edward Wong reported, and there was "pin-drop silence" in the room. 
The Biden Toast, as it may yet come to be known - or perhaps the Biden Roast, or the Biden Throw-down - certainly gave the state-controlled Chinese media an opening to hit back against the running dog imperialist lackeys. 
The leading Communist Party outlets -the People's Daily newspaper and its tabloid subsidiary, the Global Times - have been quite restrained and straightforward in their reporting, at least on the English-language sites that most Americans and Europeans would visit. On the op-ed and opinion pages, however, it's game on. 
In a People's Daily commentary, Ruan Zongze, a former political officer in the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said "the strategic suspicion between the two countries has never weakened."
In the first 10 years of this century, Mr. Ruan said, "the United States focused only on anti-terrorism and ignored taking precautions against big emerging powers, while China is drawing a new map of global wealth. 
"However, the fact is that whenever the United States feels bad or has an economic difficulty, it always blames others. As the election campaign heats up in the United States this year, the trend of trying to 'blame China' to obtain political capital has appeared.'' 
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, offered a similar rejoinder: "U.S. politicians have long resorted to blaming China for job lossesand other domestic economic hardships.'' 
An editorial in Global Times on Thursday said the United States seemed unable "to tolerate China's rise.'' 
"The U.S. always emphasizes 'rules,' but these are excuses to protect its leadership,'' the editorial said. 
"Chinese society understands the West's anxiety caused by China's rise and tries its best to adjust. China does not intend to undermine the West. The rise of China currently seeks to ensure basic standards of living. China is at least several generations away from legitimately challenging the U.S.''
After Mr. Biden's luncheon remarks, it had "learned" that Mr. Xi had "warned" President Obama against protectionist measures "in his behind-the-scenes talks.'' 
Behind the scenes is always the funnest place.
Meanwhile, the Global Times editorial suggested that China is simply misunderstood, a naif, a wide-eyed newcomer to global diplomacy. Innocents abroad, if you will. 
"The U.S. demands that China clearly state its intentions,'' the piece said. "Unfortunately, it is obvious China does not have a diplomatic master plan for the next 20 years. China is not as ambitious as people believe, but its promises are not believed."
Global Times also has been featuring on its Web site an interview with Nicholas Platt, the longtime U.S. diplomat in Asia who was with Richard Nixon on his landmark trip that "opened up China" 40 years ago this week.
Q.
Will Xi's visit set the tone for future Sino-U.S. relations? 
A.
 The U.S. and China have to realize one important thing, that the two have no other alternative but to work together. 
"We are now so intertwined economically,'' Mr. Platt continued. "Socially we may have big differences, but we are so intertwined that neither of us can take any kind of action against the other without hurting ourselves more. 
"That's a good, safe place to be. In the boxing ring, the safest place is in a clinch. When the boxers are holding each other, they are very, very close. That's the safest place, because neither can hit the other. The U.S. and China are in a clinch. We should stay that way."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Tentative Steps

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Members of a House-Senate committee charged with writing a measure to extend a payroll tax reduction and provide added unemployment benefits reached a tentative deal Tuesday evening, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. Congressional negotiators struck a deal that would extend the payroll tax rollback without requiring spending cuts to pay for it, while also extending unemployment benefits and preventing a large cut in reimbursements to doctors who accept Medicare.

        
President Obama's political standing is rising along with voters' optimism that the economy is getting better, Jim Rutenberg and Allison Kopicki report. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows a shift in Mr. Obama's approval rating that coincides with continued Republican unease with the field of candidates seeking to replace him.

        
Over the next two days, President Obama will be trying to soothe Hollywood, that longtime bastion of fund-raising dollars for Democrats, while not alienating the high-tech industry which has surged to the top of the Obama money list, Helene Cooper reports.

The Romney campaign's new focus on Michigan comes as the latest national polls show Rick Santorum surging to a tie with the former governor, Michael D. Shear reports. Mr. Romney wrote an opinion article in The Detroit News on Tuesday defending his 2008 position to "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."

HEADLINE: Santorum Takes the Lead in Ohio

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: A new poll by Quinnipiac University shows that Mitt Romney's lead has evaporated, with Mr. Santorum surging ahead. 

 BODY:
With the Ohio primary three weeks away, Rick Santorum is now leading the pack of Republican candidates in the Buckeye State, according to the newest Quinnipiac University poll. 
Mr. Santorum has the support of 36 percent of likely Republican primary voters, trailed by Mitt Romney, with 29 percent. Newt Gingrich follows at 20 percent, and Ron Paul is in last place at 9 percent. 
The state poll was released as national polls, including the latest New York Times/CBS News survey this week, showed Mr. Santorum closing in on Mr. Romney's lead as caucus and primary contests shifted to the Midwest. Thetwo leading candidates are battling for votes right now in Michigan, the home state of Mr. Romney's family and where his father was governor. 
While Michigan and Arizona hold primaries next on Feb. 28, Ohio and several other states follow on what has traditionally been called Super Tuesday, March 6. 
The Quinnipiac survey and other recent ones demonstrate how the contest continues to be in flux, with half of likely primary voters in Ohio saying they still might change their mind. 
Mr. Santorum's backing comes from key groups of Republican voters in Ohio, including white evangelical Christians, Tea Party supporters and conservatives. He is backed by 4 in 10 voters from each of these groups, while Mr. Romney has the support of about a quarter of conservatives and evangelicals, and only 1 in 5 Tea Party supporters. Mr. Romney derives his support from moderates, voters over 65 and higher-income voters. 
But neither Republican candidate bests President Obama in theoretical head-to-head matchups. If the November election were today, Mr. Obama would get 46 percent and Mr. Romney would get 44 percent. Against Mr. Santorum, Mr. Obama would pull 47 percent of the vote, and the former Pennsylvania senator would get 41 percent.
Among all registered voters, Mr. Romney's unfavorable ratings have grown in the Buckeye State - 4 in 10 have an unfavorable view of him, up from 34 percent last month. Thirty-seven percent have a favorable opinion of Mr. Romney, about the same as for Mr. Santorum. But more than 4 in 10 voters haven't heard enough about Mr. Santorum yet to form an opinion.
And to underscore its importance as a bellwether "purple" state in November's presidential contest, Ohio voters are nearly evenly divided about Mr. Obama - 47 percent say he deserves to be re-elected, and 48 percent say he does not. Mr. Obama's job approval is at 47 percent, up from a record low in December 2011 of 41 percent. And 49 percent have a favorable opinion of him, while 46 percent of Ohio voters view him unfavorably. But that 49 percent is a new high.
More say Mr. Obama cares about the needs and problems of people like them - nearly 6 in 10. More than half say the same of Mr. Santorum, but just 4 in 10 say Mr. Romney cares about their needs. 
And both Republican candidates fare well against the president in a face-off question on the economy. Forty-six percent of Ohio voters said the former Bain Capital executive would do a better job on the economy, compared to 45 percent who said Mr. Obama would. The president had a slight edge on Mr. Santorum on the economy, 45 to 43 percent. 
The Quinnipiac University poll was based on telephone interviews conducted Feb. 7 through Feb. 12 among 1,421 registered voters in Ohio, including 553 likely Republican primary voters. The margin of sampling error for all registered voters is plus or minus 3 percentage points and plus or minus 4 percentage points for primary voters.

HEADLINE: Ambitions Rekindled at Public Library

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN; Rebecca White contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The New York Public Library on Wednesday rekindled its ambitious $1 billion plan to overhaul its branches and renovate its Fifth Avenue flagship.
The plan, which will now involve selling two of the system's best-known libraries -- the Mid-Manhattan branch and the Science, Industry and Business Library -- was announced in 2008, when it was expected to be substantially completed by 2014. But the plan languished because of the economic downturn and changes in the library's leadership.
On Wednesday, though, the board gave the British architect Norman Foster approval to proceed with the next stage of designing a new circulating library inside the main branch to replace the Mid-Manhattan operation. It would be built below the Rose Reading Room, overlooking Bryant Park.
The board also approved a pilot program to expand educational programming at branch libraries. 
''We are ready to re-engage toward executing our plans,'' said Anthony W. Marx, who became the library's president in July.
Plans for two new libraries, one in Upper Manhattan and one on Staten Island, which were to cost $40 million each, have been abandoned. But the overall cost of the project still hovers around $1 billion, which includes increasing the endowment.
About $300 million will go toward renovating the main branch; $150 million will come from the city and the rest from donations and the sale of properties, including the Mid-Manhattan branch on Fifth Avenue at 40th Street, the business library on Madison Avenue at 34th Street, and the Donnell branch on West 53rd Street, which closed in 2008.
The library has already agreed to sell five floors of office space it used in the business library building, a former B. Altman department store. Now it plans to also sell its library space on the first and lower levels.
Mr. Marx said the collections and services from the business and Mid-Manhattan libraries would be incorporated into the main branch and neither building would close until that reconfiguration was done.
The library in July sold the Donnell site to Tribeca Associates and Starwood Capital Group, which will build a hotel and condominium designed by Enrique Norten to include a library.
The plan has raised concerns among librarians about their jobs and among library patrons, who fear that creating a circulating library in the main branch, now a noncirculating research library, would result in fewer books being available.
There are two main storage areas in the main library. There will still be 1.5 million books in the stacks underneath Bryant Park, library officials said. The more than two million items in the noncirculating stacks, built in 1911 under the main reading room, will be moved elsewhere in the building or into storage in New Jersey. Mr. Marx said that any book requested from New Jersey would be available at the main branch within 24 hours by scanning or delivery.
''We're going to have to make hard decisions about what should be kept there,'' he said, referring to the main branch. ''We want to ensure our unique and priceless collections are accessible.''
With the expansion the main branch will become the largest circulating library in the United States, Mr. Marx said, with publicly accessible stacks. ''We need to provide the opportunity to browse for books at a time when bookstores are closing,'' he said, adding that ''scholars and researchers should be able to enjoy the serendipity of what they find on the shelf.''
But some patrons fear crowding at the main branch, where annual attendance is expected to rise to perhaps 4 million, from 1.5 million. ''It won't be O.K.,'' said Donald Jones, 55, a Manhattan resident who uses the computers at the Mid-Manhattan branch several times a week. ''One problem I already have is crowding with the computers.''
The plan also calls for turning second-floor offices in the main branch into workspace for as many as 400 writers and researchers and for keeping the library open until 11 some nights. (The latest it stays open now is 8 p.m. two days a week.) ''We want this to be Writing Central for New York,'' Mr. Marx said.
Some trustees had questioned the viability of such an expensive plan in an economic downturn. But now most seem comfortable with it. ''I've never been more confident,'' said Marshall Rose, chairman emeritus and a co-chairman of the building committee.
To some extent the project was also stalled by a changing of the guard -- the departure of Paul LeClerc as president in July and Catherine Marron as chairwoman in September. Mr. Marx, though, said the timetable was not affected by his drunken-driving arrest in November, four months into his tenure. When he was arrested Mr. Marx was driving a library-owned car on a Sunday afternoon in East Harlem. He pleaded guilty in December, was fined $500, had his license suspended for six months and was ordered to enroll in counseling.
Library trustees say that Mr. Marx retains their full support.
''We've certainly all put it behind us,'' said Neil L. Rudenstine, a former Harvard president who became the library's chairman in September. Mr. Marx, he added, ''is one of the best people I've ever worked with.''
Mr. Marx said he had visited 82 of the system's 89 branch libraries and was enthusiastic about plans to expand their services.
''I grew up using the branch libraries,'' said Mr. Marx, who was reared in the Inwood section of Manhattan. ''They are a passion for me.''
The branches are at the heart of the library's mission, Mr. Marx said, as places where people can read, study and use computers free. That is why he is spearheading the educational pilot program to increase English and computer classes, after-school tutoring and homework help.
Mr. Rudenstine said the library hoped to bring its online catalog into public schools in a partnership with the city's Department of Education; about 50 schools already have access through a pilot program.
Statistics show that more people go to public libraries in New York City than visit all sporting events and other cultural institutions combined. But Mr. Marx said, ''We're not satisfied that we're meeting the needs of all New Yorkers.''
The library wants to hear ''what New Yorkers want their library to look like in the future,'' he said. To that end, starting Thursday the library is soliciting comments and suggestions on its Web site (nypl.org/yourlibrary).
Stephen A. Schwarzman, a trustee who donated $100 million to the library in 2008 (the main branch now bears his name), said he was glad to see the undertaking back on track. ''The whole project has got enormous vitality,'' he said. ''When it's completed, people are going to be dazzled.''

HEADLINE: Fighting Poverty, Armed With Violins

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- Corrugated tin roofs, ramshackle cinder-block huts, labyrinthine streets caked with garbage and rubble, the possibility of random violence at any turn. And this section of the Sarria barrio is not even bad for Caracas.
But Sarria also plays host to a center of El Sistema, Venezuela's program of social uplift through classical music. So just across the street from such blighted scenes young children with violins and French horns and trumpets filled the spaces of an elementary school on Tuesday. 
A brass ensemble barked in a corridor open to the Caribbean air. A percussion group rumbled in a dirt courtyard nearby. In a classroom newly hatched violinists played a G major scale and simple Venezuelan tunes after a week of learning. At least two choirs were rehearsing.
The contrast was stark but also typical of El Sistema, which was founded in 1975 but became widely known only in the last five years thanks in part to the meteoric rise of its most famous product, the conductor Gustavo Dudamel. Mr. Dudamel, 31, became music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2009 and is now in Caracas with his orchestra for a cycle of the Mahler symphonies.
''It's my goal to keep going, so I can be a great musician,'' said Emily Castaneda, 10, who began playing French horn two weeks ago and was producing honorable sounds during a lesson. Or, added Emily, whose mother is a cleaning woman and who does not know her father, she might become a doctor.
El Sistema's aim is to address a depressingly universal problem: how to remove children from poverty's snares, like drugs, crime, gangs and desperation. The method, imagined by El Sistema's founder, the economist and trained musician Jose Antonio Abreu, was classical music. Orchestras and music training centers around the country were established to occupy young people with music study and to instill values that can come from playing in ensembles: a sense of community, commitment and self-worth.
With nearly one-third of Venezuela's population of 29 million under 14, the need is large.
Since the program's founding, El Sistema estimates that it reaches 310,000 children in 280 teaching locations, called nucleos, said Eduardo Mendez, the executive director. About 500 orchestras and other ensembles, from preschool groups using paper cutouts of instruments to the world-class Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra, fall under El Sistema's umbrella. Mr. Abreu has said his goal is to reach 500,000 children by 2015.
The program has become the envy of the music world, inspiring similar programs in many countries and attracting influential proponents like the conductors Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle. It has prompted a number of books and documentaries, countless news reports and a steady flow of musicians and educators tramping through showcase nucleos.
The attention has made Sistema officials adept at playing host to visitors, who receive a warm but fairly controlled welcome, which is usually necessary in dangerous areas. These officials and Sistema fans speak in near mystical terms of Mr. Abreu and his program's results.
The populist government of Hugo Chavez is also happy with the program, pouring 540 million bolivars, about $64 million, a year into it. Foundations and donors add various amounts each year as well as gifts of instruments.
The Sarria nucleo, on the city's northern edge, is housed in a prekindergarten-through-sixth-grade school of 1,200. In an arrangement with the government it offers after-school activities from 2 to 6 p.m. for 600 children.
Sarria embodies many of the principles that seem to make El Sistema so successful. All instruction and instruments are free. No child is turned away, teaching is done in groups, and many of the instructors have passed through El Sistema themselves (and are thus committed to the movement). Public performance is ingrained from the beginning. The nucleo is within walking distance of the students' homes.
All performers are given medallions that have the image of a violin on one side and the motto ''Tocar y Luchar,'' ''To Play and to Fight,'' on the other.
''From the time they start playing and performing for others, they feel they are proud of what they are doing,'' Mr. Mendez said.
The Sarria orchestra was in the final throes of rehearsing for a concert this week. The nucleo's director, Alejandro Munoz, 32, was conducting. He is a stern figure who had already assigned some timeouts to talkative members. They were playing Handel's ''Water Music'' and ''Alma Llanera,'' considered an unofficial Venezuelan anthem that every Sistema orchestra player learns.
''The main thing in our nucleos is the quality,'' Mr. Mendez said. ''We teach them with the best quality possible.''
Mr. Munoz, a violinist, was himself born in a barrio and passed through a nucleo. ''My mother thought it would be a safe place,'' he said. He was identified as a conducting prospect and sent to a conservatory.
At Sarria the beginning violin teacher was Ismenia Molina, 51, who was one of the earliest members of the first Sistema orchestra, giving her the aura of a founder. She has been with El Sistema for 33 of her 51 years.
El Sistema also has choirs and programs to teach instrument-making and repair.
Things don't always run smoothly in the program. Tensions sometimes arise between Sistema officials and the administrators of the buildings they use. The program's growth sometimes outpaces the supply of teachers and instruments. Parents don't always cooperate in getting children to rehearsals or lessons. Instruments are stolen in this crime-ridden country.
One fact sometimes overlooked is that Sistema is also open to people from middle-class or upper-middle-class families.
The Sarria nucleo's founder, for instance, Rafael Elster, had a privileged upbringing. Mr. Abreu assigned him to set up the nucleo in 1999, and he spent 10 years there, suffering several armed robberies and the cleaning out of his house.
The majority of Sistema children do not go on to musical careers, but many come back and work for El Sistema anyway. Mr. Mendez, for instance, is a lawyer.
''Once you get touched by El Sistema,'' he said, ''you will never leave El Sistema.''

HEADLINE: Rich and Poor: The Education Gap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Poor Dropping Further Behind Rich in School'' (front page, Feb. 10):
From the civil rights movement of the 1960s to the election of the first African-American president in 2008, our country has made considerable progress in reducing the achievement gap related to race. That progress did not just happen.
I disagree with Douglas J. Besharov, a fellow at the Atlantic Council, that ''no one has the slightest idea what will work'' or that ''the cupboard is bare.'' 
There is a rich, diverse mosaic of programs, services and organizations that have intervened to create access to high-quality educational opportunities, provide academic enrichment and skill-building, ensure retention and college completion, and create career awareness and opportunities for African-Americans and other students of color. The decreasing gap is evidence that these efforts have had impact.
There are lessons to be learned from many of these efforts. What organizations have been most successful? Why have these interventions been effective in narrowing the achievement gap with race? How can we leverage best practices to attack the growing gaps in education between the rich and the poor?
We have known for some time that growing gaps in educational levels between income groups are making social and economic mobility more challenging, if not impossible. It's time to focus on what has worked so we can restore the kind of opportunity that our society is built on.
SANDRA E. TIMMONS President, A Better Chance New York, Feb. 10, 2012
To the Editor:
The cupboard of solutions isn't bare; many of today's education reforms just don't deal with the real problems.
Reduce the income gap. Adopt policies that address the effects of poverty in schools. Recognize that control and compliance reform strategies don't improve education. Make it easier to deal with ineffective teachers, but stop bashing schools.
See educators as partners in a search for solutions. Make teaching an honored profession. Spend money to attract and develop a stronger teaching force. Invest in smaller classes. Finance early-childhood education. Set high standards, but reduce the obsession with test scores. Promote smart, passionate and innovative teaching.
We know what many of the answers are. But we just have to ask the right questions first.
MICHAEL V. McGILL Superintendent of Schools Scarsdale Public Schools Scarsdale, N.Y., Feb. 11, 2012
To the Editor:
Studies showing an increasing achievement gap between rich and poor students come as no surprise. As early-childhood educators who spend time in classrooms, we have been shaken by the changes of the last decade, changes that have had a particularly devastating effect on children in poor communities.
Young children have been deprived of essential experiences -- art, music, open-ended discussion, dramatic play, exploratory use of materials -- that we know contribute to well-rounded development and engaged learning.
The pressure for narrow academic advancement is a direct result of the No Child Left Behind law. Policy makers, divorced from the lives of young children and disdainful of the knowledge of experienced teachers, have left the learner out of the equation.
These studies point to the complete bankruptcy of the No Child law, but we wonder if policy makers will draw the logical conclusions. Improvements in children's real achievement will come only with broader reforms: the development of a strong corps of teachers, in early childhood as well as in upper grades; increased support for teachers; emphasis on curriculum that is cognitively challenging and developmentally appropriate; and social reforms that support families and allow families to support their children's learning.
BETSY GROB JULIE DIAMOND New York, Feb. 12, 2012
The writers are, respectively, a member of the graduate faculty at the Bank Street College of Education, and a field supervisor of student teachers for N.Y.U. and City College, CUNY.
To the Editor:
It may not be so much the influence of economic impoverishment as the effect of emotional impoverishment that contributes to the gap in school success between the rich and the poor.
People raised in families with gaps in emotional warmth, empathy and connectedness between parents and children suffer in so many concurrent ways. They fall between the cracks socially, emotionally, intellectually as well as financially.
The emotionally deprived children may exist at any income level, but the financial resources of a wealthy community may offer more support to bridge the gaps.
From a psychoanalytic view, what is most important about these findings is the need for support in psychological-emotional areas, to foster a higher chance of achieving self-regulation, curiosity and focus, all keys for developing mastery, learning and happiness.

HEADLINE: Boeuf Bourguignon Again?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
TONIGHT, thousands of Americans will sit down to a dinner of warmed-up leftovers or delivery pizza. Their dogs and cats, meanwhile, will feast like epicureans, beneficiaries of a foodie revolution that has transformed many kitchens into four-star restaurants for pets.
Cats who used to put up with plain tuna or mackerel can now savor white-tablecloth dishes like wild salmon and whipped egg souffle with garden greens, part of Fancy Feast's Elegant Medleys line, or Outback Grill, an Australian-themed entree from Weruva, with native fish like barramundi and trevally.
Their canine cousins might be sniffing lustily as the pop-top opens on French Country Cafe, a beguiling mixture of duck, brown rice, carrots, Golden Delicious apples and peas offered by Merrick, a small family-owned company in Amarillo, Tex., or sending their taste buds to Hawaii with Kauai Luau, chicken with brown rice, sweet potato, prawns, egg, garlic and kale in a lobster consomme. The beach feast is one of the Tiki Dog flavors from Petropics, another small company.
In most American homes, menus reflect belt-tightening. Mealtimes have lost some of their luster at the high table. Down on the kitchen floor, however, the picture is rosy. 
''It is now considered socially acceptable to treat pets as members of the family and to express that by spending lavishly on them, especially when it comes to food,'' said David Lummis, the senior pet-industry analyst for Packaged Facts, a market research company.
Joe Davison, a financial adviser in San Francisco who shops at Catnip & Bones on Chestnut Street, gave his two black Labradors a culinary upgrade about four years ago. They now dine on Cowboy Cookout and Grammy's Pot Pie, two of the retro American flavors sold by Merrick.
''The dogs love it, and I believe it helps with their health and coat, but I admit that it's partly based on what looks good to me, Mr. Davison said. ''You can see green peas and pieces of potato along with the chunks of meat. It's amazingly like real people food.''
The new generation of chef-inspired pet foods accounts for no more than 5 percent of the pet-food market, but the market is big. Retail sales of dog and cat food exceeded $19 billion in 2011, according to the market research company Euromonitor International. Also, profit margins in what is sometimes called the super-premium category, a fuzzily defined niche that embraces natural, organic and gourmet pet foods, can reach 40 percent, compared with 30 percent for premium brands and 20 percent for standard brands.
Pet owners, invariably called ''pet parents'' by the makers of super-premium pet foods, do not mind reaching in their wallets and paying extra, even in recessionary times.
Two underlying forces have intensified the urge to spend: aging pets and a growing population of affluent pet owners spending money on them.
The American Pet Products Association, an industry group, found in its most recent pet-owner study that about 4 in 10 American households own a cat and almost half own a dog. Increasingly, these pets are middle-aged or elderly. The most recent edition of the American Veterinary Medical Association's ''U.S. Pet Ownership and Demographics Sourcebook,'' published in 2007, reported that about 4 in 10 of those cats and dogs were older than 6.
At the same time, Packaged Facts has reported, households with incomes of more than $70,000 accounted for nearly half of total spending on pet food in 2010, up from less than a third in 2000. A new study of the pet industry by Dillon Media reports that those making more than $100,000 a year increased their share of pet-food spending and now account for about a third of the total market.
These are precisely the health-conscious, label-scrutinizing, restaurant-going consumers likely to indulge their cats and dogs at mealtimes.
''They might cut back on a new car or taking a trip around the world, but they won't skimp on their pets,'' said Tom Nieman, the owner of Fromm Family Foods, a fourth-generation family business in Mequon, Wis. ''It's not going to happen.''
The giant pet-food companies like Nestle Purina Pet Care, the maker of Fancy Feast cat food, have taken note and added luxury lines. Purina introduced Elegant Medleys, a deluxe offshoot of Fancy Feast, in 2006, with flavors like turkey Florentine ''in a delicate sauce with garden greens,'' priced at about 20 cents more a can than Fancy Feast, which sells for about 70 cents.
In 2009, doubling down, the company brought out a line of cat appetizers in flavors like steamed tilapia and tongol tuna in broth. Packaged in two-ounce servings, as opposed to the three-ounce entree size, they sell for about $1.35, or 45 cents more than a can of Elegant Medleys. For dogs, Purina came up with Chef Michael's Canine Creations (''chef-inspired, canine-desired'') in 2009, a line of dry and wet foods in flavors like rotisserie chicken with carrot and corn garnishes. The company is adding short rib, stewed chicken and beef brisket flavors this winter. Also in 2009, Mars Petcare added bistro entrees to its Cesar dog-food brand, and Del Monte Foods introduced the Market Selectline to its Meow Mix range.
Some of the biggest winners in the super-premium race have been the mom-and-pop pet-food companies, both the established names like Fromm, Evanger and Merrick, as well as newcomers like Petropics, Blue Buffalo, Weruva and Petite Cuisine. Although no match for the likes of Purina, which controls about a third of the pet-food market, the boutique companies have registered strong growth, often in the double digits, over the past several years.
All have benefited mightily from the great pet-food recall of 2007, when contaminated gluten and rice protein from China caused fatal kidney failure in thousands of cats and dogs around the world. The contaminated protein was found in pet food manufactured by Menu Foods, a Canadian company that supplied nearly 100 pet-food brands in the United States.
Overnight, thousands of concerned pet owners shifted their allegiance to small companies with a brand identity built on using pure ingredients, often marketed as ''human grade'' and manufactured in plants that also produce canned food for humans. In some cases ingredients are packed by hand, with chunks and shreds layered for maximum eye appeal.
''A lot of midline premium brands, which still have a lot of grain and carbohydrates in them, lost traction to companies like mine,'' said Christine Hackett, who founded Petropics with her husband, Robert, in 2005 after working in research and development for PetCo.
Tiki Cat and Tiki Dog represent a fanciful, foodie niche that has, in the last five years, established a separate identity from the dozens of health-food and nutritional brands that crowd the pet-store shelves. Health-food principles remain part of the marketing pitch, but the new restaurant-style pet foods stake out new territory by targeting the susceptible salivary glands of pet parents.
''We wanted the art, the cooking, the feel of vacation,'' said Ms. Hackett, a devotee of Polynesian culture and tiki art. ''The recipes were inspired by our own dining out.'' Hence Lanai Luau for cats (tuna in crab surimi consomme) and Maui Luau for dogs (chicken with brown rice, sweet potato, egg, garlic and kale in chicken consomme). Who knew there was a Margaritaville for pets?
Mr. Nieman, at Fromm, drew on his devoted viewing of Food Network shows in formulating his ''four-star'' line of dry food for cats and dogs. The grain-free Surf and Turf for dogs, a culinary voyage in a bag, includes ingredients like wild salmon, duck, chicken and ''hand-picked'' vegetables and fruit. Wisconsin cheese adds a subtle locavore touch.
Blue Buffalo's line of bistro-inspired cat food offers time-honored classics like boeuf bourguignon. The company has a spa line as well.
Reflecting a potent trend in restaurant dining, some pet-food companies have deliberately taken a detour around haute cuisine and tapped into nostalgia for blue-plate diner specials and comfort food -- reinterpreted and updated. Merrick's canned dog food includes all-American temptations like Burger Pies and Sweetie Fries, Campfire Trout Feast and Gameday Tailgate. Cats can go regional with New England Boil (whitefish, lobster, crab, shrimp and sardines) and Southern Delight, a down-home blend of chicken, catfish and crayfish.
Weruva has introduced Cats in the Kitchen, a line of stewlike entrees with cutesy names like Pumpkin Jack Splash and Love Me Tender.
Nothing is too good, when it comes down to it, for that standoffish, persnickety fur ball that rules the house. ''You get a lot of delight in being able to plate something new and see the cat lick it clean,'' said Ms. Hackett of Petropics. ''And the cats do have the final vote.''

HEADLINE: In Reversal, Tightrope Act Above Falls Is Approved

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY - For months, Canadian officials derided funambulism as no fun at all.
Vowing to preserve the natural splendor of Niagara Falls, they refused to allow Nik Wallenda, a seventh-generation circus performer, permission to cross the gorge on a tightrope. 
But on Wednesday, bowing to an intense lobbying push by Mr. Wallenda and funambulism enthusiasts across two countries, the Canadian parks agency that oversees Niagara Falls reversed course and agreed to let the show go on.
The agency, the Niagara Parks Commission, voted unanimously to allow Mr. Wallenda to attempt his tightrope crossing, removing the last major impediment to a performance that Mr. Wallenda, 33, has called his ultimate professional dream.
''I can't explain to you the amount of emotions,'' Mr. Wallenda said in a euphoric telephone interview from Niagara Falls, Ontario, where he witnessed the vote.
''I had a few tears, but it hasn't sunk in,'' he added. ''We were told by not one, not two, but probably 50 people: 'This is impossible, not going to happen.' This is to prove that if you pursue your dream and never give up, you can achieve your dream.''
Clearing the way for the tightrope crossing has not been a simple task. But last year Mr. Wallenda sought and received approval from the New York State Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for his proposal to walk the 1,800 feet across the falls balanced on a two-inch-diameter steel cable.
The geographic direction of Mr. Wallenda's walk will be determined by weather conditions on the day of the event.
Niagara Falls has had a colorful - and occasionally fatal - history of daredevilry. But the Niagara Parks Commission, which controls the parkland on the Ontario side of the falls, has long opposed ''stunting,'' claiming it detracts from the natural majesty of the waterworks. The agency denied Mr. Wallenda's proposal in December.
Mr. Wallenda pressed the issue, taking his case to Ontario's tourism minister, who asked the parks agency to consider Mr. Wallenda's proposal further.
In a telephone interview, the commission's chairwoman, Janice Thomson, described Mr. Wallenda as a ''professional'' and said he had a well-thought-out plan for making the walk as safe as possible.
''In looking through the economic impact that can be attributed to such an event, coupled with reviewing the history of tightrope walking and realizing it is a part of our history, the commission decided to acknowledge that history by allowing the Nik Wallenda walk,'' Ms. Thomson said.
The motion approved on Wednesday requires that a final agreement be negotiated by the commission and Mr. Wallenda in the coming weeks. The New York State action passed last year granted him permission to cross the falls until late September 2012; Mr. Wallenda said his walk would most likely take place early in the month.
As part of the arrangement, the parks commission set a new policy that allows a professional stunt artist like Mr. Wallenda to perform a similar feat once every 20 years, thereby granting succeeding generations a chance to honor the area's history of stunting.
Speaking of the tightrope compromise, Ms. Thomson added, ''It is a balance.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: This Column Was 100% Made in America

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
BLUE-COLLAR workers in fields like manufacturing -- particularly when they make products on American soil -- are again becoming a favorite subject for white-collar workers on Madison Avenue.
The trend was born of the economic worries that followed the financial crisis in 2008. Recently, it is gaining steam -- appropriate, since the ads often use blasts of steam to signal something is being built -- with proposals in Washington to offer incentives to encourage the location or relocation of factories in the United States.
''We continue to see very heavy emotional response to anything that would leverage against the bad economy,'' said Robert Passikoff, president at Brand Keys, a brand and customer-loyalty consulting company in New York. 
The trend is even extending beyond advertising. For instance, ''ABC World News'' is running a series of reports under the rubric ''Made in America,'' in which anchors and reporters celebrate a preference for buying merchandise made in this country.
The most notable moment to date in the trend came on Feb. 5, when Super Bowl XLVI was played, as marketers paid NBC tens of millions of dollars to run commercials with work themes before the game, during the game and during halftime.
Those commercials included spots for General Electric, part of a campaign carrying the theme ''G.E. works,'' that celebrated products like refrigerators and turbines being built in the United States; a spot that showed a bottle of new Bud Light Platinum beer being produced in a plant that looked more like a factory than a brewery; and a spot for Hyundai, featuring workers employed at its first American factory, in Montgomery, Ala.
The Hyundai commercial, titled ''All for One,'' ''was intended to celebrate Hyundai's spirit of trying new things,'' said Steve Shannon, vice president for marketing at Hyundai Motor America. ''An example is certainly our growth and capabilities in the U.S.''
''Although we didn't develop 'All for One' specifically to communicate a 'made in the U.S.A.' message,'' he added, ''it became part of the story we wanted to tell.''
No work-themed commercial that Super Bowl Sunday drew more notice than a spot from the Chrysler Group, known as ''Halftime in America,'' which featured Clint Eastwood declaring that ''the world's going to hear the roar of our engines.'' The spot generated a national debate that was even spoofed on ''Saturday Night Live.''
The purpose of the Chrysler commercial, and the others in the genre, was summarized in a speech by Sergio Marchionne, chief executive at the Chrysler Group, to a group of dealers. The intention is ''a call to take action to reconsider and contribute to this great land's economic progress,'' he said. ''It's simply a way of saying that everyone, in this land, has the right to dream and the power to turn that dream into reality.''
Another example of the trend also arrived last week when the Tropicana Products division of PepsiCo augmented a campaign for Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice, which carries the theme ''Tap into nature,'' with ads that play up the provenance of the oranges.
''Grown, picked and squeezed in Florida,'' print ads proclaim. ''Tropicana Pure Premium is 100% pure Florida orange juice.'' In a television commercial that made its debut during the CBS coverage of the Grammy Awards, orange crates labeled ''Tropicana Pure Premium 100% Florida'' are displayed four times in 30 seconds.
Tropicana Pure Premium had been made solely with Florida oranges until 2007, when PepsiCo began mixing in oranges from Brazil.
That decision, and a similar step by the Coca-Cola Company, which sells orange juices bearing brands like Minute Maid and Simply Orange, led a competitor, Florida's Natural, part of Citrus World, to add a logo to its packages composed of an American flag and the words ''Product of U.S.A.''
(Now that Tropicana Pure Premium has returned to its all-American orange sourcing, Florida's Natural is proclaiming in ads and on its Web site: ''All Florida. Never imported. Who can say that?'')
The timing of the Tropicana Pure Premium campaign ''is based on 100 percent Florida Tropicana Pure Premium being nationally available,'' said a spokesman for Tropicana Products, Michael Torres.
In several instances, there is more to the American-centric efforts by marketers than commercials. For instance, Tropicana Products also changed the labels on packages of Tropicana Pure Premium, adding a sentence that reads ''100% pure Florida orange juice.''
And the ''G.E. works'' campaign is being accompanied by initiatives at General Electric like a four-day conference in Washington this week, meant to shine a spotlight on ''what works in America,'' as the company described it.
At the conference, Jeffrey R. Immelt, chairman and chief executive at G.E., discussed plans that include the opening of three G.E. Aviation plants in 2013, in Alabama, Mississippi and Ohio, and the company's hiring of 5,000 American veterans in the next five years.
For all the drumbeating for American workers, said Mr. Passikoff of Brand Keys, his research indicates that many consumers do not shop specifically ''for something made in one place or another'' because they have heard ''in the past 20 years so much talk of a 'global economy.' ''
For example, in the automotive category, where a car is built ''is not one of the drivers, pardon the pun'' in deciding whether or not to buy it, he added.

HEADLINE: Congress Has No Date For the Prom

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
I am shocked to report that Congress, the beating heart of American democracy, is unpopular.
Not unpopular like a shy kid in junior high. Unpopular like the Ebola virus, or zombies. Held in near-universal contempt, like TV shows about hoarders with dead cats in their kitchens. Or people who get students to call you up during dinner and ask you to give money to your old university.
The latest Gallup poll gave Congress a 10 percent approval rating. As Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado keeps pointing out, that's lower than BP during the oil spill, Nixon during Watergate or banks during the banking crisis. 
On the plus side, while 86 percent of respondents told Gallup that they disapproved of the job Congress was doing, only 4 percent said they had no opinion. That's really a great sense of public awareness, given the fact that other surveys show less than half of all Americans know who their member of Congress is.
So little attention, yet so much rancor. We're presuming that this is because of the dreaded partisan gridlock, which has made Congress increasingly unproductive in matters that do not involve the naming of post offices.
And Congress is listening! Lately, we have been seeing heartening new signs of bipartisan cooperation. For instance, the House and Senate are near an agreement on the payroll tax cut, namely that it will continue and not be paid for.
This is actually sort of a tradition. No matter who is in power in Washington, Congress has always shown a remarkable ability to band together and pass tax cuts that are not paid for. It's like naming post offices, only somewhat more expensive.
But there's much, much more. For instance, both chambers recently approved a big new ethics reform bill that would ban members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.
Perhaps you imagined that this was already against the law.
This piece of legislation had been lying around gathering dust since 2006. But, this year, the House and Senate decided to stand tall and pass it as a matter of principle. It had nothing to do with a ''60 Minutes'' report that made the whole place look like a convention of grifters. Totally unrelated. This was simply a bill whose time had come.
And that bill would probably already be signed into law were it not for a disagreement over whether to require the high-paid professionals who poke around Congress collecting information that might be of use to their Wall Street clients to register the same way lobbyists do.
You'd think this would be easy to sort out since most members of the House and the Senate have gone on the record in favor of registering these guys.
But, no, the idea ran afoul of the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, the Darth Vader of Capitol Hill. Cantor says the idea should be studied, which is, of course, legislatese for ''trampled to death by a thousand boots.''
Still, the good news is that the basic idea of prohibiting members of Congress from using the information they acquire in the course of their public duties to engage in insider trading did pass both chambers by enormous majorities.
Yippee.
And the bipartisan cooperation keeps rolling on. This week, the Senate confirmed Judge Adalberto Jose Jordan to a seat on the federal Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. A visitor from another country might not have appreciated the proportions of this achievement, given the fact that Jordan, who was born in Cuba and who once clerked for Sandra Day O'Connor, had no discernible opposition.
But Americans ought to have a better grasp of how the Senate works. The nomination's progress had long been thwarted by Mike Lee, a freshman Republican from Utah, who has decided to hold up every single White House appointment to anything out of pique over ... well, it doesn't really matter. When you're a senator, you get to do that kind of thing.
This forced the majority leader, Harry Reid, to get 60 votes to move Judge Jordan forward, which is never all that easy. Then there was further delay thanks to Rand Paul, a freshman from Kentucky, who stopped action for as long as possible because he was disturbed about foreign aid to Egypt.
All that is forgotten now. The nomination was approved, 94 to 5, only 125 days after it was unanimously O.K.'d by the Judiciary Committee. Whiners in the White House pointed out that when George W. Bush was president, circuit court nominations got to a floor vote in an average of 28 days.
No matter. Good work, Senate! Only 17 more long-pending judicial nominations to go!
Meanwhile, the House named a post office in Missouri for a fallen Marine.

HEADLINE: Shares Slide on Greece's Troubles

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks slumped on Wednesday in one of their worst showings this year as Greece slogged through negotiations with other countries over a bailout.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 97.33 points, or 0.76 percent, to close at 12,780.95. It was the worst one-day decline this year for the Dow, which narrowly avoided its first triple-digit loss for the year. The average was down as much as 125 points. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index climbed tentatively through the morning but gave up their gains by the afternoon. The S.& P. fell 7.27 points, or 0,54 percent, to 1,343.23. The Nasdaq fell 16 points, 0.55 percent, to 2,915.83.
The declines were broad, with nine of the 10 industry groups in the S.& P. recording losses. The only group that did not record a loss was materials, which was flat. Only five of the 30 stocks in the Dow rose for the day, and those just barely increased.
The price of oil climbed to its highest level in five weeks after Iran said it would cut off some exports of crude to Europe. Iran was responding to the European Union's plans to embargo Iranian oil this summer, a move meant to pressure Iran to abandon its nuclear program. Benchmark United States crude rose $1.06 to end the day at $102.14 per barrel in New York.
The average retail price for a gallon of gas was $3.52. Gas prices are already the highest on record for this time of year, and economists fear that they could crimp the halting economic recovery. This time a year ago, gas was $3.12.
Apple stock went on a wild ride. It set a new high at midday, $526.29 per share, but fell sharply and closed down $11.79 at $497.67 after eight consecutive days of gains.
The decline appeared to be caused by rumors -- apparently ungrounded -- that the Nasdaq 100 index would adjust its components to give Apple, the biggest company in the world by market value, less weight. That would force mutual funds that track the Nasdaq 100 to sell Apple stock.
The euro fell slightly against the dollar to just under $1.3065. The euro had been mostly rising since mid-January, but it topped out around $1.33 late last week.
Interest rates were barely changed. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32, to 100 20/32, and the yield fell to 1.93 percent, from 1.94 percent.
Among individual stocks, Kellogg rose 5.1 percent after announcing it would buy Pringles from Procter & Gamble.

HEADLINE: A Rare Deal

 BODY:
There's nothing like a deadline -- and the prospect of acute political embarrassment -- to concentrate the mind. With Congress about to go on recess, and with Republicans fearing a voter backlash, negotiators on Wednesday were putting the finishing touches on a deal to extend the payroll tax cut and federal jobless benefits through 2012.
The agreement is imperfect but sound. It will help struggling Americans and the struggling economy. It is also a political win for Democrats and President Obama, who had made extending the payroll tax cut and the jobless benefits a centerpiece of his jobs agenda. We hope that it gives them the courage to stick to that agenda if they face another round of Republican obstructionism. 
As recently as late last year, Republicans were refusing to renew either of the provisions -- because they did not want to raise taxes on millionaires to pay for them, as Democrats had proposed, and because they wanted to deny the president anything he asked for. In late December, they grudgingly agreed to a two-month extension. On Monday, recognizing the political cost of standing in the way of a middle-class tax cut, they dropped their demand that it be offset with additional, deep spending cuts.
The payroll tax cut will add $100 billion to the deficit, a consequence, in large part, of Republicans' refusal to raise taxes on the rich to pay it. The Republicans got an offset for the jobless benefits, whose $29 billion cost will probably be covered by requiring federal workers to contribute more to their pensions and by selling parts of the wireless spectrum. Paying for these emergency benefits was unnecessary, but the compromise seems reasonable.
The tax cut and jobless benefits will both boost families' spending money, a crucial support to the weak economy. The payroll tax cut reaches 160 million Americans, while federal jobless benefits reach some four million Americans who have been out of work for more than six months. Moody's Analytics estimates that letting the two provisions lapse would cause a large hit to demand that would result in the loss of more than 500,000 jobs in 2012.
The duration of federal jobless benefits -- which generally kick in after 26 weeks of state-provided benefits run out -- was reduced to a maximum of 73 weeks in high-unemployment states and 63 weeks in average states, compared with as much as 99 weeks currently. That's better than the 59 weeks that Republicans had called for, but it is still stingy at a time when there are 5.5 million people who have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks.
Democrats successfully blocked Republican demands to impose uncalled-for conditions on applicants for jobless benefits, including drug testing and requiring them to be high school graduates or working toward an equivalency degree. (A fig leaf requires applicants to be drug-tested if they lost their job because of a failed drug test or if they are seeking a job that generally requires a drug test.)
To avert a 27 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors, the deal makes a more problematic $21 billion cut from health care spending, including a $5 billion cut to a disease-prevention fund, which President Obama had also proposed cutting. These cuts, like the pain being imposed on federal workers, could have been avoided if the rich had been asked to pay slightly higher taxes.
A vote in both chambers is scheduled before the upcoming recess, and already some of the most conservative Republicans are grumbling about it. But, for now, this is a refreshing change. Republican leaders deserve credit for agreeing to the deal, as do Democratic leaders for insisting on doing the right thing for the economy.

HEADLINE: Sunni Extremists May Be Aiding Al Qaeda's Ambitions in Syria, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and THOM SHANKER; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Sunni extremists, including fighters linked to Al Qaeda's franchise in neighboring Iraq, are likely responsible for two big recent bombings in the Syrian capital as well as attacks on Friday in Aleppo, the country's largest city, American officials said Wednesday.
As the violence in Syria escalates, several analysts said, Al Qaeda is seeking to exploit the turmoil and reinvigorate its regional ambitions after being sidelined in the initial popular uprisings of the Arab Spring a year ago. 
The precise role of the Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda in Syria is unclear. Some intelligence officials and diplomats in Washington, Baghdad and Beirut, Lebanon, said the Qaeda franchise was responsible for the deadly bombings in Aleppo last week and in Damascus, the capital, on Dec. 23 and Jan. 6, which killed scores of people. But they acknowledged that they did not have the forensic or electronic intercept evidence to prove it.
Other officials said Sunni fighters loosely affiliated with Al Qaeda but not directly controlled by the terrorist group may also have been involved, operating in common cause with but independently of pro-democracy forces seeking to topple the embattled government of President Bashar al-Assad.
''It appears to be a very complicated mixture of networks that are fighting the Syrian government, including individuals associated with Al Qaeda in Iraq,'' said Seth G. Jones, a political scientist at the RAND Corporation and the author of the coming book ''Hunting in the Shadows: The Pursuit of Al Qa'ida Since 9/11.''
Other experts agreed, saying Sunni extremists -- some of whom have returned from Iraq to fight in Syria -- also have the expertise to carry out large-scale bombings.
''There are plenty of people with that kind of know-how in Syria,'' said Andrew Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the author of a recent book on Syrian-American relations. ''The Assad regime helped invent the car bomb, and they have used it brilliantly to pursue their foreign policy goals. It could be Al Qaeda or simply those with a similar background carrying it out.''
Or as Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put it during Senate testimony on Tuesday, ''Those who would like to foment a Sunni-Shia standoff -- and you know who they are -- are all weighing in in Syria.''
The Syrian government has always argued that it was fighting foreign terrorists, including some from Al Qaeda, a charge dismissed as propaganda by the Syrian activists leading the uprising.
But some American officials now say Al Qaeda in Iraq, whose membership has declined substantially in recent years, is trying to take advantage of the violence in Syria and perhaps even hijack the popular uprising against the Syrian government.
Al Qaeda was caught off guard by the Arab Spring's largely nonviolent, secular revolutions fueled by social media. The death of Osama bin Laden in May dealt the organization another major blow, and it has been seeking a foothold ever since.
''It comes as no surprise that Al Qaeda's Iraq affiliate, through its networks in Syria, might attempt to seem relevant by going after the Assad regime,'' said an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the assessment contained classified information. ''It is opportunism, plain and simple.''
Indeed, Ayman al-Zawahri, who succeeded Bin Laden as the leader of Al Qaeda worldwide, issued a statement on Saturday urging Muslims in the region -- he specifically mentioned Iraq -- to support the uprising, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist communications.
The debate over Al Qaeda's role in Syria came as the United States government on Wednesday offered to help any post-Assad government secure Syria's stockpiles of chemical weapons and portable antiaircraft missiles.
With violence rising and the political outcome wholly uncertain, American officials acknowledged that the effort to secure Syria's unconventional weapons remained speculative.
But the high-level comments underscored concerns that the chaotic situation in Syria may offer opportunities for terrorist organizations to acquire chemical weapons or a type of shoulder-launched missile sought by militants to shoot down commercial airliners.
The American intelligence community is monitoring Syria's weapons stockpiles, officials said, even as it attempts to increase its efforts to gather information about and assessments of the opposition militia leadership.
''We would certainly be prepared to work with any successor government to help them secure control of those weapons with a goal to destroying them,'' said Thomas Countryman, the assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation.
''First priority: to secure. Second priority: to destroy,'' he said during a breakfast meeting with reporters. ''How exactly you do that in a situation in which the new government has not firmly established its authority or its security control over the country is only speculative at this point.''
A similar American effort is securing and destroying the Qaddafi government's stockpile of chemical weapons in Libya.
But there is a significant difference: Libya had signed an international chemical weapons treaty, and thus had declared the location and size of its stockpiles. Syria has not signed the convention, although American officials said they had a fairly clear idea of where the Assad government stored its chemical weapons.
The United States also hopes to replicate in Syria its efforts to help the new Libyan government account for an estimated 20,000 shoulder-launched antiaircraft missiles held by the Qaddafi government before it fell, a project in which the United States is enlisting the assistance of Libya's neighbors. A significant number of those Libyan missiles were destroyed, and an additional 5,000 have been tallied, Mr. Countryman said.
Syria's stockpile of shoulder-launched, antiaircraft missiles is believed to number in the tens of thousands, an arsenal that ''we don't wish to see to fall into terrorist hands,'' Mr. Countryman said.
He also said Iran and Russia were continuing to supply Syria with conventional armaments that could be used against militia forces and civilians opposing the Assad government. He did not provide details on the types of weapons.

HEADLINE: 3 Former Olympus Executives Charged in Fraud Scandal

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO (Reuters) -- Three former executives of Olympus Corporation, the medical equipment and camera maker, were arrested on Thursday in connection with a $1.7 billion accounting fraud, one of Japan's biggest corporate scandals.
The three had been identified by an investigative panel, commissioned by the company, as the main culprits in the fraud, which sought to delay the reckoning from risky investments that Olympus, like many Japanese companies, made in the late-1980s bubble economy.
Tokyo prosecutors arrested Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, a former president, Hisashi Mori, a former executive vice president, and Hideo Yamada, a former auditor, on suspicion of violating the financial instruments and exchange law, officials said in a statement. 
Also arrested were four others, including the former bankers Akio Nakagawa and Nobumasa Yokoo, suspected of helping the executives hide huge investment losses through complex merger and acquisition deals.
Investors have been focused on who will run the once-proud company when its management steps down at an April 20 shareholders meeting, and whether Olympus will seek a capital tie-up to fix its balance sheet.
Olympus would like that April meeting to be a turning point in the scandal, with at least six of its 11-member board, including its president, Shuichi Takayama, set to resign.
His successor is likely to be one of three board members the panel said were not responsible for the cover-up -- Masataka Suzuki, Kazuhiro Watanabe and Shinichi Nishigaki -- said a source familiar with the matter, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Last year, the investigative panel found that the three arrested former executives had played leading roles in a 13-year scheme to hide the losses, and they were among 19 executives Olympus sued over the scandal.
The panel said it found no evidence of involvement by organized crime, despite speculation that ''yakuza'' gangsters were somehow involved in the cover-up scheme.
An Olympus spokesman said the company would cooperate fully with the investigative authorities. The company is also under investigation by law enforcement agencies in Japan, Britain and the United States.
Mr. Kikukawa's condominium was among 20 sites raided in December by prosecutors. Mr. Kikukawa, who took over as president in 2001, was reportedly aware of the details of the cover-up.
Mr. Nakagawa, who began his banking career at Nomura Securities, was a founding member of the Axes group, which was awarded a $687 million advisory fee for Olympus' acquisition in 2008 of the British medical equipment firm Gyrus that was at the heart of the scandal.
Mr. Yokoo, another ex-Nomura banker, ran a consulting firm, Global Company, which was hired by Olympus in 2000 to scout for new businesses and steered investment into three small money-losing Japanese firms.
The scandal was exposed last October by its chief executive at the time, Michael Woodford, a rare foreign chief executive in Japan, who was ousted by the Olympus board after questioning dubious merger and acquisition deals that were later found to have been used to conceal the losses.
The fraud fanned concerns about lax corporate governance in Japan over all.
In December, Olympus filed five years' worth of corrected financial statements and overdue first-half results, revealing a $1.1 billion dent in its balance sheet, leading to talk that it would need to merge or forge a business tie-up to raise capital.
On Monday, it forecast a $410 million full-year loss, largely because of its ailing camera operations, but its core endoscope business appeared unscathed by the scandal, and its president said the firm might not need outside capital.
On Thursday in Tokyo, Olympus shares were down 1.8 percent to 1,280 yen, or about $16.30, in a flat overall market.

HEADLINE: Auto Production Helps Buoy Factory Output

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Manufacturing output rose in January and a gauge of factory activity in New York state hit an 18-month high in February, showing a solid underpinning for the economic recovery. 
Another report on Wednesday that showed optimism among home builders approached a five-year high this month, a good omen for the struggling housing market.
The reports added to a run of fairly upbeat data, even though overall industrial production was flat last month as unusually mild winter weather weighed on utility output.
''What we are seeing here is confirmation of the positive momentum we have seen in the economy over the past few months,'' said Millan Mulraine, senior macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.
Factory production increased 0.7 percent, the Federal Reserve said, after an upwardly revised 1.5 percent rise in December. The December increase was previously reported as a 0.9 percent gain.
Manufacturing was buoyed by a 6.8 percent jump in motor vehicle output. But production at utilities plunged 2.5 percent, the second straight month of big declines.
A 1.8 percent drop in mining production, the first decline in almost a year, also helped damp industrial output last month. However, overall production was stronger than first thought in December, rising 1 percent as opposed to the previously reported 0.4 percent gain.
A report from the New York Federal Reserve showed a gauge of factory activity in New York state rose to its highest level in more than 1 1/2 years in February.
However, slowing new orders and further declines in unfilled orders suggested activity in that region could be close to peaking. There was a rise in shipments and companies increased hours for existing workers.
Capacity use in manufacturing rose in January to 77.0 percent, the highest since April 2008.
There are also signs of growth in the housing market, which has been a drag on the economy, with confidence among home builders the highest this month since May 2007.

HEADLINE: Euro Zone's Economy Shrank in Fourth Quarter

BYLINE: By JACK EWING AND DAVID JOLLY; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and David Jolly from Paris.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Five members of the euro zone, including Italy, fell into recession in the final quarter of 2011, official data showed Wednesday, as the sovereign debt crisis and the imposition of austerity measures discouraged consumers from spending and businesses from investing. But the zone's two largest economies, France and Germany, held up better than expected.
The 17-nation euro zone contracted by 0.3 percent from the third quarter of the year, Eurostat, the European statistics agency said -- the first such decline since the second quarter of 2009. That contraction was smaller than the 0.4 percent economists had expected, but the pain was nonetheless acute among smaller countries and in Southern Europe -- ground zero of the debt crisis. 
German output fell 0.2 percent in the quarter, less than expected, while France surprised economists with 0.2 percent growth, defying expectations of a decline as exports of Airbus planes bolstered exports and business investment increased.
The data were ''a bit reassuring,'' said Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, even if the weakness should continue through the first quarter of 2012. ''This shows that Europe is not going into freefall, it's not like the post-Lehman crisis.''
''The key for the outlook,'' Mr. Schulz continued, ''remains whether the debt crisis can be contained. For the moment, the markets are giving Europe the benefit of the doubt,'' meaning countries that are not carrying out big fiscal adjustments -- like Germany -- could be growing again by the second quarter.
The leaden pace of activity in the euro zone, which grew 0.7 percent from a year earlier, compares unfavorably with the United States, which grew by 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2010. The British economy grew 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 2010.
''It could have been worse,'' Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank, said of the euro zone data in a note to clients. The figures ''clearly indicate that 'core' euro zone economies generally were less affected by the escalating debt crisis than peripheral economies, which seems to make sense given that the financial turmoil and austerity efforts are concentrated in the latter part of the region.''
Five euro zone countries had at least two quarters in a row of declining output, the generally accepted definition of a recession. They were Greece, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy. France and Slovakia were the only euro zone countries to report quarterly growth. The Spanish economy shrank by 0.3 percent, following a flat third quarter.
In Italy, where Prime Minister Mario Monti's government is struggling to reduce debt and restore investor confidence, the national statistics agency, Istat, said the economy contracted for a second straight quarter, shrinking by 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter from the prior three months, and by 0.5 percent from a year earlier.
Defense Minister Giampaolo Di Paola said Wednesday that Italy would save money by buying cutting military spending, including buying fewer Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets than it originally ordered. Mr. Di Paola told legislators that Italy would buy 90 warplanes instead of the 131 it had initially ordered, Reuters reported.
A European fiscal compact agreed to in December and a move by the European Central Bank to allow banks to borrow almost unlimited sums at 1 percent interest for three years have helped to ease the sense of crisis in the bloc.
Economists are fairly optimistic that the slowdown in Germany, the largest economy in Europe, will be fairly short lived. That raises hopes that Germany and some other countries will grow strongly enough to help compensate for the abysmal economic performance of countries like Greece and Italy.
The euro zone probably has continued to shrink in early 2012, meaning that the region is in recession, Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank said in a note. But he added, ''Then the worst is probably over.''
David Jolly reported from Paris.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For London Youth, Down and Out Is Way of Life

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- For almost two years, Nicki Edwards has been looking for work -- any type of work.
She is 19 years old, well-spoken and self-possessed. But like many young people in Britain, she could not afford to remain at her university, making it impossible to find a job. London's youth riots last summer have closed even more doors to people like her.
''If you are not working, in training or in college, you might as well be a thief -- employers just do not take you seriously,'' Ms. Edwards said. ''At some point, you just say, 'I'm stuck and I will never find a job.' ''
Perhaps the most debilitating consequence of the euro zone's economic downturn and its debt-driven austerity crusade has been the soaring rate of youth unemployment. Spain's jobless rate for people ages 16 to 24 is approaching 50 percent. Greece's is 48 percent, and Portugal's and Italy's, 30 percent. Here in Britain, the rate is 22.3 percent, the highest since such data began being collected in 1992. (The comparable rate for Americans is 18 percent.) 
The lack of opportunity is feeding a mounting alienation and anger among young people across Europe -- animus that threatens to poison the aspirations of a generation and has already served as a wellspring for a number of violent protests in European cities from Athens to London. And new economic data on Wednesday, showing much of Europe in the doldrums or recession, does little to bolster hopes for a better jobs picture anytime soon.
Experts say that the majority of those who took to the streets in London last summer were young people who were unemployed, out of school and not participating in a job training program.
Classified by statisticians as NEETs (not in education, employment or training), they number about 1.3 million, or one of every five 16-to-24-year-olds in the country.
While youth unemployment has long been a chronic issue here, experts say the British government's debt-reduction commitment to rein in social spending appears to be making the problem worse, experts say. Insufficient job training and apprenticeship programs, they argue, contribute to the large pool of permanently unemployed young people in Britain.
''It is patently wrong for young people to have such a poor start in life, when there is so much more we could be doing,'' said Hilary Steedman, an economist at the London School of Economics. ''Just because they did not go to university does not mean they don't want to work.''
Many young people here spend endless months applying for technical jobs for which they do not have adequate training. In many cases, months turn into years, with people remaining on the dole indefinitely. In the most recent fiscal year, the government paid $:4.2 billion ($6.6 billion) in benefits to this age group, at least some of which might be better spent on job training, some experts argue.
''A well-financed apprenticeship program is an important social investment that can enhance the competitive capacity of an economy,'' said John P. Martin, an economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, who studies labor market issues across Europe.
Ms. Steedman, a specialist in vocational training, said that Britain lags far behind countries like Germany, Austria and the Netherlands in its use of training programs to introduce young people to permanent work.
Fewer than one in 10 employers in Britain offered apprenticeships in 2010, she said, compared with at least a quarter of employers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. And while government financing for such programs has increased in the last few years, Ms. Steedman said that much of the money went to training existing workers 25 years and older rather than building the skills of 18-to-20-year-olds.
''It's completely perverse,'' she said, pointing out that 40 percent of the 500,000 or so apprenticeships go to people age 25 or older. ''Companies are subsidizing 25-year-olds who already have jobs.''
Ms. Edwards, for her part, completed two years at Greenford College, in London, before leaving last March because she could no longer afford the cost. She had hopes of pursuing a career in mental health, but now has narrowed her ambitions to taking care of children or the elderly.
Despite her inability to find a job, she keeps trying almost daily, filling out resumes online, handing them out in person and stomaching the shame she feels in having to accept government benefits.
''I don't want to get paid by the government,'' said Ms. Edwards, who lives in West London. ''But what am I supposed to do? People can't get jobs.''
James Lawson, 18, is also desperately looking for a job. He lives in a rent-subsidized youth hostel in the Hammersmith section of West London, and barely gets by on the $:103 ($163) in unemployment benefits he receives every two weeks.
With his limited education and experience Mr. Lawson sees an apprenticeship as his only hope. He recently completed an information technology training course at a local academy. But the training led nowhere, so now he is resting his hopes on securing an apprenticeship at the British military contractor BAE Systems that promises -- if he can secure one of the few positions -- to provide him training as an electrical engineer.
''I wake up every morning and say to myself, 'I don't have a job,' '' he said. ''But I have to stay positive -- even if it means taking a thousand noes to get that one yes.''
Neither Mr. Lawson nor Ms. Edwards participated in last summer's riots. They both say, however, that they understand the frustrations that pushed many of their peers to break the law.
One 19-year-old who admits he looted during the July disturbances says he has now joined a gang and taken to petty burglaries to make ends meet.
''I just don't care anymore,'' he said, declining to identify himself. ''I am sick of living like rubbish.''
Even those who stayed in school are struggling to find work.
Tam Chowdhury, 25, graduated from Southbank University in London in 2010 with a criminology and law degree. Out of the 105 positions she applied for, she said, she secured just two interviews.
''Even if you have qualifications, it can be really tough,'' said Ms. Chowdhury, who works at Tomorrow's People, a charity in London that provides training and preparation for disadvantaged young people looking to enter the job market.
While the recession is clearly making it harder for the young in Britain and across Europe to find work, economists argue that without a strategic partnership between the government and the private sector that trains those who want to be trained, youth unemployment in many countries will remain high even after the economy recovers.
Mr. Martin, of the O.E.C.D., said that the European countries that supported apprenticeship programs -- Germany, Austria and the Netherlands -- had also managed to sustain robust manufacturing and export industries.
In other economies, the cooperation among employers, government and unions is not as strong. ''In England, for example, many employers prefer to poach skilled labor,'' Mr. Martin said.
None of which comes as news to Stefan Radanovic, 19, who says he has applied for hundreds of jobs in customer service or sales.
He is looking for a job in the music industry but is willing to do anything to help support himself and his single mother, with whom he lives in the Ealing district of West London.
Mr. Radanovic presents a confident and polite appearance -- all he wants, he says, is a chance -- although he understands why he has not yet received one.
''I don't blame them,'' he said of the countless employers who have ignored his resume. ''They just don't want to train you.''

HEADLINE: Growth Slow, but Fed Says More Easing Is Not Likely

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is not inclined to begin a round of asset purchases unless economic conditions deteriorate, according to the minutes of the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee.
The Fed's leaders did not see evidence that growth is accelerating, according to the minutes of the committee's Jan. 24-25 meeting, released Wednesday. The central bank continued to forecast that the domestic economy would grow only modestly over the next year.
But most members of the Fed's policy-making committee agreed that slow growth was not a sufficient reason to expand the central bank's economic aid campaign. Only ''a few'' argued the Fed should try harder to address problems like the persistently high rate of unemployment, the minutes said. 
The Fed has not expanded its portfolio in more than half a year, and the minutes suggested it was unlikely to do so unless ''the economy lost momentum'' or inflation fell below 2 percent and seemed likely to stay for a while.
''Given that the incoming economic data since that meeting has only been more positive,'' Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday, ''there is now little chance of the Fed launching another round of large-scale asset purchases'' in the next few months.
The Fed's forecast that the United States economy will expand 2.7 percent this year remains significantly more upbeat than the predictions of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. According to the minutes, Fed officials think that if the bank's forecast is wrong, it is more likely that growth will be slower than they expect.
The minutes, released three weeks after each meeting of the policy-making committee, offer a laundry list of reasons for concern:
''The slowdown in economic activity abroad,'' begins the sobering list. ''Fiscal tightening in the United States, the weak housing market, further household deleveraging, high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses, and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets until the fiscal and banking issues in the euro area are more fully addressed.''
Under the influence of those concerns, the committee voted with surprisingly little discussion -- at least according to the minutes, actually a summary rather than a transcript -- to announce the Fed's intention to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least until late 2014. The decision, which surprised investors, extended the Fed's previous declaration of intent to keep rates near zero until mid-2013.
The Fed has held rates near zero since late 2008, seeking to spur economic activity by punishing savers and rewarding borrowers. It also has amassed nearly $3 trillion in assets, including government debt and mortgage-backed securities, to make borrowing even cheaper for businesses and consumers.
The minutes make clear that the Fed intends to continue this huge stimulus campaign for years to come.
The central bank does not plan to unwind its portfolio until it starts to raise interest rates, meaning that it currently projects that the first asset sales would happen no sooner than early in 2015.
The committee continues to debate the expansion of those efforts, according to the minutes. A vocal minority believes the central bank already has done too much.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, told reporters Wednesday after a speech in Texas that the prospect of additional asset purchases was ''a fantasy of Wall Street,'' according to wire services.
''It's not going to happen; it's not necessary,'' said Mr. Fisher, who has long opposed the idea. He is not a voting member of the committee this year.
Other Fed officials, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have been careful to leave the door open, offering variants on the commitment expressed in the minutes that the Fed will respond to economic developments as necessary.
And an increasingly assertive group wants action now.
''In their judgment, current and prospective economic conditions -- including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the committee's objective -- could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long,'' said the minutes, which do not describe who holds this view.
The list appears to include Fed Governor Daniel K. Tarullo, who called last year for the Fed to consider buying more mortgage-backed securities.
It also may include John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
''It's vital that we keep the monetary policy throttle wide open,'' Mr. Williams said in a speech last week, although he did not mention asset purchases specifically.

HEADLINE: Doubting Greeks' Resolve, Euro Zone May Hold Back Full Bailout

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH and STEPHEN CASTLE; Nicholas Kulish reported from Berlin, and Stephen Castle from Brussels. Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Distrustful of Greek politicians, European leaders considered a plan on Wednesday to hold back a significant share of the $171 billion bailout for the deeply indebted country even if Athens passes the austerity measures demanded by its international lenders.
''Statements and assurances from Greece are no longer taken at face value,'' said Wolfram Schrettl, professor of economics at the Free University in Berlin. ''There is a growing belief that Greece is looking for a sucker -- and Germany's playing the sucker.'' 
Financial experts say they still expect the deal to go through in some form, but the haggling and potential changes -- spiced by a remark from the Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, that ''there are many in the euro zone who don't want us anymore'' -- were enough to send financial markets reeling in Europe and the United States.
In a conference call on Wednesday evening, the European finance ministers discussed a plan under which they might pay only about $40 billion to help reach a deal with private-sector bondholders and assure that Greece could meet a $19 billion bond payment in late March. But under that plan they would not sign off on the rest of the package until a new Greek government is formed after parliamentary elections in April.
The issue holding up a deal was not financial but political, officials said. Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who leads the group of euro zone finance ministers, said that stronger oversight was necessary to ensure that the Greek government put austerity measures and economic restructuring into effect. But Mr. Juncker stopped short of saying that the rescue funds would be released, a decision that has been deferred until a meeting of the finance ministers in Brussels on Monday.
Officials in other European capitals fear that if Greece is given the entire bailout at once, politicians in Athens will ease up on the politically unpopular measures, yielding to the pressure of a people who are fed up with austerity. The officials remained skeptical despite receiving written pledges on Wednesday from Greek leaders, who said they would adhere to the terms of the bailout agreement even after parliamentary elections.
''Who will ensure afterward that Greece continues to stand by what Greece is agreeing to now?'' Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said in a radio interview. He said he ''had doubts'' that Greece would fulfill all of the requirements.
The tougher stance reflects a growing belief that Europe could weather a default by Greece and its subsequent departure from the euro zone, and that such a move would not destabilize financially shaky countries like Portugal, Spain and even Italy. In a sign of the poisonous atmosphere that is coloring the discussions, the Greek president, Karolos Papoulias, accused Mr. Schauble of insulting his country.
''We all have the obligation to make the effort to get through this crisis. I will not accept Mr. Schauble reviling my country. I don't accept this as a Greek,'' Mr. Papoulias told members of the Greek armed forces during a visit to the Defense Ministry. ''Who is Mr. Schauble to revile Greece? Who are the Dutch? Who are the Finns? We always had the pride to defend not only our own country but the freedom of Europe.''
Further eroding support for Greece is the rising concern that even if the nation's politicians follow through on the required overhaul, it will not be enough to put the country back on a sustainable track. Greece's economy shrank 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, even faster than projected, making its fiscal goals that much harder to achieve.
''Austerity is like every potent medicine; an overdose of it can kill the patient,'' said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London. ''The tragedy of Greece is that they overdelivered on the austerity and underdelivered on the structural reforms; as a result, Greece is in a big mess.''
Though Germany is by no means alone in its skepticism, the conflict has increasingly become a two-nation affair. Protesters in Greece have burned German flags, and a rising chorus in Germany has called for the Greeks to be kicked out of the euro zone. The chief executive of the powerful industrial company Bosch on Wednesday became the latest high-profile figure to call for a Greek exit.
The conference call on Wednesday came after Mr. Juncker canceled a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels. Greece's international lenders have demanded details on how Athens plans to make up a shortfall of $430 million in required budget savings after Greek political leaders insisted on limiting cuts to pensions. Mr. Juncker said those measures had now been identified.
But officials in Brussels cautioned that big doubts remained. ''We've seen things moving in the last few days,'' said one euro zone official who was not authorized to speak publicly, ''but not quickly enough. The Greeks have to help us to help them.'' Another official said that there were still not enough details about the additional savings.

HEADLINE: An Early Eco-City Faces the Future

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
CORDES JUNCTION, Ariz.
THE pilgrimage began with a black-and-white handbill on a campus bulletin board. At the top was a sketch of an ultramodern compound rising above a desert canyon: a city upon a hill.
Next came the manifesto. ''If you are truly concerned about the problems of pollution, waste, energy depletion, land, water, air and biological conservation, poverty, segregation, intolerance, population containment, fear and disillusionment,'' the poster began. Then, at the bottom, the remedy: ''Join us.''
Occupying the middle of nowhere must have appealed to the students, architects and seekers of the 1970s who founded Arcosanti, an ''urban laboratory'' in the desert 70 miles north of Phoenix. After following a washboard road to the desolate camp, they would find a kind of kibbutz. Here, in workshops, they might build a 30-foot-high concrete vault or plant olive trees or cast bells in silt to sell for construction money. 
Above all, they were able to join an ongoing colloquy with the city's visionary designer, Paolo Soleri. In a cosmic language of his own invention (filled with phrases like the ''omega seed'' and ''miniaturization-complexity-duration''), Mr. Soleri proselytized for a carless society in harmony with the natural world. Over the course of 40 years, some 7,000 souls would come and go.
For the most part, though, they left. And last fall, Mr. Soleri joined this group himself, retiring at age 92 as the president of the parent Cosanti Foundation.
Now, Arcosanti is experiencing its own version of Cuba's ''special period'': a transitional era of privation and possibility. And the man who would be Raul Castro in this analogy is the foundation's new president, Jeff Stein, 60, formerly dean of the Boston Architectural College.
As a resident of Arcosanti in its heyday, ''he has all the qualities to be the guardian of the faith,'' said Michel Sarda, 69, a foundation trustee and a publisher of Mr. Soleri's books.
But if Mr. Stein can't miraculously transform Arcosanti into a dense eco-city for 5,000 residents -- and that was always Mr. Soleri's plan -- what should it become instead?
Mr. Sarda speaks enthusiastically about building a retirement tower for golf-shy retirees and the project's alumni. Mr. Stein's immediate proposals are more modest: a canopy for the outdoor amphitheater, a renovated commercial bakery, a storage unit for Mr. Soleri's collection of fantastical architectural models and a half-dozen new apartments.
Whatever Mr. Stein may wish to do, for now it will have to be accomplished with an operating budget of less than $1 million. That annual sum includes payroll, utilities, food, building materials, insurance: everything. It is, by his estimation, about a 10th of what the community needs to build new housing and attract new residents and businesses. That is, to turn a somewhat derelict complex of a dozen-odd concrete structures into something more like a city.
His first job, perhaps, is to become an ambassador: to remind the world that Arcosanti exists as a going concern. Visitors (and some 25,000 stop here each year) often observe that this city of the future seems more like a city of the past. Part Mos Eisley, part Ozymandias. But that description fails to account for the 56 inspired souls who continue to live and work and dream in the Arcosanti that exists today.
One such latter-day disciple is Maureen Connaughton, 37, who until last year was a project manager in Philadelphia for a specialty fabrication company. On a cold Tuesday night in January, Ms. Connaughton was sitting with Mr. Stein and a few dozen of her fellow Arconauts in the dining hall, known as Crafts III in the local dialect, tucking into a community meal of breaded pork chops and fried tofu. They were bundled in sweaters and hats and Carhartt jackets. Mr. Soleri may have shown a genius for passive solar design, but at Arcosanti he didn't really do central heat.
If you were an optimist, like Ms. Connaughton, who lives in an apartment beneath the cafe and dining hall, you might note that it's easy to sleep in the cool Arizona winter. Yes, the building's aging concrete has a habit of flaking onto your bed. But ''what you get in exchange is just so worth it,'' she said. ''To have this big round window and look out at the canyon.''
At a fall building workshop here in 2010, she discovered how much she liked working with her hands. This is the opposite of the paper shuffling (or, worse, paperless shuffling) that defines the modern office job. Back in Philadelphia, Ms. Connaughton loaded up the car (''I need a lot less stuff than I did before,'' she said) and headed west to cast ceramic wind bells.
''I really heard all the good and bad things people say about it being set in the past,'' she said of Arcosanti, sipping a $2 glass of wine from the cafe's tiny liquor cabinet. ''And I want to see it set in the present. Because it's my present.''
DURING Mr. Soleri's long tenure, Arcosanti evolved into a surprising anachronism: a company town. The product line? Handmade bells and heady theories about imaginary cities, or ''arcologies.'' Ordinary capitalism -- independent businesses and privately held homes -- was anathema.
Mr. Soleri never bought into the standard American real estate hustle, Mr. Sarda recalled. ''He would say, 'Developer: it starts with 'D,' like 'devil' and 'demon,' '' Mr. Sarda said. ''I cannot say that Paolo is a man of compromise.''
Or as one longtime foundry worker put it, ''Who ever tried to build a city by selling art?''
At the most basic level, Mr. Stein seems to share Mr. Soleri's knack for avoiding personal wealth. ''The typical American c.e.o. makes 325 times what the company's average worker earns,'' Mr. Stein said. As the new director, ''I'm two times the average salary.'' And at Arcosanti, the average salary is minimum wage.
Yet smart young volunteers continue to trek here from faraway places like Australia, South Korea, Mexico, Chile, Italy and Jordan, paying to enroll in the construction workshops. A few of these folks will decide to stay, taking a job on site.
The commute can't be beat. The Wi-Fi signal is strong. And residents pay just $160 a month for room and board. Yes, the room might be an unheated 8-by-8-foot cube in the psychedelic shantytown known as Construction Camp. But this is part of the experience, or the experiment, or whatever you want to call it.
''There are intentional communities all over the country,'' Mr. Stein said. ''This isn't one of them. It's almost an accidental community. People were drawn here by Paolo Soleri and the power of his ideas. And by the beauty of the place.''
The architectural intern Youngsoo Kim, 32, followed the beacon of Mr. Soleri's writing to this sparse outpost from the megalopolis of Seoul.
On a bright Wednesday morning, Mr. Kim and his colleague Yasaman Esmaili were stretching a measuring tape across the curved concrete entryways of the East Crescent. This development (unfinished, of course) includes an outdoor amphitheater, administrative offices, a rec room, a handful of residences, the Soleri archives and the scenic guest quarters called the Sky Suite.
Though the cubes and apses of Arcosanti have been sketched and photographed in countless books and exhibitions, the site and building utilities are more of a mystery. In simpler terms, no one seems to have the foggiest idea where to find a light switch.
Prompted by Mr. Stein, the pair has been trying to remedy this situation, assembling up-to-date building information models. The construction ''could have been done much better,'' Mr. Kim said. ''But it was also meaningful for it to be built by the people who learned the concept.''
The great masses of concrete act as a thermal sink, absorbing heat during the molten days and then radiating warmth at night. But the compound's heating, windows and insulation -- the foundations of most green building -- seem to have been an afterthought. Ms. Esmaili, a 26-year-old graduate of the University of Tehran, hopes to study these systems while she waits to hear from Ph.D. programs.
Mr. Soleri originally envisioned a series of greenhouses that would occupy the hill below the complex. Hot air would rise from these conservatories into a complex of tunnels that could heat the East Crescent. At present, two trial greenhouses have been finished. For now, a single volunteer has been charged with growing what she can. For better or worse, the national food-gardening craze seems to have skipped Arcosanti.
Meanwhile, the project has only dabbled in popular technologies like solar panels, rain barrels and composting toilets, off-the-shelf gear that can be applied on a small scale.
''I should have them,'' Mr. Soleri said during a recent visit to the project. Yet for most Americans, he maintained, chasing these technologies can become a game unto itself. ''We are passionate collectors of gadgetries,'' he said. ''We can't resist.''
Mr. Soleri likes to say that he ''is a scatterbrain at this point.'' But he still projects a commanding presence. Upon meeting a visitor outside on a frigid morning, he raised his hand and waved it to the side, as if to say, ''Kindly step out of my sunlight!''
He seemed more comfortable after an espresso, back in his former apartment, a vaguely austere 700-square-foot studio with a two-burner cooktop and an open shower next to the toilet. The paint and the carpeting, now 30 years old, seem to be original. But then, no one ever accused Mr. Soleri of personal extravagance. As Mr. Kim said, ''His humbleness and frugality shocked me.''
For several years, Mr. Soleri has lived in a tumbledown ranch at the nonprofit's Cosanti campus, on the outskirts of Scottsdale. Though his former apartment now belongs to the new chief, Mr. Stein knocked politely at the front door. He worked alongside Mr. Soleri for eight years, in the 1970s and '80s. And if he has a skeptical thought about his mentor's legacy, you won't hear him voice it in public.
Mr. Soleri, however, will discuss his marvelous, flawed creation with disarming frankness. Has Arcosanti, for instance, lived up to its potential?
''No. Don't be silly,'' he said, and then laughed. ''If you become a writer or you become a sculptor or a scientist, most of the time you're able to generate yourself a means to carry on.'' An anti-commercial architect, by contrast, must depend on selling his creation to investors and tycoons.
The upside is that Mr. Soleri's theories about pollution, waste, energy depletion -- all the plagues listed on the poster -- have never been more compelling in the marketplace of ideas.
With the interminable recession, Mr. Kim said, ''I think there are lots of Americans out there ready to simplify.''
He has coined his own Soleri-like catchphrase: ''the banality of consumption.'' And he has advanced Mr. Soleri's ideas in a compilation, ''Lean Linear City: Arterial Arcology,'' just out from Cosanti Press. Perhaps, he said, the book will influence the cities rising from bare earth in India and China.
Nadia Begin, 41, an architect and planning coordinator at the project for almost 18 years, seemed to speak for the whole community when she said, ''Arcosanti needs to be part of the conversation.''
Yet it's hard to argue that this skeletal settlement represents the city of tomorrow, said Dennis Frenchman, 63, who has created large-scale developments in South Korea, China and Spain, and is a professor of urban design and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr. Frenchman expressed amazement at the beauty and intricacy of Mr. Soleri's drawings, and the boldness of his invention. But ''I don't think it's taken seriously as an urban model,'' he said. ''It's really a historical curiosity'' -- a place whose beautiful handicrafts and Utopian spirit recall a Shaker village. The Shakers, he noted, have their furniture, the Arconauts have their bells.
Arcosanti is like a Shaker village in one other regard: the community has never bloomed with children. At last count, the number was four.
Ms. Begin gave birth to two sons at home, in her arresting apartment above the bronze foundry, where the slanting silt-cast walls create a kind of sunken space capsule with porthole windows and skylights.
But Mr. Soleri, the master of frugality, didn't design a lot of spacious three-bedroom units. Which explains why Ms. Begin and her husband sleep next to a crib that holds their 4-year-old son.
ARCOSANTI needs children. And new living quarters. And working greenhouses. And people to plant them. Above all, this bulwark against modern capital needs money.
Just about everyone is hoping that Mr. Stein, with his management experience and professional network, will be able to revitalize Arcosanti. At Taliesin West, another countercultural colony with quirky buildings to maintain and tourists to serve, the succession process has dragged on for more than 50 years, since Frank Lloyd Wright's death in 1959.
Jeffrey Grip, 64, a management consultant who is the chairman of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation board, laid out the options for a place like Arcosanti. ''You can become essentially a museum: preserve and display what was created there,'' Mr. Grip said. ''Or you can become an educational foundation that furthers the works'' of a great architect. A third path, he said, is to hope that a new mission will metamorphose in the chrysalis of the magical buildings.
If that future doesn't materialize, what's the worst-case scenario for Arcosanti?
''You're looking at it,'' Mr. Stein said.
His quip is less pessimistic than it may seem. Everything here is paid for, he said. ''We don't have a mortgage.'' So even in its current state, Arcosanti must be more practical than the 460,000 housing units sitting empty in Arizona, according to recent census data.
Let's say that the shuttered bakery in the Crafts III building never reopens in a renovated form -- one of Mr. Stein's priorities. Instead, it continues to be a gathering spot where Ms. Connaughton, the ceramist, meets friends after dinner. She likes to bake treats for visitors and tourists: giant sheets of lemon bars and peanut butter cookies.
On a recent night, a half-dozen friends joined her there, clustering around the warmth of the commercial oven. A few students from the Kansas City Art Institute, here for a two-week residency, were finishing sketches they had begun that morning. Their professor, who lived at Arcosanti in the 1970s, recalled bacchanals at the Construction Camp. Something about a nude public bath and an indoor bonfire.
A few decades removed from those madcap days, the youth of Arcosanti have graduated to a never-ending game of Othello. It took this happy crowd two hours to finish a six-pack. Ms. Connaughton spooned out another batch of cookies while Anita Carter, June Cash's sister, crooned over the boombox. When the evening wound down, home was just downstairs.
For decades now, visitors have asked what it would take to finish Arcosanti. Maybe it's time for a different question. Why doesn't everyone choose to live this way?

HEADLINE: Net Income At Comcast Gains 26%

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
A decline in the number of customers canceling their cable service coupled with additional high-speed Internet subscriptions contributed to a 26.4 percent increase in quarterly net income at Comcast, the nation's largest cable provider. 
In the three months that ended Dec. 31, the company said Wednesday, Comcast generated $1.29 billion in net income, up from $1.02 billion in the same period in 2010.
Revenue jumped 54.7 percent, to $15.04 billion, driven largely by 336,000 new high-speed Internet customers and a 37 percent increase in revenue in the company's business services division, which mostly sets up small businesses with Internet, phone and cable service. Operating income at the company, which is based in Philadelphia, soared 45 percent, to $2.9 billion.
The results point to a slightly improved economic climate in which more consumers are able to afford their monthly cable service, which is still the essence of the rapidly expanding Comcast.
''Cable had another terrific year of improving customer metrics,'' Brian L. Roberts, the chairman and chief executive at Comcast, said in a statement. He added that a new high-tech cable brand and an ''intensified focus on service and innovation are making a real difference.''
Still, Comcast and its satellite and cable competitors have recently diversified away from video service as viewers increasingly watch television via the Internet. Comcast lost 17,000 video customers in the quarter, compared with 135,000 in the same period a year earlier.
Meanwhile, revenue from residential high-speed Internet subscriptions was up 10.1 percent in the quarter, a harbinger of how the company will shape its strategy as it adapts to new technologies. Last month, Comcast struck a 10-year deal with Disney that allows customers to stream shows and sports in and outside the home.
One drag on the otherwise solid quarter was the NBC broadcast network, which Comcast took on as part of its acquisition of a majority stake in NBCUniversal. Revenue at the network fell 3.7 percent in the quarter and 7 percent for the year. Revenue at the media company's filmed entertainment unit, which includes Universal Pictures, fell 1.8 percent in the quarter, to $1.3 billion.
Despite NBC's widely reported struggles, Comcast has said that it bought NBCUniversal primarily for the value of its cable networks. Those networks, including USA, CNBC and Bravo, had a 5.3 percent revenue increase in the quarter.
Revenue at the Universal Studios theme parks, a division Comcast plans to expand, was up 4 percent.
On Wednesday, Comcast said it would increase its annual dividend by 44 percent, to 65 cents a share. The company also announced a $6.5 billion stock repurchasing plan, with $3 billion worth of those buybacks set for 2012.
The share buybacks reflect a trend in the media and cable industries. Last month, Time Warner Cable, the largest cable provider after Comcast, said it would buy back $4 billion worth of stock, and News Corporation has undertaken a $5 billion stock buyback.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Self-Insured Complicate Health Deal

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS; Reed Abelson and Laurie Goodstein contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Obama administration thought it had found a way to ease mounting objections to a requirement in the new health care act that all employers -- including religiously affiliated hospitals and universities -- offer coverage for birth control to women free of charge.
It would make the insurers cover the costs, rather than the organizations themselves. 
But the administration announced the compromise plan before it had figured out how to address one conspicuous point: Like most large employers, many religiously affiliated organizations choose to insure themselves rather than hire an outside company to assume the risk.
Now, the organizations are trying to determine how to reconcile their objections to offering birth control on religious grounds with their role as insurers -- or whether there can be any reconciliation at all. And the administration still cannot put the thorny issue to rest.
''We're all kind of waiting and seeing,'' said Jim Liske, chief executive of the Prison Fellowship, a Christian charity that insures itself and objects to offering the morning-after pill to its employees.
The administration has remained mostly silent on how self-insured institutions will be treated, other than to say that the details will be worked out in meetings with religious leaders in the days and weeks to come.
''This policy will be developed collaboratively so that the ultimate outcome works for religious employers, their workers and the public,'' an administration official said Wednesday.
But some expressed skepticism that any satisfactory solution could be reached. ''That's quite a trick,'' said Richard M. Doerflinger, associate director of ''pro-life activities'' at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which has been among the most vocal critics of the birth control mandate.
''Putting the obligation on the insurer and not the employer doesn't help much if they are the same person,'' he said.
The Obama administration announced in January that it would require most health insurance plans to cover contraceptives for women free of charge as part of putting the federal health care law in place. Although the rule allowed churches to opt out for religious reasons, it did not extend the exemption to religious-affiliated institutions like hospitals or universities. The compromise plan, presented last Friday, has been embraced by some Catholic groups but opposed by others.
Nicholas P. Cafardi, dean emeritus and professor of law at Duquesne University, a Catholic institution, said that President Obama gave the bishops exactly what they asked for.
''The only serious issue left is self-insurance,'' he said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. ''But the Obama administration has said it wants to work with these organizations so they're not required to violate their conscience. I'm sure they mean that in good faith.''
Employers that self-insure provide health insurance directly to employees, paying the health care claims of their workers. Large employers often choose to self-insure because they can spread the risk across hundreds or thousands of workers. The option is often more economical and can allow an organization to tailor its plan to the specific needs of its employees. Many such employers contract with an insurance company to administer the plan.
Nationwide, 60 percent of workers with health insurance were covered by a self-funded plan in 2011, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual survey of employer health benefits. Among large employers, the number is even higher. Eighty-two percent of covered workers at companies of more than 200 employees had self-funded plans.
Insurance industry experts and Catholic groups said they did not know how many religiously affiliated organizations self-insure, but they said the number was likely to mirror the national trend. Many of the organizations are large employers, including hospital systems and universities.
Several religiously affiliated organizations already offer coverage for contraceptives to their workers, often to comply with state birth control mandates. Among these are Dignity Health, which was affiliated with the Catholic Church until this year, and Fordham University, which is run in the tradition of the Jesuit religious order.
In a curious twist, several Catholic organizations have chosen to self-insure in recent years to avoid the requirements of the state mandates, said Michael Galligan-Stierle, president of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.
''There's been a promise to have a conversation, but we haven't heard about when it's going to be,'' he said. ''We're waiting for that.''
Now those who self-insure say they worry that they will find themselves caught between following the law and following their consciences.
''It seems to me that they've given a pretty clear signal that we are going to have to do something different,'' said Mr. Liske, of the Prison Fellowship, which employs 200 workers, 110 of them women.
The organization views the morning-after pill as a form of abortion, which it opposes. And although Mr. Liske said he was heartened that the administration said it would work with groups like his to reach a solution, ''anything that would put us in a situation where we would be directly or indirectly funding abortions would not be acceptable to us.''
One interest group that is likely to keep a low profile in the public debate is the insurance companies. ''They don't want to get in the middle of this firestorm,'' said Robert Laszewski, a health care industry consultant and former insurance executive. ''You can't please anybody. Who do you want to offend -- women's health advocates or the Catholic Church?''

HEADLINE: World Bank President Will Leave

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Robert B. Zoellick will step down as president of the World Bank when his five-year term expires on June 30, the Washington-based institution announced on Wednesday.
In an interview, Mr. Zoellick said that he had no immediate plans for his next career move. He said that he felt most proud of his work to modernize the bank, which focuses on fighting poverty and financing development in emerging countries.
When he first took office in 2007, ''there were questions about whether people wanted to be engaged with the bank,'' he said. ''Now, we find that whether on regular development issues, postconflict states, or climate issues, there is a very strong interest in working with us.'' 
Mr. Zoellick's departure seems likely to set off another clash between the advanced economies that traditionally appoint the leaders of the major international financial institutions and the emerging economies that tend to benefit from -- and bear the consequences of -- those institutions' policies.
For the last seven decades, since the World Bank's establishment, the United States has in practice appointed its leader, while Europe picks the head of the International Monetary Fund, the bank's sister institution.
Recently, countries like Brazil, India and China -- with their rapid economic growth and growing political clout on the global stage -- have pushed for a more open, transparent and inclusive selection process. Aid and international development organizations have also railed against the old guard's outsize influence.
''Whoever becomes the president needs to be seen as legitimate around the world,'' said Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Center for Global Development in Washington. ''The emerging markets -- we need to bring them into the multilateral fold, to have them engaged not as victims or recipients or problems, but as real actors whose decisions matter.''
The World Bank's leadership has committed to opening up the presidential selection process, and the Group of 20 countries has stated its commitment to ''support new open, transparent and merit-based selection processes for the heads and senior leadership'' of the funds and banks that support financial stability and development in communiques.
But in practice, that has not yet resulted in a big change at the top. In 2007, European leaders supported former President George W. Bush's nomination of Mr. Zoellick to head the World Bank. And Washington supported the candidacy of Christine Lagarde, the former French finance minister, for managing director of the International Monetary Fund last year. But notably Mr. Zoellick and Ms. Lagarde visited major emerging market nations to drum up support for their candidacies.
Thomas E. Donilon, the White House national security adviser; Jacob J. Lew, the chief of staff; and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, are consulting with President Obama in choosing a nominee. The White House expects to make an announcement in the next few weeks.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, is an often-mentioned candidate for the position, though the State Department has denied rumors that she is moving to the bank. Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and Obama economic adviser, is another possibility. Mr. Geithner is also mentioned, though his role in helping select the next president may suggest he is not a candidate.
In a statement, Mr. Geithner praised Mr. Zoellick's contributions to the bank, calling him a ''remarkably effective leader.''
''It is very important that we continue to have strong, effective leadership of this important institution, and in the coming weeks, we plan to put forward a candidate with the experience and requisite qualities to take this institution forward,'' he said.
Mr. Zoellick said he had made democratizing development one of his major goals at the helm of the institution. ''We wanted to move away from an elite model, and instead say, 'There's a lot of interesting experimentation and innovation across developing countries.' ''
''The world is changing and changing quite fast, and the bank has to change with it,'' he added.
Mr. Zoellick presided over the first increase in the bank's general financial resources in two decades. He also helped to raise $90 billion for the bank's fund for the world's poorest, the International Development Association.
Mr. Zoellick has also pushed the bank to open not just its coffers, but its data archives, giving public access to its much-prized store of information on the world economy. ''I'm very proud of that,'' Mr. Zoellick said, describing the policy as a ''freedom of information act'' for the bank. It is also ''important because it makes public institutions more accountable, and it helps us focus on results,'' he said.
There is considerable speculation over where Mr. Zoellick, who is 58, might be headed as well. A longtime member of the Republican foreign and economic policy elite, his name has been mentioned as a possible candidate to become Treasury secretary if President Obama does not win a second term. Mr. Zoellick said that he had no plans, and did not plan to decide his next career move until after he left the bank.
Mr. Zoellick said that the World Bank supported an open application process to replace him as president. But, he added, ''I've spent 30 years, both in government and outside government, trying to help and support and rebuild the multilateral system.'' He said, ''I think there's a benefit for this system if the United States has a sense of responsibility to and ownership of those institutions.''

HEADLINE: As China's Currency Rises, U.S. Keeps Up Its Pressure

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With little fanfare, China's currency has appreciated significantly in the last year and a half, leading many economists to question whether the exchange rate is still the most important economic issue for the United States to press with China's leaders.
The rise of the renminbi -- up 12 percent since June 2010 on an inflation-adjusted basis and 40 percent since 2005 -- has helped American companies by effectively reducing the cost of their products in China. In the last two years, American exports to China have risen sharply. 
The renminbi remains undervalued, relative to all other currencies, by 5 to 20 percent, according to various estimates. But many business executives and economists say that other issues, like intellectual-property theft and barriers to entering Chinese markets, are now a bigger drag on the American economy.
In his Oval Office meeting on Tuesday with Xi Jinping, China's vice president and likely next leader, President Obama discussed the currency as one of the trade practices that concerned the United States. That meeting -- and tough public comments by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- continued a three-year campaign by the administration to convince Chinese leaders that a stronger currency is in their interest.
''We are making progress, but it's not sufficient,'' Lael Brainard, the Treasury Department's under secretary for international affairs, said in an interview, ''and we will keep on pushing.''
Administration officials and members of Congress have chosen not to emphasize the appreciation publicly, partly to keep pressure on China. Widespread discussion of the change could reduce support in Congress for a bill that would impose sanctions on Chinese imports to the United States and that Beijing strongly opposes.
Similarly, the notion that the exchange rate was no longer as serious a problem as it had been could complicate American efforts to rally international pressure, from Brazil and other countries hurt by the renminbi's value.
Politicians are also wary of seeming soft on China, given that polls show many Americans blame China to some degree for this country's economic problems. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has argued for taking stronger measures against China than Mr. Obama has.
But the fact that policy makers often continue to talk about the renminbi as if the situation had not changed brings its own risks.
''People on the Hill are talking the same way they were a few years ago,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''We should be acknowledging that they've made very substantial progress. I think that would give us more credibility.''
Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell and Brookings Institution economist, added, ''It's hard to make the case the renminbi is very undervalued on a multilateral basis.'' Other analysts say that an undervaluation of 10 percent of more remains significant.
Some Chinese officials have bristled recently over the lack of credit they have received for their movement. ''Perceptions about the renminbi exchange rate in the international community are absolutely groundless,'' Li Daokui, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, recently said. The renminbi, he added, was ''probably the only emerging economy's currency that has been rising against the U.S. dollar'' since last August.
China's economic rise has depended on a growing factory sector that benefits from a cheap renminbi. But the currency value's has both benefits and drawbacks for the country, say economists, both in China and beyond.
An inexpensive currency effectively subsidizes companies that export goods -- and their workers -- at the expense of most Chinese households, whose buying power is diminished.
A more expensive renminbi gives Chinese households more buying power, by reducing the cost of imports to China. It also puts pressure on Chinese companies to develop more innovative products that bring higher-paying jobs, rather than competing mostly on price.
As a result, the debate over the renminbi in China often resembles a struggle between interest groups. Officials from the United States, Brazil, Europe and elsewhere have tried to strengthen the forces seeking a stronger renminbi by explaining how that will lead to more balanced, sustainable growth for the whole world.
Starting in June 2010, with the worst of the global recession fading and political frustration with China rising across much of the world, American officials and others began to have more success.
The renminbi has risen 8.5 percent against the dollar since June 2010, with the pace having slowed in the last six months. Taking into account the different inflation rates in the two counties, the effective increase is closer to 12 percent.
The rise has helped sharply reduce China's current account surplus -- a measure based largely on the difference between a country's exports and imports. In 2007, the surplus equaled more than 10 percent of China's gross domestic product, a level widely seen as unsustainable. Last year, the surplus fell below 3 percent.
The renminbi also rose substantially from 2005 to 2008, under pressure from President George W. Bush's administration and other governments, before holding steady from mid-2008 until mid-2010.
The rise in the renminbi is not the only reason many economists think other issues, like the theft of patented technology, are more important to the American economy. Because many items are assembled in China, with parts made in other countries, a stronger renminbi affects only a small portion of the cost of many products officially made in China.
Less than 4 percent of the value of an iPhone, for example, comes from Chinese labor and parts, one academic study found.

HEADLINE: Panel Completes Last Details of Tax Cut Extension

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Members of a House-Senate committee charged with writing a measure to extend a payroll tax reduction said Wednesday that their work was done, just shy of an hour before their deadline to get a bill ready for a Friday vote.
After fighting until the very final hour over how to pay for parts of a $150 billion plan that would also extend unemployment benefits and prevent a pay cut for doctors who accept Medicare, leaders of both parties put together a bill that the majority of the committee could support. 
While the substance of most issues had largely been worked out this week, Democrats from Maryland -- home to many federal workers -- held up an agreement at the last minute debating whether a pay freeze for federal workers or a reduction in scheduled raises would be more acceptable than changes to pensions for some employees as a way to pay for continuing jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed.
Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who is on the conference committee, and Representative Chris Van Hollen, also a Democrat of Maryland, said they were unhappy with provisions affecting federal employees.
With no support from Senate Republicans -- who Senate Democrats said earlier in the week had not been very involved in the drafting of the report -- it came down to Mr. Cardin, who was reluctant to give the needed signature to push the report toward the floors for a vote.
Mr. Cardin was called Wednesday by President Obama, who strongly wanted the provisions and leaned heavily on the senator to give his approval, senior administration officials said.
While the committee's work has the blessing of House Republican leadership, many rank-and-file Republicans, while cheered by a reduction in unemployment benefits and proposed erosion of the health care law, were nonetheless leaning against the deal.
''They are framing it as a middle-class tax cut even though this is a significant change to how Social Security has traditionally been treated,'' said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, Republican of Nebraska, who plans to oppose the measure. ''The payroll tax keeps Americans attentive to the fact that they put a little bit aside each check for Social Security. That connection is now gone.''
A final measure should be ready for a vote in the House on Friday, but the timing of a Senate vote seemed less certain.
Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has held up Senate votes this week in protest of a decision by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, to deny Mr. Paul other legislation that would strip Egypt of foreign aid for 30 days as punishment for detaining American pro-democracy workers.
Under the agreement reached by House and Senate negotiators, the current reduction in the employee's share of the Social Security payroll tax -- to 4.2 percent of wages, from 6.2 percent -- would be continued to the end of the year. Revenue lost to the Social Security trust fund would be fully replaced with money from the general fund of the Treasury.
For a worker with annual earnings of $50,000, the payroll tax holiday would increase take-home pay by $1,000 over the course of the year.
The bipartisan agreement also revamps unemployment insurance, reducing the maximum duration of benefits in states with high unemployment to 73 weeks, from the current 99. Currently, fewer than half of states are eligible for 93 weeks or more of unemployment insurance, with just 18 states getting the full maximum of 99 weeks.
The roughly $30 billion price will be picked up by the sale of radio spectrum licenses and the federal worker benefit changes.
Under the agreement, states will be allowed to conduct drug testing for anyone who lost a job because the person failed or refused to take an employer's drug test, and they could test anyone seeking a job that generally requires such a test, a provision similar to existing law.
Federal workers were not pleased with the proposed changes, with Colleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, calling them ''absolutely outrageous.'' She said House and Senate negotiators were tentatively planning to save $15 billion over 10 years by reducing the government contribution to pensions for new federal employees and requiring the workers to contribute more.
The agreement extends the nation's main welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, through the current fiscal year. States will have to prevent welfare recipients from using electronic benefit cards at liquor stores, casinos and strip clubs. In addition, the legislation blocks a 27 percent cut in payments to doctors treating Medicare patients. In effect, this assures that beneficiaries will have access to their doctors after March 1, when the cut was to have taken effect.
Dr. Peter W. Carmel, president of the American Medical Association, said his group was ''deeply disappointed'' that the agreement, while delaying the cut for 10 months, did not replace the statutory formula that requires such cuts. Republicans boasted that they had cut spending under the new health care law to help pay for Medicare spending under the agreement. For example, the agreement cuts $5 billion from a special account created by the new law to promote public health.
To help offset the cost of paying doctors under Medicare, the agreement will also reduce payments to hospitals.

HEADLINE: Both Sides Eager to Take Birth Control Coverage Issue to Voters

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
The furor over President Obama's birth control mandate has swiftly entered a new plane, with supporters and opponents alike calling the subject a potent weapon for the November elections and mounting what they say will be prolonged campaigns to shape public perceptions of the issue: Is it about religious liberty or women's health?
Roman Catholic bishops, evangelicals, other conservatives and the Republican presidential candidates have dismissed as meaningless the effort by President Obama last week to soften the rule, which requires that employees of religiously affiliated institutions like schools and hospitals, but not churches, receive free contraception in their health plans. 
Sensing an opportunity, Congressional Republicans have leapt into the fray. An amendment to block any health mandate that violates a business owner's beliefs is before the Senate -- and a target of intense lobbying. A House committee is holding a hearing on Thursday to ask, ''Has the Obama Administration Trampled on Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Conscience?''
But the political repercussions could be much wider. ''This was an unexpected gift,'' said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and a Republican strategist. He said religious conservatives saw the mandate as part of a web of Obama assaults on faith and values, and an ominous sign of how the president would carry out his health care plan if re-elected.
Liberal women's health and rights groups point to evidence, including a New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday, indicating that most Americans, including a majority of Catholics, support requiring religiously affiliated institutions to provide contraception coverage. With ad campaigns, phone banks and appeals to members of Congress during their home leave next week, they hope to rebrand the debate as one over women's access to basic health care. They make comparisons to the outpouring of support for Planned Parenthood that forced the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation for breast cancer research this month to reverse its decision to halt donations.
''The United States is more than 51 percent women, and I can say that we will mobilize our base and we will outnumber the other side,'' said Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, which works to elect women who support abortion rights to Congress.
Her organization is one of more than 40 -- including the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Naral Pro-Choice America, MoveOn.org and the Service Employees International Union -- that formed a Coalition to Protect Women's Health Care and are asking millions of supporters to get involved.
On Friday, Mr. Obama sought to defuse the conflict by saying insurance companies, rather than religious employers themselves, would pay the costs of birth control.
But the Catholic bishops said their basic objection remained. ''We will therefore continue -- with no less vigor, no less sense of urgency -- our efforts to correct this problem through the other two branches of government,'' they declared. Other ''preventive services'' mandated by the health law are aimed at disease, the bishops wrote, ''and pregnancy is not a disease,'' an implicit rejection of the administration's characterization of this as a health issue.
The bishops and others are pushing for a reversal in Congress, which some say could happen in the Republican-controlled House. But with the Senate in Democratic hands, a legislative resolution is unlikely, so both sides are pressing their cases more widely, with an eye to November's battle for control of Congress as well as the presidency.
To that end, bishops around the country are planning media campaigns, including radio and television advertisements, to denounce what they call a violation of conscience and the First Amendment. At the same time, they are asking parish priests to raise the matter with congregations and to circulate petitions.
Conservative evangelical groups, even though most do not oppose contraception on theological grounds, have taken up the cause with equal force. Their leaders argue that a government mandate forcing any religious group to act against its beliefs is a threat to all religions. Major evangelical groups that openly opposed Mr. Obama and his health care plan in the past see this as a new affront and a new opportunity for attack.
The National Association of Evangelicals, which represents thousands of churches in 40 denominations, ''will be working vigorously'' against the mandate, said Galen Carey, the association's vice president for government relations -- lending substance to the statement last week by Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and a Baptist minister, that ''we are all Catholics now.''
Evangelical leaders say they would be outraged by the mandate in any case, but many also believe that it will bring them political gains. Mr. Reed, the conservative strategist, said that even if a majority of Americans expressed general support for requiring contraceptive coverage -- and even if, as he believes, the economy remained the primary issue -- getting conservative and religious voters more fired up could make a difference.
''Among key voter groups in key battleground states, this issue in combination with others is not going to be helpful to Obama,'' he said.
Women's health advocates, though, insist that they will win this fight.
''Women are coming out of the woodwork, saying, 'They're attacking birth control? You've got to be kidding!' '' said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president for policy and communications of Planned Parenthood. ''The people who vote against birth control and vote against health care -- they are going to have boxed themselves into a very small corner.''

HEADLINE: President Visits Factory To Hail 'Insourcing' Plan

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
MILWAUKEE -- President Obama came here on Wednesday to promote his new ''insourcing'' economic plan, which he says could help prod American manufacturers to bring jobs home from China and elsewhere overseas. But the biggest question buzzing about his visit was what he and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin would say to each other when they toured the plant that served as poster child du jour for Mr. Obama's rollout.
Alas, it was not to be; Mr. Walker, a Republican who is facing a recall election that he has boldly predicted will be a bellwether for Mr. Obama's own chances in Wisconsin, pulled out of the joint tour with the president at the last minute. Mr. Walker's spokesman told reporters that the governor had the flu so he would not join Mr. Obama to congratulate Master Lock for bringing jobs back to the United States. 
Mr. Walker was apparently not too sick to show up at the airport to greet Mr. Obama, however, presenting the president with a Milwaukee Brewers baseball jersey and demurely declining, in a brief chat afterward with reporters, to take a whack at the president.
''Today's the president's day,'' he said, when reporters traveling with Mr. Obama tried to egg him on. ''I'm appreciative he's in Wisconsin, appreciative he's focused on manufacturing. We'll leave politics for another day.''
Mr. Obama also has ostensibly been leaving politics for another day, focusing his remarks at Master Lock on the need to rein in unfair trading practices from China and restore American manufacturing jobs. He trotted out -- again and again -- the administration's new catchphrase, insourcing.
''You've all heard enough about outsourcing,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Well, more and more companies like Master Lock are now insourcing. They're deciding that if the cost of doing business here is no longer much different than the cost of doing business in countries like China, they'd rather place their bets on America.''
Mr. Obama -- who, aides say, expressed concerns about unfair competition on Tuesday when China's presumed next leader, Vice President Xi Jinping, visited the White House -- several times made Beijing the counterpoint to his manufacturing narrative. He promised to use his just-announced trade enforcement unit to focus on investigating unfair trade practices in China.
The president did make an indirect -- albeit transparent -- dig at the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, whose recent efforts to explain his 2008 ''Let Detroit Go Bankrupt'' column, in light of the Michigan primary on Feb. 28, have been delighting Obama supporters.
Mr. Obama pointedly held his bailout of the American auto industry as an example of how government intervention can help manufacturing jobs. ''There were some folks,'' he began, allowing a long, pointed pause, ''who said we should just let it die.''
''With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen,'' he said, in a line that appears destined for campaign speeches to come. ''And today, the American auto industry is back.''
Mr. Obama's stop in Milwaukee is the beginning of a three-day trip that is mostly a money run. After Milwaukee, the president was scheduled for stops in Southern California for several fund-raisers, including one co-hosted by the actor Will Ferrell. Then it is on to San Francisco for more fund-raisers, and Seattle, where he planned to make remarks at a Boeing facility before hitting another fund-raiser.
In Los Angeles and San Francisco, the president will have to walk a fine line between Hollywood and Silicon Valley, two big contributors to his campaign who have been at each other's throats over the online piracy issue.
''I believe the president enjoys support from people in both industries,'' the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters traveling with the president. ''We are absolutely committed to working to find solutions to the problem of copyright infringement and intellectual property rights infringement, but we need to do it in a way that doesn't restrict Internet freedom.''

HEADLINE: Franctic Actions Hint At Pressure On Iran Leaders

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE and ROBERT F. WORTH; Reporting was contributed by Rick Gladstone and William J. Broad from New York, David E. Sanger from Washington, Thomas Fuller from Bangkok, Ethan Bronner from Jerusalem, and Alan Cowell from London.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A string of aggressive gestures by Iran this week -- assassination attempts on Israelis living abroad that were attributed to Tehran, renewed posturing over its nuclear program and fresh threats of economic retaliation -- suggest that Iranian leaders are responding frantically, and with increasing unpredictability, to the tightening of sanctions by the West.
As investigators unearthed new evidence implicating Iran in the attacks this week in Thailand, India and Georgia, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran announced Wednesday what he said was his country's latest nuclear advance, and Iran's Oil Ministry threatened to pre-empt a European oil embargo by cutting off sales to six countries there.
''These are all facets of the same message,'' said Muhammad Sahimi, an analyst and professor at the University of Southern California. ''Iran is saying, 'If you hit us, we will hit back, and we are not going to sacrifice our nuclear program.' '' 
The flurry of Iranian actions and statements comes as Western governments are watching closely for signs of Iran's reaction to the tougher sanctions they have imposed. But the intentions of Iran's divided leadership are notoriously difficult to divine, and even as Mr. Ahmadinejad declared defiantly that ''the era of bullying nations has passed,'' another Iranian official said Tehran was ready for new talks on the nuclear issue.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, confirmed on Wednesday that she had received a reply from a top Iranian official responding to her invitation to negotiations over the future of its nuclear program. Iran's Al Alam television said the country had offered to ''hold new talks over its nuclear program in a constructive way.''
American officials reacted with caution to the reported offer to talk and said they saw little substance in either the oil threat or Mr. Ahmadinejad's announcement that Iran had new centrifuges able to enrich uranium more quickly. The Iranian president was shown on live television overseeing the loading of what was described as an Iranian-made fuel rod into a research reactor and declaring that ''the arrogant powers cannot monopolize nuclear technology. They tried to prevent us by issuing sanctions and resolutions but failed.''
Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said that Mr. Ahmadinejad's remarks appeared ''calibrated mostly for a domestic audience.''
''The Iranians have for many months been putting out calendars of accomplishments, and based on their own calendars, they are many, many months behind,'' Ms. Nuland said.
Nor did the threat to cut oil sales to six European countries -- first incorrectly announced by Iran's Press TV as already in effect -- have much of an impact. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, noted that the European Union banned new oil contracts with Iran last month and said it would halt all imports of Iranian oil July 1. Oil prices ticked up by $1.06 a barrel to $101.80 on the New York Mercantile Exchange in response to Iran's warning.
Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the belligerent moves by Iran actually underscored weakness.
''If there's a meta-narrative here, it's that Iran tends to speak loudly but carries a small stick,'' Mr. Sadjadpour said. ''Their alleged terror attacks projected incompetence more than fear, their announced nuclear progress is likely exaggerated, and their threat to pre-emptively cease oil exports to Europe turned out to be another bluff.''
Evidence was accumulating that the bombing this week that injured four people in New Delhi, including an Israeli diplomat's wife, and bombs discovered in Tbilisi, Georgia, and Bangkok were part of a single plot, for which Israel has blamed Iran. Iranian officials have denied any involvement.
Two Iranian suspects in the Bangkok episode -- in which an explosion rocked a house and led investigators to more bombs there -- were in custody in Thailand and a third in Malaysia, officials said. And Thailand's chief of police, Gen. Prewpan Dhamapong, said the explosive devices found in the rented house resembled those found in Georgia and New Delhi. He added that the Iranian suspects were on a mission targeting Israeli diplomats.
In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the incidents showed why all nations should draw ''red lines against Iranian aggression.''
''These days, Iran's acts of terror are clear to everyone,'' Mr. Netanyahu told Parliament. The method of the bombing in New Delhi and attempted bombing in Georgia this week -- magnetic devices attached to cars -- appears to be the same as those used to kill Iranian nuclear scientists in attacks widely attributed to Israel.
The Iranian actions came at a tense time, after weeks of public discussion in Israel and the United States of the possibility of Israeli airstrikes to slow the progress of Iran's nuclear program, which Western officials believe is working toward a capacity to make nuclear bombs and which Iranians say is for peaceful purposes.
The latest developments suggested to some analysts that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was deliberately lashing out at the West, though it was not clear whether his intention was simply to retaliate or to provoke a limited war with Israel. Some Iranian hard-liners are said to believe that such a war would benefit them, allowing them to close ranks and assert greater authority for the elite Revolutionary Guards.
''I think this is Iran's way of saying, 'Look out, we can reach out and touch you,' '' said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a professor of Middle East Studies at Syracuse University. ''But I doubt that Khamenei wants to go all the way to a serious armed confrontation.''
Some analysts cautioned against taking the recent developments as signs of a new Iranian position, noting that Iran is now more fragmented politically than ever, and that the country's leaders often deliberately send divided messages. ''If they are going to make a concession, they will do it behind the scenes,'' said Kelly Golnoush Niknejad, editor of the news site Tehran Bureau. ''Often the Iranian government will say one thing in public and do something entirely different in diplomatic channels.''
Yet most analysts doubt that Iran is ready to make a diplomatic overture that the West will take seriously. Although Mr. Ahmadinejad is widely said to be eager for a real breakthrough with the West on the nuclear issue, Iran's supreme leader holds final authority over foreign affairs, and he is extremely resistant to concessions.
While Iran appeared to be signaling a willingness to start more nuclear talks, in the letter from Saeed Jalili, the country's top nuclear negotiator, to Ms. Ashton, some diplomats and analysts were dismissive.
''Jalili has a history of making offers that stick to generalities and avoid any specific discussions,'' said Mr. Sahimi, the U.S.C. analyst.
The nuclear claims Iran made Wednesday seem either overstated or insignificant. It was unclear whether Iran had succeeded in producing real homemade fuel that could safely power a research reactor for long periods of time or whether the televised display involved prototype fuels or test materials. ''I'm very skeptical,'' a European diplomat familiar with Iran's nuclear effort said of the reactor claim.
Iran's new centrifuge claims also seem exaggerated. Starting nearly six years ago, in April 2006, Tehran has regularly boasted that it is on the verge of perfecting and deploying a new generation of more advanced centrifuges that will enrich uranium far more quickly.
Mr. Ahmadinejad's nuclear announcement, in the view of some analysts, was an effort to create ''facts on the ground'' in advance of any new nuclear talks. In addition, it might be a play for domestic support in advance of Iran's upcoming parliamentary elections, scheduled for March 2, which could affect a power struggle between his supporters and Ayatollah Khamenei's.

HEADLINE: Tea Time in Iowa for a Chinese Leader

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Edward Wong contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
MUSCATINE, Iowa -- Twenty-seven years ago, a young man named Xi Jinping, on an agricultural research trip from his home in China, came to rural eastern Iowa and slept in Eleanor and Thomas Dvorchak's sons' room. The boys had just gone off to college -- their room still stuffed with the things of childhood -- and Ms. Dvorchak said she felt bad. She had grown up reading Pearl S. Buck novels about the travails in rural China, and now here was a visitor, perhaps from that same hard place, and they had put him in there with the Star Trek action figures.
''He did not complain,'' said Ms. Dvorchak, 72, who is now retired and living in Florida. ''Everything, no matter what, was very acceptable to him -- he was humble.'' 
On Wednesday, Mr. Xi returned to Muscatine -- triumphantly this time, with an entourage and a room of his own -- as China's vice president and heir apparent to the leadership of a rapidly rising world power. Seventeen people he met here in 1985, including the Dvorchaks, were invited to tea.
Casual it was not. Streets were blocked by the police around the neighborhood where the reunion took place. And then it began to rain -- a cold, off-and-on drizzle that obscured the view of the Mississippi River, visible from the old houses, some stately and some ramshackle, that dominate the bluff.
About a block from the house where the tea took place, a few dozen people protesting China's human rights record traded shouts with counterprotesters across the street. A pro-Tibet group had come down from Minneapolis and chanted slogans against Chinese policies in Tibet. Some Chinese students from the University of Iowa shouted back, ''We love China.''
Chinese officials have said the trip flowed from Mr. Xi's desire to relive a pleasant period from his past and to reconnect with Iowa farmers and other residents he came to know a quarter-century ago. It was also clearly a propaganda event at a time of heightened tensions between the United and China over a raft of issues, including differences over how to handle Syria's violent crackdown of protests and suspicion in Beijing over the reassertion of American power in Asia.
The tightly choreographed moment was intended to show audiences in the United States and in China the deep connection that the presumed future Chinese president, now 58, feels with the people of the American heartland.
It was also likely meant to highlight China's growing dependency on food imported from the United States. Iowa, the country's leading soybean producer, is a big supplier to China. On Wednesday, Chinese trade representatives signed agreements with American grain companies to increase soybean imports.
But even if the trip was propaganda for the Chinese government and Mr. Xi, as many residents here cheerfully admitted, who cared? It was also a good advertisement for Muscatine, population 23,000. What was in 1985 just ordinary Iowa niceness came boomeranging back. Cornfield diplomacy worked.
And with reporters and cameras swarming in town -- the Chinese news media were especially keen to get shots of the various houses and bedrooms where Mr. Xi stayed -- Muscatine's moment in the spotlight, many residents said, was not to be squandered. It is the sort of rural wisdom that Mark Twain -- a local hero who lived briefly here on the banks of the Mississippi River and wrote for The Muscatine Journal in the 1850s -- might well have praised or parodied: When opportunity knocks, shake it by the lapels until the coins fall out.
''We've displayed to this world leader our work ethic, No. 1, and our value for friendship; that's No. 2,'' Mayor DeWayne M. Hopkins said in an interview at City Hall. ''If that message can be disseminated into the rest of the United States in encouragement for people to be interested in Muscatine and perhaps relocate here -- and I mean people all the way from households up to retail and manufacturing -- then that's a plus.''
At the Long John Silver's fast-food restaurant, the sign out front said, ''Welcome back to Muscatine Xi Jinping'' on one side, and on the other, ''Original menu available, fish sandwich 2 for $3.''
Inside, the general manager, Michelle Cacho, said that good buzz was good business. ''It's kind of propaganda, but if it helps folks in Iowa we might as well roll out the red carpet,'' she said.
Other residents said they believed the compliment that Mr. Xi paid the town by coming back was real, and that residents should be honored.
''He could go to Nebraska, or anyplace else in heartland America, but he chose to come back here, which shows well for Muscatine,'' said Dennis Figg, 62, who had stopped in at the Phillips 66 gas station on the edge of downtown to visit with a friend and buy some chewing tobacco.
Some of the people who played host to Mr. Xi in the 1980s, sounding like polished diplomats, said the lasting value of the visit was the relationships that would be built for Iowa's sake or Muscatine's or maybe for rural America in general.
''I'm hoping that our friendship from the past will be an example of how we build an even stronger relationship,'' said Sarah Lande, who served on the committee that organized Mr. Xi's trip to Iowa in 1985 and who held the tea on Wednesday.
The Muscatine-China connection is being bolstered, as it turns out, by one of the Star Trek-loving sons whose world Mr. Xi was exposed to in 1985, Mark Dvorchak. He is now 46, living near Los Angeles, and travels frequently to China and across Asia as an economic consultant, his parents said.

HEADLINE: Conservative Pundits Find Romney Disengaged, and Say That's Puzzling

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
One morning in January, Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of the conservative magazine and Web site Newsmax, sat with Mitt Romney in his hotel room at the West Palm Beach Courtyard Marriott in Florida and offered some blunt advice about dealing with the news media.
He needed to do a better job reaching out to conservative writers and pundits, Mr. Ruddy told the candidate. But then, sensing that he wasn't breaking through, Mr. Ruddy stopped. 
''There was a lack of interest on his part as to specific recommendations I might have,'' he later recalled.
''My feeling from them was that while they were happy to listen to the information, they weren't going to act on it.''
From the television studios of Fox News to the pages of The Weekly Standard, the refrain of the conservative opinion machine is virtually the same: Mitt Romney doesn't talk to us, doesn't get us.
''There's actually a cultural disconnect between a lot of conservative thought leaders and Mitt Romney,'' said Joe Scarborough, co-host of MSNBC's ''Morning Joe.'' He added that Mr. Romney lacks a personal touch. ''He's not a glad-hander. He's not like Bill Clinton or George H. W. Bush, who loved to sit on the phone and work people.''
Mr. Romney's distant, complicated relationship with many of the conservative media's leading voices has heightened concerns that his convictions are not as genuine and deep-seated as their own. Many commentators have pounced on some of Mr. Romney's recent remarks -- saying that he is ''not concerned about the very poor'' because they have a government safety net and that he was a ''severely conservative'' governor -- as proof that he cannot speak their language.
''The real problem here is that it shows he doesn't have fluency with conservative ideas,'' Charles Krauthammer, the conservative columnist, said on Fox News.
Or, as Rush Limbaugh noted the other day on his radio show, ''I have never heard anybody say, 'I'm severely conservative.'''
Ann Coulter's experience with Mr. Romney offers a telling case in point. She endorsed Mr. Romney in November, well before many of her peers in the conservative commentariat. Yet, she said, she had never had a conversation with him or his campaign. And when she attended a Romney fund-raiser last month at the Palm Beach, Fla., estate of Stephen Ross, the owner of the Miami Dolphins football team, she had to seek him out.
After Mr. Romney was done addressing the gathering, Ms. Coulter waited off stage and introduced herself -- the first time since 2008 that she had seen him, she said. ''I said, 'You owe me, and you better be as right-wing a president as I'm telling everyone you're going to be,''' she recalled. ''He laughed and basically agreed.''
Mr. Romney has never displayed much ease with journalists, at least not in the way other Republicans have. The elder President Bush was known for dropping by the press area in the West Wing to talk to reporters. His son was chummy enough with the press corps traveling with him during the 2000 race that he gave many of them nicknames. And for the better part of his 2008 campaign, John McCain would regularly invite journalists back into the inner sanctum on his bus, the ''Straight Talk Express.''
Mr. Romney's outreach in 2008 was more apparent. At the 20th anniversary party for Mr. Limbaugh's radio show, he sat with the radio host. He visited the Manhattan offices of Rupert Murdoch at least twice.
But four years later, he is elusive to many.
Andrea Tantaros, co-host of ''The Five'' on Fox News, said she was surprised the Romney campaign has not tried to push back against some of the more withering criticisms that commentators make every day on cable television and online.
In 2008, Ms. Tantaros could expect a phone call from an irritated Romney adviser if she made critical comments about him. But now, the silence is noticeable, she said. ''
And if anyone would receive an angry phone call from the Romney campaign, it would be Ms. Tantaros. She served as a communications director for William F. Weld, the former Massachusetts governor whose political strategists now work for Mr. Romney.
Offering a possible explanation for the silence, she said, ''He and his staff believe we'll eventually fall in line.''
Mr. Romney's relations with the news media are more distant than they are hostile. And he enjoys friendly interactions with television hosts like Sean Hannity, whose radio and cable programs have been one of his regular stops, and Larry Kudlow of CNBC, who was an economic adviser in the Reagan White House.
''When I read what my friends and colleagues are writing,'' Mr. Kudlow said, ''What jumps out at me is (a) Mitt does not have long-term conservative movement credibility and (b) people have not entirely forgiven his early days in politics when he ran against Ted Kennedy and was governor of very liberal Massachusetts.''
Some believe the criticism is just part of the ritual flogging that Republicans put their candidates through to determine whether they are sufficiently conservative. ''I think it's a natural part of the process, and I think Mitt knew that when he decided to run again,'' Mr. Kudlow said.
And others occasionally give him the benefit of the doubt, saying they think his heart is in the right place even if the words sometimes come out wrong.
''We'll be happy to translate for him in these columns,'' the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal wrote earlier this month. ''But it would be less politically painful if Mr. Romney sat down for a weeklong tutorial with, say, Paul Ryan, Mitch Daniels, Jeb Bush and others who can help him.''

HEADLINE: Belling the No-New-Taxes Cat

 BODY:
Credit Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland with political courage in daring the Legislature to face up to the state's neglected roads and transit needs by, yes, raising the gasoline tax. It was last increased 20 years ago with no index for inflation. State lawmakers, fearing the voters' wrath, have neglected this responsibility ever since. 
In his State of the State address, Mr. O'Malley, a Democrat, bucked the no-new-taxes delusions with a blunt reminder that, sooner or later, taxpayers must pay for the services they enjoy. He also proposed several revenue and fee increases to pay for education and other programs.
The gas-tax proposal would phase in across three years an additional 6 percent sales tax on gasoline, the same that is levied now on general goods. This would float with the wholesale cost of gas and eventually add an estimated 18 cents to the cost of a gallon while raising $615 million a year in revenues.
While Republicans and some Democrats loudly protest that the governor is asking too much of taxpayers in hard times, their complaints of his ''job killing'' agenda hardly stacks up against the likely growth in transportation projects. For drivers, the net effect would leave the total cost of state and federal fuel taxes at 17 percent of the pump price, compared with the 20 percent it was 20 years ago, according to The Baltimore Sun.
Mr. O'Malley, in his final term and a subject of presidential speculation for 2016, is not backing down. He argues that elected officials can no longer escape the ''tough choices'' of public service by resorting to no-new-taxes pandering that never built a bridge nor paved a road.

HEADLINE: Chinese Vice President Urges U.S. to Respect 'Core Interests'

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On the second day of an ambitious tour through the United States, China's vice president and presumed next leader, Xi Jinping, said Wednesday that the two nations must respect each other's ''core interests'' while working to build trust and cooperation on a variety of issues, including trade policies and diplomacy with North Korea and Iran.
Mr. Xi delivered his remarks, billed as the major policy speech of his five-day trip, at a lunch attended by hundreds of business executives, officials, China scholars and diplomats.
Mr. Xi's use of the term ''core interests'' was intended to emphasize the existence of a line that the United States and other countries should not cross in discussions with China. The Chinese government's definition of the term has been evolving in recent years, but it has become standard in diplomatic conversations between China and the United States, and Chinese officials have been using it more often and more assertively to push back against a variety of pressures from other nations. 
In particular, ''core interests'' has come to mean territorial sovereignty, and Mr. Xi stressed that the United States should oppose those advocating independence in Taiwan and Tibet. Protesters supporting Tibetan independence have been especially vocal in the streets of Washington during Mr. Xi's trip, waving Tibetan flags and chanting as Chinese officials have been driven from meeting to meeting through the capital.
Conflict has once again flared on the Tibetan plateau in the past year, and unrest there is one of China's greatest security concerns; nearly two dozen Tibetans, mostly clergy members, have burned themselves to death since last March out of frustration at their plight, and mass protests have taken place in Tibetan towns in recent months. Chinese security forces have opened fire on several occasions.
Mr. Xi said he hoped that the United States would ''honor its commitment to recognizing Tibet as a part of China and oppose Tibetan independence and handle Tibetan issues in a prudent and proper manner.''
On the issue of expanding respect for human rights, Mr. Xi said, ''It is only natural that we have some differences.''
Later, Mr. Xi softened his tone with a long anecdote about how as a provincial official he had helped the wife of an elderly American professor visit the town in Fujian Province where the professor had spent part of his childhood.
Mr. Xi's comments came a day after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in an official welcoming toast at a State Department lunch, outlined a long list of American complaints and plans, focusing on trade and currency issues and the reassertion of American military influence in Asia.
Just as Mr. Biden's remarks were aimed in part at his domestic audience in an election year, Mr. Xi's muscular remarks on Taiwan and Tibet seemed intended as much for Chinese ears as American ones.
Mr. Xi, who is expected but not certain to succeed President Hu Jintao in the fall, has to appear willing to stand up for the interests of China while being able to build a relationship with the United States. Any sign of weakness could give ammunition to his political opponents.
The intense rivalry over China's leadership jobs has been underscored in recent days by talk of a political attack on Bo Xilai, a powerful municipal official with aspirations to higher office who, like Mr. Xi, is considered a ''princeling,'' the child of members of the Communist Party aristocracy.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Xi visited with Congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, where human rights conditions in China have been a focus of criticism far more strident than at the White House.
On Tuesday, some representatives listened to testimony on rights abuses in China, with a focus on the cases of two imprisoned rights activists, Guo Quan and Gao Zhisheng.
''It is our fervent hope that Vice President Xi can reverse the course of his predecessors and usher in positive changes in China,'' Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey and chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, said in a statement on Tuesday. ''But we remain extremely concerned, as the run-up to Vice President Xi becoming the next leader of China has been accompanied by one of the worst crackdowns in recent memory.''
The lunch at which Mr. Xi delivered his speech, held at a hotel, the Washington Marriott Wardman Park, was organized by the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee on United States-China Relations. But the points he touched on reached beyond economic matters. Until this speech, he had not publicly invoked China's core interests.
Using other common diplomatic terms, Mr. Xi also emphasized the need for the United States and China to ''increase mutual understanding and strategic trust.''
Mr. Xi underscored the close economic ties between the nations, saying that two-way trade had reached $446 billion last year and was expected to grow to more than $500 billion this year.
But China needed the United States to address certain ''imbalances,'' he said, ''in particular, easing control on civilian high-tech exports to China as soon as possible.''
On Tuesday, Mr. Biden and President Obama assertively told Mr. Xi and other officials in separate meetings that China must help rebalance the world economy and lower trade barriers. In particular, they said, China needed to appreciate its currency; enforce laws around intellectual property rights; and halt rules that compel foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts or the Chinese government in exchange for doing business in China.
Mr. Xi later acknowledged in a forum with business leaders that he had heard the complaints, but that China had its own demands of the United States, particularly concerning American restrictions on exporting technology.
On Wednesday, in what appeared to be a rejoinder to Mr. Biden's assertion the previous day that the United States was a Pacific power, Mr. Xi spoke of China's hopes and hesitations in seeing the United States try to widen its role, economically and militarily, in Asia.
''China welcomes a constructive role by the United States in promoting peace,'' Mr. Xi said. ''At the same time, we hope the United States respects the interests of China and other nations in this region.''
Mr. Xi left the Wednesday lunch after delivering his remarks to catch a flight to Iowa. He had plans to visit with Americans he had met in the farming town of Muscatine when he went there in the 1980s as part of a delegation of midlevel Chinese officials studying agriculture techniques.
Mr. Xi is scheduled to fly to Los Angeles from Des Moines on Thursday and is expected to spend two days in California.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the visit to the United States of Xi Jinping, the vice president of China, misspelled, in some editions, the given name of an imprisoned Chinese human rights activist whose case was discussed in a Congressional hearing the day before Mr. Xi met with Congressional leaders. The activist is Guo Quan, not Yuan.

HEADLINE: Fatalities Among Teenage Drivers Rose in First Half of 2011, Study Finds

BYLINE: TANYA MOHN


HIGHLIGHT: If the upward trend were to continue through 2011, the uptick would break eight years of steady declines, according to the study's authors, who are expecting data for the second half of 2011 in coming months. 

 BODY:
The death toll for teenage drivers increased in the first six months of last year, according to a new report. If the trend persisted in the second half of 2011, it would mark the end of eight consecutive years of declining fatalities among 16- and 17-year-old drivers.
The number of teenage drivers who died in crashes increased by 11 percent in the first half of 2011 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the report released Thursday by theGovernors Highway Safety Association, an organization representing state highway safety offices. Data for the second half of 2011 will be released in coming months.
"I think it's going to be a wake-up call," Dr. Allan Williams, a road safety consultant and the former chief scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit group financed by the insurance industry, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Williams prepared the report released Thursday. "What's remarkable is that in the last few years, deaths in those age groups plummeted, so even a slight reverse is a matter of concern," he said.
The historical decrease in driver deaths among this age group has been pronounced. In 1995, there were 1,015 recorded deaths among 16- and 17-year-old drivers, whereas in 2010, there were 408 deaths. 
According to Thursday's report, total deaths of 16- and 17-year-old drivers increased to 211 in the first half of 2011 from 190 in the period a year earlier, based on data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Of these states, 23 reported increases, 19 recorded decreases and eight, in addition to Washington, noted no change. Florida, Texas and North Carolina reported the highest number of deaths.
Mr. Williams said the conclusion was preliminary, but past analyses indicated more road fatalities occurred in the second half of the year than in the first half. He said he expected the report's initial findings to be an accurate predictor of teenage fatalities in 2011, once all states had issued their reports. 
Contrasted with the death rate among teenage drivers, total motor vehicle deaths declined 0.9 percent during the first six months of 2011, according to projections from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Mr. Williams said the uptick in deaths among teenagers could partly be attributed to the upturn in the economy. The cost of gas and acquiring a license might have kept some teenagers off the roads during more troubled economic times, he said, but as the economy improved, more teenagers might have started to drive, which would have increased their exposure to risk.
Another possible explanation posited by Mr. Williams related to graduated driver licensing laws, the benefits of which may be leveling off. First introduced in the mid-'90s, the laws have been upgraded at the state level over the years, but more could be done to improve them, according to Mr. Williams, like strengthening restrictions on the number of passengers in a vehicle, and on night driving.
"We've got a good building block, but just about every state could make improvements," he said, noting that compliance with graduated driver licensing laws also needed to improve. "This is something we know that works."
Troy E. Costales, chairman of the Governors Highway Safety Association, said refocusing efforts on driver education and getting parents more involved in supervising their teenagers was also essential to reducing youth fatalities.
"We need to take advantage of the moment," Mr. Costales said in an interview. He described the driver training period as "a one-shot opportunity to get it right, to do it well and to make a difference. It is critical, as most people may never get that opportunity again."

HEADLINE: 'It's All About the Dust and Decadence of India'

BYLINE: SHIVANI VORA


HIGHLIGHT: An interview with Mumbai fashion designer Naeem Khan. 

 BODY:
Mumbai-born fashion designer Naeem Khan presented his Fall 2012 collection at Lincoln Center on Tuesday afternoon as part of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York City. The 39 looks he created had a distinct Indian feel with their paisley patterns and Indian body art motifs [known as Tilakas] such as series of white swirls and was titled "The Body As A Canvas: From the Mughal Paisley to the Hindu Tilakas" to reflect the influence.
Unlike Khan's last few seasons where bold colors were a mainstay, black and beige were the predominant hues this year in his red carpet appropriate dresses and separates. And as usual, the clothes had lavish embellishments like mirrors, crystal beading and elaborate metallic embroidery, which was done in India.
The show attracted a high-profile crowd including actor Matt Damon and his wife Lucy, actresses Holly Robinson Peete, Kristin Chenoweth and Ahna O'Reilly and "Top Chef" host Padma Lakshmi.
The 54 year-old Khan spoke with India Ink backstage about his latest collection ten minutes before the models were scheduled to start walking down the runway.
Q.
What was your inspiration for your Fall line?
A.
It's all about the decadence and dust of India. The white circles and dots on some of the dresses are the patterns the Sadhus use on their bodies- I actually hand painted them on myself. A lot of the patterns are from body painting. I looked at tribal India and made it luxurious by using rich fabrics. This is the dust aspect. Then the paisley patterns on some of the pieces represent the decadence in India. So I've taken one element from the two sides and created a whole collection out of it.
Q.
 Why India and why now?
A.
 Being Indian, India is always a big part of my life, and when I last visited in October, I really felt inspired so I thought it was the right way to go. 
Q.
Many of your past collections have been heavy in bright colors, but this one is darker themed. Why is that?
A.
In a business like mine, I need to give my customers a reason to by my collection. They've already bought so much color from me, and this is a new reason to buy something which is a little more muted. Come spring, I will get back into color again.
Q.
You've been designing for nearly a decade now- how have you changed as a designer over the years?
A.
It's become like a big kitchen. I know so many ingredients now, and it's becoming easier to have so many more combinations to play with. I am a little more relaxed, I've got a bigger team, I've had professional success so things are only better, and they will continue to get easier and better.
Q.
The New York Times Style section has a story last week about the Michelle Obama effect- when she wears a designer's clothes, it usually results in a skyrocketing career. Mrs. Obama has worn your dresses a few times. How has it changed your business?
A.
The impact has been unbelievable. The first time she wore one of my dresses, I was the third most Googled thing in the country. The awareness that is created by that is substantial. And sales come from that awareness.
Q.
Do you think luxury is making a comeback after challenging economic times?
A.
Absolutely. When the economy was weak in 2009 and 2010, I changed my strategy. Instead of doing all gowns, I was doing more separates so you could create multiple outfits out of one piece. Stores back then were buying product in a limited way, and now they are ordering way more of the product, and it is not staying on the shelf. So that's the gauge I'm using to say that luxury is back.

HEADLINE: Shaking Off the Horror of the Past in India

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Narendra Modi has managed to endear himself to a vast section of the economically powerful, despite alleged links to the Godhra carnage. 

 BODY:
"He is a talented Indian, who lives in the United States with his talented wife. He is an engineer with an M.B.A. and works in a credit ratings agency. He is a law-abiding man, a good father and a good husband," Manu Joseph writes in the International Herald Tribune. 
"Ten years ago it might have been unthinkable that such a person would admire" Narendra Modi, but a decade after the riots in Gujarat that led to the death of hundreds of people, the chief minster of Gujarat "has managed to endear himself to a vast section of India's economically powerful urban middle class and business community, at home and abroad," he writes. 
During his own reporting in the aftermath of the riots, Mr. Joseph "stumbled upon" an alarming fact: 
While reporting from Gujarat on the aftermath of the riots, I stumbled upon the fact that a senior minister in Mr. Modi's cabinet, Haren Pandya, had testified in a shroud of secrecy before a tribunal that was investigating the cause of the riots. When I approached Mr. Pandya about this, he told me that he had told the tribunal that on the night of Feb. 27, Mr. Modi held a meeting with senior police officers and bureaucrats during which he is alleged to have instructed the police to allow the mobs to vent their anger on Muslims. It is a charge that Mr. Modi has consistently denied.
Mr. Pandya, who was a political adversary of Mr. Modi, told me that he did not attend that meeting, but that other people who were present had told him what had happened.
Months later, Mr. Pandya was found shot dead in his car. 
Mr. Joseph concludes: "The talented Indian sees a modern leader in Mr. Modi - an efficient man who can build roads and industries with great speed, even though, somehow, 10 years ago he was not efficient enough to save hundreds of Muslims from the "spontaneous reaction of the Hindus."

HEADLINE: How Small Businesses Can Hurt the Economy

BYLINE: BARBARA TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: Most small businesses have little value beyond their balance sheet or profit-and-loss statement and cannot be sold as going, operating businesses. 

 BODY:
Few people have the perspective that business brokers do on just how close some small businesses can come to closing their doors. Transferring business ownership is a delicate process at best, whether the business is sold to a third party or handed off to the next generation. Success can easily be derailed by any number of variables, from financial realities to emotional perceptions.
While some businesses soldier on, the result of many failed sales is the inevitable winding down and liquidation of the business. When I see the writing on the wall, I know what it will mean to the owner but I am also aware of how it will affect the local economy. I recall one particularly difficult deal that closed by the skin of its teeth back in 2010. The owner had never given a thought to selling the business until he was looking down the barrel of personal bankruptcy. If that deal hadn't gone through, nine landlords would have lost retail tenants, $5 million in sales would have vanished and 43 jobs would have disappeared. 
My own little coffee business was recently shuttered after six years with the new owner. That meant three locations closed, 16 mobile units liquidated and at least 14 jobs lost by my count. According to a new study by BizBuySell, continued sluggishness in the business succession marketplace resulted in 308,000 fewer jobs added to the economy in 2011 and $11.5 billion in lost investment and consumer spending.
Other than with my husband, I have had few conversations about how the failure to build a business with transferable value affects local economies. But I recently received a LinkedIn message on this topic from Chuck Richards, founder and chief executive of Chairman's View and creator of CoreValue business-assessment software. In addition to engaging in four start-ups and two turnarounds, Mr. Richards studied economics at Williams College and earned degrees in business and engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The following is a condensed version of several recent conversations.
Q: 
Mr. Richards: Springfield, Vt., was a small town of about 10,000 folks and one of the world's leading machine tool centers, with close to 5,000 well-paid manufacturing and management jobs. The prosperity built wonderful schools, opportunities for kids and a small town with a tight social fabric. The machine tool businesses began to disappear during the 1970s. By the 1980s the jobs had dried up and a vibrant community imploded.
Q: 
Mr. Richards: Living with the real social cost of lost jobs and economic collapse changes your view of the world, and it compelled me to search for answers.
Q: 
Mr. Richards: Most businesses have little value beyond their balance sheet or profit-and-loss statement and cannot be sold as an ongoing operating business. They lack the processes and infrastructure to dependably generate revenue and profit going forward, especially without the current business owner in charge. As a result, the owners get tired, and without options, they simply close. Some businesses can be sold for their hard assets, intellectual property or profits and the buyer strips them. Springfield saw both.
Q: 
Mr. Richards: If businesses are treated as long-term, stable assets - with sustainable and transferable revenue and profit - the economic landscape changes. And it happens one business at a time. We grow and protect our economy from the bottom up.
Q: 
Mr. Richards: Today we face thousands of potential Springfields. The demographic wave of retiring baby boomers means across this country each and every town will go through a business-transfer challenge. There are about 5.9 million private businesses with employees in the U.S. The demographic wave is clear in the numbers, as over four million are owned by baby boomers nearing retirement. These businesses generate $6 trillion in revenue and represent over half the U.S. job base. They fuel more than half our G.D.P. So half our job base is going through a transition where historically only one in four businesses are successful in transferring.
The sale of a business is the retirement plan for most boomer business owners. Let's say each business was worth an average of a million dollars; we would be talking over $4 trillion in potential wealth. If only one in four sells, we would lose $3 trillion in wealth. It just evaporates. We are talking about millions of jobs; we are talking about lost retirements; all on the line if we do not fix the transfer problem.
Q: 
Mr. Richards: Here's the good news. We know if you transfer a business well, it grows and creates jobs. We know new blood in old businesses is a shot of adrenaline, with new energy, new technology and a focus on the future. For the first time in three generations we have the chance to reinvigorate our economy with new blood. The boomers have the opportunity to transfer their businesses to the next generation in a way that grows the economy. It all starts with defining success as value, not profit.

HEADLINE: Would You Rather Attend a Public or a Private High School?

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Student Opinion | Tell us about your own schooling history: have you been to public schools, private schools, parochial schools or some combination? Which type of school would you prefer for high school, and why? 

 BODY:
In "Affluent, Born Abroad and Choosing New York's Public Schools," Kirk Semple writes:
Miriam and Christian Rengier, a German couple moving to New York, visited some private elementary schools in Manhattan last spring in search of a place for their son. They immediately noticed the absence of ethnic diversity, and the chauffeurs ferrying children to the door. 
And then, at one school, their guide showed them the cafeteria.
"The kids were able to choose between seven different lunches: sushi and macrobiotics and whatever," Ms. Rengier recalled. "And I said, 'What if I don't want my son to choose from seven different lunches?' And she looked at me like I was an idiot."
For the Rengiers, the decision was clear: Their son would go to public school.
"It was not the question if we could afford it or not," said Ms. Rengier, whose husband was transferred to the city because of his job as a lawyer and tax consultant. "It was a question of whether it was real life or not."
In New York, the affluent typically send their children to private schools. But not the foreign-born affluent. In a divergence, a large majority of wealthy foreign-born New Yorkers are sending their children to public schools, according to an analysis of census data. 
... In interviews, affluent foreign-born New Yorkers said that like all conscientious parents, they weighed various criteria in choosing schools, including quality, cost and location. But many said they were also swayed by the greater ethnic and economic diversity of the public schools. Some said that as immigrants, they had learned to navigate different cultures - a skill they wanted to imbue in their children.
"When they go to public school, they're in a whole new world, a whole world of different people and different values, which is what the world is like," said Lyn Bollen, who grew up in Birmingham, England, and attended - and taught at - state-run schools. "Shielding them from that is doing them a disservice."
Students: Tell us about your own schooling history: have you been to public schools, private schools, parochial schools, or some combination? Which type of school would you prefer for high school, and why? What do you think of the opinions of the affluent foreign-born quoted in this article about how public schooling helps one "navigate different cultures" - at least in diverse urban places like New York City? In your area, where do most people tend to send their children to school? What advantages and disadvantages do you see for each system? Why?

HEADLINE: Home-Made Jerky? That Was Our Idea

BYLINE: HUGO LINDGREN


HIGHLIGHT: In his "It's the Economy" column this week, Adam Davidson writes about a Brooklyn entrepreneur who went into business with his own brand of artisanal beef jerky. Hey, I thought, we had that idea here at the magazine once upon a time. 

 BODY:
In his "It's the Economy" column this week, Adam Davidson writes about a Brooklyn entrepreneur who went into business with his own brand of artisanal beef jerky.Well, we had a similar idea here at the magazine once upon a time. It was 2001, and I was helping put together the year-end "The Lives They Lived" issue. Among the notable deaths was Adolph Levis, who had invented the Slim Jim. My bright idea was to get Manny Howard, a culinary-adventure journalist, to produce a facsimile of what the Slim Jim was like when it was first introduced in the 1940s.
Naively, we believed the company would happily hand over the original recipe, but the corporate owners brushed us off, and Levis's family claimed to have no record of it. So Manny turned to an expert at Lupa, a meat-eater's paradise in lower Manhattan, who concocted something based on a traditional recipe for "rope sausage." Imagine our excitement as we shipped it off to Levis's son-in-law for his approval, and then imagine our crushing despair as he phoned back with this withering critique:
The samples are way off. The color is wrong, the chop is wrong, the consistency of the casing is wrong. The spicing just doesn't seem to be there, and the lactic-acid starter culture? Didn't taste any.
Looking back on it, I think he knew we had produced something far tastier than the Slim Jim has ever been. We tried our rope sausage out on the discerning bar crowd at Montero's on Atlantic Avenue, and they liked it just fine. Only too bad we didn't think to go into business.

HEADLINE: Paul Volcker vs. the Bank of Canada

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: In opposing an American regulation limiting banks' proprietary trading, the Canadian central bank recommends an approach that would seriously undermine financial stability in the United States, Canada and other countries, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The Volcker Rule is intended to curb "proprietary trading" - specifically, high-risk bets placed by our largest banks. The Dodd-Frank financial reform act put it into law, and the relevant regulators have proposed a detailed and credible set of regulations to make it work. In accordance with typical administrative procedure in the United States, comments on these regulations were solicited. The deadline was this past Monday.
Congress rightly decided that excessive risk-taking by very large banks had to be curtailed. Responsible regulators around the world are cheering from the sidelines, and that's why I was shocked to see the recent comment letter from the Bank of Canada that criticized the American law. 
The legislative intent behind the Volcker Rule is clear - and reaffirmed in detail in the comment letter by Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Carl Levin of Michigan, the co-authors of the relevant part of the Dodd-Frank legislation. 
The reason that the general approach and this specific regulation makes sense, given past practices and likely future risks, is laid out in meticulous and convincing detail in the comment submitted by Dennis Kelleher and his colleagues from Better Markets.

The big banks and their allies are naturally fighting back. They like the implicit too-big-to-fail subsidies and are apparently offering to split those with people who will support their positions in public (including some of my academic colleagues). Their collective lack of concern for the public interest is also natural, if somewhat callous. 
But the executives of these companies have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to make profits, and they interpret the too-big-to-fail subsidies as helpful in this regard. Government support, after all, allows these banks to borrow more cheaply and to take on more risk (gaining more when they get lucky, precisely because they have "downside protection" provided by taxpayers).
The Bank of Canada, that country's central bank, would ordinarily be expected to take a broader perspective, at least aligned with the social interests of the Canadian population. The bank has a strong and well-earned reputation for safeguarding financial stability in the Canadian context, and its governor, Mark Carney, is the current chairman of the Financial Stability Board, the international body charged with coordinating efforts to prevent the global financial system from blowing itself up again. 
(Mr. Carney was not in charge of the stability board during its long period of inaction and cognitive capture in the period preceding the 2007-8 crisis, when it consistently and excessively deferred to the "wisdom" of large global banks. According to his official biography on the Bank of Canada Web site, Mr. Carney worked at Goldman Sachs for 13 years but has not since 2003. I am not asserting and do not believe that this has anything to do with the issues at hand.)
In its letter, the Bank of Canada states that Volcker Rule provisions should apply only to entities that are or could damage American-insured depository institutions (see the last paragraph on Page 3). But we are far beyond worrying only about banks that have backing from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
In the post-Lehman and post-A.I.G. world, operating within the legislative framework of Dodd-Frank, smart regulators think in terms of "systemically important financial institutions." What really matters is whether an individual bank or other financial-service company is so big or so important to the system that its failure could bring down many others. Some institutions designated systematically important have federally insured deposits; others do not (just as Lehman Brothers did not when it failed in September 2008).
The legislative intent of Dodd-Frank is most definitely to identify and limit system risk wherever it occurs, including outside the banking system. The Volcker Rule is just one essential part of this effort.
The Canadian authorities also appear to believe that the Volcker Rule would constrain the activities of Canadian banks in Canada. That is not my understanding, nor the views of experts with whom I have consulted. The Volcker Rule applies to American banks and to the American subsidiaries of foreign banks; regulators in other countries can decide what to do about their own banks at home or anywhere other than in the United States. 
The more serious assertion made by the Bank of Canada is that disallowing proprietary trading by a handful of American megabanks would negatively affect the market for Canadian sovereign debt in a significant fashion (Page 2).
Writing in The Financial Times on Tuesday, Paul Volckerdelicately but deliberately demolishes this absurdity. He points out that in the 1970s and 1980s, when he was one of this country's most senior policy makers, Glass-Steagall and other regulations effectively prohibited proprietary trading and other securities trading by American banks. Mr. Volcker writes,
I do not recall - and I am morally certain it never happened - receiving a single complaint that the United States was discriminatory, that it damaged other sovereign debt markets or that it limited the ability of foreign governments to access capital markets.
Relative to the nuanced dialogue that usually takes place between current and former central bankers, this is a slap in the face. And Mr. Volcker is right to be confrontational.
The Bank of Canada provides no evidence to support its implicit proposition that American banks' proprietary traders account for a large fraction of either Canadian debt outstanding or the daily turnover of that debt. The Bank of Canada needs to publish these data if its arguments are to be taken seriously.
Keep in mind that under the Volcker Rule, as proposed, American banks would still be allowed to hold Canadian sovereign debt and to buy and sell in the course of normal market-making transactions (as well as to underwrite the issue of securities in the normal fashion). 
Only proprietary trading is being restricted, with the banks having great (and perhaps too much) leeway to define what is proprietary and what is market-making.
There is also inadequate consideration given to the obvious point: if the provision of liquidity in the market for Canadian debt is valuable, and if large banks will be less able to play this role (or will seek to charge a higher spread between the prices at which they buy and at which they sell such securities), then other firms and their traders should enter. 
Just because Goldman Sachs wants to charge you a higher price - as its chief financial officer, David Viniar, has declared - does not mean you need to pay that price. Fortunately, there is still some substantial degree of competition in such markets (and if the Bank of Canada feels strongly to the contrary, it should push hard for an antitrust investigation).
The underlying Canadian argument, of course, is that its debt is just as safe as United States Treasury obligations (see the paragraph at the top of Page 4). But where exactly would we draw the line between "safe" and "not safe" foreign government debt? 
We know that ratings agencies are routinely mistaken in their assessment of sovereign credit risk; this has been the case in almost every major crisis in recent decades (remember the AAA ratings on junk mortgage products?) 
Canada is not alone in seeking an exemption from the Volcker Rule. The European Union would like an exemption for the debt of its member governments, yet Greece is already effectively in default, and several other countries are likely to follow (see my recent paper with Peter Boone on this topic). Some Japanese officials have expressed interest in an exemption from the Volcker Rule, yet Japan's net debt is reckoned to be more than 120 percent of gross domestic product. This is a highly indebted country, and it would be foolish to grant any kind of waiver from the Volcker Rule to a country with such a high debt level.
If one or more foreign governments would care to indemnify the United States against losses incurred by our largest banks because of trading in those nations' debt, this could be the basis of an interesting negotiation (see Dennis Kelleher's suggested variant). 
For example, would Canada be willing to pledge its International Monetary Fund quota - or other reserve-type holdings, preferably denominated in American dollars - to make good any losses classified under proprietary trading by big American banks (i.e., that would otherwise be covered by the Volcker Rule)? 
Any such assets would need to be held in escrow, or there would be a very real risk that when the time came to collect, the countries in question would be unable to pay. For example, imagine what would now be the situation if American banks held a large amount of Greek government debt.
Or perhaps the Canadian taxpayer would be willing to subscribe to a new issue of convertible contingent debt issued by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase - allowing them to assume a "first loss" position whenever the management of such entities makes very big mistakes (or worse). 
As Mr. Volcker put it bluntly in his Financial Times piece, "Let us not be swayed by the smokescreen of lobbyists dedicated to protecting the interests of some highly compensated traders and their risk-prone banks."
The Bank of Canada should withdraw its comment letter. Alternatively, regulators in the United States should ignore such selfish interests of foreign governments, even when those sentiments come from the ordinarily sensible and responsible Canadians.

HEADLINE: Want to Study Business in the United States? Some Suggestions on How to Get Started

BYLINE: TANYA CALDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Excerpts from interviews with officials from Babson College and Bentley University, as well as the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who answer questions about studying business as an undergraduate in the United States. 

 BODY:
How might an Indian student interested in studying business as an undergraduate in the United States begin the task of finding a program that might prove a good fit? And how does one set about seeking admission?
Researching such questions is not necessarily an easy task, especially from afar. But in this latest installment of The Choice on India Ink, we attempt to provide some basic guidance.
Specifically, we talked to representatives from three American colleges and universities with well-known undergraduate business programs. They are Babson College and Bentley University, each located close to Boston in Massachusetts, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. While our list is hardly comprehensive -- dozens of colleges and universities offer variations of such programs -- we thought it might be helpful to start with a sampling. At the end of this post, we suggest one way to learn the names of other colleges that offer undergraduate business concentrations.
What follows, now, are excerpts from our interviews, organized around several key questions:
What are examples of the business courses and programs that American institutions offer to undergraduates?

        
Babson College emphasizes entrepreneurship and offers concentrations in several fields, including computational and mathematical financing, global business management, and technology, entrepreneurship and design.
        
Bentley Universityseeks to integrate "business, the arts and sciences, and technology through experiential learning," said Karen Karidoyanes, the senior associated director for international admissions at Bentley. It offers majors in corporate finance and accounting, managerial economics, and marketing. The school requires to students to have a foundation in the arts and sciences, and it's not uncommon for a business student to graduate with a double major as a result, Ms. Karidoyanes said.
        
At the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, students begin taking a mix of business courses and liberal arts classes during their freshman year. "A lot of our students do pick up minors in the liberal arts field," said Celia Cameron, the senior divisional director of Wharton. "We really do spend all four years teaching students how to apply theory." Students at Wharton are encouraged to customize their curriculum. The school offers concentrations in several fields for undergraduates, including in global analysis, managing electronic commerce, and operations and information management.
Is there a large population of international students at these schools?
At Wharton, up to 20 percent of the undergraduates are international students, Ms. Cameron said.
Bentley also has a growing population of international students that currently stands at 15 percent, said Pap Sarr, the director of the Center for International Students and Scholars at Bentley. The school also has a large alumni network in India.
India is the largest represented country among international students at Babson, said Grant M. Gosselin, the dean of undergraduate admissions. In fact, he said, the Indian population is so large that it accounts for 6 percent of the 2,000 students who attend Babson.
What are admissions officers looking for from international students?
Strong applicants often have similar characteristics, no matter their country of origin. Admissions officers say they are looking for well-rounded students with strong leadership skills. Specifically, they look for evidence of strong leadership skills in the students' recommendation letters and their history of extracurricular activities. It's not uncommon, for example, for student entrepreneurs to apply to Babson, Mr. Gosselin said.
As for SAT and ACT scores, admissions officers are interested in students with high scores in math, though they also have a strong interest in a student's high school transcript as a more in-depth indicator of academic achievement. Academic achievement is also relative, said Ms. Karidoyanes. She often compares a student's SAT scores with the national average in his or her home country.
"We're looking for a student who takes advantage of the rigorous classes that the school has to offer, and if they've performed well in that rigor," Ms. Karidoyanes said.
For schools like Babson, however, students should learn calculus or statistics in high school.
"We are looking for students with a quantitative background," said Mr. Gosselin. "We don't teach anything below calculus."
Babson also heavily emphasizes the liberal arts. In fact, half of the curriculum is liberal arts, Mr. Gosselin said.
(Robin Mamlet and Christine VanDeVelde, the authors of "College Admission: From Application to Acceptance, Step by Step," wrote a great post about standardized testing in a previous installment of The Choice on India Ink. Be sure to read "An Indian Student's Guide to the SAT and ACT Admissions Exams.")
What is the international student experience like at these schools?
The schools offer several services -- like international student associations -- to help students transition to college and a new cultural environment. Bentley, for example, pairs accepted students with an international peer adviser who helps them throughout the summer before freshman year, before they step foot on campus. The freshman curriculum also provides guidance on cultural adjustments and classroom behaviors, said Mr. Sarr of Bentley.
"What we're intentionally trying to do is teach from a global perspective," said Mr. Gosselin of Babson. "They'll never sit in a lecture hall. All of our classes are discussion-based classes. We really encourage them to bridge across groups that they may not normally be a part of. So our international students are mixing well with our domestic students."
Each of these schools have opportunities for hands-on learning. Bentley students will be exposed to high-tech facilities that include a simulated stock market trading room and a center of marketing technology, Ms. Karidoyanes said.
At Babson, students are encouraged to become entrepreneurs during their studies, Mr. Gosselin said. "We loan them $3,000 to go out and start their own business their very first year," he said.
Some schools also help international students on visas get paid internships, or study abroad in places where they may decide to work after graduation. Wharton students have worked in the non-profit sector or have started their own businesses while in school.
What should international students know before they arrive?
For starters, be prepared for winter, at least at these three institutions. Students from warmer climates who move to the Northeastern United States might want to seek out an international student adviser for guidance on proper clothes and coats. Students should also determine whether they will need a new cellphone while in school, and if their electronic devices are compatible with the outlets in their dorm.
In addition to seeking out support from international student advisers on campus, students may want to explore the off-campus neighborhood. Wharton's Locust Walk, a pedestrian area, provides an oasis from the urban Philadelphia area, Ms. Cameron said. Also, the Bentley campus is very close to Moody Street, where students can shop for Indian groceries and have a sense of home.
Do readers of The Choice on India Ink have other suggestions about studying business as an undergraduate in the United States? Please use the comment box below to let us know.
Where can you find more information on your own?
Those who believe that rankings are sometimes helpful in leading students to the names of colleges worth researching can check Bloomberg Business Week's annual attempt to handicap undergraduate business programs, although we add this caveat: Take the numerical rankings with a grain of salt.

HEADLINE: Uses for Bayer Aspirin

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: On MSNBC, Rick Santorum supporter Foster Friess made some rather interesting comments about contraceptives. 

 BODY:
Foster Friess, the billionaire investor and Rick Santorum supporter, can't understand why Americans are so preoccupied with sex. During an interview on MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell asked him if Mr. Santorum's comments on contraception might hurt his general election chances. His answer defies summary, so I'll just quote it in full:
I get such a chuckle when these things come out. Here we have millions of our fellow Americans unemployed, we have jihadist camps being set up in Latin America, which Rick has been warning about, and people seem to be so preoccupied with sex. I think it says something about our culture. We maybe need a massive therapy session so we can concentrate on what the real issues are. And this contraceptive thing, my gosh, it's such inexpensive. Back in my day, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn't that costly.
After letting Mr. Friess have his say, Ms. Mitchell said she needed to catch her breath, which may have been the only sensible response at that point. I do wish that she had later pushed Mr. Friess for his opinion on the national conversation is so often dominated by so-called social issues (contraceptives, abortion, gay marriage) instead of the "real issues." Or at least asked him who's responsible for these distractions.
It seems to me it is generally the cross-your-legs-solution people, not the cover-contraceptives-without-a-copay-already people, who are to blame.

HEADLINE: State-Run Ski Slopes Missing Snow and Visitors

BYLINE: DANNY HAKIM


HIGHLIGHT: The three ski areas run by New York State are suffering through the largely snowless winter. 

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The State of New York is finding out what a tough year it is to be in the ski business.
The three state-operated ski areas and the Olympic ski sites in Lake Placid have had nearly 100,000 fewer visitors over the last three months than in the same period a year earlier, according to figures provided by the state to The New York Times. The attendance drop reflects a dearth of snow that has left mountains across the region with bare patches and icy trails. 
The hardest hit state-run ski slope has by far been Belleayre, in the Catskills, which is operated by the Department of Environmental Conservation. The agency reported 53,650 visitors to the slope between Nov. 25 and Feb. 12, down from 110,058 in the same period a year ago. As a result, revenue fell by 38 percent, the agency said.
In the Adirondacks and at Lake Placid, there have been nearly 245,000 visitors to two state-run ski slopes -- Gore Mountainand Whiteface -- and the ski jumps and other facilities used in the 1980 Olympic Games. That is about 41,000 fewer visitors than a year earlier, causing an 11 percent drop in revenue.
The Adirondack slopes and the Lake Placid jumps are overseen by the Olympic Regional Development Authority. The authority was originally created to oversee the ski jumps and other facilities used in the 1980 Games. 
Jon Lundin, a spokesman for the Olympic authority, noted that last winter, the slopes were helped by the recession, which led some people to vacation closer to home, as well as by heavy snowfall. 
"The entire Northeast was blanketed in snow throughout much of the winter, which also helped to contribute to the high number of visits to ORDA's Olympic venues and the Lake Placid region," Mr. Lundin said.
Operators of Northeastern ski slopes like the state's are hoping for a burst of customers over the Presidents Day weekend, as well as some Canadian holidays ahead.
State officials declined to say whether the decline in attendance and revenue would have any impact on the ski areas.
"No layoffs or other personnel actions are planned," said Emily DeSantis, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo last month proposed as part of the state budget that responsibility for Belleayre be transferred to the Olympic authority, consolidating all of the state's ski areas under one entity and moving them all off of the state's books.
The experience at Gore, Whiteface and Belleayre is not unusual. Private ski slopes this winter are also experiencing problems in the Northeast and beyond.

HEADLINE: Three Named to Lead Science School

BYLINE: RICHARD PéREZ-PEñA


HIGHLIGHT: Cornell and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology announced the names of the top administrators for its campus planned for Roosevelt Island. 

 BODY:
Two Cornell University administrators and a professor from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, who helped design Cornell's winning proposal for a new applied sciences graduate school in New York City, will become that school's leaders, the two universities said on Thursday.
Cornell intends to begin offering classes at the new school in September, in borrowed or leased space, but plans call for moving into a major new campus on Roosevelt Island. Completion of the first phase of that project is set for 2017. Cornell will build the school and take the lead in managing it, but it will be operated in partnership with Technion.
University officials and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced the school's top administration at the Manhattan headquarters of Tumblr, the social media site. It was the mayor's brainchild to create the new technology campus, which he hopes will transform the city's economy by attracting engineers and high-tech businesses. In December he announced that Cornell and Technion had won a competition among several universities for free use of city-owned land and up to $100 million in infrastructure improvements.
Daniel P. Huttenlocher, Cornell's dean of computing and information science, will be the dean of the new school, its academic leader, with the added title of vice provost of the university. In keeping with the economic aims of the school, he has experience working with technology companies, and he is a professor in both the computer science department and the school of management.
Mr. Huttenlocher's research specialties include making machines "see," identify and track physical objects, and operation of large-scale online social networks.
Cathy Dove will take the title of vice president and become the operational leader of the new campus, managing development, finances, personnel and community outreach. She is currently associate dean for administration of Cornell's engineering school and has previously been an administrator in the school of management.
Craig Gotsman, a professor of computer engineering at Technion, which is located in Haifa, will become director of the Technion-Cornell Innovation Institute within the new campus. His specialties include computer graphics, geometry and mapping.

HEADLINE: Orissa Born Designer Presents His First Runway Show at New York Fashion Week

BYLINE: SHIVANI VORA


HIGHLIGHT: Bhibu Mohapatra says he has made clothes since he was 13. 

 BODY:
On Feb. 13, Indian fashion designer Bibhu Mohapatra had his first runway show as part of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week at Lincoln Center in New York City. Using the early 20th century Chinese opera, "The White Haired Girl" as inspiration, he presented 30 looks which incorporated rich colors such as sapphire and emerald, luxurious fabrics such as ranch mink and intricate detailing like silk ribbon embroidery.
The 39-year-old Orissa-born designer has previously presented his works at Fashion Week in a format where models stand together on a platform wearing designs that attendees can view all at once.
Mr. Mohapatra was always drawn to being a fashion designer but started off studying economics. It's only when one his professors at Utah State University saw sketches of his designs and pushed him to make his hobby a professional pursuit that he attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. Jobs as an assistant designer at fashion house Halston and design director at French furrier J. Mendel followed, and after nearly a decade at Mendel, he left to start his own line which he launched at Fashion Week in February 2009.
His pieces, which cost between $950 and $8,500, are sold at luxury retailers such as Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus stores in the United States. Actresses Glenn Close, Hillary Swank and Emmy Rossum are a few of the celebrities who have worn his gowns.
Mr. Mohapatra spoke with India Ink the week before his show at his Fashion District offices in Manhattan about his start in the business, how India influences his designs and his professional ambitions.
Q.
Tell us about your latest collection.
A.
I am in the midst of a project of creating costumes for "Aida" which will play at the Glimmerglass Opera Festival this summer (in Cooperstown, New York) plus I am reading the libretto of the Chinese opera "The White Haired Girl" so I am very much in that opera and Chinese world, and that - the pieces have lots of subtle Chinese influences like red colors, high collars, silk fabrics and Asian pattern lace overlaid on fabric.
It's also an emotional collection for me because red was my mother's favorite color, and she has now passed away.
Q.
What is your coming to America story?
A.
I studied economics in India, but I was always interested in fashion. I had been making clothes since I was 13 years old because my mother taught me how to sew, but in India, getting educated in fashion was a foreign concept. So I applied to Utah State University for a master's in economics, and that's how I first came over. I had never been on a plane before so it was quite a trip.
Q.
How did you end up at F.I.T. from Utah State?
A.
While I was there, I continued a sketch book of fashion designs that I had started while in India which one of my professors saw. She encouraged me to apply to F.I.T., which I did a year later after working on more sketches and building up some skills through working part-time as a sewer in the theater department. I attended only after I finished my master's.
Q.
After nine years at J. Mendel, why did you decide to establish your own label?
A.
When you're a designer, you always want to say something completely in your own vocabulary. For me, the drive to have designs that were 100 percent my own and weren't a collaboration grew stronger over the years.
Q.
Describe your aesthetic.
A.
I make dresses and separates that are modern and dressy. They are special occasion pieces, and even simple day dresses have dressier elements like three different fabrics- this is how I say what I have to say as a designer. My clients don't come to me for plain black pants.
Q.
How have working at Halston and J. Mendel influenced your design style?
A.
Halston made me strong technically: I learned about draping and hand sewing. From J. Mendel, I learned about making different textures out of plain fabric, mixing materials and mixing styles in one piece like making something masculine and feminine or using draping and tailoring together. All these elements are important in my designs.
Q.
What was your first collection like, and do you feel that your style since evolved?
A.
I was in London for a week-and-a-half right before I designed it, and I spent a lot of time at the Victoria & Albert Museum in the section on Japanese warriors. On the same trip, I met (artist and fashion collector) Daphne Guinness, who collects armor. I ended up creating 16 pieces influenced by that warrior theme. My newest collection (Fall 2012) has 30 pieces, but the idea behind my designs -- to be dressy and unique -- has not changed.
Q.
Where do you go for inspiration?
A.
India is huge for me. I use lots of bright colors in my works and that definitely comes from being Indian. Understanding how colors work against and with each other is in my eyes because of my Indian background. My embellishment of fabrics like beading is also inspired by India.
Travel and women are my other influences. I love to people watch and see what women are wearing, and I often wonder why they chose the outfits they did or what they're wearing underneath their coats. Watching them definitely gives me fuel for my designs.
Q.
Where do you hope to go from here?
A.
I want to expand my lines each season and do more dressier pieces and daywear separates. I am also planning on starting a bridal line by the end of this year. And, I want to have my own fur collection and eventually accessories. I am not in any hurry to have everything right away though -- I want to grow at a pace where I can still maintain a strong business.
Q.
What's your connection with India today?
A.
Family, friends and food! I go back twice a year to see my dad, other family and friends in Orissa. When I'm there, I relish the food. One of my favorites that I eat is hilsa fish which is coated in a mustard seed and yogurt paste and then baked. In New York, I watch Bollywood movies once a week at my apartment. I also cook Indian food whenever I can and go to Indian restaurants. My favorites are Devi in Manhattan for fancier Indian food and Maharaja Sweets and Snacks in Jackson Heights for simpler dishes like sarso ka saag.

HEADLINE: Skywriting With an Airliner

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Testing the Boeing 787, engineers draw up a flight path that spells out "787" and then the company's logo. The dimensions of the writing were such that no one on the ground could read it. 

 BODY:
The Boeing 787 uses advanced materials and high-tech engines to fly more quietly, with lower emissions of nitrogen oxides and less fuel than previous models, all significant environmental benefits. But sometimes, the engineers who designed have tried to have a bit of fun.
Boeing, which deliveredits first 787 in September, is continuing flight tests of the plane so that it can be certified to fly long distances over water. As part of that testing, it decided to paint the sky last week -- specifically, the northern tier of the continental United States, from Seattle to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. They drew a flight plan that spelled out "787" and then the Boeing logo.
Skywriting, a waning art, is usually done with a single-engine stunt plane; this was a 186-foot-long jet designed to carry more than 200 people.
In theory, a person on the ground could have seen parts of it it in the contrails, the vapor trails left by high-altitude jets, but the canvas was so large that no one on the earth's surface could have seen the whole thing.

It was an 18-hour test covering 9,000 nautical miles, or more than 10,000 statute miles. The company referred to it as playing"Etch-a-Sketch."
Flight Aware, a flight tracking service, not only generated a map but, for the aeronautically minded, also reproduced the flight plan in aeronautical terms. 
And the emissions? According to an outside estimate, a 787 burns about 9,800 pounds, or 1,444 gallons, of fuel an hour in cruise mode. That means emissions of approximately 6.9 tons an hour.
An earlier version of this article misstated the conversion for 9,000 nautical miles into statute miles. The correct distance is more than 10,000 statute miles.

HEADLINE: Attorney General Offers Plan for Nonprofits

BYLINE: DANNY HAKIM


HIGHLIGHT: With help from nonprofit groups themselves, the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, created a report that is an aid package and an attempt to curb abuses. 

 BODY:
Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman is the latest politician to offer an overhaul plan aimed at nonprofit groups.
But the report he unveiled on Thursday is as much an aid package for nonprofit groups as an attempt to hold the line on runaway compensation and other abuses. And it's no wonder -- the report was co-authored with nonprofit groups.
Among other things, the report calls for state-backed, zero-interest loans for struggling nonprofits and changing state laws and regulations to be more friendly to the groups. 
Mr. Schneiderman does propose some steps to bolster self-policing by nonprofit groups, including the use of independent directors to monitor compensation and other issues -- though it's not clear from the report or a legislative summary provided by Mr. Scheiderman's office how an "independent director" would be defined.
But the effectiveness of Mr. Schneiderman's plan most likely hinges on his proposal to tweak state law to give the attorney general greater authority to challenge excessive compensation in court, and the fine print is still being written.
In a statement, Mr. Schneiderman said: "In these difficult economic times, it is more important than ever to make New York a hospitable environment so nonprofits can continue to carry out their vital work. At the same time, we must maintain the public's trust by ensuring that nonprofits are governed effectively, and with meaningful oversight."
Mr. Schneiderman's plan follows an executive order by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo tolimit the amount of state money used to pay executives of nonprofit groups to $199,000, though executives could quite likely circumvent the cap by drawing from other sources of money, including federal aid.
The governor created a panel to review nonprofit compensation last year, after a report was published in The New York Times about compensation abuses at one of the state's largest nonprofits serving the developmentally disabled.

HEADLINE: Moody's Weighs Rating Cuts for Major Banks

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS and more than 100 other financial institutions might have their credit ratings cut by Moody's Investors Service because of increasingly challenging market conditions. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- Moody's Investors Service has put Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS and more than 100 other financial institutions on notice.
Citing increasingly challenging market conditions, the credit rating agency said it would review its grades for 114 banks based across Europe, as well as eight other financial institutions based elsewhere, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Nomura. 
Moody's indicated it could cut some credit ratings by as much as three levels as it weighed the risks to the banks' investment banking models and large capital market exposures.
 "The combination of changed operating conditions and increased regulatory requirements and restrictions has diminished these firms' longer-term profitability and growth prospects," Moody's said in the statement, which was released on Wednesday after markets closed in New York.
In a separate statement from London, Moody's said it was reviewing its ratings for banks based in European countries, including Italy, Spain and Britain. It cited the prolonged euro crisis, concerns about government debt and risks linked to large capital market businesses as reasons.
Banking stocks fell in Europe on Thursday. In London, Barclays shares fell 1.5 percent and HSBC was down 1.2 percent. In Paris, Societe Generale, which also released earnings that missed forecasts on Thursday, and Credit Agricole both fell more than 3 percent.
"The current environment is characterized by disrupted markets and a deteriorating, uncertain economic outlook," Moody's said. "In many countries, weakening sovereign creditworthiness is exacerbating these negative characteristics."
Moody's said it was reviewing most banks in Italy, Spain, France and Britain. They include Barclays, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole. It also cited "fragile funding conditions, wider credit spreads, increased regulatory burdens and more difficult operating conditions" among the reasons for its action.

HEADLINE: Teaching 'Death of a Salesman' With The New York Times

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Articles, lesson plans and more for considering Arthur Miller's most famous play. 

 BODY:
PUB-DATE: March 8, 2012
In 1975, critics suggested the play had gained, not lost, resonance in the 25 years since its premiere. And some believe the story of a man realizing that the success he had chased had eluded him has only become more relevant recently, amid the discontent of the Occupy movement. 
Indeed, in 2011, the Times theater critic Ben Brantley speculated about the 2012 Broadway production: "Willy Loman may emerge as even more a man of our time than he seemed to be of his when the play first opened in 1949." 
Perhaps "Salesman" also endures because the characters continue to remind audiences of themselves, of people they know and of their own fractured relationships. In his review of a 1990 production of "Death of a Salesman," Alvin Klein quoted Miller as saying, "The play is really about mortality and leaving something behind. Willy Loman is trying to write his name on a cake of ice on a hot July day."

HIGHLIGHT: In separate statements, Moody's Investor Service indicated it was reviewing its ratings for scores of banks with concerns over the prolonged debt crisis in Europe and new regulation. 

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service has a message for Wall Street: the skies are still dark.
The ratings agency is reviewing 17 global banks, including Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Credit Suisse, for possible downgrades to their long-term credit ratings, dulling optimism caused by a monthlong rally in which major banks have recovered some of last year's losses.
Moody's said it was weighing the risks to the institutions' investment banking models and exposures to its capital markets business, which include trading securities and underwriting stocks and bonds.
In a separate statement from London, Moody's said it was reviewing its ratings for scores of banks based in European countries, including Italy, Spain and Britain. It cited the prolonged sovereign debt crisis and risks linked to large capital market businesses.
"The combination of changed operating conditions and increased regulatory requirements and restrictions has diminished these firms' longer-term profitability and growth prospects," Moody's said in one of the statements, which was released on Wednesday after markets closed in New York.
Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and UBS could face cuts of up to three notches in their long-term credit ratings. Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank are among the 10 firms that could have their ratings cut by two notches, while Bank of America and three others could be cut by a single notch, Moody's said.
Credit downgrades could hamper Wall Street firms by making it more expensive for them to borrow money, as well as increasing the amount of collateral they are required to post for certain trades. In a regulatory filing last year, Morgan Stanley estimated that a credit downgrade of two notches - a more minor downgrade than the three notches being considered - would require it to post approximately $4.2 billion in additional collateral on derivatives contracts with its trading partners.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman, Mark Lake, declined to comment.
In the United States, the Moody's review points to a sector that has been hobbled, perhaps permanently, by the introduction of new regulation designed to curb risky types of trading and require banks to hold more capital in reserve.
"The tone does seem to be secular rather than cyclical," said Jeffery Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill. "They're looking at how the world is changed."
Downgrades would be unlikely to surprise many investors, who have known for months about the constraints and dangers posed by regulation and the European debt crisis. On Thursday, the largest United States banks being reviewed for downgrade showed little movement in either their stock prices or their credit default swap levels, a measure of the cost of insuring against a firm's default.
"It seems to be more of a historical rating than a prospective rating," said Richard X. Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities, of the Moody's review. "The reason they've provided is something they could have said 12 or 18 months ago."
Although some firms were threatened with bigger downgrades than others, David Fanger, a senior vice president with Moody's, said the problems that led to the wide-ranging review were common to most firms.
"With the most recent action, what we're saying is that the whole sector's relative positioning within our scale may be too high," Mr. Fanger said in an interview on Thursday. "We don't like to move ratings that quickly, but this is an industry that has demonstrated fairly significant transition risk."
Last year was the worst since the financial crisis for Wall Street banks, which saw their revenues plunge as market activity dried up and a European debt crisis loomed. In November, Standard & Poor's, a rival ratings agency, downgraded 15 banks, expressing concerns that new regulations and capital requirements could cut into their long-term profitability.
The Moody's review, a project similar in scope to the review that led to the S.&P. downgrades, was sparked by concerns that the choppy waters of 2011 were caused by a seismic shift in the banking industry, rather than temporary problems that could lessen when the markets recover fully. Moody's expects to make its final decisions on the downgrades within 90 days.
"Capital markets firms are confronting evolving challenges, such as more fragile funding conditions, wider credit spreads, increased regulatory burdens and more difficult operating conditions," Moody's said in its report.
In its review of European banks, Moody's put under review 114 banks from 16 countries, including HSBC of Britain and Deutsche Bank of Germany. Among the reasons Moody's cited were the deteriorating creditworthiness of the region's countries and continued volatility in the Continent's financial markets.
Italian banks were the most affected by Moody's announcement, with 24 to be reviewed. Much of the ratings agency's concern is targeted at the stagnant Italian economy. The International Monetary Fund expects the country's gross domestic product to contract by 1.7 percent this year, while government debt currently stands at 120 percent of Italy's gross domestic product.
"There's a strong belief that the country's public debt is not under control," said Stefano Caselli, a banking professor at Bocconi University in Milan.
While downgrades could be bad news for banks, they may give investors a truer measure of the health of the financial sector. Firms are increasingly turning to businesses like wealth management that carry fewer risks, but lower returns, than once-lucrative proprietary trading desks that are now all but absent at large Wall Street banks.
The changes have already shown up in the bottom line. Goldman Sachs's earnings dropped nearly 70 percent last year; Morgan Stanley's were down 42 percent. And return on equity - a critical figure used to gauge a firm's profitability - dipped into the single digits for many firms, a far cry from the 20 percent and 30 percent figures common in the precrisis era.
Those figures may recover as the market lifts, but Moody's and other ratings agencies are still cautioning that Wall Street may be stuck with a less profitable, more constrained business model for the foreseeable future.
"On one hand, we think it will be more challenging for things to get back to the way they were," Mr. Fanger said. "On the other hand, market participants may not want them to get back to the way they were."

HEADLINE: Obama at the Master Lock Plant

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: The story of a thriving Milwaukee factory fits perfectly with the president's narrative of government-assisted manufacturing renewal. 

 BODY:
It's obvious why President Obama was drawn to the thriving Master Lock factory in Milwaukee on Wednesday, and not because, as he joked, he is increasingly interested in high-strength door hardware as his two girls approach high school.
The factory has an irresistible tale to tell that fits perfectly with Mr. Obama's narrative of government-assisted manufacturing renewal. After chasing low-cost labor in Mexico and China more than a decade ago, Master Lock recently began staffing up its Milwaukee plant again. With out-sourced labor more expensive, and American workers more productive, the company was able to start shipping padlocks from Wisconsin to China instead of the other way around.
"This company has been making the most of a huge opportunity that exists right now to bring jobs and manufacturing back to the United States of America," Mr. Obama said.
It's great that the lock factory is now running at full capacity with a workforce of 412, but Mr. Obama omitted a key fact: 15 years ago the Milwaukee factory employed 1,154 workers.
During those years, computerized factories, robotics, and precision machinery changed manufacturing around the country, from automotive assembly lines to small machine shops. Many of those jobs will not come back, even once the economy does.
There's nothing wrong with expanding manufacturing capacity through tax credits and other incentives, as the president is aggressively trying to do, or with providing money for the specialized training that many companies need. The $8 billion Mr. Obama proposed in his 2013 budget for job training at community colleges could be helpful to many students.
But those students shouldn't raise their hopes too high, and the president should acknowledge that there are severe limits to how far manufacturing can carry the next American economy. As Christina Romer, formerly a senior economic adviser to Mr. Obama, recently wrote in The Times, the 30-year manufacturing decline is not the reason for high joblessness, which can be better addressed through rebuilding infrastructure, helping state governments, and cutting middle-class taxes.
The president favors all those things, and has put a priority on improving education. Many of those community college students, however, are being taught fundamentals they should have learned in high school, if their public school systems were stronger. Training them in the narrow skills that a particular company demands might help them in the short term, but a strengthened K-12 education system would give them a much wider range of options.
One of the most frightening revelations in the New York Times series about the making of the iPhone was that it was not simply lower wages that led Apple and other manufacturers overseas. Among other reasons, it was also the striking lack of mid-level engineers in the United States. Community colleges might be able to help in that regard, but not if they are fully occupied teaching unprepared students basic reading and algebra.
The Master Lock plant, as the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel recently reported, is the sole survivor in a huge graveyard of empty factories in the city's west side industrial corridor. Restoring that corridor, and all the similar graveyards around the country, will require a much bigger investment - in education and infrastructure, just to start - than anyone in Washington seems willing to admit.

HEADLINE: What if the Renminbi Is Not the Problem?

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: The renminbi is up 12 percent since June 2010 on an inflation-adjusted basis and 40 percent since 2005, reports David Leonhardt. Increasingly, executives and economists are suggesting that the West should move on to other issues with China. 

 BODY:
With little fanfare, China's currency has appreciated significantly in the last year and a half, reports David Leonhardt, leading many economists to question whether the exchange rate is still the most important economic issue for the United States to press with China's leaders:
The renminbi remains undervalued, relative to all other currencies, by 5 to 20 percent, according to various estimates. But many business executives and economists say that other issues, like intellectual-property theft and barriers to entering Chinese markets, are now a bigger drag on the American economy.
"A tense Oval Office meeting on Tuesday w-ith Xi Jinping, China's vice president and likely next leader - and tough public comments by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. - continued a three-year campaign by the administration to convince Chinese leaders that a stronger currency is in their interest," David wrote. "Polls show many Americans blame China to some degree for this country's economic problems. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has argued for taking stronger measures against China than Mr. Obama has."
But the fact that policy makers often continue to talk about the renminbi as if the situation had not changed brings its own risks.
"People on the Hill are talking the same way they were a few years ago," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "We should be acknowledging that they've made very substantial progress. I think that would give us more credibility."
Read one high-level Chinese official's response from Davos last month to the pressure over the renminbi in the China Daily's English language site. 
What is the root of the American - and larger Western - malaise? Is China simply benefiting from the so-called competitive advantages of a relatively impoverished and sometime maltreated workforce, just as less developed economies always have in an international system? Or do the United States and Europe have something to learn from China about how to be better, more competitive capitalists?

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
House and Senate negotiators said they had worked out a deal to extend the payroll tax cut and provide additional benefits for unemployed workers while preventing a pay cut for doctors who accept Medicare, Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear write. The reporters say that the deal has the blessing of Democratic and Republican leaders but faces resistance by rank-and-file Republicans.
All over the country, members of the House are finding their positions in that unpopular chamber to be toxic to their campaigns for re-election or other offices, Jonathan Weisman writes. Case in point: What should have been an easy effort by Republicans to capture the Senate seat held by Kent Conrad of North Dakota, a Democrat who is retiring, has turned into a toss-up as their favored candidate in the race, Representative Rick Berg, takes a beating for his record in the House.
Mitt Romney returned to his boyhood home in Michigan on Wednesday to find himself in an unexpectedly tight race with Rick Santorum for the hearts, minds and votes of the state's Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Polls show him trailing Mr. Santorum ahead of the Feb. 28 primary, Ashley Parker writes.
President Obama visited Milwaukee on Wednesday to promote his "insourcing" plan to bring back jobs from overseas, and he managed to squeeze in a dig at Mr. Romney, Helene Cooper reports. Mr. Obama's Wisconsin stop was the beginning of a three-day trip that is mostly a money run, with fund-raisers scheduled in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.
President Obama's birth-control mandate has supporters and opponents alike asking whether the issue is about religious liberty or women's health,and various groups seek to capitalize on the issue in the November elections, Erik Eckholm reports.
Happening in Washington:
Economic data expected today includes new home construction and producer prices for January (8:30 a.m.), weekly unemployment claims (8:30) and weekly mortgage rates (10).
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will speak at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's annual community banking conference at 9 a.m.
At 9:30 a.m., James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, will meet with the Senate Armed Services Committee to talk about world threats.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner testifies before the Senate Budget Committee at 10 and the House Budget Committee at 2 p.m.
At 2:30 p.m., Secretary Janet Napolitano will appear before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee during a hearing focused on cybersecurity.

HEADLINE: In Michigan, Romney Criticizes Unions

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney embraces Tea Party activists at a business round table. 

 BODY:
MONROE, Mich. - At a business round table at an industrial metal processing site here, Mitt Romney on Thursday criticized union bosses and advocated for "right to work" legislation. He also sought to cast himself as a Washington outsider, making sure to promote the support of Tea Party members in attendance.
Pointing out one man as "Dennis - a dry-waller and a Tea Partier," Mr. Romney said: "We have others who are also Tea Partiers here. Hearing your perspective on what the president is doing right and wrong would be helpful."
The man, Dennis Moore, the owner of a dry wall company, was quick to praise Mr. Romney.
"If we put a Tea Party litmus test on candidates, if we were in the time of Ronald Reagan, two years out of California, Ronald Reagan would not have gotten the endorsement of the Tea Party people that I'm giving to Romney right now," Mr. Moore said. "Mitt Romney is conservative."
As a small group of people watched from the wings, Mr. Romney admitted that while "unions play an important role in our economy," there were some tweaks he'd like to make to the system.
"I don't believe the president should step in and say, 'Well, we're going to have a regulation here that says all federal work has to be done by unions,'" Mr. Romney said. "And so I say, No. 1, we're to make it a level playing field. No. 2, we're going to have right to work, where individuals or workers can choose whether they want to be a member of a union or not. No. 3, we're not going to tell union members we're taking dues out of your paycheck to go to a political action committee you may disagree with. That's simply wrong."
Mr. Romney also vilified Washington, casting himself as an outsider who has spent his life in the private sector.
Balancing the budget, he said, "is going to require someone coming from outside Washington."
 "I think there is a mindset, as well as a skill, that comes from having worked in the private sector, where you've got to balance budgets or you'll go out of business," he said.
He spared neither Democrats nor Republicans, telling the group that only an outsider could remedy the broken system in the nation's capital.
"I want to underscore how important it is to have people go to Washington to fix Washington, and don't go there and get fixed by Washington," Mr. Romney said. "One of the challenges we have in our party is we had the leadership in Washington for a while, and Republicans started acting like Democrats. Republicans started earmarking like crazy. Republicans spent too much money, way above the rate of inflation. Republicans didn't send programs back to the states. Republicans didn't eliminate programs, we added programs."
He added: "We were doing exactly what the Democrats have done. And we can't keep doing that." 
Mr. Romney couldn't help but delve into the weeds of the company, National Galvanizing. Before the event started, he took a tour - with no press accompanying him - of the factory.
"I wondered how they made galvanized steel," he enthused. "Now I know."

HEADLINE: Making It Official, With a Smile

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: Members of a bipartisan panel that struck a deal on the payroll tax extension take pen in hand to sign their report as the cameras click. 

 BODY:
Of all the legislative events in Washington, lawmakers tend to enjoy when things get signed the most. 
So with camera-ready smiles and a thumbs-up or two, most of the 20 members of a bipartisan Congressional committeethat drew up a plan to extend a payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits cheerfully showed up Thursday to sign their report. 
One by one, the members filed into the office of the committee's chairman, Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, to sign the papers splayed out on a large table under an ornate chandelier. 
Reporters flocked to each member who entered the room like sparrows to seed-stocked feeders, looking for any final bits of wisdom on the tense negotiations that led to the bill, which House and Senate leaders hope to bring to the floors of their respective chambers by Friday. 
"I think it was actually a healthy process," said Representative Greg Walden, a Republican conferee from Oregon. "We need to do more of this."
 Mr. Camp and his chief negotiating partner, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, linked hands for the cameras, as Mr. Baucus said helpfully for anyone who didn't get the visual cue, "Working together!"
Not everyone was on board. The three Republican senators appointed to the committee - Jon Kyl of Arizona, Mike Crapo of Idaho and John Barrasso of Wyoming - had not signed the bill by midday. 
Mr. Barrasso and some Republican aides said that the three members felt left out of the process of shaping the report and did not feel the need to sign it. A majority of signatures from both chambers was needed to get the job done, and all House Republicans signed it, as well as Democrats from both chambers. 
Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, a Republican conferee, looked genuinely hurt, as if he had been stood up by a handful of people he had invited to dinner. 
"They'll be coming, right?" he asked Mr. Baucus as the two left the ornate room. 
"Jon told me he's not going to do it," Mr. Baucus whispered back, apparently in reference to Mr. Kyl. 
At a news conference, the House speaker, John A. Boehner, said he did not believe Senate Republicans had been left out. "They've been as involved in the process as anybody else," he said, adding: "If I recall correctly, there were two or three public meetings where they were all present. So, for someone to say they weren't involved really would surprise me."
Under the roughly $150 billion agreement reached by House and Senate negotiators, the current reduction in employees' share of the Social Security payroll tax - to 4.2 percent of wages, from 6.2 percent - would be continued to the end of the year. The deal also extends unemployment benefits, but reduces the maximum duration of benefits in states with high unemployment to 73 weeks, from the current 99. It also prevents a pay cut for doctors who accept Medicare. The unemployment benefits will be paid for in part by the sale of some radio spectrum licenses and changes to the pensions of federal workers. 
While Mr. Boehner said the deal was "one that I support," he did not express great love for it.
"Let's be honest," he said. "This is an economic relief package, not a bill that's going to grow the economy and create jobs."

HEADLINE: Santorum Tells Michigan of Strict Opposition to Bailouts

BYLINE: GERRY MULLANY and RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum highlights a difference with Mitt Romney on government financial intervention. 

 BODY:
2:24 p.m. | Updated Addressing a sensitive issue in Michigan 12 days before the state's primary, Rick Santorum said he, like Mitt Romney, opposed the federal loans to the auto industry after the 2008 financial collapse. But he added that he took "a different position from Governor Romney" in opposing aid to the financial industry, too.
"The government should not be involved in bailouts, period," Mr. Santorum told the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday. 
Mr. Romney supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, that provided a financial lifeline to troubled Wall Street banks, but he subsequently opposed the loans to the auto industry. And Mr. Romney has emphasized in recent days that he favored a managed bankruptcy instead that would have let the auto companies confront legacy costs like pensions and health care obligations.
But Mr. Santorum, in his speech Thursday, suggested he has shown more consistency in opposing such government financial intervention across the board.
"I did make my opinions known within the administration," he said, referring to the Bush administration. "I thought what they were doing was wrong."
He said the bailouts set a bad precedent for future presidents.
"It will make it easier for future presidents to intervene," he said. "I blame President Bush more than I blame President Obama," he said, adding that it was Mr. Bush who got the taxpayer-financed rescue efforts in motion.
Mr. Santorum also used some pointed language to discuss the class issues that have been frequently colored the campaign, and alluded to Mr. Romney's comments on this issue, saying there was "another candidate in this race who suggested that he didn't care about the very poor, he cared about the 95 percent."
Then, Mr. Santorum expounded on his own thoughts about income inequality, saying, "I'm about equality of opportunity."
"There is income inequality in America, there always has been and hopefully - and I do say that - there always will be," he said. "People rise to different levels of success based on what they contribute to society and to the marketplace, and that's as it should be."
"We shouldn't have a society that has a president who envies or creates class warfare," he added.

HEADLINE: Romney's Tenuous Electability Edge

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: There are good reasons to believe that Mitt Romney's electability advantage may be less than polls now show. 

 BODY:
The forecast model I've been using in conjunction with a set of New York Times magazine articles suggests that Mitt Romney is likely to fare better than Rick Santorum in the popular vote against Barack Obama. Specifically, the model would give Mr. Romney a 40 percent chance of winning the popular vote against Mr. Obama given G.D.P. growth of 2.5 percent this year (in line with the most recent forecasts), but Mr. Santorum just a 23 percent chance.
Mr. Romney's comparative advantage in the model is based on a set of four objective indicators of candidate ideology, which suggest that Mr. Santorum is further from the center of the electorate on balance - an unfavorable factor historically.
Suppose you accept that candidate ideology matters and the model does a reasonable job of accounting for it. This should be taken to imply that other factors related to the candidates are irrelevant. My view, instead, is that the political science literature sometimes gives short shrift to "candidate quality" factors . Ideology happens to be one factor that we can measure somewhat well - at least as compared to something like "charisma" - but it is plausible that there are other factors that outweigh it.
In fact, the "electability gap" between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum that the model posits is not all that great. Specifically, it estimates that Mr. Romney's more moderate ideology is worth a net of about 3 points in the popular vote - so an election that Mr. Santorum would win by 4 points, Mr. Romney would win by 7. The reason it looks bigger in terms of their respective odds against Mr. Obama is because the election is still projected to be fairly close over all, in which case any small advantage or disadvantage can be meaningful. 
In the magazine article, I argue that one such small factor that could work against Mr. Romney - and possibly in favor of Mr. Santorum - is the Electoral College. A Republican candidate who does poorly with working-class white voters has an extremely tough electoral map because those voters tend to be concentrated in swing states, especially in the Midwest, whereas wealthier whites tend to be concentrated in noncompetitive states, especially on the coasts. 
Indeed, there is some evidence that Mr. Romney is having trouble with just these sorts of groups. In the recent Pew poll, Mr. Romney trailed Mr. Obama by 11 points in the Midwest - worse than his overall 8-point deficit. And he got just 42 percent of the vote among whites whose families make less than $30,000 per year, worse than the 46 percent that John McCain got in 2008.
Suppose that Mr. Obama wins all of the Midwestern states that he carried in 2008 other than Indiana, which may have been something of a fluke since Mr. McCain's campaign essentially ignored the state. But he does win Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota. 
With victories in these states, plus the Democratic base states that the party won in 2000 and 2004, Mr. Obama would already have almost enough electoral votes for victory. Specifically, he'd have 266 electoral votes, just 4 away from the 270 that would guarantee him another term.
Mr. Obama would have a ton of options for where to procure those votes. He could do it in the South (Florida, North Carolina or Virginia), the West (Nevada, New Mexico or Colorado) or the Northeast (New Hampshire). For that matter, he could also do it entirely in the Midwest, by winning either Indiana or Missouri.
On the other hand, suppose that Mr. Obama were to win all of the swing states outside the Midwest, but in the Midwest, he came up short, winning only his home state of Illinois. This would leave him just shy of a victory, with 267 electoral votes.
For that reason, if Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney look as though they'd do about as well the other in the Midwest, much of Mr. Romney's electability advantage dissipates. And a candidate who gets 49 percent of the vote nationally but 51 percent in the Midwest would arguably be better than one for whom the reverse is true.
Apart from the Electoral College, there are some other "candidate quality" factors that work in favor of Mr. Santorum. For instance, his favorability ratings are currently better than Mr. Romney's among general election voters. That could change - Mr. Santorum has not been faced the same scrutiny from the media or faced the attacks from opponents that Mr. Romney has, and favorability ratings can revert to the mean. But it's harder for Mr. Romney to make a case on electability when his favorability ratings are net-negative with the electorate as a whole and with independent voters specifically.
Also, Mr. Santorum might do more to motivate the Republican base than Mr. Romney. The difference isn't likely to be large, but if we're looking at things that might make a marginal difference of 1 or 2 points, it is worth thinking about.
There are also factors that would work in Mr. Romney's favor. He is likely to raise more money than Mr. Santorum, as he has so far in the primary. As Philip Klein notes, Mr. Santorum might be more vulnerable to losing votes to a libertarian candidate (Gary Johnson or, less likely, Ron Paul). Mr. Romney is probably somewhat better vetted than Mr. Santorum at this point. 
And the metrics the model uses to estimate ideology place more emphasis on economic policy than social policy. If social issues became more pertinent in the campaign, the ideology gap could be larger. (Then again, if Republican candidates are spending time debating social issues rather than the economy, it may be a sign that economic conditions have improved enough that Mr. Obama is likely to win anyway.)
The point is simply that this is a debatable case - more so, say, than a comparison of Mr. Romney and Newt Gingrich might be. Also, a party is within its rights to consider factors above and beyond electability. A small additional chance of losing the general election to Mr. Obama might be deemed an acceptable risk if Republicans think Mr. Santorum would be more reliably conservative once in office.
If the electability issue becomes debatable rather than being taken for granted as an advantage for Mr. Romney, he could find himself in some trouble. 
In the recent CNN national poll, 55 percent of Republican voters said that Mr. Romney was the most likely candidate to defeat Mr. Obama, while just 18 percent said the same for Mr. Santorum. This was despite the fact that Mr. Santorum actually led Mr. Romney by 2 points in the poll over all.
Isn't that a favorable factor for Mr. Romney? Actually, it may not be. The reason is that this electability edge is presumably priced into Mr. Romney's stock - and is some of the reason that he is keeping things close. Were the issue to become more debatable in the eyes of Republican voters, he might begin to trail Mr. Santorum by a fairly large margin. And the issue is likely to be more hotly debated if Mr. Romney loses states like Michigan and Ohio, which are crucial in both the primary and general election.

HEADLINE: Small Thinking

 BODY:
Rick Santorum coyly promised a group of Detroit business leaders Thursday that his plan to restore manufacturing and revive the economy was ''just a little different'' than those of the other candidates. The plan he then described was nothing more than a rehash of tired Republican ideas stretching back decades.
Name a tax, and he proposed to cut it: every income-tax rate, including, of course, that on the highest earners. The already low tax on capital gains. The tax on dividends. The corporate tax. And he would simply eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. 
Then, of course, come the spending cuts: $1 trillion a year for five years. He didn't bother to list the hundreds of vital programs that would be devastated in the process. He had one easy prescription for any given safety-net program for the poor: ''Cap it, cut it, freeze it, and block-grant it to the states.'' And inevitably there was the call for far more domestic oil drilling.
But perhaps his most jarring assertion -- especially in Michigan, which has suffered more than most from devastating unemployment -- was that many people are deliberately staying out of the work force in order to luxuriate in their unemployment benefits.
''I hear it from manufacturers, we have a hard time finding workers,'' he said. ''Well, when you have 99 weeks of unemployment benefits, and a variety of other social safety-net programs, people can make choices that they otherwise wouldn't make.''
That is not only out of touch with reality; it is deeply insulting to millions of struggling Americans.
It's true that some companies are looking for well-educated workers, or those with specialized training. But Mr. Santorum's wild spending cuts would ravage the nation's education system and the skills programs those employers need. He has repeatedly made clear his contempt for what he calls ''government-run schools'' (more commonly known as public schools), and has expressed a strong preference for home schooling.
Ultimately, Mr. Santorum's solution for all of the country's problems, from manufacturing to its moral climate, boils down to one very small idea: get government out of the way. Lower taxes and spending, and, like magic, factory floors will suddenly teem with well-educated workers. The carmaker bailout put in place by the Bush and Obama administrations was unnecessary because the companies would have recovered on their own, he said, forgetting that Chrysler and G.M. were on the brink of collapse before the government stepped in. And of course he believes government entitlements replace America's moral foundation with soul-killing dependency.
He says the nation's civil laws must comport with God's laws. But not the laws of all religions. ''Where do you think this concept of equality comes from?'' he asked in South Carolina last month. ''It doesn't come from Islam. It doesn't come from the East and Eastern religions. It comes from the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.''
Unlike his main rivals for the nomination, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, Mr. Santorum has held these kinds of views for many years, and is a far more authentic representative of the Republican Party's angry base. But he does not represent the American mainstream, or its tradition of confronting big problems with big ideas.

HEADLINE: Upturn in Job Market Sets Off a Rally

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market jumped ahead on the strength of the American job market Thursday and barreled toward its highest levels of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average pushed to within 100 points of 13,000. 
The Dow closed up 123.13 points to 12,904.08, a gain of 1 percent. The index has not closed above 13,000 since May 19, 2008.
General Motors was among the best-performing stocks of the day. Two years after it was almost wiped out, the company turned a record $7.6 billion profit last year, bigger even than when Americans could not stop buying trucks and sport utility vehicles.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.81 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,358.04, and the Nasdaq composite was up 44.02 points, or 1.5 percent, at 2,959.85.
Good news about the job market overshadowed continuing uncertainty about the Greek debt crisis.
The Labor Department said weekly applications for unemployment benefits dropped for the fourth time in five weeks to the lowest point since March 2008. That was when the jobless rate was just 5.1 percent, far below the current rate of 8.3 percent.
The stronger reading on the job market led traders to sell Treasury bonds, a sign that they are more comfortable plowing money into riskier assets like stocks. That pushed bond prices lower and yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was sharply higher, at 1.99 percent from 1.93 percent Wednesday.
Investors have shaken off fears about Europe and last summer's concerns about the United States economy and driven stocks steadily higher this year.
John Burke, president of Burke Financial Strategies, says he thinks some of the calm has been caused by the Federal Reserve flooding the market with cheap money. The Fed has promised to keep interest rates near zero for the next several years.
But Mr. Burke warned that the low rates could allow the federal government to put off reducing its budget deficit.
''They're pushing the problem off,'' he said. ''We're fine today, we'll avoid recession, but what's that going to do to us when the term is up?''
European markets did not fare as well. Stock indexes in Britain, Germany and Spain slid, though the Athex index in Greece climbed 1.1 percent.
The Greek crisis plodded along for another day without clarity. Greece is negotiating for breaks on its bonds and for an international bailout aimed at preventing a bankruptcy next month.
Portugal, another troubled country that uses the euro, reported 14 percent unemployment, the highest on record -- a reminder that the European crisis was not confined to Greece.
The euro rose 0.7 percent, to $1.3154, a sign of improving confidence in Europe. The euro had been rising steadily since mid-January but stalled late last week around $1.33.
Gasoline prices could be a threat for the American economy, particularly as Iran threatens to cut exports. The average price for a gallon of gasoline is $3.52, the highest on record this time of year, and could climb to $4.25 a gallon by late April.
A barrel of benchmark crude rose 56 cents to $102.36.

HEADLINE: Citing Losses, Postal Service Seeks Higher Stamp Prices

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mired in red ink, the United States Postal Service is warning it will lose as much as $18.2 billion a year by 2015 unless Congress grants it leeway to eliminate Saturday delivery, slow first-class mail by one day and raise the price of a postage stamp by as much as 5 cents. 
In a letter to Congress, Patrick Donahoe, the postmaster general, described an updated five-year cost-cutting plan put together in coordination with a Wall Street adviser, Evercore Partners. It reiterates many of the mail agency's proposals to switch to a five-day delivery schedule, raise stamp prices and close about 252 mail-processing centers and 3,700 local post offices.
The Postal Service has already asked Congress for permission to make service cuts and reduce annual payments of about $5.5 billion in funding retiree health benefits. But in recent weeks, the Senate and House have stalled as lawmakers differ widely on costs, the level of financial oversight and the prospect of widespread postal closures.
On Thursday, Mr. Donahoe said the mail agency's proposals would enable it to save $20 billion a year by 2015, repay its $12.9 billion debt to the Treasury and return to profitability. The plan, for instance, notes that if the post office could raise stamp prices from 45 cents to 50 cents, either in a single year or over a multiyear period, it could bring in new revenue of about $1 billion.
In contrast, Congressional inaction would result in significant annual losses and a ''long-term burden to the American taxpayer.''
In a news briefing, Joe Corbett, the chief financial officer, said that no formal proposals had been made to increase the price of a first-class stamp. He said the plan described the additional revenue the mail agency could realize over a single or multiyear period if it could increase stamp prices above the rate of inflation.
Since 2006, the Postal Service has increased the price of the stamp four times, from 39 cents to 45 cents.
About half of the Postal Service's cost-cutting proposals require legislative approval. Some Congressional proposals have focused on providing short-term relief through a cash infusion to prevent the mail agency's bankruptcy but also postpone major decisions on cuts until later.
Last week, the Postal Service said its quarterly loss rose to $3.3 billion amid declining mail volume and said it could run out of money by October.
The agency forecasts a record $14.1 billion loss by the end of this year.

HEADLINE: An Upside to China's Air Pollution: More Snowfall in the Sierra Nevada

BYLINE: By JOHN UPTON. 
jupton@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
A storm of yellow dust darkens the skies above Beijing, an increasingly familiar phenomenon blamed on the disappearance of Asian forests. A week later, in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, where annual precipitation levels are expected to decline as the climate changes, a snowstorm delights skiers. 
The storms are starkly different and separated by thousands of miles, but scientists have discovered that they are linked.
Researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California, San Diego, have discovered that dust storms in Asia could help douse the Sierras with snow, bolstering California's economy and rejuvenating its environment.
Spring and summer snowmelts in the Sierras provide fresh water for 25 million people, for wildlife and millions of acres of farmland, as well as for hydropower that meets up to 15 percent of the state's electricity needs.
In experiments that began in 2009, the scientists discovered that dust that glides on high-altitude jet streams from Asia over the Pacific Ocean plays a substantial role in seeding snowflakes that fall over the Sierras.
Industrial pollution, bacteria, heavy metals, dust and other aerosols flow freely from Asia to California. Research suggests that as much as one-third of the airborne lead in the San Francisco Bay Area wafted over from Asia.
Raindrops and snowflakes cannot fall out of a cloud unless there is a floating seed husk, piece of pollen, speck of dust or other aerosol that they can cling to and grow around.
''In order for water to condense out of the water vapor and into a droplet, it has to have a surface to condense on,'' said Doug Collins, a chemist at the University of California who is involved with the Sierra studies. ''Aerosols provide that surface.''
But different particles have different effects on clouds. Some trigger snow or rain, while others dissolve budding droplets, turning them back into mist and preventing or limiting precipitation.
In early 2009, the researchers studied two similar storms that occurred within a week of each other over the Sierras. The first was relatively dust-free. But the second fell from clouds filled with dust from a storm that had torn through China one week earlier, and it dumped 40 percent more snow than the earlier storm.
To test whether the heavier snowfall was related to the dust, the researchers took to the skies last winter in a twin-engine airplane equipped with sensors that counted dust particles and ice crystals. Ice crystals grow into snowflakes as they fall from the sky.
They found a close relationship between the levels of dust in the atmosphere and the number of ice crystals. ''They're in lockstep,'' Mr. Collins said.
The research is part of CalWater, a project that started in 2009 and is intended to improve weather forecasting and modeling.
''There's a lot of uncertainty in precipitation forecasting,'' said Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one of the agencies that sponsored the research. ''It's quite a complicated process.''

HEADLINE: An Embargo and a Boon

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- For months, the Russian government has opposed the idea of Western petroleum sanctions against Iran. But new threats to Iranian oil flow could have at least one beneficiary: Russia.
The Russian oil industry was already reaping the rewards of higher global oil prices from Iranian tensions, even before Tehran raised the stakes Wednesday by threatening to cut off oil to six European nations.
Now, whether Iran carries out that threat immediately or Europe proceeds with its previously planned embargo of Iranian oil this summer, the Russian industry could capitalize more directly. Its pipelines stand ready to serve customers willing to pay a premium price -- with a grade of oil closely resembling Iran's.
''It's pretty good for Russia right now,'' Jesse Mercer, a senior oil analyst based in Houston with PFC Energy, said in a telephone interview. 
Russia is now the world's largest oil producer, pumping about 10 million barrels of oil a day, slightly more than Saudi Arabia. Of this, Russia exports seven million barrels a day. Most of it goes to customers in Europe and Asia, although small amounts from Siberia make it as far as the West Coast of the United States.
For Russian oil companies like Rosneft and Lukoil and the Russian-British joint venture TNK-BP, the international tensions that began over Iran's nuclear development program last autumn have meant a windfall. Analysts estimate that Iran jitters have added $5 to $15 a barrel to the global price of oil, which means an extra $35 million to $105 million a day for the Russian industry. And the taxes the Russian government has received from those sales have been a political windfall for Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin as he campaigns to return as Russia's president. The extra money has helped further subsidize domestic energy consumption, tamping down inflation.
''It's good for Putin,'' Mr. Mercer said. ''In the United States, when oil prices go up, the president's ratings go down. In Russia, it's the opposite.''
Rising prices, of course, are a boon for every oil producer, whether in North Dakota, the North Sea or northern Siberia.
But Russia has a particular advantage: a pipeline system that can supply Iran's traditional customers in both Europe and Asia. Depending on which way the geopolitical winds are blowing, Russia has the ability to direct more or less of its oil either eastward or westward. Some of its oil to Europe travels by pipeline the entire way; other oil is piped to the Black and Baltic Seas and shipped from there.
What's more, the grade of Russia's main export oil, Ural Blend crude, is similar to Iran's and has already been in greater demand as an alternative to Iranian oil for European refineries.
That's why the price of Ural Blend has risen even faster than global prices generally. In December, it traded at a $2 discount to Brent oil from the North Sea. That difference is now gone. Both grades are now trading for about $119.50 a barrel, energy analysts say.
The six nations Iran threatened to cut off Wednesday were, in descending order of the size of their purchases: Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal. Tehran did not explain why it selected those countries, while ignoring even bigger oil users like Germany.
But all six were already planning to stop buying Iranian oil this summer, anyway, as part of an embargo the 27-nation European Union agreed to last month, to begin in July. At its recent peak, Europe was buying 500,000 to 660,000 barrels of Iranian oil a day, according to PFC Energy.
If the European sanctions do take effect then, oil prices could rise further -- by as much as $7 to $13 a barrel above where they are now, in the view of Wood Mackenzie, an oil consultancy based in Edinburgh.
And even if oil prices later fall, Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, would continue to benefit for a while. Russian gas prices in Europe, Gazprom's biggest export customer, are linked to the price of oil under long-term contracts that are adjusted twice annually, based on average oil prices over the previous six months. So even if oil prices decline, Gazprom's gas prices would remain high in the second half of the year.
The United States, despite being a leading critic of Tehran's nuclear ambitions, has been somewhat more muted than Europe on how to punish Iranian's oil industry -- as American politicians have been divided in their willingness to disrupt global petroleum trading and financing to the potential detriment of strategic allies.
In December Congress passed sanctions that, among other measures, impose penalties on foreign banks that clear payments for Iranian oil. Congressional supporters of the sanctions, and the Obama administration, have said the impact on oil prices are justified, given the stakes in Iran.
But the White House also cautioned that the bank strictures could interfere in the business dealings of American allies. And so when President Obama signed the measure, he said some provisions would be nonbinding, angering hawkish supporters of the sanctions, which along with Europe's are set to begin in July.
As it turns out, at least one exemption under discussion is meant specifically to limit the strategic benefits for Russia, which has been an outspoken critic of American and European strictures against Iran.
The United States and European Union are negotiating an exemption that would continue to provide the former Soviet state of Georgia -- a nation that is now a Western ally -- an alternative to Russian natural gas. The workaround allows payments to an Iranian company, Naftiran Intertrade, that has a share of the Shah Deniz natural gas field in the Caspian Sea.
The field, managed by the Western petroleum giant BP, is a supplier to Georgia. It is also a potential source for the proposed Nabucco pipeline, which would be managed by a consortium based in Vienna and backed by some Western European governments to create European competition with Gazprom. But the pipeline, seen as a maneuver to weaken Russia's hand in European energy politics, has been stalled in the planning phase for years.
China, meanwhile, is expected to circumvent the Iranian sanctions with tacit American approval by settling its oil purchases with Iran through banks that have no dealings in the United States. India, for its part, has negotiated to barter wheat for oil, or pay Iran directly in rupees.
To be sure, there are other limits to Russia's ability to fully capitalize on the Iranian oil upheaval. The big one is that the Russian industry is already producing petroleum from its working fields at full capacity, since so much of it comes from far northern and Arctic wells that must operate full-time year-round to keep from freezing. And so Russia cannot suddenly increase its export capacity beyond those current seven million barrels a day.
But its extensive pipeline network gives Russia enviable flexibility to direct its oil to wherever demand -- and prices -- are highest. That could be a boon for its Asian oil distribution.
As it happens, after a decade of Moscow's investment, a trans-Siberian oil pipeline is scheduled for completion in this year's third quarter. That will create opportunities for Russia to export petroleum more cheaply than its current railroad shipments to a Pacific port where it is then pumped into tankers for shipments to Japan and South Korea -- two countries that, as strategic American allies, will be looking for substitutes to Iranian oil.
The new pipeline, called the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline, forks in Siberia so that oil can be sent either to China or to the coast, for export to other Asian customers. It will give Russian exporters the ability to easily exploit likely price differences between customers like China, if it continues as expected to buy Iranian oil, and Japan and South Korea, which probably will not.
''They could arbitrage between the two,'' Mr. Mercer, the analyst, said of this Russian flexibility, ''and it could play to their advantage.''

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept. 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause of rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Sarah Sze: Infinite Line' (through March 25) Promising a new angle on Sarah Sze's mesmerizing, minutely detailed installations, this midcareer solo reveals that Ms. Sze, who is Chinese-American, has been profoundly influenced by many forms of Asian art. It also includes some of her rarely exhibited drawings and encourages you to see her three-dimensional artworks as drawings in space. Implicitly, it de-emphasizes the prosaic nature of her art materials: the cotton swabs, toothpicks, bottle caps and other throwaway objects that she fashions, with gee-whiz structural ingenuity, into rambling landscapes and galactic spirals. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (through April 22) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Frick Collection: 'Renoir, Impressionism and Full-Length Painting' (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick's mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed little girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (through April 29) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor to ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' (through May 6) Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed not as political activists, but as political heroes who fell into history by accident. The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether ''black or white, young or old, gay or straight.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion; the work of his competitors and peers; the evolution of tabloid journalism; and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Jewish Museum: 'The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951' (through March 25) One of many artistic casualties of the McCarthy-era blacklists was the Photo League, a New York school and salon for amateur and professional photographers. Its members -- among them Weegee, Lisette Model and Aaron Siskind -- are now reunited in this stirring show, which traces the group's history through some 145 vintage photographs. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Art in an Age of Revolution: Fu Baoshi (1904-1965)' (through April 15) Serene on the surface but less so underneath, the museum's first full-dress retrospective of a 20th-century Chinese painter is as much about history as art history. It focuses on an artist, teacher and art historian who helped preserve the ancient tradition of ink painting and then struggled to make it relevant under the Communists, bending it toward propaganda, introducing a new degree of realism and making frequent use of the color red. While fascinating, the show leaves you wondering what he might have accomplished under less encumbered circumstances. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Infinite Jest: Caricature and Satire From Leonardo to Levine' (through March 4) It is not nice to make fun of other people, but it is hard to resist. This fascinating and often amusing show presents about 160 drawings and prints from six centuries in which men and women appear ugly, weird, venal and foolish. The show shies away from troublemaking work by contemporary artists, but examples of exceptional draftsmanship and satiric imagination from the past abound. Watercolors by the great British cartoonists James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson alone make a visit rewarding. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Renaissance Portrait From Donatello to Bellini' (through March 18) This magisterial, intensely thought-provoking show presents about 160 works by the most celebrated masters of 15th-century Italian painting and sculpture. It was a time when ancient Greek and Roman precedents inspired artists to create extraordinarily lively images of people in two and three dimensions. The dialogue between painting and sculpture is especially intriguing. Desiderio da Settignano's marble bust of a lovely young woman with a strikingly expressive, coquettish expression creates an illusion of fleeting real life that painters could only envy. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Spies in the House of Art: Photography, Film, and Video' (through Aug. 26) This exhibition of 17 contemporary works inspired by museums doesn't mention Theodor Adorno by name, but it nods toward his ideas in a wall text, which jokes that artists often see museums as ''mausoleums, places where art goes to die.'' Andrea Fraser's video ''Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk'' (1989) leans toward the anti-museum view, while a 16mm film by Nashashibi/Skaer, the duo of British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, made by gliding through the Met in the dark with a camera and a flash strobe, treats the museum like a darkened crypt. Lutz Bacher's video offers another museum tour, while the museum appears in poetically distorted form in photographs by John Pilson, Tim Davis and Lothar Baumgarten. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' alone is a must-see: its five hand scrolls constitute one of the Met's greatest paintings and have never before been shown together. Return visits are merited. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: 'Henry Taylor' (through April 9) Mr. Taylor, who lives in Los Angeles, paints fast, loose and sensuously on canvases great and small. Portraiture is his work's center of gravity, African-American life his subject. With exuberant generosity, he portrays friends, relatives, acquaintances from the art world and off the street and heroes of sports and politics. Along the way, he takes in downbeat cityscapes patrolled by cop cars and envisions allegories of spiritual trauma in the Land of the Free. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression' (through May 6) The city's premier museum of Latin culture explores its holdings in urban folk art, so-called handicraft and other forms of vernacular expression and comes up with visual gold. Among the kaleidoscopic displays are Puerto Rican santos and the winsome cellophane animals, birds and insects of Gregorio Marzan (1906-97). Splendid textiles include Haitian voodoo banners; densely appliqued molas and the patchwork scenes called arpilleras, with which Chilean women kept hope alive for disappeared relatives during the regime of Augusto Pinochet. An intoxicating, if sometimes bittersweet, vitality is revealed. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: Sanja Ivekovic: 'Sweet Violence' (through March 26) This timely and resonant survey familiarizes American audiences with the spare, selfless achievement of this pioneering Croatian artist, born in Zagreb in 1949. Conceptual in style, photo- and performance-based in approach, political in motivation, ardently and precisely feminist, her work makes use of materials at hand -- personal photographs, women's magazines, state-sponsored television, even government surveillance -- to dissect different forms of power and illuminate the plight of the powerless, while also presaging familiar developments in appropriation art and relational aesthetics to a startling degree. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-32 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Cecil Beaton: The New York Years' (through April 22) A British dandy in the Wildean mold, Beaton photographed fashion for Vogue and Vanity Fair; made photographic portraits of rich, famous and glamorous people; drew and painted cartoons, caricatures, fashion illustrations and theatrical sets with a deft hand; published six volumes of his diaries; and won two Oscars for his costume and set designs, for the Hollywood movies ''Gigi'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' He spent much time in New York, and this entertaining exhibition surveys what he did here during his five-decade career. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'The Ronald S. Lauder Collection: Selections From the 3rd Century B.C. to the 20th Century/Germany, Austria and France' (through April 2) Since it opened 10 years ago, the Neue Galerie has stayed true to its narrowly focused mission: to showcase German and Austrian art and design of the early 20th century. But its anniversary exhibition of the collection of the co-founder Ronald S. Lauder covers much more territory. In the dark-wood-paneled gallery on the second floor, for instance, six paintings by Cezanne preside over an imposing installation of arms and armor and 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish portraiture. And a third-floor gallery of Picasso, Matisse and Brancusi amounts to a mini-Museum of Modern Art improbably wedged into a Carrere-and-Hastings town house. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
Noguchi Museum: 'Civic Action: A Vision for Long Island City' (through April 22) Several artists suggest their visions for the future of Long Island City, ranging from site-specific to silly. Natalie Jeremijenko's ''feral robots'' sniff out pollutants in contaminated soil, and she suggests hula hoops filled with wildflower seeds. Rirkrit Tiravanija proposes growing ''drivable'' grass along a section of Broadway, and Mary Miss focuses on four giant smokestacks that tower over the area and imagines them as an eco-feedback center registering environmental changes visible to the community. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
- Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Bearden Project' (through March 11) Of the many New York City events celebrating the Romare Bearden centennial year, the Studio Museum has come up with the best in this sparkling cross-generational shout-out to the artist. In addition to a small handful of superb works by Bearden himself, the show is made up of tributes by a hundred contemporary artists, old and young, who together extend Bearden's cosmopolitan, griot-to-the-global-village spirit into the future. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
- Swiss Institute Contemporary Art: 'Jean-Frederic Schnyder' (through Feb. 26) The first New York show of this lapsed Swiss Conceptualist, who was born in 1945 and represented his country at the 1993 Venice Biennale, is a characteristic mix of benign and barbed, as well as of painting, sculpture and video. The 35 small, delectable paintings of ''Landscape'' bivouac at the border of art and kitsch, tackling themes of hearth and home, taste and cliche, while a video parade of bottles of schnapps implicates the tourist industry. It's deceptively tidy, deeply Swiss satire. 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, swissinstitute.net. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
'Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones' (through April 15) This wide-ranging survey was assembled by one of the leading milliners in Britain and draws heavily on the incomparable collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It includes fascinating historical material; a survey of 20th- and 21st-century headgear at its most creative (and often most frivolous); and rather too many efforts by the show's organizer. But what's good is great: for example, a platterlike feather number from 18th-century London. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Bryan Drury: 'Portraits' (through Feb. 25) Mr. Drury's six finely painted, intensely realistic panel paintings appear to be conventionally old-fashioned portraits of middle-aged rich folks. But the closer you look, the weirder they seem. There is a reptilian feeling about them. They might be extraterrestrial beings who have donned human disguises in their mission to take over Earth. Dean Project, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 229-2017, deanproject.com. (Johnson)
- Natasza Niedziolka: 'White Shadow' (through Feb. 25) In a New York solo debut that is just cause for optimism, this Polish-born, Berlin-based pictorial artist mixes together art and craft, folk traditions and early Modernism to devise spare, colorful still lifes that sometimes involve paint but more often make extensive use of knitting, embroidery, sewing machines and dangling thread. The history of painting and textiles entwine; a raw, witty beauty ensues, along with a sense of an artist proceeding by her own lights. Precedents include Hannah Hoch's angular collages, Anni Albers's textiles and Rosemarie Trockel's knit paintings. Horton Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-2663, hortongallery.com. (Smith)
- Joyce Pensato: 'Batman Returns' (through Feb. 25) In her latest show of perky cartoon characters gone over to the dark side, the painter Joyce Pensato embraces installation art with the deranged determination of a supervillain -- surrounding her canvases with heaps of plush toys and assorted props from the studio. Although the exhibition is titled ''Batman Returns,'' perhaps in homage to the 1992 Tim Burton film, Ms. Pensato's vision of the caped crusader is all her own. Her drippy enamel-on-linen paintings of the hero's mask strip away his trust fund and cave full of bat-gizmos, making him into a mythic, messy presence. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Rosenberg)
Marianne Vitale (through Feb. 25) The performance-driven sculptures in Ms. Vitale's first solo at Feuer, rustic-looking wooden constructions that have been shot at or set on fire, suggest a strong presence in search of the right vehicle. (You may remember the blunt exhortations of Ms. Vitale's video manifesto, ''Patron,'' from the 2010 Whitney Biennial.) The centerpiece, ''Burned Bridge,'' turns a dead metaphor and a pile of reclaimed lumber into a haunted, commanding artwork. Zach Feuer Gallery, 548 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com. (Rosenberg)
Weegee: 'Naked City' / Vivian Maier (through Feb. 25) Two careers in street photography -- markedly different in sensibility and visibility -- are contrasted in side-by-side shows. The raw, exuberant tabloid art of the famous Weegee (1899-1968) is manifest in a display of 125 images from throughout his career. Meanwhile, the secretive, recently discovered photographer Vivian Maier (1926-2009) took pictures ceaselessly, pursuing a style as unobtrusive as Weegee's is loud and in your face, but no less assured. Steven Kasher Gallery, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 966-3978, stevenkasher.com. (Smith)
- Doug Wheeler (through Feb. 25) Stepping through the fourth wall into Mr. Wheeler's luminous, futuristically titled installation ''SA MI 75 DZ NY 12'' (2012) is like entering a giant marshmallow. Because all surfaces are snowy white, corners seamlessly coved and the whole brightly lighted, it seems as if you are in a space of possibly infinite extent. It might be a preview of the universal divine light into which each of us will merge, according to some mystics, when we die. David Zwirner, 519 West 19th Street, (212) 517-8677, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)

'Gran Fury: Ready My Lips' (through March 17) A collective that grew out of Act Up and took its name from a New York City police car, Gran Fury existed from the end of 1989 until the mid-'90s. The political climate of that period informs the show, as well as downtown Manhattan's landscape of graffiti, posters and stickers. ''Kissing Doesn't Kill'' (1990), a series of posters displayed on buses, defied contemporary claims that AIDS could be spread by kissing, while ''Read My Lips'' turned George H. W. Bush's famous campaign line into a homoerotic provocation. The haircuts and clothes in the works are dated, but the sentiments overlap powerfully with current activism and the Occupy movement. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Schwendener)
Rashid Johnson: 'Rumble' (through Feb. 25) As this putative star's career accelerates, his work becomes slicker and emptier, a pastiche of styles and strategies past and present. The main effect of pieces involving red-oak flooring branded with motifs resembling a rifle's cross hairs, or mosaic mirrors and bronze reliefs defaced with viscous spews of black, is of glamorous baubles with just the right amount of titillating shock value. Only the unsettling, subtly charged, ultimately poignant combination of swagger and self-mockery of the video ''The New Black Yoga'' feels genuine. Hauser & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 794-4970, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
- 'Marble Sculpture From 350 B.C. to Last Week' and 'Portraits/Self-Portraits From the 16th to the 21st Century' (through Feb. 25) Filling nearly four floors of pristine gallery space, these two exhibitions romp in lively, even wicked ways through a succession of periods and styles, with continuity provided by what's called the ''ideal'' sculptural material in one case and the human visage in the other. The result is a deliciously nonacademic exercise in looking and a robust reminder that, wherever we may think we are in terms of art, the past is rarely far behind, nor irrelevant.

'Soto: Paris and Beyond: 1950-1970' (through March 31) Once a figure of international renown, Jesus Soto is now mostly remembered as a minor Modernist who worked in the overlap among hard-edge abstraction, kinetic art and Op Art. This show will not precipitate a run to revive his reputation, but it does open an intriguing window on the mid-20th-century philosophical landscape of Modern art. Still perceptually arresting are constructions from the '50s, in which you view abstract compositions through similarly painted plexiglass panels.

Neuberger Museum of Art: 'American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942' (through April 29) This exhibition, organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Mass., reunites the Four Musketeers of New York painting: John Graham, Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis and Willem de Kooning. For a time -- the 1930s, give or take a few years -- these artists linked arms to defend modern American art against the dreariness and insularity of the Depression. One might see this show as an expansion of the first few galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's recent de Kooning retrospective, with their eerie still lifes and fidgety figure paintings that seemed to collapse abstraction and representation.

Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts: 'Henry Ossawa Tanner: Modern Spirit' (through April 15) Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937) was the first African-American artist to achieve international fame in modern times. After permanently expatriating to France in 1891, he found success as a painter of luminous pictures of biblical subjects. In this informative survey of his career, one piece stands out: an Annunciation in which the angel Gabriel appears to Mary as a burst of yellow light. It is a painting of amazing grace. 118 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, (215) 972-7600, pafa.org. (Johnson)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Zoe Strauss: Ten Years' (through April 22) In 2001 the artist Zoe Strauss came up with an unusual idea for an exhibition. It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, ''I-95,'' is at the core of ''Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,'' an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Van Gogh Up Close' (through May 6) Nature both inspired van Gogh's extraordinary art and calmed his perpetually jangled nerves, and this modest yet groundbreaking show of 45 often small, unfamiliar canvases -- devoted almost entirely to landscapes -- examines his crucial connection to its bounty. The selection cuts a narrow, well-organized path through his art, examining the terrains he painted, the often close-up viewpoints he used and the shifting topographies of his paint textures, leading us to the fullness of his achievement along a fresh and eye-opening route. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Last Chance
- Steve Gianakos: 'New Paintings' (closes on Saturday) With fearless indiscretion, Mr. Gianakos paints disjunctive, cartoon satires combining juvenile innocence and surrealistic prurience. In a busy farmyard scene, limned in bold black lines like all the other works in this show, a pubescent femme, naked but for a pleated miniskirt, gets down on all fours on the backs of wallowing piglets, as other animals delight in the view of her nude backside.

- Damien Hirst: 'The Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011' (closes on Saturday) The formerly young British artist's spot-painting summation may be spread throughout the 11 emporiums of the worldwide Gagosian franchise, but New York is bearing the brunt, with 115 of the total 331 distributed among three galleries, one of which (980 Madison) could count as four shows on its own. Despite the consistency of the formula, a typically Hirstian range of quality, from good to atrocious, prevails. Some are engaging paintings; others aren't really paintings at all. Similarly, at least one installation -- at West 21st Street -- is ravishing; others are oppressive, best suited for the artist's most hard-core fans. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, (212) 744-2313; 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea; (212) 741-1111; and 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)
Klara Liden: 'Pretty Vacant' (closes on Sunday) Ms. Liden, the ''it girl'' for today's avant-garde, creates quasi-secret spaces the way children build forts out of pillows in their bedrooms. For this show, she erected a blue wall across the gallery space, with a door admitting visitors into a room filled with 80 used Christmas trees rescued from the streets of New York. A path leads to an old sofa, where you may sit and bask in the piney scent. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 165 East Broadway, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, reenaspaulings.com. (Johnson)
- 'Looking Back/The 6th White Columns Annual -- Selected by Ken Okiishi and Nick Mauss' (closes on Saturday) Ardently feminist, willfully obscure and focused on a rather limited gene pool of the young and the hip, the sixth incarnation of the White Columns annual may be the most idiosyncratic version yet of this indispensable year-end review. Among much that is either inconsequential or -- in the case of several established female artists -- feels obligatory, the standout is Michaela Eichwald's 37-foot-long photographic mural. Its slipping, sliding, technically mysterious miasma of chemicals and images updates Robert Rauschenberg by way of urban cave painting.

- Jordan Wolfson (closes on Saturday) This brilliant New York gallery debut consists of ''Animation, masks,'' a 12-minute 29-second digital animation that rivets the ear and the eye while perturbing the mind, not unlike an exquisite Faberge egg that explodes in your face. It turns its medium inside out, rejuvenates appropriation art with richly contrasted images and roils sundry stereotypes, starting with a high-definition Shylockian lover boy. The color alone is extraordinary; the totality is an extensively barbed classic for our stubbornly sentimental, tragically materialist times.

HEADLINE: Egyptian Party Threatens To Review Treaty With Israel

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
CAIRO -- The Islamist party that leads the new Egyptian Parliament is threatening to review the 1979 peace treaty with Israel if the United States cuts off aid to the country over a crackdown on American-backed nonprofit groups here.
The pact is considered a linchpin of regional stability, and the statements, from at least two senior leaders of the party, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, represent the first time that Egyptians have explicitly raised it during an escalating standoff over the crackdown. 
The Obama administration and Congressional leaders have already warned Egypt that the United States might cut off its annual aid to the country, which in the most recent budget came to $1.3 billion in military supplies and about $250 million in other subsidies, including some money directed to the nonprofit groups under investigation. At least two senators have introduced legislation that could curtail the aid, and the Brotherhood released its statements on Thursday as the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the matter.
Leaders of the Brotherhood have said that they would respect the American-brokered 1979 treaty, and the seriousness of their new threats is hard to assess. Many analysts, as well as some Brotherhood leaders here, have cited internal domestic reasons to respect the treaty, mainly because it ensures peaceful borders at a time when Egypt can ill afford the cost of a military buildup and its economy teeters on the brink of collapse.
But at the same time, Egyptians have long considered American aid as a kind of payment for preserving the peace despite the popular resentment of Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians, widely seen here as a violation of the treaty.
In the clearest of multiple Brotherhood statements on the subject, Essam el-Erian, who is chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, told Reuters that the aid was ''one of the commitments of the parties that signed the peace agreement, so if there is a breach from one side it gives the right of review to the parties.''
''We will be harmed,'' he added, ''so it is our right to review the matter.''
The crisis was set off by a criminal investigation into the foreign financing of nonprofit groups; the inquiry began last spring under the military council that took power after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. The council kept on the books severe restrictions on the operations and financing of nonprofit groups that made almost all the independent advocacy or rights groups operating in Egypt technically illegal.
Accompanied by repeated suggestions from government officials that ''foreign hands'' were stirring up street protests against military rule, the investigation has focused mainly on four organizations that receive American financing. Two, the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, were chartered to promote democracy and have close ties to Congressional party leaders. A third was Freedom House, which has a similar mandate. The fourth teaches journalism.
The investigation culminated in raids on the groups' offices by squads of heavily armed riot police officers, the indictments of 16 Americans and 27 others, and a travel ban that has trapped at least a half-dozen Americans in Egypt.
The standoff poses a thorny political problem for the leaders of both countries. Washington would like to preserve its alliance with Egypt during this critical period but faces political pressure to secure the freedom of the Americans and to defend the nonprofit groups.
The United States is Egypt's most important international benefactor, but it is also widely resented here for its support of Israel and the invasion of Iraq.
The Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, has appeared to seek the political middle ground, supporting a liberalization of the laws to allow nonprofit ''civil society'' groups to operate more freely while at the same time asserting that the United States cannot put itself above Egyptian laws.

HEADLINE: International Crackdown On Tax Crimes Intensifies

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- The global body that sets standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing said Thursday that governments should treat tax crimes as a red flag for other types of financial malfeasance, a sign that international cooperation against tax cheats is gaining momentum. 
The body, the Financial Action Task Force, said it was expanding its list of ''predicate offenses for money laundering'' to include serious tax crimes.
The task force, based at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development here, also updated its so-called blacklist of noncooperative countries and territories for the first time in several years.
The changes reflect a growing movement toward international cooperation to catch tax cheats. Governments have become much less lenient on the subject since the financial crisis began four years ago, with tax havens like Switzerland coming under pressure to cooperate.
On Feb. 8, six countries, including the United States, France, Germany and Britain, announced that they would work together to fight tax evasion in the context of putting the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act in place, a United States initiative to find hidden accounts overseas.
The task force has no enforcement powers of its own, but the recommendation ''means the proceeds of tax crimes must now be considered'' by governments, Richard Chalmers, co-chairman of the body's working group for assessing compliance, said at a news conference.
The focus is not on tax evasion per se, but rather on how ill-gotten gains might be put to use. Officials acknowledged that the definition of tax crimes differed from country to country and that it would be up to national officials to define and act on the information they found.
The task force operates by consensus, and officials declined to say which countries had supported or opposed the new initiative. But the Swiss Banking Association said in a statement that it had ''always expressed skepticism concerning the addition of tax crimes'' to the task force's list of offenses, and that it welcomed ''the fact that the F.A.T.F. leaves it up to the respective countries to define the terms of the crime as predicate offense for money laundering.''
The task force, whose agenda includes the fight against financing nuclear proliferation, last revised its guidelines in 2003. The issue of tax crimes was proposed as a topic for inclusion at the last revision, but failed to make the final text. The inclusion in the new guidelines shows the extent to which the international climate has changed since then.
Officials said at the news conference that the task force was no longer separating measures for combating terrorist financing from its main recommendations because there was much in common with other criminal money laundering, rendering the distinction moot.
The task force was working to ensure that governments knew who were the ''beneficial owners'' of businesses within their jurisdictions, officials said.

HEADLINE: At State-Run Ski Slopes, a Shortage of Snow and Visitors

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The State of New York is finding out what a tough year it is to be in the ski business.
The three state-operated ski areas and the Olympic ski sites in Lake Placid have had nearly 100,000 fewer visitors over the last three months than in the same period a year earlier, according to figures provided by the state to The New York Times. The attendance drop reflects a dearth of snow that has left mountains across the region with bare patches and icy trails. 
The hardest hit state-run ski slope has by far been Belleayre, in the Catskills, which is operated by the Department of Environmental Conservation. The agency reported 53,650 visitors to the slope between Nov. 25 and Feb. 12, down from 110,058 in the same period a year ago. As a result, the agency said, revenue fell 38 percent.
In the Adirondacks and at Lake Placid, there have been nearly 245,000 visitors to two state-run ski slopes - Gore Mountain and Whiteface - and the ski jumps and other facilities used in the 1980 Winter Olympics. That is about 41,000 fewer visitors than a year earlier, causing an 11 percent drop in revenue.
The Adirondack slopes and the Lake Placid jumps are overseen by the Olympic Regional Development Authority. The authority was originally created to oversee the ski jumps and other facilities used in the 1980 Games.
Jon Lundin, a spokesman for the authority, noted that last winter, the slopes were helped by the recession, which led some people to vacation closer to home, as well as by heavy snowfall.
''The entire Northeast was blanketed in snow throughout much of the winter, which also helped to contribute to the high number of visits to ORDA's Olympic venues and the Lake Placid region,'' Mr. Lundin said.
Operators of Northeastern ski slopes like the state's are hoping for a burst of customers over the Presidents' Day weekend, as well as some Canadian holidays ahead.
State officials declined to say whether the drop in attendance and revenue would have any effect on the ski areas.
''No layoffs or other personnel actions are planned,'' said Emily DeSantis, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation.
Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo last month proposed as part of the state budget that responsibility for Belleayre be transferred to the Olympic authority, consolidating all of the state's ski areas under one entity and moving their finances outside the state budget.
The experiences at Belleayre, Gore and Whiteface are not unusual. Private ski slopes this winter are also experiencing problems in the Northeast and beyond.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Dealing With Iran on the Nuclear Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The cat-and-mouse game with Iran depicted in ''Iran Is Ready to Talk,'' by Dennis B. Ross (Op-Ed, Feb. 15), is becoming more dangerous every day. Most people are hoping that ''crippling sanctions'' against Iran will force its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to give up his nuclear ambitions. Others believe that sanctions may inspire desperate acts by Iran.
Iran has been a catalyst of instability in the Middle East for years. It hates America. It hates Israel. It hates non-Shiites. So much hate breeds contempt. 
The United States and Israel must stand ready to act militarily if the pressure drives Iran to lash out against any other nation. Desperation may ultimately rule the day for all the interested parties in this terrible situation.
SALVATORE J. BOMMARITO New York, Feb. 15, 2012
To the Editor:
Iran is ready to engage in nuclear talks, but it is doubtful that the United States is, since obviously it is better to avoid addressing Iran's right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
Sadly, the United States and its allies have used the ruse of war to mask the blatant economic warfare waged against Iran on flimsy grounds in light of the absence of any smoking gun corroborating the allegations of Iranian nuclear proliferation.
Contrary to Dennis B. Ross's description of an apt American policy toward Iran, the policy is misguided by virtue of the sheer failure to produce any hard evidence that indicates Iran's breach of its nonproliferation treaty obligations.
After the successful Turkish-Brazilian mediation with Iran following the United States' encouragement, the Obama administration reversed itself, thus showing that it is afraid of successful diplomacy with Iran and, like Israel, prefers the path of confrontation.
KAVEH L. AFRASIABI Palo Alto, Calif., Feb. 15, 2012
The writer is a former adviser to Iran's nuclear negotiation team, 2004-05.
To the Editor:
Despite Dennis B. Ross's eloquent arguments, I do not believe that sanctions will be effective against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran because I see little evidence that the Iranian people support the sanctions that are aimed at deterring a nuclear Iran.
Seeing the hostile, nuclear-armed United States on three sides (Iraq, Afghanistan and in the Persian Gulf) and the threatening, nuclear-armed Israel not far away, the Iranian people may consider the acquisition of nuclear weapons to be more important than even the relieving of crippling sanctions; and Mr. Ahmadinejad has little incentive to go against the will of his people on this.
We believe that the world will be better for all people, including Iranians, if Iran does not build nuclear weapons. Helping the people of Iran to understand why it is in their best interest to forgo nuclear weapons is key to achieving this desired end.
But crippling sanctions and war are counterproductive because they instead reinforce for the people of Iran that we are their enemy.
LEE NEWBERG Albany, Feb. 15, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Frantic Actions Hint at Pressure on Iran Leaders'' (front page, Feb. 16):
Iran's production of fuel for a research reactor from 20 percent enriched uranium is not insignificant. Instead, this action, combined with Iran's use of low-enriched uranium for production of fuel for its power reactor, and the intent to continue both, eliminate any hypothetical threat of a nuclear weapon from Iran's fully safeguarded nuclear programs.
The United States and its allies should support these actions and end dangerous threats and sanctions against Iran's important nuclear programs.
CLINTON BASTIN Avondale Estates, Ga., Feb. 16, 2012
The writer directed United States Atomic Energy Commission programs for production of nuclear materials and nuclear components for weapons.

HEADLINE: Profit Rises at Molson Coors, Beating Wall St. Estimates

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Fourth-quarter profit at the Molson Coors Brewing Company beat Wall Street estimates, as price increases, cost savings and an extra selling week helped offset weak sales volume. 
Shares of the brewer, whose brands include Molson Canadian, Coors Light and Blue Moon, rose $1.24, or 2.83 percent, to $45.10 on Thursday.
The company also cited easy comparisons with the year-earlier period, when the weak economy hurt sales and higher fuel and commodity costs pressured profits.
A Stifel Nicolaus analyst, Mark Swartzberg, pointed to a bigger-than-expected margin for MillerCoors, Molson's United States joint venture with SABMiller, and lower spending in the company's Canada, Britain and international units.
''We take the results as another indicator U.S. brewer profitability is improving,'' Mr. Swartzberg said in a research note.
In the United States, lingering unemployment, especially among core male beer drinkers, has led to weak volumes and heavy promotions. That has pressured profits.
In the fourth quarter, Molson's net income rose to $173.2 million, or 95 cents a share, from $109.8 million or 58 cents a share in the period a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 97 cents a share, topping analysts' average estimate of 71 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
Net sales increased 12.2 percent, to $937.3 million, also topping Wall Street's estimate of $924.5 million.

HEADLINE: Gay Marriage, Passed, Awaits Veto by Christie

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
TRENTON -- The New Jersey Assembly approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage on Thursday, setting up a confrontation with Gov. Chris Christie, who promised a swift veto and defied the Legislature to put the issue before voters instead.
In two hours of passionate debate, Democrats supporting the measure urged their colleagues to make history, comparing the fight for legalization of same-sex marriage to battles for women's suffrage and against racism. 
''We can make a giant leap forward today in the fight against one of the last legalized barriers to equal rights,'' said Sheila Y. Oliver, the Assembly speaker, whose voice broke at several points as she exhorted her colleagues to support the bill.
The State Senate passed a similar bill on Monday; the Assembly vote was the first time the Legislature united in endorsing same-sex marriage.
And the vote, passing 42 to 33, underscored how much opinion has shifted since two years ago, when the Senate rejected a similar bill. New York State legalized same-sex marriage last year, and this month Washington State did so. The bill passed on Thursday would make New Jersey the eighth state that allows gay and lesbian couples to marry.
But advocates for the bill in New Jersey face a new fight: trying to win enough votes to override the governor's expected veto.
Mr. Christie is a rising star in the Republican Party, in which any politician with national ambitions must consider social conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage. After New Jersey Democrats, who control the Legislature, said they would make same-sex marriage a top priority this year, the governor proposed putting the issue to voters in a referendum in November.
On Thursday, Mr. Christie declared the Legislature's action merely ''an exercise in theater.''
''I've given them an alternative,'' said Mr. Christie, who spent the day holding a news conference to announce that WrestleMania was coming to MetLife Stadium in 2013 and appearing at a fund-raiser for a Republican running for the United States Senate. ''Put it on the ballot and let the people decide.''
Democrats have accused him of avoiding an issue that could hurt his national prospects, and said they would refuse to pass the legislation required to put a referendum on the ballot.
Mr. Christie has 45 days to veto the bill. If he does, the Democrats will have nearly two years to muster the two-thirds majority needed to override it.
''We're going to take the time we need, assisted by a changing world,'' said Steven Goldstein, the chairman of Garden State Equality, a gay rights group. ''Look at how the world has changed from two years ago.''
While the measure in the Senate found only 14 votes in 2010, this week it passed with 24. Assembly Democrats said they would have had two more votes, from Republicans, if two members had not been on vacation. Four Democrats voted against the bill on Thursday, and no Republicans voted in favor.
Mr. Goldstein said his group's budget this year was one-tenth what it was two years ago. National advocacy groups did not put as much money into the battle, disappointed over the failure of the legislation two years ago. Instead, he said, supporters will push their case in person, reminding legislators that same-sex couples are their relatives and friends.
The governor's refusal to support same-sex marriage could also backfire, some noted.
''The meanness question is going to come out,'' said Assemblyman Reed Gusciora of Mercer County, one of two openly gay members of the Legislature and the bill's chief sponsor.
An override would be easier in the Senate, where it would need 27 votes; in the Assembly, it would require 54.
The debate on Thursday, however, reflected the shifting landscape. Several legislators who are leaders in black churches that oppose same-sex marriage spoke of agonizing over the legislation but ultimately deciding to support it.
''I came to the conclusion that the people sent me here from my district, here to protect what's right,'' Assemblywoman Cleopatra G. Tucker, a Democrat from Newark, said. ''To protect the rights of everyone.''
Others echoed Assemblyman Louis Greenwald of Cherry Hill, the majority leader, saying that in 50 years, people will look back and wonder, ''What was all the fuss about?''
Some said that there would be economic benefits in same-sex marriage, that weddings could mean $250 million in business for the state and 800 additional jobs. If the state does not pass it, they said, it risks losing residents and their tax revenue to New York, where same-sex marriage is legal.
Polls show that a slight majority of New Jersey voters support same-sex marriage. They also show that about the same percentage supports the governor's idea of putting it on the ballot.
Democrats argue that same-sex marriage is a matter of civil rights, and that civil rights should not be subject to referendum. They note that the last time the state put a question of civil rights on the ballot, in 1915, the male voters of New Jersey declined to allow women the right to vote.
Democrats predict that a referendum would bring a flood of outside money from national groups opposed to same-sex marriage. It could also draw out conservative voters to lift the hopes of the Republican presidential nominee in a state that would otherwise be expected to tilt toward President Obama.
In speeches on Thursday, Republicans argued that the decision to change an institution as sacred as marriage was better made by voters than by the 121 members of the Legislature.
''I trust the people of New Jersey and I believe they should be allowed to voice their opinion in a vote,'' said Assemblywoman Nancy F. Munoz of Summit.
As she spoke, a crowd, largely of Orthodox Jewish men in the balcony sprang to its feet and cheered.
The question of same-sex marriage continues to make its way through the state's courts. In 2006, the State Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples were entitled to the same protections as heterosexual couples, but left it up to the Legislature to decide how to guarantee those rights. The Legislature passed a civil unions law, but seven gay couples have sued the state, arguing that the law discriminates against them in matters like obtaining a mortgage or seeing partners in the hospital.
Senator Loretta Weinberg, a sponsor of the legislation, said, ''Our legislature stood up in both houses and stood up on behalf of marriage.''

HEADLINE: Congress to Sell Public Airwaves To Pay Benefits

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The need for revenue to partly cover the extension of the payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment benefits has pushed Congress to embrace a generational shift in the country's media landscape: the auction of public airwaves now used for television broadcasts to create more wireless Internet systems.
If a compromise bill completed Thursday by Congress is approved as expected by this weekend, the result will eventually be faster connections for smartphones, iPads and other data-hungry mobile devices. Their explosive popularity has overwhelmed the ability, particularly in big cities, for systems to quickly download maps, video games and movies.
The measure would be a rare instance of the government compensating private companies with the proceeds from an auction of public property -- broadcast licenses -- once given free. 
The auctions, which are projected to raise more than $25 billion, would also further the Obama administration's broadband expansion plans and create a nationwide communications network for emergency workers that would allow police, fire and other responders from different departments and jurisdictions to talk to each other directly.
Public safety officials have wanted such a seamless communications system ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The sweeping changes are even more remarkable because they resulted not from an effort to address communications policy, but from a hard-fought bipartisan compromise to extend a payroll tax holiday and jobless benefits. Republicans insisted that the extension of the unemployment insurance -- a cost of roughly $30 billion -- be paid for in full, and one area that both sides could agree on was spectrum sales.
The spectrum auctions are at least one to two years away, but most of the programs they pay for would be covered immediately. Consumers are unlikely to see additional charges since the auction would add new spectrum rather than adding to the costs of existing spectrum.
The payroll tax exemption would be extended through the end of this year, providing a worker earning $50,000 annually with $1,000 more in take-home pay over that time. The bill would also prevent a reimbursement cut for doctors who accept Medicare.
The legislation is the result of an unusual degree of cooperation between two parties that have fought bitterly over recent issues, and members of the conference committee that negotiated the deal played to the cameras on Thursday. One by one, members filed into the office of the committee's chairman, Representative Dave Camp, Republican from Michigan, to sign the papers splayed out neatly on a large table that rested under an ornate chandelier.
Mr. Camp and his chief negotiating partner, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, linked hands for the cameras, as Mr. Baucus said helpfully for anyone who did not get the visual cue: ''Working together!''
Not everyone agrees on the ultimate benefit of the new policies. Democrats, telecommunications companies and public safety officials have argued that the auctions of public airwaves will create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment to build the systems.
But the House speaker, John A. Boehner, was more lukewarm in his enthusiasm for the measure. While saying that the compromise was ''one that I support,'' he added: ''Let's be honest. This is an economic relief package, not a bill that's going to grow the economy and create jobs.''
Some members of Mr. Boehner's party disagreed. Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, who leads a communications subcommittee, said in a joint statement that the bill would be ''an economic game-changer.''
''With 13 million Americans still seeking employment, job creation is a driving force behind efforts to expand wireless broadband,'' the congressmen said in their statement. ''Spectrum auctions are not only good public policy for the communications and technology sector, they will produce meaningful job creation when we need it most.''
Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who for much of the last two years has pushed the idea of reclaiming what he called inefficiently used airwaves from broadcasters, said he was ''pleased that Congress has recognized the vital importance of freeing up more spectrum for mobile broadband.''
But he expressed caution about some of the bill's language, which he said ''could limit the F.C.C.'s ability to maximize the amount and benefits of recovered spectrum.''
He was referring to a provision in the bill, pushed aggressively by broadcasters, that sets limits on what actions the F.C.C. can take to reclaim airwaves from broadcasters. The bill prohibits the F.C.C. from excluding from the auctions companies like AT&T and Verizon, which already hold large chunks of spectrum for their networks.
The bill does allow the F.C.C. to write formal rules that set limits on how much spectrum one company can hold in a given market, however.
The legislation also provides for the creation of bands of unlicensed airwaves, so-called white space, around each segment of auctioned spectrum for use in building large Wi-Fi networks in urban areas and for use by cellphone companies in temporarily easing crowding on their networks.
About $15 billion of the $30 billion extension in unemployment benefits will be paid for with the proceeds of the incentive auctions.
Another $7 billion of auction proceeds will be used to build the public safety network on a block of spectrum that, had it been sold, might have raised another $2.75 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office's evaluation of the bill.
Roughly $1.75 billion will be available for the F.C.C. to compensate television stations that volunteer to give up their spot on the spectrum. The F.C.C., with some restrictions, can also move some stations around on the broadcast spectrum, allowing it to put together packages of contiguous bands of spectrum. Those would be more valuable than scattered pieces and thus should raise more money at auction.
Public safety departments pressed to include in this bill a dedicated nationwide network, since fire and police departments in New York found that their radio systems couldn't talk to each other during the attacks on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission endorsed such a project in 2004, and emergency units continued to have the same problems after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the BP oil spill in 2010.
The F.C.C. had favored auctioning off the section of spectrum that now will be turned over for emergency services, letting it be developed by cellphone companies that would agree to give first priority to public safety transmissions during an emergency.
The conditions for the auction, however, resulted in no company bidding the required minimum, and the block of spectrum has sat largely unused for several years.

HEADLINE: How the Rich Get Richer, Rental Edition

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
Thousands of people are expected to become rich in the latest Bay Area tech boom, and in San Francisco these newly minted millionaires will receive a benefit originally meant to help the poor and working class: rent control.
Not that they have a choice. The law applies to rental apartments built before June 1979, regardless of the tenant's income. Rent increases are limited to less than inflation -- last year the increase was 0.1 percent, an all-time low. 
But with an estimated 30 percent of the city's rental properties owned by mom-and-pop investors with four units or less, an unintended consequence of rent control is becoming more prevalent: people of relatively modest means subsidizing the housing of the extraordinarily wealthy.
Critics say it is just the latest failure of the city's housing policies.
Noni Richen, a former school cafeteria cook, and her husband, who once worked on the Alaskan pipeline, put their life savings into buying a four-unit Western Addition apartment building in the 1980s. ''We had $20,000,'' Ms. Richen said. ''That was a lot of money to us, and we put that down.''
The rents the Richens collect have changed little since then because of rent control: $1,000 for each two-bedroom apartment. ''It's a deal,'' she said, noting that her tenants aren't wealthy but that her expenses (insurance, repairs, utilities) have risen faster than the rents. ''I don't begrudge them. I'd do the same thing if I was them.''
But what Ms. Richen sees as a basic question of fairness has prompted her to become an outspoken critic of rent control, serving on the board of the Small Property Owners of San Francisco Institute, a volunteer organization that advocates for small-time landlords.
Henry Karnilowicz, the group's president, said rent control should be abolished, or at least reformed so that the wealthy do not receive subsidized rent. ''There should be means testing,'' he said.
Mr. Karnilowicz estimated that 5 percent of the city's 212,000 rental units (about 10,600) are kept vacant by landlords who would rather not deal with rent control (others estimate the number is higher, about 25,000 units). He said that many owners would rent those homes if there were reforms, like requiring the rich to pay full market value.
Such a move is highly unlikely, however. In a city where 64 percent of residents rent, tenants have enormous political clout and it is unpopular to even discuss reforming rent control.
The cone of silence was evident Monday when a parade of economists and housing experts testified at a board of supervisors committee meeting about the city's housing situation. Each presentation showed that housing had become increasingly unaffordable in recent years, pricing out people at every income level -- except the wealthy.
Yet not one expert mentioned rent control's impact on the market.
Voters approved rent control in 1979 to help preserve communities by limiting rent increases, a threat to working class and lower-income tenants. However, a new city analysis shows that for the first time upper-income households (annual incomes over $107,000) outnumber the poor (incomes under $35,000), 29 percent to 27 percent. And rents for vacancies average $2,600 a month, a record high.
According to Ted Gullicksen, executive director of the San Francisco Tenants Union, the market is much like it was during the 1990s dot-com boom that pushed rents and displacements to extremes.
Additionally, the number of existing rent-controlled apartments has been reduced by demolition or conversion to sale as private homes, like condominiums. ''There's a serious and steady depletion of housing rental stock,'' Mr. Gullicksen said, perhaps 1,000 or more units annually.
Protecting that dwindling supply from further erosion has become a ''ferocious'' battle, said Sara Shortt, executive director of the Housing Rights Committee of San Francisco, a tenants' advocacy group.
But just trying to determine the exact number of rent-controlled units -- and their tenants' finances -- is difficult. The city's last comprehensive research, undertaken in 2000, found that one-fourth of households in rent-controlled apartments earned more than $100,000 a year -- a revelation that prompted I-told-you-so rhetoric from some landlords.
Since then, similar comprehensive research has been blocked, in part by tenants' advocates who believe the findings would be ''politicized'' and become a referendum on rent control, Ms. Shortt said.
Both she and Mr. Gullicksen oppose means testing to exclude the rich from rent control. There are privacy concerns, they said, and it would create a situation in which landlords would then rent only to the wealthy.
And with so many tech nouveau riche around, that could make matters even worse for those of ordinary means.

PERSON: Bruce Herman 

HEADLINE: Bruce Herman, 54, Worker Training Expert

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Bruce G. Herman, a nationally recognized expert on worker training who fought to preserve New York City's garment district and to revive manufacturing across the country, died on Feb. 7 in Manhattan. He was 54. 
The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Jennifer, said.
Mr. Herman, a Brooklyn resident, devoted himself to saving and creating manufacturing jobs, whether as president of the Garment Industry Development Corporation, a labor-management partnership, or as New York State's deputy labor commissioner. Because of his expertise on work-force matters, he often testified before Congressional and state legislative committees.
''When a lot of the intellectual elite was writing off manufacturing, Bruce championed manufacturing,'' said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. ''He doubled down on it and was committed to rebuilding a vibrant manufacturing sector.''
After the World Trade Center was destroyed, in 2001, he devoted himself to helping the families of the 79 workers at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop one of the towers, who were killed, and to finding jobs for the 350 Windows workers who survived.
As a top official of the Center for Workforce and Economic Development, a New York nonprofit group, he arranged the first grant to underwrite the Restaurant Opportunities Center, which helped unemployed restaurant workers find jobs after the Sept. 11 attack. He later lined up more than $500,000 in investment for Colors, an unusual cooperatively owned restaurant in Greenwich Village founded by former Windows on the World workers.
Bruce Gregory Herman was born on March 23, 1957, in Lancaster, Pa., the son of Samuel and Arlene Herman. After graduating from Penn Manor High School, in Millersville, Pa., he attended Dickinson College, where he received a bachelor's degree in political science. He obtained a master's degree in political science at Columbia University.
He married Jennifer Kleinberg in 1998, and is survived by her; their three sons, Luke, Taylor and Carter; his parents; two brothers, Michael and Steven; and two sisters, Sandra Herman and Christine Fisher.
From 1991 to 1998, Mr. Herman was president of the Garment Industry Development Corporation.
''He really turned it into a major force,'' said Bruce Raynor, former president of Unite Here, the apparel-workers' union. ''He showed that there was a real role for start-up apparel companies. In this industry, a start-up company can, two years later, become a major player.''
From 2000 to 2002, Mr. Herman headed the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Working for America Institute, which promoted labor-management partnerships to create profitable businesses and good-paying jobs. He was executive director of the National Employment Law Project from 2004 to 2007.
As deputy labor commissioner for work-force development, from 2007 to last August, he oversaw a staff of 1,300 and coordinated job-training and job-finding efforts at unemployment offices across the state.
He expanded apprenticeship programs and developed rapid-response efforts when factories closed.

HEADLINE: Banks Put On Notice In Review By Moody's

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service has a message for Wall Street: the skies are still dark.
The ratings agency is reviewing 17 global banks, including Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Credit Suisse, for possible downgrades to their long-term credit ratings, dulling optimism caused by a monthlong rally in which major banks have recovered some of last year's losses.
Moody's said it was weighing the risks to the institutions' investment banking models and exposures to its capital markets business, which include trading securities and underwriting stocks and bonds. 
In a separate statement from London, Moody's said it was reviewing its ratings for scores of banks based in European countries, including Italy, Spain and Britain. It cited the prolonged sovereign debt crisis and risks linked to large capital market businesses.
''The combination of changed operating conditions and increased regulatory requirements and restrictions has diminished these firms' longer-term profitability and growth prospects,'' Moody's said in one of the statements, which was released on Wednesday after markets closed in New York.
Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and UBS could face cuts of up to three notches in their long-term credit ratings. Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank are among the 10 firms that could have their ratings cut by two notches, while Bank of America and three others could be cut by a single notch, Moody's said.
Credit downgrades could hamper Wall Street firms by making it more expensive for them to borrow money, as well as increasing the amount of collateral they are required to post for certain trades. In a regulatory filing last year, Morgan Stanley estimated that a credit downgrade of two notches - a more minor downgrade than the three notches being considered - would require it to post approximately $4.2 billion in additional collateral on derivatives contracts with its trading partners.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman, Mark Lake, declined to comment.
In the United States, the Moody's review points to a sector that has been hobbled, perhaps permanently, by the introduction of new regulation designed to curb risky types of trading and require banks to hold more capital in reserve.
''The tone does seem to be secular rather than cyclical,'' said Jeffery Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill. ''They're looking at how the world is changed.''
Downgrades would be unlikely to surprise many investors, who have known for months about the constraints and dangers posed by regulation and the European debt crisis. On Thursday, the largest United States banks being reviewed for downgrade showed little movement in either their stock prices or their credit default swap levels, a measure of the cost of insuring against a firm's default.
''It seems to be more of a historical rating than a prospective rating,'' said Richard X. Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities, of the Moody's review. ''The reason they've provided is something they could have said 12 or 18 months ago.''
Although some firms were threatened with bigger downgrades than others, David Fanger, a senior vice president with Moody's, said the problems that led to the wide-ranging review were common to most firms.
''With the most recent action, what we're saying is that the whole sector's relative positioning within our scale may be too high,'' Mr. Fanger said in an interview on Thursday. ''We don't like to move ratings that quickly, but this is an industry that has demonstrated fairly significant transition risk.''
Last year was the worst since the financial crisis for Wall Street banks, which saw their revenues plunge as market activity dried up and a European debt crisis loomed. In November, Standard & Poor's, a rival ratings agency, downgraded 15 banks, expressing concerns that new regulations and capital requirements could cut into their long-term profitability.
The Moody's review, a project similar in scope to the review that led to the S.&P. downgrades, was sparked by concerns that the choppy waters of 2011 were caused by a seismic shift in the banking industry, rather than temporary problems that could lessen when the markets recover fully. Moody's expects to make its final decisions on the downgrades within 90 days.
''Capital markets firms are confronting evolving challenges, such as more fragile funding conditions, wider credit spreads, increased regulatory burdens and more difficult operating conditions,'' Moody's said in its report.
In its review of European banks, Moody's put under review 114 banks from 16 countries, including HSBC of Britain and Deutsche Bank of Germany. Among the reasons Moody's cited were the deteriorating creditworthiness of the region's countries and continued volatility in the Continent's financial markets.
Italian banks were the most affected by Moody's announcement, with 24 to be reviewed. Much of the ratings agency's concern is targeted at the stagnant Italian economy. The International Monetary Fund expects the country's gross domestic product to contract by 1.7 percent this year, while government debt currently stands at 120 percent of Italy's gross domestic product.
''There's a strong belief that the country's public debt is not under control,'' said Stefano Caselli, a banking professor at Bocconi University in Milan.
While downgrades could be bad news for banks, they may give investors a truer measure of the health of the financial sector. Firms are increasingly turning to businesses like wealth management that carry fewer risks, but lower returns, than once-lucrative proprietary trading desks that are now all but absent at large Wall Street banks.
The changes have already shown up in the bottom line. Goldman Sachs's earnings dropped nearly 70 percent last year; Morgan Stanley's were down 42 percent. And return on equity - a critical figure used to gauge a firm's profitability - dipped into the single digits for many firms, a far cry from the 20 percent and 30 percent figures common in the precrisis era.
Those figures may recover as the market lifts, but Moody's and other ratings agencies are still cautioning that Wall Street may be stuck with a less profitable, more constrained business model for the foreseeable future.
''On one hand, we think it will be more challenging for things to get back to the way they were,'' Mr. Fanger said. ''On the other hand, market participants may not want them to get back to the way they were.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Economic Reports Show A Brightening Outlook

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell to the lowest point in almost four years last week, the latest signal that the job market was steadily improving.
In other economic news, a rise in building permits suggested that the construction industry was growing confident that more buyers were ready to come off the sidelines, and the latest data on wholesale prices signaled that inflation remained largely in check. And a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found continued expansion in factories in mid-Atlantic states.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that weekly applications for unemployment benefits dropped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 348,000. It was the fourth drop in five weeks and the fewest number of claims since March 2008. 
The four-week average, which smoothes out fluctuations in the weekly data, fell for the fifth-consecutive week to 365,250. The average has fallen nearly 13 percent in the last year.
The consistent decline indicates that companies are laying off fewer workers and that hiring is picking up. When applications drop consistently below 375,000, it usually signals that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.
In January, the economy added a net 243,000 jobs, the most in nine months. And the unemployment rate dropped for the fifth-consecutive month, to 8.3 percent. The economy has added an average of 201,000 jobs a month for the last three months.
Faster economic growth is spurring the additional hiring. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final three months of last year, a full percentage point higher than in the previous quarter.
Still, the job market has a long way to go before it fully recovers from the damage of the Great Recession. Nearly 13 million people remain unemployed, and 8.3 percent unemployment is still high.
On the housing front, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday that construction of single-family homes cooled slightly in January after surging in the final month of 2011.
Building permits, however, increased. Builders broke ground on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000 homes in January, which is up 1.5 percent from December and nearly matches November's three-year high for starts.
Construction began on 508,000 single-family homes last month, a 1 percent drop from December and the first decline in four months. A big rise in apartment construction helped offset the decline in single-family homes.
Still, the number of December single-family homes was revised up strongly to show builders had started 513,000 homes, a 12 percent gain from November.
And building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose 0.7 percent, a majority of which were for single-family homes. It can take 12 months for a builder to obtain a permit and construct a single-family home.
Single-family home construction rose in each of the final three months of last year, bringing the pace of those starts to the highest level since April 2010.
''The upturn in permits and starts in recent months has been consistent'' with the surge in the survey of home builders, ''which has surprised the markets to the upside for five straight months,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''The new home sales numbers have not yet responded, but builders seem confident that if they build, buyers will come.''
The Labor Department also reported on Thursday that the producer price index, a measure of wholesale prices, rose 0.1 percent. Wholesale prices fell by the same amount in December. In the last 12 months, they have increased 4.1 percent, the smallest rise in a year.
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices increased 0.4 percent, the most in six months. Economists said most of the increases were likely to be temporary and not to continue driving the core higher.
Wholesale gas prices rose, but were offset by steep drops in home heating oil, natural gas and electricity, which fell by the most in more than seven years.
The Philadelphia Fed's survey of economic conditions for February found increases in manufacturing activity, new orders and shipments. Over all, the report's index of manufacturing conditions rose to 10.2 points, up from 7.3 in January.
The survey of mid-Atlantic businesses also found steady employment levels but an increase in average work hours.

Previews and Openings
'Assistance' (in previews; opens on Feb. 28) Occupy the stage! This satire by Leslye Headland (the 2010 critical hit ''Bachelorette'') sets employees against a boss from hell. Directed by Trip Cullman, with Bobby Steggert, Michael Esper and Sue Jean Kim. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org. (David DeWitt)
'Beyond the Horizon' (in previews; opens on Feb. 26) Ciaran O'Reilly, who directed the Irish Rep revivals of ''The Emperor Jones'' and ''The Hairy Ape,'' returns to Eugene O'Neill with this staging of the playwright's first full-length work, a story of two brothers in love with the same woman. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1920. Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, irishrep.org. (David Rooney) 
'Carrie' (in previews; opens on March 1) Will it be another bloodbath or a fresh prom-night corsage this time around for the infamous musical adapted from the Stephen King novel? One of Broadway's most legendary flops in its 1988 debut, the show has been revised for this MCC Theater production by its original team, Michael Gore (composer), Dean Pitchford (lyricist) and Lawrence D. Cohen (author of the book and also screenwriter of the 1976 Brian De Palma film). Stafford Arima directs a cast that includes Molly Ranson as the telekinetic high school misfit and Marin Mazzie as her hellfire-preaching mother. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Rooney)
'Death of a Salesman' (in previews; opens on March 15) Following in the footsteps of Brian Dennehy, Dustin Hoffman, George C. Scott and Lee J. Cobb, just to name his Broadway predecessors in the role, Philip Seymour Hoffman slips on the careworn persona of Willy Loman in this revival of the Arthur Miller classic. Directed by Mike Nichols, the ensemble also features Linda Emond as Linda, Andrew Garfield (due on screen this summer in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'') as Biff, Bill Camp as Charley and John Glover as Ben. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Early Plays' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Two titans of experimental theater, the Wooster Group and New York City Players, come together under the direction of Richard Maxwell in this interpretation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Glencairn'' plays, exploring themes of longing and eternity through tales of sailors on and off the ocean. St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'Edward Albee's The Lady From Dubuque' (in previews; opens on March 5) As part of Signature's inaugural season in its new Frank Gehry-designed home, the company tackles one of Mr. Albee's more challenging plays with this rare revival of the 1980 work inspired by his reading of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's ''On Death and Dying.'' David Esbjornson directs a cast headed by Jane Alexander as the enigmatic title figure. Signature Theater, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Rooney)
Frigid New York (opens on Wednesday) Smaller and more tightly run (and less sweaty) than the New York International Fringe Festival, this effort brings 30 shows to three East Village theaters. Of note: ''Missed Connections,'' a staging of the much-read Craigslist pleas; ''The Rope in Your Hands,'' a Hurricane Katrina-themed solo show; and the presumably self-explanatory ''Man Saved by Condiments!'' Kraine Theater and the Red Room, both at 85 East Fourth Street, and Under St. Marks, 94 St. Marks Place, (212) 868-4444, frigidnewyork.info. (Eric Grode)
'Galileo' (in previews; opens on Thursday) This new production of the Brecht play, translated by Charles Laughton, offers another chance to see the courageous title character up against the Inquisition. It stars the busy Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham and features a range of stage stalwarts, familiar and rising, like Jon DeVries, Steven Skybell and Nick Westrate. Brian Kulick directs. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (DeWitt)
'Hurt Village' (in previews; opens on Feb. 27) Katori Hall (the Martin Luther King drama ''The Mountaintop'') is back in Memphis for this premiere, a tale of a teenage rapper, her family, their home in a housing project -- and the return of her father, an Iraq war veteran. With Ron Cephas Jones and Tonya Pinkins. Signature Theater, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (DeWitt)
'An Iliad' (in previews; opens on March 6 and 7) The Tony-winning actors Denis O'Hare and Stephen Spinella play alternate performances of this new version of Homer's epic poem. Written by Mr. O'Hare and Lisa Peterson, who also directs, the production considers humanity's appetite for violence and destruction, contemplating how little has changed since the Trojan War. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com, nytw.org. (Rooney)
'My Tawny Valentine' (opens on Friday) Nearly 20 years after his Obie-winning solo show, ''The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me,'' David Drake stars in this self-described ''drag tragicomedy with music.'' He plays a former ''Hee-Haw Honey'' and disco one-hit-wonder named Tawny Heatherton. The choice of director is an intriguing one: the former ballet star and occasional Broadway visitor Robert La Fosse (''Dancin','' ''Jerome Robbins' Broadway''). Fridays only at the Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, spincyclenyc.com. (Grode)
'Painting Churches' (in previews; opens on March 6) Carl Forsman stages the first New York revival of Tina Howe's 1983 comedy about parent-child relationships and the intersection of life and art. The Keen Company production stars Kathleen Chalfant and John Cunningham as the aging couple preparing to move to a Cape Cod beach house, and Kate Turnbull as the artist daughter who arrives to help them pack and paint their portrait. Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Playing Moliere' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Thursday) Bring comfortable shoes: New York Classical Theater continues its habit of traipsing audiences up, down and around the World Financial Center's Winter Garden in what it calls ''panoramic theater.'' This time audiences will encounter three Moliere comedies (''Sganarelle,'' or ''The Imaginary Cuckold,'' and two lesser-known titles), which have been interwoven to accentuate overlapping characters and common themes. World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com/arts-events; free. (Grode)
'Rated P for Parenthood' (in previews; opens on Feb. 29) The Bugaboo set gets its own breezy four-actor musical, a la ''Menopause: The Musical'' and ''I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change'' (a long-running hit in this same theater). Child rearing, from the arrival of the stork to the suddenly empty nest, is the topic this time. Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Rutherford & Son' (in previews; opens on Feb. 27) The solid Mint Theater first staged this 1912 family-business drama at a soon-to-be historic time -- September 2001 -- and now gives the play another chance, with some cast members from that production of more than a decade ago. Richard Corley directs the Githa Sowerby play. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (DeWitt)
'The Thrill of the Chase' (in previews; opens on Sunday) When one man announces his plan to pop the question to his longtime girlfriend, his womanizing roommate doesn't exactly share his enthusiasm. A dark wager ensues, along with men-behaving-badly complications that will strike familiar chords for David Mamet and Neil LaBute fans. The playwright, Philip Gawthorne, has been pegged in Britain as a young writer to watch. Drilling Company Theater, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Grode)
'Tribes' (in previews; opens on March 4) Acclaimed in its 2010 premiere at the Royal Court Theater in London, Nina Raine's play brings David Cromer back to the same address where he staged his penetrating dissection of ''Our Town.'' His latest project is a provocative comedy about a young man born deaf into a family whose articulacy compounds his isolation. Things change when he begins a relationship with a woman also losing her hearing. The six-member cast features Mare Winningham. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Rooney)
Broadway
- 'Anything Goes' Kathleen Marshall's zesty revival of Cole Porter's hit-packed musical embodies the essence of escapist entertainment in the 1930s, when hard times called for bold smiles, tough wisecracks and flashy fantasies. Sutton Foster is sensational as the nightclub evangelist Reno Sweeney (2:30). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' As the fatally conflicted Bess, the extraordinary Audra McDonald is a gale force of emotion in Diane Paulus's slimmed-down musical adaptation of the landmark 1935 opera. Otherwise, despite a likable performance from Norm Lewis as Porgy, this production feels cloudy and mild, only rarely acquiring the majesty of the opera that inspired it (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Nick Jonas plays the amoral hero of Frank Loesser's 1961 musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties: Stockard Channing, Rachel Griffiths, Stacy Keach, Judith Light and Justin Kirk (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Road to Mecca' A quiet, slow and ultimately powerful revival of Athol Fugard's three-character play about the inevitable and necessary apartness of artists. Rosemary Harris is wonderful, a study in subliminal radiance, as an aging South African sculptor under siege from the forces of conventionalism. Jim Dale and Carla Gugino provide strong support in Gordon Edelstein's production (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold directs a bright cast that includes Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the Gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
'Stick Fly' Lydia R. Diamond's overstuffed but lively comedy-drama feels like a Tyler Perry melodrama (sans Madea) as revised by an academic specializing in issues of class in African-American culture. Condola Rashad gives the standout performance in the director Kenny Leon's uneven production, playing a young woman who embodies the problems of racial and class divisions that the other characters theorize about (2:15). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Wit' Cynthia Nixon gives a large, lucid and delicate performance in this immaculately staged (and inevitably moving) revival of Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama from 1998 about a terminally ill English professor. Lynne Meadow's smart and sensitive production magnifies the play's innate theatricality without compromising the hard emotional truth at its center (1:40). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
- 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the Apple co-founder's life and vision into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
'The Broken Heart' Selina Cartmell's gloom-shrouded production of this rarely staged tragedy by John Ford features a fine cast, but the air of woe foretold is so thick that it's hard to engage with the twisted tale of love and retribution (2:45). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, new42.org. (Isherwood)
'Chekhovek' This dramatization of nine Chekhov short stories is proficiently acted and directed, yet often more intriguing in theory than in execution (2:00). ArcLight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, (866) 811-4111, chekhovek.com. (Ken Jaworowski)
'CQ/CX' The playwright Gabe McKinley, a former staff member of The New York Times, turns the newspaper's 2003 Jayson Blair scandal into a cautionary take of deceit, ambition and hubris. The roman a clef play, briskly staged by David Leveaux for Atlantic Theater Company, has some insider details, but the work doesn't go much beyond the compelling narrative of a major journalistic fraud (2:15). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Frank Rizzo)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
- 'How I Learned to Drive' A first-rate revival of Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize winner. With Norbert Leo Butz and Elizabeth Reaser playing a predatory uncle and his precocious niece, one of the most discomfiting love stories in the American theater returns after 15 years with its power to rattle and stir undiluted. Kate Whoriskey directs (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Brantley)
'Ionescopade' A broad revival of this 1974 comic revue, which sets Ionesco's absurdist plays to music, is a sampling menu for his fans (2:00). York Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Zinoman)
'Look Back in Anger' Sam Gold's stylized staging of John Osborne's 1956 drama about a working-class lad with the weight of a stifling social system on his shoulders wins points for ingenuity -- the stage is about three feet deep -- but in the crucial central role, Matthew Rhys (television's ''Brothers and Sisters'') never locates the genuine pain beneath the surface rage (2:10). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 352-3101, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Myths and Hymns' Elizabeth Lucas's luminous staging of Adam Guettel's elegiac song cycle turns Mr. Guettel's richly melodic songs of yearning and transcendence into reflections on the loves and losses of a New England family. Well sung by a cast of six, led by Linda Balgord as the matriarch beset by ghosts from the past (1:20). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101, propspecttheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Psycho Therapy' This farce by Frank Strausser about couples counseling for a Los Angeles woman and her two lovers shows sparks on occasion, especially when Angelica Page as Lily and Jeffrey Carlson as her younger, rich ex-boyfriend, go at each other, either fighting or making up. But even a farce requires more than stereotypes, and beyond its uneven pacing and contrived outcome, the play never truly cares about any of its characters (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, cherrylanetheatre.org. (Daniel M. Gold)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Richard III' Kevin Spacey entertainingly out-acts everybody onstage in Sam Mendes's valedictory production for the Anglo-American Bridge Project. Say what you will about Mr. Spacey's histrionic excesses, he provides a sustained (and intelligent) interpretation as Shakespeare's murderous crookback. The same cannot be said of Mr. Mendes's staging, a grab bag of postmodern gimmicks (3:00). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)
'Russian Transport' Janeane Garofalo plays it straight, more or less, in Erika Sheffer's dark drama about the corrupting influence of a new Russian immigrant (the excellent Morgan Spector) on a Brooklyn family (2:10). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
- 'Rx' Kate Fodor's play about an affair between a work-weary editor (Marin Hinkle) and a pharmaceutical researcher (Stephen Kunken) is an engaging blend of gentle satire on our overprescribed culture and classic romantic comedy. Ethan McSweeny's sprightly production features fun supporting turns from Marylouise Burke and Elizabeth Rich (1:40). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Isherwood)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents gets to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'The Ugly One' Marius von Mayenburg's absurdist comedy bluntly satirizes the superficiality of contemporary culture and the slipperiness of identity. When an engineer deficient in looks (Alfredo Narciso) is transformed into a super-hunk by plastic surgery, he begins to lose his grip on his sense of self, especially when he starts meeting his own face on every other street corner (1:00). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, sohorep.org. (Isherwood)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, but most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30).

Off Off Broadway
'Growing Up Gonzales' This one-man play about a Nuyorican family in the 1970s is part stand-up, part melodrama and part cultural tourism. Andres Chulisi Rodriguez alternates between playing two brothers: Cisco, the sweet-natured, slow younger brother, who we learn at the outset has recently died; and Johnny, the thuggish older sibling, who has discovered Cisco's journals after his brother's death. The quiet Cisco, it turns out, was quite the storyteller and has colorfully recreated the tragedies and farces of their fatherless childhood, including ridiculous stories about shoplifting raw chickens and imitating Bruce Lee (1:30). Jan Hus Playhouse, 351 East 74th Street, (212) 811-4111, growingupgonzales.com. (Rampell)
'The History of the World' Judith Malina, 85 and still the unsinkable life force behind the venerable downtown avant-garde troupe the Living Theater, instigates another rebellion with this exuberant, dizzying flight through the course of Western civilization, peppered with political observations. It's never dull, but the audience participation may deter some viewers. Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-0255, livingtheatre.org. (Andy Webster)
'That Ain't No Lady' The doyenne of the now-defunct annual outdoor drag festival, Wigstock, Lady Bunny purveys bawdy stand-up and pornographic pop song parodies in her first new cabaret act in 10 years. Looking like Dusty Springfield on steroids and introduced ''direct from the Port Authority men's room,'' the Lady and her show are definitely not for the prudish. But anyone feeling nostalgic for the seedy old days before Times Square became a tourist-friendly theme park will get a kick out of this evening of big hair and bad manners. Tuesday only (1:30). La Escuelita Cabaret Theater, 301 West 39th Street, (212) 631-0588, brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)
- 'These Seven Sicknesses' Over the course of this ambitious adaptation of Sophocles' seven surviving plays, blood erupts from just about every orifice, onto just about every article of clothing and just about every square inch of the narrow stage. Sophocles purists may not be happy with some of the changes, but in the end this gory five-hour production -- which includes breaks for a pan-Asian dinner and dessert -- remains vibrant, entertaining and fresh. That's no small feat considering its marathon length and 2,400-year-old roots (5:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Rampell)

Last Chance
'Merrily We Roll Along' (closes on Sunday) A brassy (in all respects) staging of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's problem musical from 1981. James Lapine directs a cast that includes a very good Celia Keenan-Bolger and Lin-Manuel Miranda, with Colin Donnell as the cipher corrupted by success. The tally remains status quo: great score, unfortunate book (2:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'The Philanderer' (closes on Sunday) An early work by George Bernard Shaw, this drawing-room farce follows a Victorian-era love triangle among a rake, the woman he loves and the woman who loves him. Shaw meant to explore some of the feminist territory Ibsen had in ''A Doll's House,'' but he met with only mixed success. This production by the Pearl Theater Company does little to elevate the play either, though it benefits from Karron Graves's comic performance as the impetuous and frustrated Julia Craven (2:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Gold)
- 'Samuel & Alasdair: A Personal History of the Robot Wars' (closes on Saturday) Lila Neugebauer directed the Mad Ones' imaginative riff on atomic age fears, set in a Soviet radio station in Irkutsk about a century after the United States was wiped out by robots in 1959. ''Samuel & Alasdair'' has the larky excitement of ''let's put on a show'' even as its can-do spirit becomes infected with a feeling of creeping dread. The robots, it seems, are coming to Irkutsk, too (1:15). New Ohio Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444, newohiotheatre.org. (Saltz)
'Tokio Confidential' (closes on Sunday) What begins as a predictable but not unpleasant musical melodrama (Japanese tattoo artist makes a big impression on American widow in 1870s Tokyo) spins off into a fairly ludicrous potboiler. Eric Schorr's engaging score grounds the characters for a while, but the enterprise ultimately feels like a lurid drag extravaganza with all of the campiness removed (2:15).

HEADLINE: Obama's Trip West Fills His Campaign's Coffers

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- If there were any doubts that President Obama had plunged fully into his re-election campaign, they were erased on Thursday as the president spent an entire day hopscotching some of California's fanciest neighborhoods in search of dollars to finance his bid for a second term.
In political circles a fund-raising trip of this magnitude is called a ''money run,'' and advisers say that by the time the last wineglasses will be clinked -- on Friday, at a fund-raiser at the Westin in Bellevue, Wash. -- Team Obama will have raised around $8 million. 
While Mr. Obama is mixing in a couple of public stops -- he visited a manufacturing company in Milwaukee on Wednesday and will stop at a Boeing plant on Friday -- the mostly political nature of his trip produced Republican grousing that Mr. Obama was doing ''what he does best,'' in the words of the Republican National Committee's spokeswoman, Kirsten Kukowski: ''Campaign in Hollywood with the rich and famous who will open their pocketbooks for his campaign coffers.''
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, shrugged off the Republican criticism, saying, ''We're consolidating a lot of events out here because he's here, and then there will be periods of relatively few political events, and then more concentration, depending on what's on the schedule.''
As to the criticism that taxpayers are paying for part of what is a fund-raising trip because the campaign stops are combined with official events, Mr. Obama's advisers noted that has long been the case during presidential re-election seasons. ''We do it absolutely by the book and in the same manner that President Bush did and President Clinton did,'' Mr. Carney told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One.
Mr. Obama is trying to use the lengthy Republican presidential nomination fight to shore up Democratic financing for the election year. Just two weeks ago, the Obama campaign, in a turnaround, began officially encouraging supporters to donate to a Democratic ''super PAC,'' Priorities USA. Obama campaign officials characterized their decision as a necessary one meant to combat similar Republican political action committees, particularly those set up to back Mitt Romney.
At the various events on Wednesday and Thursday, Mr. Obama mostly stuck to the same script, telling supporters at one fund-raiser, co-hosted by the actor Will Ferrell: ''Part of our job is to say, as tough as it is, as incremental as it sometimes seems, things have changed. And they can change more if we fight for it, if we're determined, if we have confidence in each other, if we decide to unite instead of divide.''
Mr. Obama referred to signs of an uptick in the economy, including jobs growth and a revival of the auto industry after the bailout that he backed. And because this was, after all, a group as solidly Democrat as any the president is likely to encounter, he even talked about the health care bill he pushed to passage.
Mr. Obama's arrival on Thursday in San Francisco coincided with his campaign's announcement that it had opened its first office dedicated solely to high-tech work in the race, like setting up Twitter feeds, Facebook pages and other Internet applications. Campaign aides called it a ''technology field office,'' and said they believed it to be a first for a presidential campaign.
Katie Hogan, deputy press secretary with the Obama campaign, said that one of the office's missions would be to serve as a place for Web-savvy volunteers to come with ideas about how to increase the campaign's reach through the use of the Internet.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Annual Profit Rises 62%, but Quarterly Earnings Fall

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motorsreported a big annual profit on Thursday, but losses in Europe dragged down fourth-quarter earnings.
The results mean G.M.'s hourly workers in the United States will receive profit-sharing checks next month of up to $7,000, a record.
G.M. said it earned a quarterly profit of $472 million, or 28 cents a share, down from $510 million, or 31 cents a share, a year ago. It was the eighth consecutive quarterly profit for the carmaker, which cleansed much of its debt in bankruptcy two years ago, but also the smallest during that stretch. 
For all of 2011, G.M. earned $7.6 billion, nearly all of it from North America. That was 62 percent higher than the $4.7 billion it earned a year ago and nominally more than G.M.'s previous record of $6.7 billion in 1997 (in today's dollars, the 1997 profit would be about $9.4 billion).
Revenue increased 11 percent to $150.3 billion, as sales rose and its vehicles commanded higher prices.
G.M.'s chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, called the year ''another step in the right direction'' but said the performance in Europe was not acceptable.
''Obviously, we still have a lot of work to do in some areas and we're taking the necessary corrective actions to get the ball over the goal line,'' Mr. Akerson said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.
Excluding one-time items like debt reduction and an investment in its former financing arm, Ally Financial, G.M. earned 39 cents a share in the fourth quarter, 2 cents below analysts' expectations. Still, shares rose nearly 9 percent, to close at $27.17 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
G.M. earned $7.2 billion in North America in 2011, 26 percent higher than the previous year. Under a formula in the United Automobile Workers union's new contract with G.M., 47,500 hourly workers are eligible to receive up to $7,000 in profit-sharing as a result. G.M. paid workers $4,300 a year ago and before that had paid out more than $1,000 only once, in 1999, when the checks were $1,775 each.
In contrast, the company lost $747 million in Europe, where it is speeding up a restructuring of its Opel brand. It lost $562 million in Europe during the fourth quarter alone, as economic conditions there deteriorated.
G.M.'s continuing restructuring plan for Europe, where it has been losing money every year for more than a decade, ''was built around a more robust European economy than we face today,'' G.M.'s chief financial officer, Daniel Ammann, said.
Mr. Ammann said G.M. would move ''rapidly and decisively'' to reduce its break-even point in Europe and not simply wait for the economy to improve.
''G.M.E. has to become profitable even in a challenging economic environment,'' he said. ''Just like in the United States a couple years ago, we will need to show improvement in both revenue and cost to be successful.''
Mr. Ammann declined to reveal specific actions that G.M. would take in Europe, like plant closings, but said the company was ''in discussions with all of our stakeholders to optimize the business.'' He said the auto industry had too much production capacity in Europe, noting only that G.M. was in the same position as its rivals there.
The company also lost money -- $225 million in the fourth quarter and $122 million on the year -- in South America, a reversal from a year ago, when that region generated a profit of $818 million.
Globally, fourth-quarter revenue rose 3 percent to $38 billion. G.M. said it expected to increase its top-line revenue in 2012 as demand for vehicles improves in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Analysts said they expected North America to continue driving G.M.'s profits higher as the company works to increase its margins.
''G.M.'s new focus on balancing traditional cost controls with improved product quality is beginning to pay dividends in North America,'' Brian A. Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, wrote in a report Thursday.
G.M. generated $1.2 billion in positive operating cash flow during the fourth quarter, increasing its total automotive liquidity to $37.5 billion.
G.M. said its United States pensions ended the year underfunded by $13.3 billion, or 12 percent. A year ago, they were underfunded by $11.5 billion, or 11 percent. On Wednesday, G.M. said it would freeze pension contributions for salaried employees, instead switching them to a 401(k)-type plan to eliminate the risk of a future shortfall.
The pension gap is among the factors hindering the value of G.M.'s stock, analysts say. Shares of G.M. are worth about one-quarter less than the price set in an initial public offering in November 2010, when the federal government sold most of the 60 percent stake it received in G.M. after shepherding the company through bankruptcy.
The government still owns 26 percent of G.M., but the Obama administration has delayed plans to sell those shares in the hopes of recovering a larger percentage of its investment as the share price increases.

HEADLINE: In Detroit, Santorum Defends Opposition to Auto Industry Bailout

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from New York, and Ashley Parker from Monroe, Mich.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Faced with explaining his opposition to the 2008 rescue of the automobile industry to an audience of Detroit business leaders on Thursday, Rick Santorum attacked his chief rival, Mitt Romney, who also opposed the industry's bailout, for treating Wall Street differently from Detroit.
Mr. Santorum, who is locked in a tight Michigan primary race with Mr. Romney, argued in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club that Mr. Romney was inconsistent for supporting the Wall Street bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, while objecting to billions of dollars in federal loans to the auto industry. 
''Governor Romney supported the bailout of Wall Street and decided not to support the bailout of Detroit,'' Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, said. ''My feeling was that we should not support -- the government should not be involved in bailouts, period. I think that's a much more consistent position.''
In response, the Romney campaign said that Mr. Santorum had once defended a congressman who voted for TARP by saying the congressman's vote was ''the wrong decision, but I don't think it was an unreasonable decision.''
A new Detroit News poll showed Mr. Santorum leading Mr. Romney by four percentage points in Michigan, which was within the poll's margin of error. Mr. Romney needs a victory in the Feb. 28 primary to regain momentum after Mr. Santorum unexpectedly swept three contests on Feb. 7.
The battle for Michigan will soon be evident on the airwaves. On Thursday, a ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Santorum reserved nearly $700,000 in television time for commercials that are to begin Friday. The group, the Red, White and Blue Fund, is stepping in where Mr. Santorum's campaign has had a minimal presence, committing only $40,000 to advertising in Michigan.
But that increase in spending will not come close to matching the total number of advertisements supporting Mr. Romney. His campaign has reserved more than $800,000 in airtime, and the pro-Romney super PAC has spent more than $650,000 on television commercials in the state.
Both candidates, recognizing the political power of labor unions here, sought on Thursday to tone down some of their anti-union comments. Mr. Romney said during a visit to Monroe that unions play an ''important role,'' but defended so-called right-to-work laws. Mr. Santorum said during his address here that private-sector unions were a ''legitimate'' part of the economy.
But Mr. Santorum drew a distinction with public-employee unions, which he said had an unfair advantage because they bargain not with business owners representing shareholder interests, but with politicians trawling for votes and handling taxpayer money. ''I have no problem with private-sector unions,'' he said, adding, ''I don't feel quite as warm and fuzzy about public-sector unions.''
If either man wins the Republican nomination, his opposition to the auto industry bailout will be seen as a hurdle to winning Michigan, a critical swing state, in the general election. The auto bailout, which was begun during the Bush administration and continued by President Obama, is now widely seen as successful, and as if to emphasize that point to the candidates, General Motors on Thursday reported a quarterly profit of $472 million.
Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney both say they favored a managed bankruptcy -- which ultimately happened -- but without the government loans. They argue that such a process would have allowed the companies to emerge at least as healthy, if not healthier, as they did from the bailout.
But many industry analysts say that the huge amounts of money required to save the companies was available only through the government; banks and other private sources of capital were too weakened by the economic crisis to provide loans on anywhere near the scale needed.
''These companies were hemorrhaging cash on a daily basis into the millions and millions of dollars; credit was not easily accessible from almost any of the markets, and so I don't know that they would have survived,'' said Gary Corbin, managing director of business development in Michigan for Accenture, the consulting firm. For every job lost at one of the big car companies, he said, 6 to 10 other jobs would have also been lost across the United States in a ripple effect.
''It was a huge catastrophe just about to happen,'' he said.
In his speech, Mr. Santorum laid most of the blame for the bailouts not with Mr. Obama but with George W. Bush, a rare departure from the Republican candidates' nonstop assault on Mr. Obama's policies.
''President Obama was just following suit,'' he said. ''President Bush set the precedent, and it was the wrong precedent.''
Mr. Santorum also said that he favored income inequality because some people contribute more to society than others. While also emphasizing that he favors ''equality of opportunity,'' he added: ''There is income inequality in America. There always has been and hopefully, and I do say that, there always will be. Why? Because people rise to different levels of success based on what they contribute to society and to the marketplace, and that's as it should be.''
He also made light of the release on Wednesday night of his recent income tax returns, noting that he had paid roughly double the effective tax rate of Mr. Romney, who made far more money.
''Look, I do my own taxes,'' Mr. Santorum said. ''Heck, Romney paid half the tax rate I did, so obviously he doesn't do his own taxes. Maybe I should hire an accountant in the future.''

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON and JONATHAN ANSFIELD; Ian Johnson reported from Chongqing, and Jonathan Ansfield from Beijing. Edy Yin contributed research from Beijing, and Andrew Jacobs contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
CHONGQING, China -- This week, the United States has been host to China's leader-in-waiting, Xi Jinping, hoping to glean clues to the country's future. But for the Chinese, it is an unfolding political drama in this sprawling mountain city that could have a major impact on the country's political fortunes.
Here in Chongqing, the Communist Party's secretive, stage-managed process of installing a new generation of leaders has become a more open and sometimes brutal contest, with fortunes of leaders of broadly different inclinations at stake.
''What's going on in Chongqing is a battle over the future course of China,'' said Wang Kang, a local writer and commentator. ''It is about how China should be run.'' 
It also has implications for American politics. Despite denials from Washington, American diplomats and Chinese sources with ties to security services say that one of the chief figures in Chongqing sought asylum at a United States Consulate but was rebuffed partly because the United States did not want to create a diplomatic crisis ahead of Mr. Xi's trip.
The main player is the region's powerful party secretary, Bo Xilai, the closest China has to a Western-style politician. A tall, suave 63-year-old, Mr. Bo has intrigued foreign and domestic political watchers for two decades -- as mayor of a port city, provincial governor, commerce minister and now head of Chongqing, a city-state the size of Austria with 30 million people. Unlike Mr. Xi, seen as humble and deft, Mr. Bo is a tenacious fighter and showman.
He is also a contender for the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo, which would put him among the nine people -- with Mr. Xi at the head -- who have final say on everything from currency exchange rates to Tibet.
But Mr. Bo's chances have suffered a serious blow because of an unfolding corruption scandal involving Wang Lijun, the man he recruited as Chongqing's top law enforcement officer. While some observers say Mr. Bo's ascension cannot be ruled out, most seem to think his upward trajectory has stalled.
Until recently, Mr. Bo's tenure in Chongqing had seemed brilliant. For most of his political ascent, Mr. Bo relied on his father, Bo Yibo, a revolutionary war leader who died only in 2007. As the offspring of a top-ranking official, or ''princeling,'' he is part of a network of people who can bypass normal channels, both for personal and political gain.
Mr. Bo used these connections to carry out a series of populist changes in Chongqing. Once the wartime capital of China, it was expanded in the 1990s into a small, mostly rural province with a metropolis at its center.
He vowed to double the region's urban population to 20 million by the end of the decade. And he oversaw a pilot program to award millions of farmers urban residency and built hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments to lure them, although local experts say his underlings have relied heavily on coercion.
Another of Mr. Bo's initiatives was a much-publicized campaign to revive Mao-era songs and ideology. He also made populist promises to double rural incomes and took on foreign companies like Wal-Mart, burnishing his credentials with people wary of the influence of multinational corporations in China.
Most famously, he attacked the triads, mafia-type groups that for decades arbitrated disputes and squeezed ordinary citizens.
To attack the triads, Mr. Bo hired Mr. Wang, an official he had known from an earlier posting. Mr. Wang had a reputation for courage -- he had personally stormed a hotel and arrested a crime boss after knocking him cold with an uppercut -- but also for brutality. In one case reported in the Chinese news media, he was so enraged that a pedicab driver had had the temerity to be run over by his white Mercedes that he leapt out, beat the man and had him detained for 15 days on a traffic violation.
With Mr. Bo running political interference, Mr. Wang took on the gangs, arresting 2,000 people, including high-level Communist Party officials charged with shielding crime lords. The campaign also ignored normal judicial procedures. There have been 13 executions.
In Chongqing, Mr. Bo remains mostly popular. Public housing, better roads and safer neighborhoods all resonate, even if many rural residents chafe at forced relocation. ''I can tell that people are wealthier and spending more,'' said Yang Xuebo, a fruit seller. ''He is ambitious, but if you're a leader you have to have big visions.''
Back in Beijing, even many liberal critics are excited by his boldness to break the rules and push through reforms, after a near absence of significant change for a decade.
''Xi Jinping may be well-intentioned, but he is not the kind of character who really dares to take on the vested interests,'' said one fellow princeling who has advised leaders, including Mr. Bo. ''Bo Xilai is the probably the only person who dares.''
Civil libertarians are appalled at the disrespect for due process. Mr. Bo's promotion of old-style Communist culture is seen as an effort to revive an era best left at rest. And his economics are criticized as copying Mao-style ''leapfrog development'' that was meant to modernize China in a single bound but ended in disaster. And Mr. Bo has infuriated many of China's top leaders and their families.
For example, he ordered the arrest of a lawyer who had defended one of Chongqing's crime bosses. But the head of the lawyer's firm was the son of another deceased revolutionary leader, Peng Zhen. Mr. Peng and the elder Mr. Bo had been bitter rivals, and the attack on the lawyer revived this generational feud.
Now, the years of brash action seem to have caught up with Mr. Bo. Several months ago, his top police official, Mr. Wang, became the target of an investigation into corruption in a northeastern city, Tieling, where he had worked.
When party investigators first questioned Mr. Wang, Mr. Bo spoke favorably and sought to protect him, according to the fellow princeling. But under pressure from central authorities, Mr. Bo soon began to turn, and this month Mr. Bo effectively demoted Mr. Wang.
A few days later, Mr. Wang learned that his driver had been arrested, according to the source. Mr. Wang apparently panicked. On Feb. 6, he drove 200 miles from Chongqing to the nearest United States Consulate, in Chengdu.
He stayed overnight, talking with consular officials and inquiring about the possibility of political asylum, according to American diplomats. Washington rebuffed the request mainly because it would be logistically difficult, but also because it was reluctant to upset Sino-American relations on the eve of Mr. Xi's visit, the diplomats said. It was not clear how Mr. Wang could have left China -- a posse of local and national police officers was already waiting outside the consulate -- and the Americans were queasy about protecting someone linked to so many human rights abuses.
On the record, American officials would say only that Mr. Wang left the consulate ''of his own volition.'' Other sources in China said that Mr. Wang's chief goals were to seek refuge from Mr. Bo and make clear to him that incriminating knowledge or evidence had been passed on. Mr. Wang left the consulate and is reported in detention in Beijing.
Within a couple days, Mr. Bo sent a letter to the leadership in which he took responsibility for having promoted and ''failed to investigate'' Mr. Wang, and offered, if only perfunctorily, to resign, according to the fellow princeling.
His future is a matter of conjecture. He may face retirement, or end up in a ceremonial job at a consultative conference or the rubber-stamp Parliament.

HEADLINE: Moochers Against Welfare

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
First, Atlas shrugged. Then he scratched his head in puzzlement.
Modern Republicans are very, very conservative; you might even (if you were Mitt Romney) say, severely conservative. Political scientists who use Congressional votes to measure such things find that the current G.O.P. majority is the most conservative since 1879, which is as far back as their estimates go.
And what these severe conservatives hate, above all, is reliance on government programs. Rick Santorum declares that President Obama is getting America hooked on ''the narcotic of dependency.'' Mr. Romney warns that government programs ''foster passivity and sloth.'' Representative Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, requires that staffers read Ayn Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged,'' in which heroic capitalists struggle against the ''moochers'' trying to steal their totally deserved wealth, a struggle the heroes win by withdrawing their productive effort and giving interminable speeches. 
Many readers of The Times were, therefore, surprised to learn, from an excellent article published last weekend, that the regions of America most hooked on Mr. Santorum's narcotic -- the regions in which government programs account for the largest share of personal income -- are precisely the regions electing those severe conservatives. Wasn't Red America supposed to be the land of traditional values, where people don't eat Thai food and don't rely on handouts?
The article made its case with maps showing the distribution of dependency, but you get the same story from a more formal comparison. Aaron Carroll of Indiana University tells us that in 2010, residents of the 10 states Gallup ranks as ''most conservative'' received 21.2 percent of their income in government transfers, while the number for the 10 most liberal states was only 17.1 percent.
Now, there's no mystery about red-state reliance on government programs. These states are relatively poor, which means both that people have fewer sources of income other than safety-net programs and that more of them qualify for ''means-tested'' programs such as Medicaid.
By the way, the same logic explains why there has been a jump in dependency since 2008. Contrary to what Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney suggest, Mr. Obama has not radically expanded the safety net. Rather, the dire state of the economy has reduced incomes and made more people eligible for benefits, especially unemployment benefits. Basically, the safety net is the same, but more people are falling into it.
But why do regions that rely on the safety net elect politicians who want to tear it down? I've seen three main explanations.
First, there is Thomas Frank's thesis in his book ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'': working-class Americans are induced to vote against their own interests by the G.O.P.'s exploitation of social issues. And it's true that, for example, Americans who regularly attend church are much more likely to vote Republican, at any given level of income, than those who don't.
Still, as Columbia University's Andrew Gelman points out, the really striking red-blue voting divide is among the affluent: High-income residents of red states are overwhelmingly Republican; high-income residents of blue states only mildly more Republican than their poorer neighbors. Like Mr. Frank, Mr. Gelman invokes social issues, but in the opposite direction. Affluent voters in the Northeast tend to be social liberals who would benefit from tax cuts but are repelled by things like the G.O.P.'s war on contraception.
Finally, Cornell University's Suzanne Mettler points out that many beneficiaries of government programs seem confused about their own place in the system. She tells us that 44 percent of Social Security recipients, 43 percent of those receiving unemployment benefits, and 40 percent of those on Medicare say that they ''have not used a government program.''
Presumably, then, voters imagine that pledges to slash government spending mean cutting programs for the idle poor, not things they themselves count on. And this is a confusion politicians deliberately encourage. For example, when Mr. Romney responded to the new Obama budget, he condemned Mr. Obama for not taking on entitlement spending -- and, in the very next breath, attacked him for cutting Medicare.
The truth, of course, is that the vast bulk of entitlement spending goes to the elderly, the disabled, and working families, so any significant cuts would have to fall largely on people who believe that they don't use any government program.
The message I take from all this is that pundits who describe America as a fundamentally conservative country are wrong. Yes, voters sent some severe conservatives to Washington. But those voters would be both shocked and angry if such politicians actually imposed their small-government agenda.

HEADLINE: The Buffett Tax Rule Is Really More a Guideline

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama has made the Buffett Rule, mandating that millionaires pay at least 30 percent of their incomes in taxes, the centerpiece of his campaign for ''fairness.'' But look for it among the myriad tax changes the White House detailed in the 2013 budget proposal it released this week, and you will not find it.
The Buffett Rule has become a signal piece of election-year political rhetoric. It featured heavily in Mr. Obama's State of the Union address last month. It has become a favored talking point on the campaign trail. And Mr. Obama underscored his support of it in his budget proposal. 
But the White House says it is a ''guideline,'' rather than a legislative initiative. And it says it prefers not to establish the Buffett Rule without a broader overhaul of the tax code, though it would support a Congressional effort to carry it out alone.
''This is the guiding principle of tax reform,'' said Jason Furman, principal deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council. ''To some degree, it's a specific policy, where we set a floor, a minimum rate. And to some degree, it is a statement of principle of how you would like to design the tax system.''
The Buffett Rule is named for Warren E. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway billionaire who made a point of saying that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his hard-working secretary, Debbie Bosanek, who sat in Michelle Obama's box at the State of the Union address.
It seems like an appealingly simple way to ensure that the rich do not pay a smaller proportion of their earnings than many members of the middle class. But tax experts and even the White House itself contend it might be hard to carry out.
The White House asked for numerous changes to raise more revenue from the wealthiest Americans in its budget proposal. Those include allowing the high-end Bush administration tax cuts to expire and taxing dividend earnings as regular income.
But the proposal stops short of suggesting an application of the Buffett Rule on top of that, instead listing it as a ''principle'' for future reform, alongside a repeal of the alternative minimum tax.
The much-hated alternative minimum tax was initially designed to do just what the Buffett Rule would: prevent the wealthy from using loopholes and deductions to lower their tax rates. But the tax was not indexed for inflation, and therefore, each year it ensnares more and more middle-class Americans.
Congress has ''patched'' the tax to prevent it from hitting the more than 30 million tax filers who should hypothetically pay it. Still, 4.3 million tax filers paid the alternative minimum tax last year, raising $39.1 billion in revenue.
Tax experts say creating a new alternative minimum tax for the wealthy might make for good political argument, but it is less compelling as policy.
''It just doesn't make any sense to have one set of rules that applies to some people and one set of rules that applies to everyone else,'' said Leonard E. Burman, a tax expert and professor at Syracuse University.
''It's really complicated,'' Professor Burman said. ''I'm very sympathetic to taxing capital gains like ordinary income; that's the issue this proposal is ostensibly addressing. But the idea that we have different sets of rules for different people? It undermines the tax code.''
William G. Gale, a director of the Tax Policy Center and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said: ''A well-designed tax system would as an artifact be consistent with something like the Buffett Rule. But trying to glom the Buffett Rule onto the current tax system? That's going to be a mess.''
There is a second reason for not proposing the Buffett Rule in the budget: It would significantly reduce revenue if installed alongside a repeal of the alternative minimum tax.
According to Internal Revenue Service data, 236,883 tax filers made $1 million or more in 2009, and they paid an average rate of about 24 percent. Bringing that up to 30 percent would raise billions of dollars over time -- but not nearly as much as the alternative minimum tax, experts say.
While the White House has declined to make the Buffett Rule a concrete proposal, Democrats in Congress have forged ahead. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat from Rhode Island, independently came up with the idea for a minimum tax for the wealthy, and made a proposal after Mr. Obama mentioned it in his State of the Union address.
The proposed law, the Paying a Fair Share Act, eliminates all deductions for the wealthy except their charitable contributions. After that, they must pay a 30 percent minimum tax on the balance of their income.
The law includes a phase-in, to avoid taxing Americans making $1 million at much higher rates than others making $999,999. If the taxpayer makes between $1 million and $2 million, the tax bill is only a fraction of the difference between taxes owed under current law and taxes as determined by the Buffett Rule.
The administration consulted with Senator Whitehouse's office on the proposal, and has said it backs it. ''We're broadly comfortable with the approach Senator Whitehouse laid out in his proposal,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. ''You can do it different ways, but no concerns about not going ahead with something in that broad neighborhood.''
Testifying about the budget proposal on Capitol Hill this week, Mr. Geithner defended the administration's requested tax changes and its choice not to include a comprehensive tax reform plan.
He said the White House strongly recommended broad tax reform to broaden the tax base and simplify the dizzyingly complex tax code. But it recommends enacting changes in the meantime to help reduce the deficit and raise revenue from the wealthy. ''We think the better way to get there is through comprehensive tax reform,'' he said.
''We took a run at trying to negotiate a framework like that with Republican leadership in the House,'' Mr. Geithner said of comprehensive reform. ''We found no basis for agreement on even the broad framework.''
''We're just trying to be realistic,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Fantasy Focus: Sleeper Reliever Watch

BYLINE: DAVID REGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Fantasy team owners have to keep track of the many moves made in the closers' ranks over the off-season. 

 BODY:
Maybe it's just me, but it seems there's been higher-than-normal movement among the closer ranks this off-season. From Huston Street heading to the friendly confines of Petco Park to new closers in Boston (Andrew Bailey), Philadelphia (Jonathan Papelbon) and Toronto (Sergio Santos) among others, let's take a quick look at how things stack up:
Rock-Solid Closers
Craig Kimbrel (ATL), J.J. Putz (ARI), Andrew Bailey (BOS), Carlos Marmol (CHC), Ryan Madson (CIN), Rafael Betancourt (COL), Jose Valverde (DET), Joakim Soria (KC), Heath Bell (MIA), John Axford (MIL), Mariano Rivera (NYY), Jonathan Papelbon (PHI), Joel Hanrahan (PIT), Huston Street (SD), Brandon League (SEA), Brian Wilson (SF), Joe Nathan (TEX), Sergio Santos (TOR), Drew Storen (WAS)
Closers for Now
Jordan Walden (LAA), Jim Johnson (BAL), Chris Perez (CLE), Javy Guerra (LAD), Matt Capps (MIN), Frank Francisco (NYM), Jason Motte (STL), Kyle Farnsworth (TB)
It's surprising the Angels didn't pay more attention to their bullpen, but I guess when you sign Albert Pujols and C.J. Wilson, it matters less. Scott Downs would seem to be next in line, but LaTroy Hawkins could also get a look should Jordan Walden struggle. No chance the Orioles go down the Kevin Gregg path again, so consider Matt Lindstrom next in line behind Jim Johnson. Chris Perez may have been an All-Star for the Indians, but he also had a 39:26 strikeout-walk ratio. That's well below average. The 84:24 mark that Vinny Pestano posted in his 62 innings was well above average. Pestano makes for a solid handcuff in deeper formats for Perez owners. Kenley Jansen's 16.1 strikeouts per 9 innings was an all-time record, so it may just be a matter of time before he surpasses the Dodgers' Javy Guerra. Further degradation in Matt Capps's 4.7 K/9IP could be his downfall, leaving Glen Perkins next up for the Twins. Frank Francisco has the big contract, so he'll be the guy for the Mets initially, but Francisco has a subpar (for a reliever) 3.72 career earned run average. I like Ramon Ramirez (2.62 E.R.A., 66:26 K:BB in 68 2/3 innings) over Jon Rauch as the next guy in line behind Francisco. Jason Motte should be able to hold the St. Louis job over Fernando Salas and Eduardo Sanchez, but things could change there. In Tampa Bay, Kyle Farnsworth has been an excellent signing, but Joel Peralta lurks should Farnsworth revert to his old, erratic self.
Question Marks
That leaves closers' jobs in Chicago (AL), Houston and Oakland undecided. On the South Side, the White Sox dealt a cost-controlled up-and-coming reliever in Sergio Santos and brought in no obvious successor, leaving the likes of Matt Thornton and the rookie Addison Reed to battle for the job this spring. Thornton may have the early edge, but Addison's minor league numbers last year are too remarkable to ignore: 78 1/3 innings, 111 strikeouts and just 14 walks. His fastball and slider are plus pitches, and with Thornton coming off a season in which he posted a 1.36 WHIP, Reed makes for a nice sleeper target.
In Houston, Brandon Lyon is coming off a labrum and biceps injury, but Lyon is like Jason in the "Friday the 13th" movies, coming back again and again. The veteran Wilton Lopez is still around and could function as a short-term option, but the guy to watch here is David Carpenter. Promoted to Class AAA after 14 innings in Class AA last season, Carpenter promptly tossed 19 scoreless innings at that level before reaching the big leagues, where he had a 2.93 E.R.A. and 29 strikeouts in 27 2/3 innings. If he can cut down on the walks (13 in those innings), Carpenter could seize the closer role for a while.
Andrew Bailey is out as Oakland's closer, leaving the role up for grabs among a group including Grant Balfour, Brian Fuentes, Joey Devine and perhaps even Fautino De Los Santos. For now Balfour has the edge off a 2.47 E.R.A. season, but he also has just 10 big league saves, so this one is wide open. Keep an eye on De Los Santos, who could move up the pecking order quickly if he makes progress in his control.

HEADLINE: Robbing Greece of Its Pride

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: As if Greece had not suffered enough dents to its pride, armed thieves broke into a museum celebrating the ancient Olympics on Friday and seized dozens of exhibits. Was it yet another dismal symbol of decline and fall? 

 BODY:
LONDON - In another blow to Greek pride, as the country struggles to meet its European partners' demands for a financial bailout, armed robbers broke into a museum at the birthplace of the ancient Olympics on Friday and made off with a haul of treasures.
Pavlos Geroulanos, Greece's culture minister, was reported to have offered his resignation immediately after learning of the heist, the second major art theft this year. In January, thieves fled the National Gallery in Athens with $6.5 million-worth of art, including paintings by Pablo Picasso and Piet Mondrian.
The latest theft was blamed by some on budget cuts that have been imposed on all aspects of Greek public life in an attempt to rein in the country's runaway debt. 
Friday's raid targeted the Ancient Olympia museum in southern Greece where a ceremony is scheduled for May 10 to light the Olympic flame for this year's Games in London.
As the BBC's foreign editor Jon Williams tweeted:
As if #Greece not got enough problems: 68 objects stolen from Athens museum dedicated to ancient #Olympics. Items of "incalculable" value.
- Jon Williams (@WilliamsJon) February 17, 2012
When Mr. Geroulanos announced last month that he would offer cut-price permits for films and photographic shoots at monuments such as the Parthenon, he was accused of "renting out" Greece's art treasures to cover budget cuts.
Culture ministry security guards have been among the low-level public workers demanding job security and exemption from further budget cuts, in their case on the basis of the potential impact on museum security.
The latest robbery will be seized on as another symbol of a breakdown of Greek society in the face of the draconian austerity measures being imposed on the country's 11 million people. 
Rioting in Athens at the weekend in response to a government decision to bow to the demands of the country's European creditors has spurred a mood of national humiliation. Some commentators say the Greeks have only themselves to blame while others suggest they should tell the European Union to get lost.
Rendezvous reader Richard McDonough wrote from Irvine, California, in response to our article on Wednesday entitled "The Decline and Fall of Greece": "It is clear that the necessary austerity required to fulfill this bankers club's members will eviscerate the average working stiff Greek. Were I Greece I would default, leave the EU, drop its currency and do what I could to make my own way."
Before the weekend, however, it looked as if (EURO)130 billion bailout deal will be finalized on Monday.
The bargaining has brought some sharp exchanges touching on Greek pride and appeals for Europe to avoid humiliating the Greeks. One such appeal came from Alexis Papahelas, executive editor of the Greek daily Kathimerini who wrote in a contributed article in IHT Global Opinion this week: 
"Some of our partners seem to focus more on ways to humiliate our political leaders or the average Greek than they are on getting the job done. If they somehow believe that they will force a change of political culture and personnel through intimidation, they are dead wrong."

HEADLINE: Interracial Couples Who Make the Most Money

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Among newlyweds, Asian grooms and white brides earn the most money between them, followed by white grooms and Asian brides. 

 BODY:
The share of American newlyweds in interracial couples has more than doubled in the last 30 years, to 15 percent in 2010 from 6.7 percent in 1980.
That's according to a new Pew Research Center report, which also looked at how interracial couples compare to same-race couples when it comes to income. On its face, it looks as if couples who married out of their own race are socioeconomically similar to those who married in: in 2008-10, the median combined annual earnings of interracial newlyweds was $56,711, compared with $55,000 for same-race newlyweds.
The numbers vary tremendously, though, depending on the combination of races involved. Here is a list of newlyweds from 2008-2010, sorted by different racial combinations of husbands and wives:
New marriages with an Asian-American groom and a white bride earned the most money, with the median such couple bringing in $71,800 between the two of them. Note, though, that such pairings represent less than 1 percent of all newly married spouses of any racial combination, so the sample size is small.
The converse of that group - new spouses in which the husband is white and the wife is Asian-American - earn almost as much, with a combined median income of $70,952. They are followed by newlyweds who are both Asian, who typically earn $62,000 in total.
So basically, what these numbers are reflecting is that Asians earn more money, period, which is generally true across the population of Asian-Americans and has been the case for a while.
At the bottom of the income list is new marriages in which both spouses are Hispanic. Given the share of Hispanics who are recent immigrants from poor countries, this is probably not surprising.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $9,020,000

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: A penthouse at the Laureate on the Upper West Side that sold for $9.02 million was the biggest sale of the week, according to city records. 

 BODY:
A penthouse at the Laureate on the Upper West Side that sold for $9.02 million was the biggest sale of the week, according to city records.
It is the third time in four months that a sale at the Laureate, a new deluxe condominium at 76th Street and Broadway, topped the list of most expensive sales of the week.
Given the building's success in attracting wealthy buyers - it is nearly sold out, with average selling prices over $6 million - it was not surprising that the asking price of this penthouse had been bumped to $9.7 million from $9.5 million, according to Streeteasy.com.
Shlomi Reuveni, who is leading the sales team for Brown Harris Stevens, declined to comment on the sale. The apartment was bought anonymously through a limited liability company, according to city records.
If the buyers find they feel a little cramped in the 3,420-square-foot apartment, which has five bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, they can take advantage of the Laureate's amenities, which include a fitness center, a private lounge, a music room, two playrooms, a solarium, a parking garage and even a pet spa, according to the listing.
Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.
An earlier version of this post included a photograph of the Laurel, a building on East 67th Street, rather than the Laureate.

HEADLINE: 2013 Budget Would Increase Alternative-Powertrain Tax Credit to $10,000

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: A provision in the president's budget would increase the current maximum credit from $7,500 to $10,000, and would make the credit claimable by the seller, not the purchaser. 

 BODY:
6:05 p.m. | Updated 
The budget introduced Monday by President Obama for the 2013 fiscal year included a provision (PDF) of particular interest to sellers and potential buyers of alternative-powertrain vehicles.
If the provision were preserved, it would increase the current maximum federal income tax credit for certain plug-in vehicles from $7,500 to as much as $10,000. The credit would no longer be claimed by the consumer, but by the vehicle's seller or financer, who could opt to give buyers a break at the time of sale by reducing the list price.
The proposed credit would have a maximum value of $10,000 through 2016, after which time the maximum would fall in $2,500 increments to $7,500 for vehicles entering service in 2017, $5,000 in 2018 and $2,500 in 2019. The credit, which would end Jan. 1, 2020, could be applied to a wider group of vehicles than are currently eligible, including natural gas cars and some hybrids.
Eligible vehicles, however, would have to operate "primarily on an alternative to petroleum," according to the proposal. They would also have to meet miles per gallon equivalent, or m.p.g.e., targets. The current tax credit begins to phase out after manufacturers sell 200,000 advanced-powertrain vehicles, but the proposed credit contains no such limit.
Speaking of the credits Monday at a news conference, Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council and assistant to the president for economic policy, noted that the credits were "technology neutral," in a seeming rebuttal to critics who argued that the administration favored E.V.'s over other advanced mobility technologies. "We don't pick between natural gas and electric vehicles," he said. "We'll let the market determine that and give consumers the incentive to buy these cars."
The provision would also cap the credit at $7,500 on vehicles with a manufacturer's suggested retail price above $45,000. Vehicles below that price would be eligible for the full $10,000 maximum credit.
The budget proposal includes a tax credit of up to $25,000 for alternative-fuel trucks weighing between 14,000 and 26,000 pounds, and credit of up to $40,000 for those weighing more than 26,000 pounds. That credit, halved in the 2018 calendar year, would apply to trucks sold after Dec. 31, 2012, and before Jan. 1, 2019. Bryan Hansel, chairman and chief executive of the electric truck maker Smith Electric Vehicles, said such a credit would improve the appeal of its products.
"This tax credit would likely take two years off the return on investment for vehicles such as ours, and that would dramatically help with the adoption rate," he said in a telephone interview.

HEADLINE: Giving Ideas a Kick in the Wallet

BYLINE: HANNAH MIET


HIGHLIGHT: Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, recently called attention to Kickstarter,com, where people can post fund-raising proposals, and we summarize some pending ideas there. 

 BODY:
When Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, announced a partnership between the Council and the Manhattan Internet company Kickstarter during her State of the City address this month, there may have been some head-scratching in the room.
Ms. Quinn said the City Council would create its own page on the three-year-old fund-raising Web site this spring to promote community projects in neighborhoods with high unemployment rates; the hope was to spur development in those areas.
Kickstarter is as far from a bureaucratic appropriations process as one can get. Anyone can propose a creative project on Kickstarter and sites like it, and set a goal for donations: a few thousand dollars to finance a mural, or hundreds of thousands for an independent film. Donors are charged only if the goal is met, and are often promised sweeteners in return for their contributions, pledge-drive style. (In government, that might be called a bribe.)
An interesting aspect of Kickstarter is that while people's pitches are presumably aimed at their friends and (ever-expanding) social networks, anyone who happens to be browsing on the site could decide to offer a few dollars to a total stranger whose dream seems worth supporting. We did a little browsing and present here some New York City Kickstarter dreams. (No City Council endorsement is implied.) 
"Love Ever After,"
Three years ago, Ms. Fleishman began photographing and interviewing New York couples who had been married for at least 50 years. Through Kickstarter, she is raising money to continue, and she has already surpassed her $15,000 goal. She plans to photograph 15 other elderly couples and turn the series into a book. "We met in 1939 and we didn't have money," Fran Futterman, half of a couple Ms. Fleishman photographed playing their piano side by side, told her. "So we enjoyed each other's company." 
Snap's,
The Courtneys are trying to raise $10,000 by March 12 to get their Chicago-style hot-dog truck on the road; the vehicle will run on the leftover oil from their deep fryer. Donors backing Snap's will be rewarded with certificates for free food, like panko-crusted avocado fries, to be served alongside the Brat Mi, a Vietnamese-style bratwurst sandwich. 
The Harlem Arts Festival
The festival team needs $12,000 by March 18 to produce a free showcase of music, dance, theater and visual art by Harlem artists, to be put on in a park this June. "We want to celebrate the artistic legacy of Harlem by taking a contemporary look at the art that's made here now," Chelsea Goding, the festival's development director, said in its Kickstarter pitch video.
Wonder Threads,
Ms. Rodgers, a fashion designer, is trying to raise $14,000 by March 5 for the materials to make laptop and iPad cases that look like interoffice envelopes and marble composition notebooks.
"Pavilion,"
Mr. Sutton, a filmmaker who founded Video Kid Brooklyn, a digital media arts workshop for New York City youth, got his first feature film accepted into the South by Southwest Film Festival. Called "Pavilion," it is about "the secret lives of teenagers," its Kickstarter page says. Mr. Sutton has already surpassed his goal of $25,000 to promote and color-correct the film, in addition to perfecting the audio.
"Death Boogie,"
The Mighty Third Rail, a trio that mixes hip-hop, poetry, beat-boxing, violin and upright bass, is working with Ms. McGrath, a theater director, to take the production "Death Boogie" to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. They are asking for $20,000 by March 4 to do so.
"American Ecstasy,"
While working in New York as a set photographer for pornographic movies in the 1980s, Ms. Nitke captured the reality behind the fantasy: the male hunks yawning between takes, the bored eyes of starlets surrounded by dildos, the sudden shifts from camera-ready ecstasy to tired desensitization. She is trying to raise $25,000 to create and distribute "American Ecstasy," a memoir of what she calls "the golden age of porn."
"Heavenly Sight," 
The groups are seeking $18,000 to develop a living-history Web site on blind musicians to complement a Black History Month radio special. If financed, heavenlysight8.org will be developed, based on guidelines from the National Federation of the Blind and the Perkins School for the Blind, to be easier for the vision-impaired to use.
"It Rides Upon Us,"
Mr. Goodwin photographed rural and urban decay alongside Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line between Washington and New York City. He already surpassed his (very precise) goal of $1,776 and will use the money to take more photos along the tracks, then design and produce a book of his photos and accompanying vignettes. The inspiration for the book's title comes from a Henry David Thoreau quotation: "We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us"
"Crazy and Proud,"
In 1999, Lowell Handler, who has Tourette's syndrome, began teaching photography to mentally ill women at a city shelter. He has already reached his $3,300 goal and will use all the money he raises by his deadline - Saturday night - to make an e-book of the photographs taken by these women, accompanied by audio interviews he conducted with them. 
"I found that these women in these shelters were taking better photographs than the students I taught in colleges," Mr. Handler said. The students "knew a little about photography, but they knew nothing about life," he said, adding, "The women knew nothing about photography, but they knew everything about life."

HEADLINE: Court Overturns Conviction of Ex-Goldman Programmer

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A federal appeals court reversed the conviction late Thursday of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer found guilty of stealing proprietary code from the bank's high-frequency trading platform. 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court reversed the conviction late Thursday of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer found guilty of stealing proprietary code from the bank's high-frequency trading platform.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the conviction and ordered the trial court to enter a judgment of acquittal. A judgment of acquittal generally bars the government from retrying a defendant.
The reversal was without explanation; it said an opinion would follow "in due course." 
 The appeals court ruling came just hours after a three-judge panel heard oral arguments on Mr. Aleynikov's appeal. Mr. Aleynikov, who was convicted in December 2010, is serving an eight-year sentence at a federal prison in Fort Dix, N.J.
"We are pleased and gratified that the court of appeals has roundly rejected the government's attempt to rewrite the federal criminal laws," said Kevin Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer. "Mr. Aleynikov spent a year in prison and suffered many other losses as a result of these unjust charges, but he never lost faith in his ability to win an acquittal. This is a wonderful day in his life."
Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, declined to comment.
The reversal deals a major blow to the Justice Department, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a top priority. This case tested the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act, a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. Federal prosecutors held up the arrest of Mr. Aleynikov as an example of the government's crackdown on employees who steal valuable and proprietary information from their employers.
The decision is also a loss for Goldman Sachs, which reported Mr. Aleynikov to federal authorities after it accused him of stealing computer code. The bank had portrayed itself as the victim of a brazen crime.
A crucial issue in the appeal -- and a main focus of Thursday's oral argument -- was whether Mr. Aleynikov's actions constituted a crime under the statutory language of the Economic Espionage Act. The debate centered on whether Goldman's high frequency trading system was a "product produced for interstate commerce" within the meaning of the law.
Lawyers for Mr. Aleynikov argued that the bank's trading platform was built for internal use and never placed in the stream of commerce. The government countered that the high-frequency trading system, which Goldman used to trade in markets around the globe, was clearly produced for interstate and foreign commerce.
Mr. Aleynikov's arrest in 2009 drew attention to a new and lucrative corner of Wall Street. High-frequency trading uses complex computer algorithms to make rapid trades that exploit tiny price discrepancies. The trading became a substantial source of revenue at banks and hedge funds, and these companies vigilantly guard the code underpinning their trading strategies.
Armed with a degree in computer programming, Mr. Aleynikov came to the United States from Russia in 1990. His services were in demand at Goldman, which paid him $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers.
He was lured away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a new firm run by an executive from the Citadel Investment Group, a giant Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay about triple what he made at Goldman.
During his last final days at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov uploaded source code to a server in Germany that allowed him to do an end run around the company's security systems. He was arrested shortly thereafter.
At trial, Mr. Marino, the lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, acknowledge that his client breached Goldman's confidentiality agreements, but insisted that he did not commit a crime.
Federal prosecutors portrayed Mr. Aleynikov as a thief who stole Goldman's closely guarded code to help his new employer. After a two-week trial, the jury deliberated for just three hours before reaching a unanimous guilty verdict.
The ruling is the second time in as many months that the Federal Appeals Court in Manhattan has overturned a conviction secured by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. In January, the appeals court reversed the conviction of Joseph P. Collins, a former outside lawyer to Refco, the collapsed brokerage firm, citing judicial error.

TOP STORIES 
Court Overturns Conviction of Ex-Goldman Programmer | A federal appeals court reversed the conviction late Thursday of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer found guilty of stealing proprietary code from the bank's high-frequency trading platform.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the conviction and ordered the trial court to enter a judgment of acquittal. A judgment of acquittal generally bars the government from retrying a defendant.
The reversal deals a major blow to the Justice Department, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a top priority. This case tested the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act, a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. Federal prosecutors held up the arrest of Mr. Aleynikov as an example of the government's crackdown on employees who steal valuable and proprietary information from their employers.

It is the latest twist in one of the more bizarre chapters of the government's years-long investigation. Mr. Kinnucan is the most recent individual charged in the government's wide-ranging case, which has resulted in 60 convictions and guilty pleas.

HEADLINE: For Mexico City, a Repurposed Landfill

BYLINE: ELISABETH MALKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Methane from a landfill will flow to a power plant, helping to keep the lights on in the city. 

 BODY:
In developing countries, closing a landfill often means just that: locking the gate and walking away. 
But when Mexico City's government shut down the giant Bordo Poniente landfill last December, officials announced that they had a full-blown plan for the site. As I wrote on Friday in The New York Times, the city aims to capture the methane gas produced by the landfill to fuel a power plant that could supply electricity to as many as 35,000 homes. 
If all the pieces fall into place, Mexico City could be a model for other large cities in the developing world that are studying ways to manage their landfills effectively, said Karen Luken, the global waste director for the C40 Clinton Climate Initiative, a joint program of Bill Clinton and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. 
"When you talk to a place like Jakarta, they can't even put their arms around it," she said of the Indonesian capital.
Some 79 million tons of garbage have been dumped on the 927-acre site of the so-called fourth stage of Bordo Poniente since it opened in 1994. (The earlier stages have long been shut down.) 
As organic waste in a landfill breaks down, it produces landfill gas, a mix of methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor. Methane is over 20 times more effective in trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide is over the course of a century, so action to reduce such emissions can have a significant impact on greenhouse gases over all. 
In Mexico City, officials estimate that Bordo Poniente produces as much as 20 percent of the city's heat-trapping emissions. Converting its methane to fuel a power plant will reduce annual emissions in the initial years by the equivalent of two million tons of carbon dioxide, Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said. 
The energy from the power plant will help cover the costs of shutting down Bordo Poniente, which will cost $100 million to $200 million, said Ms. Luken, who advised Mexico City on the project. 
Not only will the energy project generate revenue through electricity sales, but it will be eligible to receive carbon credits as a result of the emissions reduction. The Mexican federal government, which pushed the city to shut down Bordo Poniente, has also allocated money for the project. 
Still, the details may prove a challenge In the United States, where there are more than 550 different kinds of projects to use landfill gas, the supply of gas is more constant. Typically, operators build cells for a landfill, close them and then move on to the next one, Ms. Luken. said. 
But because the entire Bordo Poniente landfill was closed at once, methane production is expected to peak after three years and then drop off gradually. "It was never designed for landfill gas management," she said. 
The plant will have a generating capacity of 35.6 megawatts during the first five years of operation and supply power for up to 35,000 households at its peak before falling off. Even though the plant has limited output, "every indication is that it should make economic sense," Ms. Luken said. 
 At times, forging a consensus among the city's government's competing authorities has been complicated, with someone always wanting to have the last word, said Ms. Luken, who worked with the city for three years. "You have to have a garbage czar," she said.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: To the Airwaves

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Congress proposes auctioning off airwaves to pay for benefits, New Jersey lawmakers vote to legalize same-sex marriage and a House hearing continues the debate on insurance coverage for contraceptives. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
Looking for a way to partly cover the extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits, Congress has turned to auctioning off public airwaves. Now used for television broadcasts, they would be used to create more wireless Internet systems and a nationwide emergency network, Edward Wyatt and Jennifer Steinhauer report.

        
The New Jersey Assembly passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage on Thursday, but now advocates of the measure are facing another hurdle: collecting enough votes to override the veto Gov. Chris Christie has said he will employ, Kate Zernike reports.

        
Political theater and religious soul-searching mixed Thursday in a House hearing about President Obama's plan to provide free insurance coverage of contraceptives. Robert Pear reports on the continued debate over the policy and the administration's compromise.

        
The warm, behind-the-scenes friendship between Mitt Romney and Representative Ron Paul of Texas stands out in the midst of a bitter nominating fight. But what remains to be seen is whether that relationship could help Mr. Romney as the contest drags on, Richard A. Oppel Jr. reports.

        
Although President Obama has made the Buffett Rule a staple of his economic discussions, the rule is actually more of a "guideline" than a legislative initiative, the White House says. The rule that would make millionaires pay higher taxes is absent from the president's latest budget proposal, further designating it as a piece of election-year rhetoric, Annie Lowrey reports.

        
With the Michigan primary approaching, Rick Santorum faced the challenge of explaining his opposition to the auto industry's bailout by attacking Mr. Romney for being inconsistent: While Mr. Romney may have also opposed that particular bailout, he supported the Wall Street one, Mr. Santorum pointed out. Richard A. Oppel Jr. reports on the battle for Michigan.
Washington Happenings:

        
Mr. Obama will discuss American manufacturing and the economy at a Boeing facility in Everett, Wash., on Friday. Later, he will attend campaign events.

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the vice president of China, Xi Jinping, will be in Los Angeles, where they will visit a school and attend a luncheon given by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.

HEADLINE: Government Dealt Setback in Case Against Ex-Goldman Programmer

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: In a blow to the Justice Department's crackdown on intellectual property theft, a federal appeals court reversed the conviction of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer. 

 BODY:
Since his arrest nearly three years ago, Sergey Aleynikov, a former programmer at Goldman Sachs, has acknowledged violating the bank's confidentiality policy by downloading source code from company computers.
He also insisted that it was not a criminal act.
A federal appeals court has now agreed with Mr. Aleynikov, issuing a ruling late Thursday that not only reversed his conviction but also mandated an acquittal, resulting in his release from prison on Friday afternoon.
 "Justice occasionally works," said an emotional Mr. Aleynikov, who appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday afternoon sporting a prison-issued gray sweat suit. He had served one year of an eight-year sentence at a federal penitentiary in Fort Dix, N.J.
The reversal deals a major blow to the Justice Department, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a main concern. It is also a loss for Goldman Sachs, which reported Mr. Aleynikov to federal authorities after it accused him of stealing computer code. The bank had portrayed itself as the victim of a brazen crime.
The unusual decision from a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit came just hours after hearing his lawyer, Kevin Marino, argue his appeal. On Friday, after a request from prosecutors, the appeals court dialed back its ruling, revoking its mandate that the trial court judge issue an acquittal. That could allow the government to appeal the Second Circuit's decision by requesting that the entire panel of appeals court judges review the case.
Chief Judge Dennis G. Jacobs issued a terse one-paragraph order without explanation, saying only that an opinion would follow "in due course."
A spokesman for the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.
Legal experts said that the ruling strongly suggested that the written opinion from the highly influential Second Circuit court would be a significant development in corporate espionage law.
"Given that theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property has been a growing priority for federal prosecutors, the court's forthcoming opinion will be critical for defining the scope of the government's enforcement ability in this space," said Nicholas S. Goldin, a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who served as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where he worked on these types of cases.
The Aleynikov case has tested the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. At the time of his conviction, Mr. Aleynikov was held up by federal prosecutors as an example of the government's crackdown on employees who steal valuable information - especially in digital form - from their employers.
Early this decade, the Justice Department formed computer hacking and intellectual property units, or CHIP units, at United States attorney's offices around the country to fight a spike in intellectual-property theft and cybercrime. During the 2010 fiscal year, the F.B.I. opened at least 190 intellectual-property crime investigations, 66 of which concerned trade-secret theft.
Members of the white-collar criminal-defense bar have criticized the Justice Department's aggressive stance toward prosecuting corporate espionage, arguing that victims like Goldman can seek suitable remedies in civil court.
A crucial issue on Mr. Aleynikov's appeal - and a main focus of the judges during the oral argument on Thursday - was whether his actions constituted a crime under the statutory language of the Economic Espionage Act. The judges homed in on whether Goldman's high-frequency trading system, and the code upon which it was built, was a "product produced for interstate commerce" within the meaning of the statute.
Mr. Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer, argued that the trading system housed on Goldman's computer servers was not produced for commerce because Goldman never licensed or sold the system and had no intention of doing so. Goldman's trading system, he argued, was built for internal use and was not a tangible item of property distributed and used by the commercial public.
A government lawyer countered that the trading system had obvious connections to interstate commerce, because Goldman used to it buy and sell stocks and bonds across global markets.
Mr. Aleynikov's odyssey through the criminal justice system began on July 3, 2009, when F.B.I. agents arrested him as he stepped off a flight at Newark Liberty International Airport.
The government accused Mr. Aleynikov of stealing Goldman's proprietary "black box" computer code that the bank used to make rapid-fire trades across global markets. Mr. Aleynikov was criminally charged with violating two laws: the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act.
His case highlighted a new and lucrative corner of Wall Street. High-frequency trading uses complex computer algorithms to make thousands of lightning-fast trades that exploit tiny price discrepancies. The trading became a substantial source of revenue at banks and hedge funds, which vigilantly guard the code underpinning their lucrative trading strategies.
Mr. Aleynikov, 42 years old and a resident of North Caldwell, N.J., came to the United States from Russia in 1990, with a degree in computer programming. He joined Goldman in May 2007 and was paid $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers.
After a little more than two years at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov was lured away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a new firm run by a former senior executive at the Citadel Investment Group, a large Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay Mr. Aleynikov about triple his Goldman salary.
Before leaving Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov downloaded the bank's secret source code to his home computer, his laptop and a memory device. Goldman caught Mr. Aleynikov after noticing a surge of data leaving its servers and reported the violation to criminal authorities.
During a two-week trial in December 2010, the government depicted Mr. Aleynikov as an evil, greedy computer scientist who had masterminded a hacking scheme that could potentially earn his new employer millions of dollars.
Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer acknowledged that his client should not have lifted source code from Goldman, but argued that it was not a criminal case and his client never intended to harm the bank.
A jury convicted Mr. Aleynikov after three hours of deliberation.
But on Friday at 6 a.m., Mr. Aleynikov opened his prison-monitored e-mail account at Fort Dix to find a two-word message from his lawyer: "We won."
Standing by his client after Friday's court hearing, Mr. Marino railed against the government's case.
"This was a radical exaggeration of the breadth of the criminal laws and a wrongheaded prosecution that should never have been brought," the lawyer said.
Mr. Aleynikov said he had barely had time to think about the future, but was excited to see his three young children, ages 8, 6 and 3. And though overjoyed with his win on appeal, he was measured about the future.
"In prison you learn to appreciate your life day by day," he said. "Today is a victory, but tomorrow you never know."

HEADLINE: Behind a White House Pivot on China

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: One of the striking aspects of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s critical public comments this week to Xi Jinping, the likely next leader of China, was how they contrasted with the Obama administration's typical approach to China. 

 BODY:
 One of the striking aspects of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s critical public comments this week to Xi Jinping, the likely next leader of China, was how they contrasted with the Obama administration's typical approach to China.
 As James Fallows, who knows a thing or two about China, wrote in his recent Atlantic cover article assessing President Obama's first term, the administration has generally combined "a low-key demeanor" in public with clear, frequent messages in private about American priorities. Mr. Fallows concludes:
The strategy was Sun Tzu-like in its patient pursuit of an objective: re-establishing American hard and soft power while presenting a smiling "We welcome your rise!" face to the Chinese. "It was as decisive a diplomatic victory as anyone is likely to see," Walter Russell Mead, of Bard College, often a critic of the administration, wrote.
So why would the administration now change tactics if the old one seemed to be working? Two possibilities seem most plausible.
One, it's an election year. Jeffrey A. Bader of the Brookings Institution, who previously had the China dossier on Mr. Obama's National Security Council, made this point to my colleague Mark Landler earlier this week. With Mr. Obama being attacked by Republicans for being too soft on China - and with many Americans blaming China for some of the economy's problems - a low-key approach to China creates political problems. 
Two, the administration may be worried that the earlier strategy is running its course. As I mentioned in an article this week on the economic relationship between the United States and China, the Obama administration has had some success in persuading Chinese leaders to raise the value of the renminbi, which has helped American exporters. Recently, however, the pace of renminbi appreciation has slowed:
This chart shows the change in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate over the previous 13 weeks, which is roughly three months. The pace of appreciation peaked in late 2010 - coincidentally or not, shortly after a September 2010 trip that Lawrence H. Summers and Thomas E. Donilon, top White House officials, took to Beijing, in part to lobby China on the exchange rate. The rate slowed in early 2011 and has slowed further in the last few months. 
Is it possible that the White House feels the need to get a bit more outwardly aggressive with Beijing?
(A technical note: The chart here shows the exchange rate without taking the differing inflation rates in the two countries into account. Taking inflation into account - which produces the best measure - would show faster appreciation over the last year and a half but would still show the pace to have slowed recently.)

HEADLINE: Feb. 17, 1972 | Nixon Departs for Diplomatic Trip to China

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Feb. 17, 1972, President Richard Nixon departed on his historic trip to China, where he met with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai in an attempt to normalize relations between the two countries. 

 BODY:
On Feb. 17, 1972, President Richard Nixon departed on his historic trip to China, where he met with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai in an attempt to normalize relations between the two countries.
The New York Times said that as many as 8,000 congressmen, government officials, newsmen and schoolchildren gathered at the White House lawn to bid Nixon farewell. The president told the crowd, "If we can make progress toward that goal on this trip, the world will be a much safer world, and the chance particularly for all of those young children over there to grow up in a world of peace will be infinitely greater."

Nixon was known for his anti-Communist politics. While serving in Congress, he was part of a lobby that urged President Harry Truman not to establish diplomatic relations with Mao's Communist government after it took over China in 1949. China fought American troops during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, after which the United States implemented a trade embargo and pledged its support to the Chinese government-in-exile in Taiwan.
Relations between the United States and China remained hostile over the next two decades. However, in the 1960s, China began to distance itself from its Communist ally the Soviet Union, leading to border clashes in 1969. Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, saw an opportunity to play China and the Soviet Union off each other to improve relations with each country.
In April 1971, China invited the United States ping-pong team to play in China, marking the first time that Americans had been invited to Communist China. Dr. Kissinger traveled secretly to China that July and met with Zhou Enlai to prepare for a potential presidential visit. On July 15, after Dr. Kissinger's return to Washington, Nixon announced that he would be visiting China the following year.
Nixon's anti-Communist reputation allowed him to reach out to Communist countries without appearing "soft" on their ideologies and policies. The Times noted that he was the first president to visit a Communist country -- Romania -- in 1969 and that he would be the first president to visit China and later Moscow.
Nixon arrived in Beijing on Feb. 21 and met with the aging Mao for the first and only time. He spent most of the eight-day trip with Zhou, continuing the negotiations begun by Dr. Kissinger the previous summer. On the final day of the trip, Nixon and Zhou released the Shanghai Communique, in which the two countries pledged to pursue normalization of relations and the development of trade. However, the communique made little attempt to resolve the issue of Taiwan.
In the years after Nixon's visit, the United States and China have opened trade and contacts. In 1979, the United States officially broke relations with the Chinese government-in-exile and established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.
Connect to Today:
In a 2011 Op-Ed for The Times, two career diplomats, former Ambassadors William H. Luers and Thomas R. Pickering, said President Obama could learn from Nixon's dealings with China in his approach toward Iran. They write that only Mr. Obama "can lead the United States to agreements with Iran that advance American national interests."
Consider, too, the authors' final argument: "There is no guarantee that diplomacy will succeed. But that is also true of war. And only diplomacy can offer Iran's current rulers a stake in building a secure future without a nuclear bomb. Only diplomacy can achieve America's major objectives while avoiding the mistakes committed in Iraq or Vietnam."
In what ways are United States-Iran relations today similar to those between the United States and China in the early 1970s? How are they different? In your opinion, does the United States run the risk of repeating mistakes committed in previous conflicts? Do you agree that United States foreign policy should rely more on diplomacy than military force? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: How the Economy Looks From the White House

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The Council of Economic Advisers has released its annual report, and its chairman says the recovery is gaining momentum more quickly than was expected even recently. 

 BODY:
Today, the White House released its annual economic report of the president, a ranging overview of how President Obama and his Council of Economic Advisers view the economy - everything from housing policies to the aging of the workforce to the debt crisis in Europe. 
In a call with reporters, Alan Krueger, the chairman of the council, said the recovery had been strengthening even faster than he and other economists expected recently and the report notes that the "sharp drop" in unemployment this winter took them "by surprise." 
For that reason, he said, the report's forecast of the unemployment rate in 2012 and beyond was out of date, given that it was made in November. But the council did update its estimates of job growth to account for the recovery's recent strength. It expects the economy to create 167,000 jobs a month in 2012, up from 146,000 a month in 2011.
Mr. Krueger also highlighted some counterintuitive parts of the council's analysis. 
The report stresses the dismal condition of the labor market and anemic job growth during the recovery. But in some ways, Mr. Krueger said, the recession was less severe than economists might have predicted. 
 "Growth in private nonfarm jobs in the current recovery began nine months after the business-cycle trough," the report says. "By comparison, payrolls first began expanding consistently 12 months into the 1990-91 recovery, and sustained private-sector job growth in the 2001 recovery did not begin until 21 months after the official end date of the recession."
Referring to the stimulus bill as well as the extraordinary actions taken by the Federal Reserve, the report adds: "As bad as the Great Recession was, the United States appears to have fared relatively better than other countries that have experienced severe financial crises, in large part because of the emergency actions that were taken to strengthen the economy and stabilize the financial system."

HEADLINE: The Options for Payment Reform in U.S. Health Care

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: No simple method is available for reducing the cost of health care, and the various payment methods each have strengths and weaknesses, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
Over the years, both experience and empirical research have taught policy makers around the globe that how money enters the health system - and how much enters - has a powerful influence over the shape and modus operandi of health care delivery.
It is therefore not surprising that "payment reform" has become the new battle cry in the United States, as the nation seeks better control over the annual increases in health spending per capita. 
So, what choices do policy makers have in payment reform? 
It is useful to go back to basics. Any payment system for health care has several dimensions:
1. The "base" upon which prices are defined and paid.
2. The level of the payment per unit of the chosen base.
3. The administrative and economic process by which that price level is determined.

The chart below focuses on the first and third of these dimensions. The columns describe the main bases in the menu; the rows describe the methods by which price levels are determined. The second dimension - that is, the "right" level of payment - is highly debated. From society's perspective, economists would define that level as the minimum that must be paid to elicit from the providers of health care the supply of health care goods and services that society wishes to have and is willing to pay for. 
By far the most prevalent payment base around the world has been and continues to be the piece-rate method base as fee for services, or F.F.S. 
A major advantage asserted for F.F.S. is that it rewards providers of health care in direct proportion to the number and type of services they render - what is called "productivity." A second advantage is that by its very nature F.F.S. forces the providers of care to describe in detail what services they have delivered to patients. It lays bare what goes on, or at least what is reported to go on, in the provider's practice.
A major disadvantage of F.F.S. is the strong financial incentives it creates to prescribe for and deliver to patients more health care than may be clinically warranted by best-practice standards.
Furthermore, if the profit margin implicit in the level of a fee for a service and the cost of producing the underlying service varies significantly across services - as in practice it generally does - then these profit margins may distort the mix of services going into medical treatments away from best clinical practice. 
Finally, the F.F.S. system enables the much-deplored fragmentation of health care suspected of yielding substandard overall quality of medical treatments and excessive costs. 
Bundled payments per episode of illness, the next payment base in the chart, are thought to mitigate the disadvantages ascribed to F.F.S. 
The idea here is that expert clinicians use evidence-based, best clinical practices to compose the bundle of distinct goods and services that should go into the treatment of a given medical condition. There should then be one single payment made - the so-called bundled payment - for the entire package of these goods and services. There would, of course, have to be an organization at the receiving end of the payment capable of coordinating the entire treatment and distributing the bundled payment among the various participants in the treatment. 
The theory driving bundled payments is that, given the payment, the various providers of health care involved in the treatment of a given medical condition - e.g., a hip replacement or a coronary artery bypass graft - will naturally be driven to seek the most cost-effective treatment package. 
By "cost effective" is meant the total cost incurred to achieve a given clinical outcome from a treatment - for example, a change in life expectancy or in "quality-adjusted life years," known as QALYs (pronounced KWAH-lees). The QALY is a metric based on life expectancy, with each year adjusted by a multiplier ranging from 0, for death, to 1, for perfect health, for the health status experienced in that year (as I discuss in Pages 519-25 of this paper). 
An added advantage attributed to bundled payments is that they automatically force our health care delivery system to change from its current fragmented organization toward clinically integrated health care, generally thought to yield health care of superior quality (and often lower costs). 
To health-policy analysts and the policy makers they advise, and many clinicians as well, the concept of bundled payments has enormous intuitive appeal. Not surprisingly, then, bundled payments have become the latest nouvelle vague in this arena. 
On the way from concept to implementation, however, bundled payments have to run, first, the gantlet of health care providers, not all of whom gain in the switch to bundled payments from F.F.S., and, second, the gantlet of political partisanship. (Because bundled payments are so enthusiastically endorsed now and yet face these serious obstacles, I shall return to them in the future.)
Capitation is the third base upon which payment to providers of care can be made. This concept is particularly suited to nonepisodic, chronic care. 
Under capitation, an organization - for example, a large, multispecialty medical group or a staff-model health maintenance organization such as Kaiser Permanente in California - willing to coordinate all care an individual may need during an entire year against a prepaid flat capitation receives a payment that is adjusted for the expected, actuarial risk of the patient.
Subsequent to receipt of that payment, the paid organization is expected to assume financial risk for the care actually needed by the covered individual. In extraordinary circumstances that could not have been actuarially foreseen, there may have to be ex-post risk-adjustment payment.
Annual salaries for health personnel, including physicians, and predetermined budgets for institutions are the final base upon which payment can be made for health care. 
Budgets for institutions, including nursing homes and hospitals, have been widely used around the world, but less so in the United States. 
Health personnel other than physicians have traditionally been salaried everywhere. Hospital-based physicians are salaried in many countries and increasingly in the United States, where physicians have switched from self-employment to being employees of hospitals, academic health centers, clinics or large group practices.
Salaried physicians almost always receive their payments from an institution (e.g., hospitals or a clinic) that acts as an intermediary between insurance carriers and patients, on the one hand, and physicians on the other. These institutions may be paid by any of the other payment bases in the chart, and frequently by F.F.S.
When physicians are in the employ of hospitals, the hospitals have far more control of the costs they incur over the signature of physicians ordering hospital services than hospitals have under the traditional American system, in which self-employed physicians have affiliations with hospitals that they can view as rent-free workshops 
In that system, the order entry of self-employed physicians attending their hospitalized patients causes the hospital to incur costs over which they have little or no control, while the physicians initiating these costs have typically not been held formally accountable for them. From a managerial perspective, it is an awkward arrangement (see "Hospital Economics 101").
While F.F.S. payment is generally thought to result in overuse and misuse of health care services, bundled payments, capitation, budgets or physician salaries carry with them the risk that clinically desirable services are withheld from patients for financial reasons or simply because exertion is not rewarded. 
Therefore, these methods must be accompanied by some means to protect patients from these untoward effects through constant monitoring of the care rendered.
During the 1990s, for example, California experimented widely with capitation - alas, with mixed results. As the California HealthCare Foundation has noted, capitation methods must be accompanied by constant monitoring of the care rendered, to protect patients from these untoward effects. Actually, the same is true for all payment methods, including F.F.S.
Indeed, anyone who thinks for a moment about the problem of paying the providers of health care will quickly come to the disheartening conclusion that there is no ideal method of injecting money into the health care system. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses that must be traded off against one another in settling on a payment option. 
In my next post, I shall examine the alternative methods of determining the level of payment per unit of whatever base for payment is chosen. Here, too, the choice of method is not obvious. Each method has strengths and weaknesses.

HEADLINE: Young Mothers Describe Marriage's Fading Allure

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
LORAIN, Ohio -- Marriage has lost its luster in Lorain, Ohio.
Sixty-three percent of all births to women under 30 in Lorain County occur outside marriage, according to Child Trends, a research center in Washington. That figure has risen by more than two-thirds over the past two decades, and now surpasses the national figure of 53 percent.
The change has transformed life in Lorain, a ragged industrial town on Lake Erie. Churches perform fewer weddings. Applications for marriage licenses are down by a third. Just a tenth of the students at the local community college are married, but its campus has a bustling day care center. 
The New York Times interviewed several dozen people in Lorain about marriage here. What follows are their stories.
Young parents spoke of an economy that was fundamentally different from in their parents' time, and that required more than a high school education for fathers to be stable breadwinners. They talked of how little they trusted each other to be reliable mates, and of how the government safety net encourages poor parents to stay single.
Tony Cruz, a father of two, has felt the effects of Lorain's economic decline first hand. His father, a high school graduate, worked at a steel plant and provided middle-class trappings like a house and a car for his family. Mr. Cruz, 31, with the same level of education, has done mostly seasonal work in construction and repair, as factory jobs, far fewer than in his father's day, have been hard to come by.
Now unemployed, he is taking a class at Lorain County Community College, whose main campus is in nearby Elyria. Mr. Cruz, who has never married, got custody of his children after their mother developed a drug habit. He spends his days driving them to school and his girlfriend -- who is not their mother -- to her job at a flower shop.
''You feel really low when you can't help your family out,'' Mr. Cruz said. He said he would not consider working in a fast food restaurant or a store because the wages are much lower than in construction.
Joblessness and run-ins with the law are so prevalent among young men in Lorain that many women interviewed said they had given up on finding a suitable mate. Angel Ives, a nursing student at the community college, said she did not want to bring another man into her family after her daughter's father, a groundskeeper for sports fields, was jailed on assault charges. Ms. Ives, 32, works in a nursing home while attending college, and said she was too tired to date. She jokes that her idea of a perfect suitor is someone who will come to her house to baby-sit while she naps.
''A baby makes a woman grow up, but not a man,'' she said. ''I can't imagine ever depending on a man. I don't trust them.''
Older residents blamed the decline in marriage on government aid. Mary Grasso, a retired sweet shop owner, said men had stopped taking responsibility for their children because the state had stepped in with safety net programs. Ms. Grasso, 70, experienced the decline in weddings directly: Wedding cake orders fell by half during the 30-plus years she was in business.
''It's too easy for them,'' she said of young people. ''There are no restrictions anymore. And we are taking care of all of these children.''
Many women described a lifestyle of dating in which relationships sometimes resulted in children, but less often in fathers deeply involved in their families. Judge David Basinski of Lorain County Domestic Relations Court, in Elyria, said he recently had a case in which a man who had nine children by six women owed $55,000 in back child support. Child support cases have become so common among unmarried parents that the court now gives seminars on parental responsibilities.
''For a long time I believed it was happening among people who didn't have that much money,'' he said of the trend toward births outside marriage. ''But now we are moving to a much broader category.''
Several married people who were interviewed said they had wed later in life, often after having children. Pamela Noble-Garner, a nursing home worker who is taking stenography classes at the community college, said she married for the first time at age 37, years after having two children by two men. Her husband, a prison guard, is involved in the lives of his own previous children, a quality that drew her to him. Ms. Noble-Garner, who grew up as one of six siblings in a household run by a single mother, said her father was rarely in her life, an absence she regrets
''We can all stick our chests out and say, 'We don't need no man to raise our babies,' '' Ms. Noble-Garner said. ''I would honestly tell them, 'Honey, yes you do. You might not need him financially, but your baby needs a father.' ''

HEADLINE: Thinking Outside the Redbox

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
BELLEVUE, Wash. -- To many people, the coffee dispensed by vending machines is a sour brew, forever associated with jury duty waiting rooms and bowling alleys.
But Coinstar, which has become a force in self-service retailing through the swift rise of Redbox, its movie rental subsidiary, hopes to change that. When a visitor to its headquarters here dips a credit card into a coffee machine in the company cafeteria, the machine grinds a batch of beans and dribbles out a $1 cup of fresh coffee that tastes pretty close to a cup from any upscale coffee bar.
The machine is the latest bet by Coinstar, which is best known for its Redbox kiosks that have become nearly inescapable in some parts of the country. More than 35,000 of the bright red machines are tucked into corners of Walmarts, McDonald's outlets and drugstores. Its $1.20-a-night DVD rentals made it into the biggest renter of home videos in the United States and helped drive many Blockbuster stores out of business.
Those cheap rentals also turned Redbox into one of Hollywood's boogeymen who, along with Netflix, were blamed for accelerating the decline of home video sales. Faced with the prospect that online movie watching will eventually replace physical discs, Redbox last week banded together with Verizon Communications to form a service that combines DVD and streaming movie options. 
Redbox's profile has largely overshadowed its parent company's broader ambitions to reinvent vending machines by applying them to new categories of retailing, as well as old ones like coffee. In an interview at the company's headquarters, Paul Davis, chief executive of Coinstar, said there was great convenience in self-service kiosks because of how widely they can be placed in grocery stores and other locations.
''Consumers love it because they don't have a lot of time on their hands,'' Mr. Davis, 54, said over coffee dispensed by the new vending machine in Coinstar's cafeteria. ''We try to be where the consumer goes everyday.''
Until Redbox took off, Coinstar was known for its namesake coin-counting kiosks, more than 20,000 of which are now installed inside grocery and other retail chains. The company was founded just over two decades ago by Jens Molbak, who as a Stanford University graduate student realized there wasn't an easy way to spend the spare change piled up in a jar on top of his dresser. Coinstar converts change into cash or store vouchers, earning a transaction fee in the process.
The coffee kiosks are the first of what Coinstar expects to be a wave of new vending machines from the company. It is testing the machines in locations around the country and expects to have about 500 installed by the end of the year.
Mr. Davis envisions the 3-foot-by-3-foot kiosks going into supermarkets, gas stations and office buildings, though he does not see a need for them in retail locations that already have a small Starbucks or some other coffee chain. Coinstar joined with Starbucks on the kiosks, which are labeled with the company's Seattle's Best Coffee brand.
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he believed the coffee kiosks represented a meaningful growth market for Coinstar. ''The retailer relationship is their biggest competitive advantage,'' Mr. Pachter said. ''If every place has a coin box, they know how to get another 12 square feet.''
A kiosk concept Coinstar is experimenting with in about eight retail locations in Texas and California is called Gizmo, through which it sells used video game consoles, iPads and other electronics. Many of the items in the kiosks are refurbished by a manufacturer or another party with prices that are up to half off retail, Mr. Davis said.
Other concepts it is testing include ecoATM, a kiosk created by a start-up Coinstar invested in that allows consumers to trade in old cellphones and other electronics for cash. The machine uses a camera to evaluate the condition of the devices. Coinstar says the traded-in phones often end up being sold in developing countries, a more environmentally friendly outcome than going to landfills.
Mr. Davis said Coinstar had about eight or nine kiosk ideas in various stages of development, part of an effort it established about 18 months ago. It tests concepts in public locations, often in primitive form and with employees nearby to observe how customers are interacting with them; the early prototypes of Gizmo, for example, were made out of cardboard.
''What we try to do is plant a lot of seeds,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We know the math says only about half are going to work.''
The company will need new kiosk successes as physical movie rentals, its biggest business, face an uncertain future. About 85 percent of Coinstar's $1.85 billion in revenue last year was from Redbox. The number of movies rented in DVD and Blu-ray formats last year in the United States fell by 11 percent from the year before, as chains like Blockbuster closed more bricks-and-mortar stores and viewers switched to online movie watching, according to NPD Group, a research firm in Port Washington, N.Y.
Despite the weakness in the overall rental market, Redbox thrived by gobbling up share from physical stores. Its number of rentals jumped 28 percent in 2011 from 2010. It accounted for 37 percent of physical movie rentals last year, up from 25 percent in 2010, NPD said. Earlier this month, Coinstar made a move to further consolidate its position in physical rental with the proposed acquisition for up to $100 million of the entertainment business of NCR, which operates DVD rental kiosks that use the Blockbuster brand.
Still, analysts say the long-term trend is irreversible: Consumers will increasingly stop renting discs in favor of the convenience of online movie watching. ''Consumers' interest in the DVD medium is going to fall far faster than we think,'' said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research.
Mr. Davis said that the decline in physical rentals would take longer than most expected. He does, however, concede that the decline will come. That is one reason the company worked with Verizon on the venture to create a service combining physical and online movie rentals. Details about the service, which will begin during the second half of the year, are sparse, but it is expected to be a subscription service with a monthly fee, like Netflix.
The online movies licensed by Verizon for the service will most likely consist of older titles because Hollywood studios tend to delay the release of many new films online. Customers will be able to go to Redbox kiosks to get newer movies on disc. Redbox owns 35 percent of the venture, with Verizon owning the remainder.
Some Hollywood studios, though, are trying to make it difficult for Redbox to get fresh movies into its kiosks, out of concern that its dirt-cheap rentals are cutting into home video sales. Several years ago, Redbox sued several of the studios for threatening to withhold DVD supplies for rentals for almost a month after the discs went on sale. In later settlements, Redbox agreed to delay rentals for 28 days in exchange for getting better economic terms from the studios for DVDs.
An agreement with one of those studios, Warner Brothers, expired at the end of January, and Redbox refused to agree to a new deal to delay rentals by 56 days from the date of their DVD release. That, in turn, forced Redbox to get Warner movies from other sources, including the same retail stores where consumers buy DVDs. United States copyright law allows a company like Redbox to rent out movies they buy retail.
Warren Lieberfarb, the former president of Warner's home video division and now a consultant in Los Angeles, said Redbox had largely become an adversary of the studios, which ''completely missed Netflix and Redbox as threats to the business model of people buying'' movies. In a recent research report, Mr. Greenfield, the analyst, called Redbox ''Hollywood Enemy #1.''
Mr. Davis said Redbox had good relationships with most of the studios. ''I think we can always get better,'' he said.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Arrests Man in a Suspected Terrorist Plot Near the U.S. Capitol

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Federal agents on Friday arrested a Moroccan man carrying a MAC-10 gun and a vest packed with nails and what he thought was explosives in what they said was a plan to carry out a suicide bombing at the United States Capitol. 
But the man -- arrested in a parking garage near the Capitol -- never posed a danger. He had been under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and an undercover agent posing as a Qaeda terrorist had given him inoperative weapons.
Court filings and law enforcement officials identified the suspect as Amine El Khalifi, 29. They said he entered the United States in 1999 on a tourist visa and never left. He has been living in Alexandria, Va., and was unemployed, officials said.
''Today's case underscores the continuing threat we face from home-grown violent extremists,'' Lisa Monaco, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's national security division, said in a statement. ''Thanks to a coordinated law enforcement effort, El Khalifi's alleged plot was thwarted before anyone was harmed.''
The arrest was first reported Friday by Fox News, which also said Mr. Khalifi prayed at a mosque in the Washington area before his attempted attack. Law enforcement officials confirmed that account.
A complaint filed against Mr. Khalifi by Steven Hersem, a supervisory F.B.I. special agent, said he had come to the authorities' attention after an informer reported a meeting at a house in Arlington, Va., in January 2011.
The informer said that someone at the meeting produced several guns and declared that the ''war on terrorism'' was a ''war on Muslims,'' and that Mr. Khalifi agreed and said the group needed to be ready for war. It was not clear whether the informant or someone else brought the guns and instigated the discussion.
The complaint says that by December, Mr. Khalifi had decided to carry out an attack and was trying to decide on what. It said he considered a synagogue, high-ranking military officers, a military building and a restaurant. Eventually, it said, he settled on a suicide attack against the Capitol, declaring that he wanted to kill people face to face and hoped 30 people would die.
The complaint says Mr. Khalifi was working with two men he thought were terrorists, but who were in fact an undercover law enforcement agent and another man working for law enforcement in an undisclosed role.
Among other things, the complaint describes a trip Mr. Khalifi is said to have taken to a quarry on Jan. 15 to test the detonation of a bomb with a cellphone, and two recent trips to walk around the grounds of the Capitol. It also describes him walking around a hotel room practicing how to shoot the gun while wearing the vest.
In addition to information supplied by undercover agents, the complaint cited video and audio recordings and other evidence.
The alleged plot was similar to other cases in in which the F.B.I. had secretly worked with people who were said to have indicated a desire to commit an attack, only to arrest them before it could be carried out.

HEADLINE: Unwed Mothers Now a Majority Before Age of 30

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE and SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
LORAIN, Ohio -- It used to be called illegitimacy. Now it is the new normal. After steadily rising for five decades, the share of children born to unmarried women has crossed a threshold: more than half of births to American women under 30 occur outside marriage.
Once largely limited to poor women and minorities, motherhood without marriage has settled deeply into middle America. The fastest growth in the last two decades has occurred among white women in their 20s who have some college education but no four-year degree, according to Child Trends, a Washington research group that analyzed government data.
Among mothers of all ages, a majority -- 59 percent in 2009 -- are married when they have children. But the surge of births outside marriage among younger women -- nearly two-thirds of children in the United States are born to mothers under 30 -- is both a symbol of the transforming family and a hint of coming generational change.
One group still largely resists the trend: college graduates, who overwhelmingly marry before having children. That is turning family structure into a new class divide, with the economic and social rewards of marriage increasingly reserved for people with the most education. 
''Marriage has become a luxury good,'' said Frank Furstenberg, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
The shift is affecting children's lives. Researchers have consistently found that children born outside marriage face elevated risks of falling into poverty, failing in school or suffering emotional and behavioral problems.
The forces rearranging the family are as diverse as globalization and the pill. Liberal analysts argue that shrinking paychecks have thinned the ranks of marriageable men, while conservatives often say that the sexual revolution reduced the incentive to wed and that safety net programs discourage marriage.
Here in Lorain, a blue-collar town west of Cleveland where the decline of the married two-parent family has been especially steep, dozens of interviews with young parents suggest that both sides have a point.
Over the past generation, Lorain lost most of two steel mills, a shipyard and a Ford factory, diminishing the supply of jobs that let blue-collar workers raise middle-class families. More women went to work, making marriage less of a financial necessity for them. Living together became routine, and single motherhood lost the stigma that once sent couples rushing to the altar. Women here often describe marriage as a sign of having arrived rather than a way to get there.
Meanwhile, children happen.
Amber Strader, 27, was in an on-and-off relationship with a clerk at Sears a few years ago when she found herself pregnant. A former nursing student who now tends bar, Ms. Strader said her boyfriend was so dependent that she had to buy his cigarettes. Marrying him never entered her mind. ''It was like living with another kid,'' she said.
When a second child, with a new boyfriend, followed three years later -- her birth control failed, she said -- her boyfriend, a part-time house painter, was reluctant to wed.
Ms. Strader likes the idea of marriage; she keeps her parents' wedding photo on her kitchen wall and says her boyfriend is a good father. But for now marriage is beyond her reach.
''I'd like to do it, but I just don't see it happening right now,'' she said. ''Most of my friends say it's just a piece of paper, and it doesn't work out anyway.''
The recent rise in single motherhood has set off few alarms, unlike in past eras. When Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then a top Labor Department official and later a United States senator from New York, reported in 1965 that a quarter of black children were born outside marriage -- and warned of a ''tangle of pathology''-- he set off a bitter debate.
By the mid-1990s, such figures looked quaint: a third of Americans were born outside marriage. Congress, largely blaming welfare, imposed tough restrictions. Now the figure is 41 percent -- and 53 percent for children born to women under 30, according to Child Trends, which analyzed 2009 data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Still, the issue received little attention until the publication last month of ''Coming Apart,'' a book by Charles Murray, a longtime critic of non-marital births.
Large racial differences remain: 73 percent of black children are born outside marriage, compared with 53 percent of Latinos and 29 percent of whites. And educational differences are growing. About 92 percent of college-educated women are married when they give birth, compared with 62 percent of women with some post-secondary schooling and 43 percent of women with a high school diploma or less, according to Child Trends.
Almost all of the rise in nonmarital births has occurred among couples living together. While in some countries such relationships endure at rates that resemble marriages, in the United States they are more than twice as likely to dissolve than marriages. In a summary of research, Pamela Smock and Fiona Rose Greenland, both of the University of Michigan, reported that two-thirds of couples living together split up by the time their child turned 10.
In Lorain as elsewhere, explanations for marital decline start with home economics: men are worth less they used to be. Among men with some college but no degrees, earnings have fallen 8 percent in the past 30 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while the earnings of their female counterparts have risen by 8 percent.
''Women used to rely on men, but we don't need to anymore,'' said Teresa Fragoso, 25, a single mother in Lorain. ''We support ourselves. We support our kids.''
Fifty years ago, researchers have found, as many as a third of American marriages were precipitated by a pregnancy, with couples marrying to maintain respectability. Ms. Strader's mother was among them.
Today, neither of Ms. Strader's pregnancies left her thinking she should marry to avoid stigma. Like other women interviewed here, she described her children as largely unplanned, a byproduct of uncommitted relationships.
Some unwed mothers cite the failures of their parents' marriages as reasons to wait. Brittany Kidd was 13 when her father ran off with one of her mother's friends, plunging her mother into depression and leaving the family financially unstable.
''Our family life was pretty perfect: a nice house, two cars, a dog and a cat,'' she said. ''That stability just got knocked out like a window; it shattered.''
Ms. Kidd, 21, said she could not imagine marrying her son's father, even though she loves him. ''I don't want to wind up like my mom,'' she said.
Others noted that if they married, their official household income would rise, which could cost them government benefits like food stamps and child care. W. Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist at the University of Virginia, said other government policies, like no-fault divorce, signaled that ''marriage is not as fundamental to society'' as it once was.
Even as many Americans withdraw from marriage, researchers say, they expect more from it: emotional fulfillment as opposed merely to practical support. ''Family life is no longer about playing the social role of father or husband or wife, it's more about individual satisfaction and self-development,'' said Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University.
Money helps explain why well-educated Americans still marry at high rates: they can offer each other more financial support, and hire others to do chores that prompt conflict. But some researchers argue that educated men have also been quicker than their blue-collar peers to give women equal authority. ''They are more willing to play the partner role,'' said Sara McLanahan, a Princeton sociologist.
Reviewing the academic literature, Susan L. Brown of Bowling Green State University recently found that children born to married couples, on average, ''experience better education, social, cognitive and behavioral outcomes.''
Lisa Mercado, an unmarried mother in Lorain, would not be surprised by that. Between nursing classes and an all-night job at a gas station, she rarely sees her 6-year-old daughter, who is left with a rotating cast of relatives. The girl's father has other children and rarely lends a hand.
''I want to do things with her, but I end up falling asleep,'' Ms. Mercado said.

HEADLINE: Santorum's Gospel of Inequality

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
''Santorum Praises Income Inequality.''
That was Fox News's headline about Rick Santorum's speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday. Santorum said, ''I'm not about equality of result when it comes to income inequality. There is income inequality in America. There always has been and, hopefully, and I do say that, there always will be.''
Unbelievable. Maybe not, but stunning all the same. 
Then again, Santorum is becoming increasingly unhinged in his public comments. Last week, he said that the president was arguing that Catholics would have to ''hire women priests to comply with employment discrimination issues.''
Also last week, he suggested that liberals and the president were leading religious people into oppression and even beheadings. I kid you not. Santorum said: ''They are taking faith and crushing it. Why? When you marginalize faith in America, when you remove the pillar of God-given rights, then what's left is the French Revolution. What's left is a government that gives you rights. What's left are no unalienable rights. What's left is a government that will tell you who you are, what you'll do and when you'll do it. What's left in France became the guillotine.''
Yet for Santorum to champion income inequality in Detroit, of all places, is still incredibly tone-deaf.
Detroit has the highest poverty rate of any big city in America, according to data provided by Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College. Among the more than 70 cities with populations over 250,000, Detroit's poverty rate topped the list at a whopping 37.6 percent, more than twice the national poverty rate. And according to the Census Bureau, median household income in Detroit from 2006-10 was just $28,357, which was only 55 percent of the overall U.S. median household income over that time.
This is a city that last year announced plans to close half its public schools and send layoff notices to every teacher in the system.
This is a city where the mayor's pledge to demolish 10,000 abandoned structures was seen as only shaving the tip of the iceberg because, as The Wall Street Journal reported in 2010, ''the city has roughly 90,000 abandoned or vacant homes and residential lots, according to Data Driven Detroit, a nonprofit that tracks demographic data for the city.''
This is not the place to praise income inequality. Last week, at a hearing before the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, the chairman of that committee, laid out the issue as many Americans see it:
''The growing gap between the very wealthy and everyone else has serious ramifications for the country. It hinders economic growth, it undermines confidence in our institutions, and it goes against one of the core ideals of this country -- that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can succeed and leave a better future for your kids and your grandkids.''
This is arguably even more true of people in Michigan than for the rest of us. Even though income inequality in the Detroit area isn't particularly high, looking at the issue as an urban one in the case of cities like Detroit is problematic. The whole region took a hit. The comparison for cities like Detroit may be more intra-city than inter-city.
As Willy Staley argued in 2010 in an online column for Next American City magazine: ''In richer cities, the inequality is put side-by-side, in an uncomfortable, loathsome way; for cities left in the dust of deindustrialization, the inequality is presents (sic) as existing between cities, not within them. Gone is the city/suburb divide between rich and poor, income inequality manifests itself within wealthy cities and between cities.''
And it is this feeling of being left behind by the American economy and abandoned by Republicans that is pushing Michigan into the blue. Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling company, found this week that Obama would handily defeat all the Republican candidates in head-to-head matchups in the state. The company's president, Dean Debnam, said in a statement: ''Michigan is looking less and less like it will be in the swing state column this fall.'' He continued, ''Barack Obama's numbers in the state are improving, while the Republican field is heading in the other direction.''
Santorum went on to say about income inequality during his speech on Thursday: ''We should celebrate like we do in the small towns all across America -- as you do here in Detroit. You celebrate success. You build statues and monuments. Buildings, you name after them. Why? Because in their greatness and innovation, yes, they created wealth, but they created wealth for everybody else. And that's a good thing, not something to be condemned in America.''
Santorum might want to take a walk around Detroit to see who's celebrating and to see how many statues he can find to honor people who simply invented something and got rich.
Furthermore, as a newspaperman and a former Detroiter, I'd like to direct him to the James J. Brady Memorial. Detroit1701.org, maintained by a University of Michigan emeritus professor, calls it ''one of the more attractive memorials in Detroit.'' It pays tribute to Brady, a federal tax collector, who set out to address the issue of child poverty in the city by founding the Old Newsboys' Goodfellows of Detroit Fund in 1914 -- what is essentially a local welfare fund.
The group provides ''warm clothing, toys, books, games and candy'' to local children every Christmas in addition to sending poor children to summer camps, the dentist and to college.
Then again, charitable giving doesn't appear to be high on Motor Mouth Santorum's list of priorities. As The Washington Post pointed out, based on Santorum's tax return disclosure this week, he has given the least amount to charity of the four presidential candidates who have disclosed their tax returns. (Ron Paul has not.) His charitable giving was just 1.8 percent of his adjusted gross income.
The Obamas were the highest, giving 14.2 percent, even though their income was second lowest.
Maybe that's the imbalance we should praise.

HEADLINE: 2 Westerners Are Detained as Protests Continue to Roil Bahrain

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
MANAMA, Bahrain (Reuters) -- An American antiwar activist and another Westerner who were leading a women's protest were detained by the police on Friday. In a separate event, the police deployed water cannons and armored vehicles to crush a demonstration of around 500 Shiites after a funeral. 
Bahrain imposed a security clampdown this week in a bid to avert mass protests on the anniversary of the Feb. 14 pro-democracy uprising last year and to prevent Shiite protesters from reaching Pearl Square, an intersection in the capital that became the focal point of protests.
But activists continued to stage protests in a cat-and-mouse game with the police to press their demand for democratic reforms that would give the elected Parliament power to form governments. Shiites, who make up the majority of the population, complain of political and economic marginalization by the Sunni monarchy, an accusation the government denies.
On Friday, a group of about 150 women, led by the two foreign activists, staged a protest, facing off for several minutes with lines of riot police officers, including a small contingent of women. One of the protest leaders wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ''unarmed civilian.'' Another protester shouted, ''Sunnis, Shiite, brothers.'' The police told them to break up the protest, then used stun grenades and tear gas. One woman was dragged away by women on the police force after she was pepper-sprayed.
''These women are protesting peacefully,'' the American detained, Medea Benjamin, shouted as she was being dragged away. Ms. Benjamin is an observer with a group called Witness Bahrain and a co-founder of the antiwar group Code Pink. In a Twitter post, she said she had been deported. The other woman who was detained gave her name as Elaine Murtagh, an independent Irish-British activist.
At least 10 foreign activists have been deported this week.
Later Friday, hundreds of riot police officers and security forces used armored vehicles, water cannons, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a march of more than 500 people in the Shiite district of Jidhafs, in the capital, Manama. They were chanting against the government.
The march followed the funeral of Hussein al-Baqali, 19. Mr. Baqali died this week from burns sustained in a tire-burning protest by Shiites last month during an air show sponsored by Bahrain's government. His family said he was unable to go to state hospitals for fear of arrest.
Sheik Isa Qassim, the most senior Shiite cleric in Bahrain, said in a sermon that the protest movement would not give up. ''The government's methods will not affect the people's push to get their rights,'' he said Friday.
Sheik Qassim is close to the biggest opposition party, Wefaq, which has begun contacts with a senior official in the ruling Khalifa family on a possible political resolution to a crisis that has paralyzed the tourism and banking hub's economy.
The violence has escalated in the last two months, with a marked rise in the use of gasoline bombs against the police, while the number of dead, many from the effects of tear gas, has risen to around 66, from 35 in June.
Activists accuse the police of using tear gas indiscriminately and sometimes firing the canisters directly at protesters.

HEADLINE: Europe's Woes Are Reflected in Its Trade Numbers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
WORLD trade, which plunged during the credit crisis, has now recovered. Total exports from all countries were higher in 2011 than they were in any previous year.
But the recovery has been uneven. For some emerging countries, the surge in exports since trade hit bottom in late 2009 has been strong. The value of goods exported by India in 2011 was 56 percent higher than it was in the 12 months through October 2008, when world trade peaked before falling rapidly. 
China's exports are about a third higher than they were then, and its imports have risen even more rapidly.
Among the major Western economies, the United States' export performance has been the strongest. It exported $1.481 trillion in goods in 2011, 14 percent higher than in the precrisis period.
That performance enabled the United States to reclaim second place among world exporters in 2011 as it edged past Germany, which had $1.476 trillion in exports. Neither is close to China, whose exports rose to $1.899 trillion.
The accompanying charts show the changes in exports and imports in 12 major countries, including the so-called BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China) as well as the four largest economies in the euro zone (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) and four other major countries (the United States, Britain, Japan and Canada). All figures were converted to dollars.
By that measure, Germany has yet to return to its precrisis level of exports. But measured in its own currency, the euro, exports in 2011 were 11 percent higher than the precrisis peak. The relative weakness of the euro both held down the dollar level of its exports and helped its exporters compete.
While export levels reflect the ability to sell items to other countries, changes in imports are often reflective of the economic health of the countries. For some countries, reduced incomes and difficulty in obtaining credit caused sharp declines in the volume of imported goods.
Nowhere was that truer than in Greece, where imports are a third lower than they were before the crisis and continue to fall. It imported $60.3 million in goods in 2011, its lowest total for any full year since 2005. Greece has never had a strong export sector, and although exports have risen to record levels, the country still imports about twice as much as it exports.
Greece is obviously a special case, but European countries in general have lagged as trade has recovered. In Spain, exports have completely recovered and are about 4 percent higher than at the previous peak, but imports remain 17 percent below precrisis levels. Neither exports nor imports have fully recovered in Britain, France or Italy.

HEADLINE: Europe's Emissions Fee Stirs Talk of Retaliation

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and NICOLA CLARK; Nicola Clark reported from Paris.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- China, the United States and two dozen other countries are looking at coordinated retaliation -- including putting pressure on European airlines and other industries -- if Europe tries to enforce a law requiring airlines to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions.
The system, the European Union's boldest initiative on climate protection to date, has provoked a worldwide outcry and raised the unwelcome prospect of a full-scale trade war. European officials have stood firm while challenging opponents to suggest an equally effective alternative. 
The European system requires an airline landing or taking off in Europe to acquire permits corresponding to the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during the entire flight -- regardless of where it originated or ended or the nationality of the airline. The system went into effect this year, although the first payments will not be due until 2013.
Other governments have objected to Europe's attempt to regulate emissions outside its airspace, while carriers like American Airlines and China Southern are furious because they could face big bills as the number of permits that they need to purchase rises.
In the latest of a series of meetings on the issue, officials from 26 governments will gather in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss a ''basket of countermeasures'' to block the European system, according to the draft agenda.
Those countermeasures include following China's lead in banning its airlines from paying the charges unless and until the Chinese government grants permission; imposing punitive levies on European airlines when they fly over other countries' airspace; reviewing bilateral and ''open skies'' agreements on landing rights, market access and other matters and freezing consideration of any new routes or capacity, according to a draft discussion paper.
In addition, the paper calls on governments to consider reopening trade agreements in sectors other than aviation and to freeze trade negotiations as a way of ''putting pressure on E.U. industries.''
The meeting would ''send a very strong signal to our E.U. friends that other countries are really angry and really preparing something strong,'' said a Chinese diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue.
However, Connie Hedegaard, the European climate commissioner, said Europe would hold firm. In a phone interview on Friday, she noted that the European Union had tried for a decade to achieve a global solution to reducing emissions before passing its own law, and she criticized the governments meeting in Moscow for not coming up with a better plan.
''Our legislation is not going to be changed,'' Ms. Hedegaard said.
Some European officials have suggested recently that parts of the new law could be suspended if there were clear progress this year toward establishing a global system. Those officials said such progress at the International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations, would have to be achieved by the end of the summer for the law to be suspended before the first payments are due on April 30, 2013.
On Friday, Ms. Hedegaard did not discuss the timeline for any possible modification of the European legislation. But any withdrawal of the law ''must be the day where we actually have an agreement and it enters into force,'' she said.
The move by Beijing earlier this month to bar its airlines from participating for now in the European system represents the most direct act of defiance yet. The United States Congress is considering similar measures.
The two-day conference in Moscow aims to adopt a resolution on the countermeasures and invite other countries to sign on.
Experts said the measures under discussion, if enforced, could disrupt the air industry.
The imposition of countermeasures would most likely be felt by consumers in the form of higher airfares and fewer options in terms of routes and frequency of flights to Europe, said John R. Byerly, a former United States deputy assistant secretary of state for transportation affairs who negotiated the 2007 Open Skies agreement with the European Union.
Airlines would lose many of the commercial incentives that were created by the easing of cross-border regulations achieved through bilateral air service agreements over the last few years, Mr. Byerly said.
''These rights are all very tenuous,'' Mr. Byerly said of air service agreements, because governments typically had the power to terminate them with just a few months' notice.
''I think it is unique to aviation to have this potential downward spiral, where you eventually don't have any rights anymore,'' he said. ''And then you have to put the whole thing back together.''
Mr. Byerly cited the decade of stagnation that occurred after France terminated its bilateral air transport agreement with the United States in 1992 in a dispute over market access. It wasn't until 2001 that the two countries reached another full open skies agreement, he said.
The European Union contends that its system is less costly than portrayed by opponents, and would speed up the adoption of greener technologies at a time when air traffic, which represents 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, is growing much faster than gains in efficiency.
The European Commission has been highly critical of the civil aviation organization, the United Nations agency, for failing to move quickly enough to establish standards and goals for greenhouse gases from aviation, as required under the Kyoto climate treaty 15 years ago.
Analysts said the threat of a trade war was real, if not imminent.
''I expect that there will be a moderation'' of the European scheme, said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Mr. Hufbauer predicted that the Europeans would find a way to either increase the share of free emissions permits for this year from 85 percent to as high as 100 percent, or even to push back the deadline for airlines to pay.
''With all of the other much larger problems that Europe is facing right now, I would think they would not want to continue to irritate other countries on this issue,'' Mr. Hufbauer said.
''All of this progress we've made with past agreements on code-sharing and alliances and cross-investment -- that's the way of the future,'' Mr. Hufbauer said. ''If things go forward on the current path, it throws a monkey wrench into all of that.''
Failure to find a compromise would also endanger future international cooperation on climate issues, Mr. Hufbauer said.
''Each side is showing its muscles of what it could do,'' Mr. Byerly said. ''This is going to require give on both sides.''

HEADLINE: Markets, on Balance, Edge Higher on Expected Greek Aid

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks edged higher on Friday, but investors stayed cautious before a long holiday weekend when hopes are set for the approval of Greece's bailout plan.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended its sixth positive week out of seven so far in 2012, lifting it near a level not seen in nearly a year. The index has risen 8.2 percent this year. 
Friday's modest advance has pushed the benchmark index up nearly 24 percent from its October low. European shares ended the week higher ahead of the deal, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index up 0.6 percent.
Euro zone finance ministers are expected to approve a rescue package of 130 billion euros for Greece on Monday when the market in the United States will be closed for Presidents' Day.
''The fact the European market is up the Friday before, knowing the U.S. market is off on Monday, is really a sign that the Greece situation is priced into the market,'' said Andrew Slimmon, managing director of Global Investment Solutions at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Chicago.
Analysts were wary of a pullback after Thursday's strong gains pushed the S.& P. to its highest close since May 2 and viewed the market's resilience as constructive.
''It is encouraging that we obviously had some breakouts yesterday on the indexes and we are not giving anything back,'' said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 45.79 points, or 0.35 percent, to close the trading day at 12,949.87. The S.& P. added 3.19 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,361.23. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 8.07 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,951.78.
For the week, the Dow rose 1.2 percent, the S.& P. gained 1.4 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.7 percent.
Equity markets have tended to react positively to progress on the Greece debt situation, but past agreements have broken down at the last minute.
Wall Street stocks also typically pause near the end of earnings season as the market digests the results. According to Thomson Reuters data, 404 of the S.& P. 500 companies have reported results through Friday, with 64 percent beating expectations.
The Nasdaq underperformed the overall market, dragged lower by a 14.3 percent decline in shares of Gilead Sciences to $47. The drop came after some patients treated with its experimental hepatitis C drug relapsed.
HJ Heinz rose 4.5 percent to $54.47 and Campbell Soup gained 2.6 percent to $32.90 after both food makers posted better-than-expected quarterly profits.
In contrast General Mills lost 3.6 percent to $38.34 after it lowered its outlook.
Data showed gasoline prices in the United States jumped 0.9 percent in January, pushing overall consumer prices up and offering a reminder of the risks energy costs pose to the economic recovery.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 100, and the yield rose to 2 percent from 1.98 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Luck and Loyalty

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
STAMFORD, Conn. -- It was 1979 and Bobby Valentine's major league career, once brimming with the dazzling promise of a first-round draft pick, had sputtered to an end almost completely without notice.
Unsure where to turn, he headed home to Stamford.
''I had $9,000 in the bank, didn't own a car, didn't own a house and didn't know what I was going to do,'' Valentine said last week, looking back on the conclusion of his decade in the big leagues.
The Yankees offered a lifeline, asking the 29-year-old Valentine to manage their minor league team in Oneonta, N.Y. His friends in baseball, not to mention George Steinbrenner, were surprised when Valentine declined.
''I wasn't in the mood for managing,'' Valentine said. 
So what was the plan?
''There was no plan,'' Valentine said.
His older brother, Joe, who still owns a machine shop in Stamford, has a theory.
''He was depressed,'' Joe Valentine said. ''He knew his career was over. But it bothered him. And it made it harder to think about what was next.''
This week, as Valentine takes his first steps as the new manager of the Boston Red Sox, a daring venture that will elevate him to a pronounced spotlight at the age of 61, it is easy to think of the smiling, polished Bobby V as a man who always possessed a confident vision of a baseball future full of bright lights and fame.
In fact, by the fall of 1979, Valentine had begun selling life insurance and was studying for his real estate license.
''People would ask me, 'Is this what you're going to do with yourself?' '' Valentine said in a two-hour interview as he drove from Fenway Park to a charity function in Connecticut last week. ''And I would answer, 'I have no idea.' ''
Baseball, for sure, seemed far from the picture.
''Everything that happened after 1979 was just luck,'' Valentine said. ''I stayed in Stamford and I got lucky.''
One of the annual, celebrated functions in Stamford, a city of 120,000 about 35 miles northeast of Manhattan, is a dinner benefiting muscular dystrophy. Late in 1979, Valentine's boyhood friend Rick Robustelli, son of the former football Giants Hall of Famer Andy Robustelli, had been given extra tickets to the dinner. He invited Valentine and his wife of two years, Mary, to accompany him.
Across the dinner table from the Valentines was one of Robustelli's neighbors, Joe Romano, a Stamford businessman. He asked Valentine about his next career move, and Bobby gave his standard nonanswer.
''He asked me if I ever thought about opening a restaurant, maybe a sports bar,'' Valentine said. ''And pretty much the next day we became partners in the restaurant business, which people later told me was the riskiest thing I could have done.''
Riskier still, Valentine and Romano chose to take over a troubled, existing beer-and-brawl bar in one of Stamford's seediest sections -- across the street from a small triangular-shaped park known for its drug and prostitution trade.
''People in town thought he was crazy,'' said Bill Arnone, another Valentine childhood friend. ''Nobody would come down to that neighborhood. You wouldn't even slow your car down as you passed by.''
For the next several weeks, Valentine's father, Joseph, a carpenter, rebuilt the inside of the bar as Bobby hauled lumber and other materials through the back door. Valentine, who had played in Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego, Seattle and New York, had an idea for what the modern, late-20th-century sports bar should look like.
It would have 10 or 12 televisions positioned throughout the bar in an era when many bars had one or two at most. Every wall would be splashed with sports memorabilia; Valentine was a big collector. The bar top itself would be glass, and beneath it would be hundreds of old baseball cards, another novelty. Most innovative, above the bar was a new service being sold: a sports ticker with a running stream of updated scores from around the country.
It may sound like the standard description of a sports bar now, but in 1980 it was almost revolutionary.
Still, there was the blighted area all around Bobby V's Sports Gallery Cafe.
One night, Valentine slipped into a lounge in another part of Stamford and heard the patrons talking about his bar.
''It will be three years before any woman steps foot in the place,'' the bartender said.
He was wrong. Valentine used his celebrity in Stamford -- he was a three-time all-state high school baseball and football player -- to get dozens of friends, associates and civic leaders to visit the restaurant. He hired off-duty cops to stand guard at the front and back doors of his cafe, and to watch over customers' cars parked nearby.
Exhibiting the chutzpah familiar to Valentine's managerial style decades later, he found remedies in uncommon methods and defied authority. He did not don a fake mustache before he did it, but at 4 a.m. one day, when the drug dealers and prostitutes had left the park across the street, Valentine strolled over with a hacksaw.
''I cut down all the wooden park benches,'' Valentine said. ''I just left them in pieces on the ground. With nowhere to sit, it got harder to hang around. I didn't eradicate the problem, but it moved elsewhere.''
Well, almost. Late on another night, Valentine left to get in his car and was accosted by a couple of prostitutes. He ended up chasing them down the street until the police arrived and arrested him.
''I spent a night in jail,'' Valentine said. ''They told me I could have one phone call. I called the mayor and he came and hustled me out of the back door.''
Before long, Valentine's bar prospered, so much so that he expanded into an adjacent building. Within two years, the area began to change as other businesses took advantage of urban renewal loans. For decades now, the area has been known as restaurant row in Stamford, a hub of corporate headquarters. The park is manicured and redesigned with distinctive lighting, and it has become a gathering spot for concerts and events.
''Bobby was the sheriff who came in and cleaned up that part of town,'' said Bennett Salvatore, the N.B.A. referee and Stamford native who was another of Valentine's childhood contemporaries. ''He showed a lot of foresight. And in turn, I think the restaurant gave Bobby a shot in the arm.
''Not that he ever needed too much encouragement; he's been a star since he was 10.''
An Early Winner
Joe Valentine, three years Bobby's elder, recalls when his 10-year-old brother wanted to tag along for pickup baseball and football games at Southfield Park in Stamford's Waterside neighborhood.
Arnone, who lived on the way to the park, said last week: ''The Valentines lived on Melrose Place and I'd see Joe walking down the street to the park with this little kid two steps behind him. We were all three and four years older and we kind of wondered why Bobby was there.''
Until they saw him play.
''Bobby was always faster and better than everyone, even as a 10-year-old going against 14-year-olds,'' Joe Valentine said. ''You just had to see it -- he was special. The second time I brought him to the park, when we chose up sides, my older friends all wanted to take him first.''
Valentine led Stamford Little League teams to championships and to the Babe Ruth League national championships.
''He was an extrovert then, as he is now,'' said Frank Abbott, who played on those early Stamford youth teams with Valentine. ''Even in practice, if he noticed the other kids losing concentration, he would make up games to keep everyone focused and interested.''
There was nothing, it seemed, that Valentine could not do. He had the lead in his high school play and won an international ballroom dancing title.
In high school, he scored 53 touchdowns as a running back and had hundreds of scholarship offers, including one from Notre Dame and another from Southern California, where Coach John McKay told him he would win the Heisman Trophy.
He chose baseball instead after the Dodgers made him the fifth pick of the 1968 draft. In subsequent rounds, the team selected Steve Garvey, Bill Buckner and Ron Cey. Valentine made his debut in the big leagues the next year, and he dominated the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, where he was the most valuable player in 1970.
He broke in as a Dodgers infielder, was traded to the California Angels in a deal involving Frank Robinson and Andy Messersmith, and was batting .302 for the Angels on May 17, 1973, when he had volunteered to play center field. Chasing a home run ball, he crashed into the outfield fence and sustained multiple compound leg fractures. He would never recover his former speed and agility.
''I remember after the injury going with him to the local high school, where he would run the stadium steps for hours,'' Joe Valentine said. ''He thought by doing that, his leg would get better. It got worse.
''He became a utility player, bouncing around the majors and not playing much. It was so sad because Bobby loves baseball so much.''
Veal and Opportunity
Valentine reconnected with professional baseball in the early 1980s, he said, completely by accident.
Attending another dinner function, this one the annual New York baseball writers' affair, Valentine ran into a San Diego Padres executive who asked him to tutor minor league infielders.
''I was going to be a roving instructor for $10,000,'' Valentine said. ''I would make eight or nine trips a year. If I had a traditional job, maybe I couldn't have done that. But with the restaurant I could get away. So I did it.''
A year later, he was at the Stamford muscular dystrophy dinner again and ran into Lou Gorman, then a Mets vice president for player personnel. Gorman, like everyone else, asked Valentine what he was doing with himself. Valentine talked about the restaurant and his role with the Padres.
''I told Lou that I liked working with the minor leaguers but that the Padres' farm teams were kind of far away from Stamford,'' Valentine said.
Gorman told Valentine he could have the same job with the Mets, and he would travel for the most part in the Eastern United States. So Valentine became a part-time Mets employee.
In 1983, the Dodgers had an opening on their coaching staff. Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda, who had been Valentine's minor league manager in the Pacific Coast League, told his bosses to offer Valentine the job. As a courtesy, the Dodgers called the Mets to ask permission to speak to Valentine, and Gorman took the call.
Laughing last week as he told the story, Valentine said: ''And Lou says that I can't be a coach for the Padres' big club because I'm going to coach in New York for the Mets. Actually, it had never been discussed, but that's how I ended up on the Mets staff the next season.
''I'm telling you, it's all luck.''
Within a year, Valentine had a spotlight job for a celebrated team -- coaching third base for Davey Johnson's Mets. On May 16, 1985, a little more than five years after he had retired as a player and began selling life insurance, he was named manager of the Texas Rangers. He had turned 35 years old three days earlier.
''I learned two things from that period after I retired as a player, when maybe things weren't very clear for me,'' Valentine said last week. ''One, your friends will help you, and I'm lucky to have grown up in a place like Stamford, where I have a lot of loyal friends. Two, don't be afraid to remake yourself. Because I am still remaking myself today.''
Valentine, who has been married for 35 years and has a 28-year-old son, cited myriad changes he has made throughout his life. He has been, for example, broke financially twice as an adult.
''The first time, it was the day I was released by the Mets,'' Valentine said, recalling 1979. ''I was playing in a spring training game and wouldn't take a call from my broker even though he kept trying to get ahold of me. I had $33,000 in one stock, just about all the money I had in the world. The game ends and afterward I get cut by Joe Torre. When I get around to calling my broker, he tells me my stock that day went from $25 a share to just pennies. I was now unemployed and busted.''
A few years later, he invested more than $50,000 in a horse riding center that went bankrupt.
''At first you wonder what happened for something to go so wrong,'' Valentine said last week, opening his eyes wide as if still shocked at his loss. ''But you learn to say, 'What did I learn?' Because you can't be afraid to learn. Then do it better next time.''
Valentine insisted he has never stopped reconstructing himself. Fired by George W. Bush as the Texas manager in 1992, he shocked the American baseball community by agreeing to manage in Japan. After returning to lead the Mets for a little more than six seasons, including an appearance in the 2000 World Series, he was eventually drummed out of New York only to reappear in a Japanese dugout again.
''But I made a bunch of changes when I went back to Japan,'' he said. ''Again, I wondered how I could do things better. So I learned a new language -- I learned Japanese -- at 55 years old.''
Valentine is not making any predictions for how he will retool the Boston Red Sox or improve them this season, or beyond. He has been going almost nonstop since he was handed the manager's job Nov. 29: flying around the country to meet with players, hiring a coaching staff, educating himself on the Red Sox farm system and courting a ravenous, impassioned local news media corps. Valentine has an apartment near Fenway Park, and since he has always followed a rigorous fitness regimen, he has learned the many miles of scenic bike paths enveloping Boston.
But as much as he advocates the benefits of change, some things have remained the same. A week before heading south to prepare for his first American spring training as a manager in 10 years, he made time to attend the Giants-New England Patriots Super Bowl, flying to the game in a chartered jet. On board were seven of his boyhood buddies from Stamford.
''I never forget where I'm from,'' Valentine said last week, driving through his home state. ''It is where I know I am never alone. All my life, I've gone back to Stamford, sometimes not very sure what to do next.
''But that's O.K. Because that's where you learn that you'll find your way. That's what makes it home.''

HEADLINE: Congress Passes Tax Cut Extension, and Everyone Claims a Win

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With each party claiming that it had pocketed an election-year victory, Congress on Friday voted to extend payroll tax cuts and unemployment benefits and sent the legislation to President Obama, ending a contentious policy fight that left lawmakers with the political bruises to show for it.
House Republican leaders were forced to turn to Democrats for passage; of the 293 who voted for the roughly $140 billion package, 147 were Democrats, carrying the proposal over the top Friday morning with the acquiescence of almost as many Republicans. It was only the second House bill in the 112th Congress to be split roughly in half along party lines; the other was a spending bill. 
The Senate followed within minutes and approved the measure on a vote of 60 to 36. Mr. Obama has said he would sign the bill as soon as Congress passed it.
The bill would maintain a two percentage-point payroll tax cut for 160 million working Americans, provide added unemployment benefits for millions and protect doctors who accept Medicare from a large cut in reimbursements.
Democrats could count far more policy victories in the bill: the payroll tax break will not be paid for, large changes that Republicans sought to the unemployment insurance program were not realized, and the program was extended far beyond what the opposing party sought. But Republicans were satisfied that they had excised an election-year issue that Democrats were seizing on to harm them.
Further, the agreement changes the pension program for some federal workers, which angered some Democrats from states with many federal workers and led them to oppose the measure. After the vote, members fled for the airports to begin a one-week recess, during which they will face the verdict of their constituents on their role in one of the most contentious fiscal policy battles of the 112th Congress.
''One hundred sixty million Americans,'' said Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who, as chairman of the Finance Committee, led negotiations over the measure with the House. ''That's the number of Americans who are helped by this bill.''
A compromise allowing the extension of the tax holiday for the rest of the year came together quickly this week, as Republicans decided that it was not politically viable to resist in an election year. It avoided an abrupt increase in payroll taxes that would have taken effect March 1, returning them to the level of 2010. The taxes are withheld from the paychecks of most wage earners and finance the Social Security system.
In the negotiations, which took place during a two-month temporary extension of a popular tax break that had been in place throughout 2011, Republicans gave up on their demands that the tax cuts be paid for.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the package will increase the budget deficit by $126 billion over the next five years, but by a bit less over the longer haul as more of the spending reductions take effect.
Republicans who supported the deal said they had won several important concessions during the talks, like imposing new conditions and limits on unemployment compensation and cutting the preventive health spending called for in the health care overhaul Democrats pushed through Congress in 2010. Representative Renee Ellmers, Republican of North Carolina, called that cut ''the most dramatic blow to Obamacare yet.'' Some Democrats sharply condemned the deal. Even those who voted for the bill, which the White House supported and Democrats considered a major act of economic stimulus, said some provisions were misguided.
Two Democratic leaders, Representatives Steny H. Hoyer and Chris Van Hollen, whose Maryland districts contain thousands of federal employees, denounced the cutting of government contributions to pensions for federal workers, the savings from which will pay for the extension of unemployment aid. The Maryland lawmakers would have preferred tax increases on the wealthy or on corporations, or closing loopholes like the one that lets fund managers treat their income as lightly taxed ''carried interest.''
''Nobody else in this bill, not a millionaire, not a billionaire, not a carried-interest beneficiary, not an oil company, nobody in this bill other than federal employees is asked to pay,'' said Mr. Hoyer, the Democratic whip, confident that his denunciation of the bill would not endanger its passage. The two Maryland senators also rejected the measure.
Under the bill, the government would save $15 billion over 10 years by reducing its contribution to federal employee pensions and requiring new workers to contribute more.

HEADLINE: Vatican's Celebratory Mood Is Dampened by Leaks That Suggest Turmoil Within

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

 BODY:
VATICAN CITY -- As the world's Roman Catholics prepare for the addition of 22 members to the College of Cardinals, the Vatican has become embroiled in an embarrassing scandal in which a number of leaked documents have drawn back the curtains on the church's inner workings.
The internal church squabbling, predictably dubbed ''VatiLeaks'' by the Italian news media, became public about three weeks ago with the disclosure on television and in newspapers of confidential letters written by a top Vatican official who had denounced alleged corruption and financial mismanagement in Vatican City. 
The widespread feeling among experts who follow the Vatican is that the letters were a volley in a battle among officials jousting for power in a papal court whose anointed leader, they say, is more concerned with theological questions than with the day- to-day affairs of state.
Every journalist who follows the church has described the current controversy as part of ''a clash between cardinals in the Curia,'' even though the Vatican is denying it, said Paolo Rodari, who writes about the Vatican for two newspapers. The e-mails and letters and documents that have made their way into print ''could not get out unless they came from someone inside,'' he added.
The Vatican has not denied the letters' authenticity, but it has issued numerous statements saying the news media have blown the matter far out of proportion.
The first missives to be published date from last spring. In them, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, at the time the deputy governor of Vatican City, fretted that he would be ousted after making enemies in his effort to combat overspending and cronyism in the awarding of contracts. He pleaded with his boss, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, and the pope to let him stay on. Instead, Archbishop Vigano was named the papal nuncio, or ambassador, to the United States.
Letters and documents by other Vatican officials followed, including some that suggested that the Vatican was not adequately complying with international legislation to prevent money laundering.
One anonymous document published in a national newspaper last week cited reports that a Sicilian cardinal had spoken vaguely about a plot to kill Pope Benedict XVI before the end of 2012.
The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, called the reports ''delirious and incomprehensible.''
The public airing of the church's problems comes at an awkward time for the Vatican as it prepares to expand the College of Cardinals, which will take place at a ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday.
It is usually a festive moment, and indeed hundreds of pilgrims have come from New York to be present when Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan becomes a prince of the church. This time, however, some columnists who write about the Vatican have made much of the fact that a higher-than-average number of new cardinals are Italian or have links with the Curia, stacking the deck, they implied, in the election of the next pope.
Full disclosure has never been the Vatican's choice of public relations strategy (even today, its archives release only long-ago pronouncements in carefully measured doses). But to judge by the numerous statements they have issued, the disclosure of the letters has uncharacteristically placed the Holy See's house organs in crisis mode.
In a front-page editorial this week about Benedict in L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper, the editor in chief, Giovanni Maria Vian, described the pope as standing fast ''before the wolves'' amid ''irresponsible and unworthy behavior'' encouraged by the ''clamor of the media.''
Father Lombardi, the spokesman, also took stabs at the news media and called on church officials to ''have strong nerves, because no one can be surprised at anything,'' comparing the embarrassment caused by the letters to the mortification that engulfed the United States administration in the WikiLeaks scandal.
The church must stand firm, and not allow itself ''to be swallowed up by the vortex of confusion, which is what ill-intentioned people want,'' he said in a statement this week. We must ''make use of reason, something which not all media outlets tend to do.''
While there is broad consensus among Vatican experts that the Vatican and its churchmen are not immune to the failings of human nature, the storied intricacies of Vatican politics make the final objective of the leaked letters less clear.
Some believe the letters are meant to cast murky light on Cardinal Bertone, accused by critics of being a bad manager even as he tries to expand his influence at the papal court.
Others say the objective is simply to disclose corruption within the Vatican's financial institutions, though in recent years the Holy See has ostensibly made efforts to be more transparent in its economic dealings (mere smoke screens, skeptics say).
''The lid came off this pot because it was masking a can of worms and it was time that they came out in the light of the day,'' said Marco Lillo, an investigative journalist at the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano, which has published several of the documents. The letters emerged, he explained, after alleged wrongdoings within the Curia went unpunished. ''In a closed world, the only way to make wrongs public is to bring them to light in the public opinion.''
And in a church that has already been shaken by the acknowledgment of widespread sexual abuse of minors on the part of the clergy, the notion that what happens within Vatican walls stays within the Vatican walls ''no longer applies,'' he said. But there are also those who believe that the attacks are aimed at the pope himself, that he is being blamed for disregarding the management (and machinations) of the church as he instead tries to cement its theological and doctrinal foundations.
The pope, who turns 85 in April, has obliquely referred to the contentious climate in the Curia on several occasions, calling on officials to pay greater attention to spiritual rather than temporal matters.
Speaking to seminarians in Rome on Wednesday, the pope said that in recent days there had been ''much talk about the Church of Rome, many things being said,'' the Vatican Information Service reported. ''Let us hope that people also talk about our faith.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Labor, Cheap No More

BYLINE: By MICHELLE DAMMON LOYALKA. 
Michelle Dammon Loyalka, a journalist who lives in Beijing, is the author of ''Eating Bitterness: Stories from the Front Lines of China's Great Urban Migration.''

 BODY:
Beijing
WHEN China's vice president, Xi Jinping, visited the White House on Tuesday, President Obama renewed calls for China to play more fairly in the world economy. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. echoed those sentiments, telling Mr. Xi that the two countries could cooperate ''only if the game is fair.''
But while China's industrial subsidies, trade policies, undervalued currency and lack of enforcement for intellectual property rights all remain sticking points for the United States, there is at least one area in which the playing field seems to be slowly leveling: the cheap labor that has made China's factories nearly unbeatable is not so cheap anymore. 
China has experienced sporadic labor shortages, which in turn have driven up its once rock-bottom labor costs. This trend is particularly evident in the weeks following China's Spring Festival, or New Year, when more than 100 million rural migrants return to the countryside to spend the year's biggest holiday with family. Coaxing those same migrants back into the urban work force has proven increasingly difficult.
This year has been no exception. Although nearly two weeks have passed since the Lantern Festival that officially marks the end of the 15-day holiday, cities across China are still facing a serious labor shortfall. In order to lure new workers and retain the old, some companies give employees sizable bonuses just for coming back to work, while others offer cash for every new employee they bring along with them. And in many areas, wage increases ranging from 10 to 30 percent have become the norm.
Despite all this, cities like Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are still short hundreds of thousands of migrant workers. Shandong Province is missing a full third of its migrant work force, and Hubei Province reports a loss of more than 600,000 workers. Last week, the Chinese government released a report describing this year's post-Spring Festival labor shortage as not only more pronounced than in years past, but also longer-lasting and wider in scope.
Numerous factors underlie China's mounting labor woes. Until now the country has been able to achieve its stunning economic growth by shifting large numbers of farmers into nonagricultural jobs. Over the past several years economists have warned that China may be reaching the so-called Lewis Turning Point -- the stage at which the rural surplus labor pool effectively runs dry and wages begin to rapidly increase.
At the same time, China's population has been steadily aging, and by 2020 the nation will have more than 200 million people over age 60. Furthermore, rising living costs in urban China coupled with markedly improved conditions in rural areas are encouraging many would-be migrant workers to look for opportunities closer to home.
In addition to a shortage in the sheer number of available workers, China's labor problems are further exacerbated by a shift in the quality and character of its work force. For the older generation, there is very little that a factory or foreman can dish out that seems too difficult to deal with, given that they witnessed, or grew up with parents who had witnessed, the nation's rocky ride through the Communist Revolution, collectivization, the disastrous Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. These are the people who pioneered the model of migrant labor on which Chinese manufacturing has come to depend: long hours in substandard conditions, all for a fraction of what United States workers earn.
As illustrated by the recent headlines over working conditions at Foxconn, which makes components for Apple, there are plenty of migrant workers still living and working under that model. But by and large China's younger generation is no longer willing to endure hardship without clear expectations that it is a temporary means to a more comfortable end.
According to the government report, a full 70 percent of rural migrants are now under 30. That means they are members of the so-called after-'80s generation -- a euphemistic Chinese term to describe those who grew up during the nation's economic revival and have thus never experienced real deprivation or acquired a taste for the chiku (''eating bitterness'') work ethic championed by previous generations.
In the past, China's migrant workers were just thankful not to go hungry; today they are savvy and secure enough to start being choosy. Higher salaries, basic benefits, better working conditions and less physically taxing jobs are only the beginning of their demands, and for many factories, these are already too costly to be tenable.
For China, having spent the last three decades building the nation on the back of its cheap labor force without having to pay too much attention to its welfare, all this is uncharted territory. It is also a serious blow to the comparative advantage that has helped make its factories an international juggernaut.
It's no wonder then that the day after meeting with Mr. Xi, President Obama showed up at a Master Lock plant in Milwaukee declaring that the time for manufacturing jobs to return to America had arrived. Not too long ago such a statement would have been nearly unthinkable, but now, thanks to China's rising labor costs, it looks as if America might be back in the manufacturing game sooner than expected.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Overturns Conviction of Ex-Goldman Programmer

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Since his arrest nearly three years ago, Sergey Aleynikov, a former programmer at Goldman Sachs, has acknowledged violating the bank's confidentiality policy by downloading source code from company computers.
He also insisted that it was not a criminal act.
A federal appeals court has now agreed with Mr. Aleynikov, issuing a ruling late Thursday that not only reversed his conviction but also mandated an acquittal, resulting in his release from prison on Friday afternoon.
''Justice occasionally works,'' said an emotional Mr. Aleynikov, who appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday afternoon sporting a prison-issued gray sweat suit. He had served one year of an eight-year sentence at a federal penitentiary in Fort Dix, N.J.
The reversal deals a major blow to the Justice Department, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a main concern. It is also a loss for Goldman Sachs, which reported Mr. Aleynikov to federal authorities after it accused him of stealing computer code. The bank had portrayed itself as the victim of a brazen crime. 
The unusual decision from a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit came just hours after hearing his lawyer, Kevin Marino, argue his appeal. On Friday, after a request from prosecutors, the appeals court dialed back its ruling, revoking its mandate that the trial court judge issue an acquittal. That could allow the government to appeal the Second Circuit's decision by requesting that the entire panel of appeals court judges review the case.
Chief Judge Dennis G. Jacobs issued a terse one-paragraph order without explanation, saying only that an opinion would follow ''in due course.''
A spokesman for the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.
Legal experts said that the ruling strongly suggested that the written opinion from the highly influential Second Circuit court would be a significant development in corporate espionage law.
''Given that theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property has been a growing priority for federal prosecutors, the court's forthcoming opinion will be critical for defining the scope of the government's enforcement ability in this space,'' said Nicholas S. Goldin, a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who served as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where he worked on these types of cases.
The Aleynikov case has tested the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. At the time of his conviction, Mr. Aleynikov was held up by federal prosecutors as an example of the government's crackdown on employees who steal valuable information - especially in digital form - from their employers.
Early this decade, the Justice Department formed computer hacking and intellectual property units, or CHIP units, at United States attorney's offices around the country to fight a spike in intellectual-property theft and cybercrime. During the 2010 fiscal year, the F.B.I. opened at least 190 intellectual-property crime investigations, 66 of which concerned trade-secret theft.
Members of the white-collar criminal-defense bar have criticized the Justice Department's aggressive stance toward prosecuting corporate espionage, arguing that victims like Goldman can seek suitable remedies in civil court.
A crucial issue on Mr. Aleynikov's appeal - and a main focus of the judges during the oral argument on Thursday - was whether his actions constituted a crime under the statutory language of the Economic Espionage Act. The judges homed in on whether Goldman's high-frequency trading system, and the code upon which it was built, was a ''product produced for interstate commerce'' within the meaning of the statute.
Mr. Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer, argued that the trading system housed on Goldman's computer servers was not produced for commerce because Goldman never licensed or sold the system and had no intention of doing so. Goldman's trading system, he argued, was built for internal use and was not a tangible item of property distributed and used by the commercial public.
A government lawyer countered that the trading system had obvious connections to interstate commerce, because Goldman used to it buy and sell stocks and bonds across global markets.
Mr. Aleynikov's odyssey through the criminal justice system began on July 3, 2009, when F.B.I. agents arrested him as he stepped off a flight at Newark Liberty International Airport.
The government accused Mr. Aleynikov of stealing Goldman's proprietary ''black box'' computer code that the bank used to make rapid-fire trades across global markets. Mr. Aleynikov was criminally charged with violating two laws: the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act.
His case highlighted a new and lucrative corner of Wall Street. High-frequency trading uses complex computer algorithms to make thousands of lightning-fast trades that exploit tiny price discrepancies. The trading became a substantial source of revenue at banks and hedge funds, which vigilantly guard the code underpinning their lucrative trading strategies.
Mr. Aleynikov, 42 years old and a resident of North Caldwell, N.J., came to the United States from Russia in 1990, with a degree in computer programming. He joined Goldman in May 2007 and was paid $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers.
After a little more than two years at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov was lured away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a new firm run by a former senior executive at the Citadel Investment Group, a large Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay Mr. Aleynikov about triple his Goldman salary.
Before leaving Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov downloaded the bank's secret source code to his home computer, his laptop and a memory device. Goldman caught Mr. Aleynikov after noticing a surge of data leaving its servers and reported the violation to criminal authorities.
During a two-week trial in December 2010, the government depicted Mr. Aleynikov as an evil, greedy computer scientist who had masterminded a hacking scheme that could potentially earn his new employer millions of dollars.
Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer acknowledged that his client should not have lifted source code from Goldman, but argued that it was not a criminal case and his client never intended to harm the bank.
A jury convicted Mr. Aleynikov after three hours of deliberation.
But on Friday at 6 a.m., Mr. Aleynikov opened his prison-monitored e-mail account at Fort Dix to find a two-word message from his lawyer: ''We won.''
Standing by his client after Friday's court hearing, Mr. Marino railed against the government's case.
''This was a radical exaggeration of the breadth of the criminal laws and a wrongheaded prosecution that should never have been brought,'' the lawyer said.
Mr. Aleynikov said he had barely had time to think about the future, but was excited to see his three young children, ages 8, 6 and 3. And though overjoyed with his win on appeal, he was measured about the future.
''In prison you learn to appreciate your life day by day,'' he said. ''Today is a victory, but tomorrow you never know.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Chinese Vice President Ends U.S. Tour on Friendly Note

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Vice President Xi Jinping of China wrapped up a carefully scripted cross-country tour of the United States on Friday having tried to cast himself not just as a fitting leader to follow President Hu Jintao, as he almost certainly will this fall, but as an unusually approachable one as well.
It was a performance aimed both at an American audience whose skepticism toward China has been compounded by election-year language, and at an audience back home whose cynicism toward its Communist rulers can also run deep.
Mr. Hu, China's wooden and distant leader over the last decade, has left many Chinese more comfortable economically, but also more removed from a party and leadership that seem to have little to do with their lives. Mr. Xi -- the joke-cracking, farm-visiting, 58-year-old statesman who told a classroom filled with students on Friday that he likes to hit the pool for a swim -- presents a sharp contrast to Mr. Hu. 
Whether a leader with a different image will translate into better relations with the United States and to changes in China, though, remains as much a mystery at the end of Mr. Xi's trip as it was before he arrived.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said he had spent more than 20 hours in relatively private talks with Mr. Xi during this trip and a similar one that Mr. Biden made to China in August, would not speculate on how his visitor's openness might translate to policy-making. But he said that in their personal conversations, Mr. Xi ''has been very frank about the economic and political dilemma he faces in China.''
He said he found Mr. Xi ''very, very direct,'' adding: ''He's absolutely responsive. When we disagree, it's a clear statement of disagreement.''
Mr. Xi buffed his regular-guy image on Friday with a visit to the International Studies Learning Center in the town of South Gate, Calif., just southeast of Los Angeles. Responding to a high school student's question during a classroom visit, he said that he likes to read, swim (his favorite sport) and watch American basketball, baseball and football.
''Of course we always want more time to ourselves,'' Mr. Xi said in Mandarin, the language the class was studying. ''But to borrow a title from an American film, it's like 'Mission: Impossible.' '' The room broke up in laughter.
Many senior Chinese officials, especially Mr. Hu, are known for trying to maintain a distance between themselves and ordinary citizens, which often infuriates those they govern and leads to the Internet vilification of politicians. But Mr. Xi appeared confident and at ease in settings like the one at the South Gate school, at a Los Angeles Lakers game on Friday night and during a midweek stop in Muscatine, Iowa, where he met with Americans who had been his hosts there 27 years earlier when he was part of a delegation looking at pig-farming techniques.
Mr. Xi's trip, with its tone of camaraderie, also had a message for Americans at a time of growing unease in Washington over China's economic and military rise. The tensions have been fueled in part by strident public speeches against Chinese policies given by Republican presidential candidates and by President Obama, who have their eyes on the 2012 election.
Mr. Biden told reporters after the school visit that he saw in Mr. Xi a Chinese leader with a distinctive style.
''This is unusual for any foreign leader, in particular for a Chinese foreign leader, to want to expose himself this much to the American public,'' Mr. Biden said. ''His going back to Muscatine was not my idea. It was our idea to do many other things. But this is a guy who wants to feel it and taste it, and he's prepared to show another side of the Chinese leadership that could be useful for Americans to see as well.''
Mr. Biden said that Mr. Xi also seemed to want to learn everything he could about the American political system. On Tuesday night, after Mr. Xi and Mr. Biden finished dinner at the Naval Observatory, Mr. Biden's home in Washington, the two sat in the library and, as Mr. Biden recounted it, talked about individual members of Congress, with Mr. Xi asking about the motivations behind some lawmakers' actions.
Mr. Xi has long stressed aspects of his personal background that show that he can connect with a range of people. He has written about his years toiling in the village of Liangjiahe in Shaanxi Province during the Cultural Revolution. He has also boasted of traveling to every county in Zhejiang Province when he was its top party official.
On Friday, he seemed keen to tell the students about the connection he had made with Americans in his 1985 visit to Iowa. ''That trip to the United States was the first trip I made to this country,'' he said. ''If anything, my trip back to Muscatine the other day reinforced my impressions of 27 years ago.''
But Mr. Xi may be engaging in mythmaking. Nicholas Platt, a senior American diplomat, said in a telephone interview on Friday that Mr. Xi had visited Washington in 1980 as part of a delegation led by Geng Biao, a top Chinese general. Mr. Xi was the general's aide. ''He wasn't on protocol lists,'' said Mr. Platt, who organized the general's visit. ''To the best of my knowledge, based on a reliable source, that was his first trip to the U.S.''
Jin Zhong, a magazine editor in Hong Kong who has researched Mr. Xi, also said in an earlier interview that Mr. Xi had traveled with General Geng to Washington in 1980.
Mr. Xi was on a different mission this time. Business deals were announced on Friday, including one between Chinese companies and DreamWorks Animation, the American film company, at an economic forum that Mr. Xi attended before the school visit. And in the afternoon in Los Angeles, Mr. Xi was led on a tour of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by Frank Gehry, by Mr. Gehry himself.
Mr. Xi is not the first Chinese leader to engage in image-polishing on an American visit. Deng Xiaoping caused a sensation in 1979 when he donned a 10-gallon cowboy hat during a visit to Texas. On a state visit in 1997, Mr. Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Appearing on a ''60 Minutes'' segment taped in China in 2000, he recited part of the Gettysburg Address in English.
Both men raised hopes for better cooperation with Washington. But behind their images and push for economic reforms, both were also thoroughly authoritarian. And while economic ties with the United States improved steadily under their watches, the basic differences separating the two powers remained.

HEADLINE: Filmmakers' Cooperative Says Future Is in Doubt

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Canyon Cinema, a half-century-old cooperative in San Francisco that champions the work of experimental filmmakers, is in critical condition, according to its executive director.
The cooperative, which has more than 3,500 films that it rents, sells and distributes, including titles by the avant-garde filmmakers Jonas Mekas, Bruce Conner and Stan Brakhage, needs $30,000 to hold on.
''We have a surplus in the bank, but it's only enough to allow us to pay for expenses for one month,'' said Dominic Angerame (pronounced ahn-JUR-ah-mee), the executive director. ''It's like being one paycheck away from not being able to pay your rent.'' 
Many filmmakers, academics and critics attest to the historical and aesthetic importance of Canyon Cinema's collection. In films shot in 16- and 35-millimeter and other formats, some of them going back to the 1930s, you can catch the glimmers of avant-garde influence that seeped into the mainstream, whether in television ads, MTV videos or the work of George Lucas. (The experimental filmmaker Pat O'Neill contributed to the optical effects for ''The Empire Strikes Back.'')
''It would be tragic if it went under, because it would make a good portion of this work inaccessible,'' said Steve Anker, the dean of the School of Film/Video at the California Institute of the Arts.
''They represent one of the bastions of the real 16-millimeter film experience,'' he added.
Canyon got its unofficial start in 1961, when a group of filmmakers that included Bruce Baillie and Chick Strand began showing largely experimental films in several sites in Canyon, Calif., near Berkeley. In the late '60s it became a for-profit distribution cooperative that rented out films, produced a newsletter and held screenings. Then, as now, fees and profits were split between Canyon and the filmmakers. It and the Film-Makers' Cooperative in New York are the two major sources for experimental-film distribution in this country.
''It's terribly important to me that there are organizations like Canyon Cinema and Film-Makers' Cooperative,'' said Jyette Jensen, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art and an expert on American avant-garde film. ''It's where filmmakers go for the history, that's where they go for inspiration. Many contemporary artists integrate film footage into their installations.''
But Canyon's profits from renting, selling and distributing films -- mostly to colleges, as well as to cultural centers and film festivals -- have eroded because of a lackluster economy and, even more, because of the digital revolution. Mr. Angerame estimates that 70 percent of the experimental films in his collection have not been digitized, and that doing so (thus making them more widely accessible), would be prohibitively expensive. Canyon has lost about $2,000 a month over the last four years and has been sustained only by the $100,000 it received from selling its paper archives to Stanford University in 2009. Its annual film rental income has dropped from $133,000 in 2004 to about $90,000 now.
Mr. Angerame said the best hope for Canyon Cinema was to fold it into a new nonprofit, to be called Canyon Foundation, that would also be dedicated to film preservation and education. The nonprofit status would allow Canyon to qualify for local, state and federal arts money, Mr. Angerame said.
M. M. Serra, executive director of the Film-Makers' Cooperative, agreed. Her group became a nonprofit organization in 1993. ''Your angel is not going to fall from the sky if you are for-profit,'' she said.
The Film-Makers' Cooperative found its angel in the form of the real estate developer Charles S. Cohen, a film buff. Back in 2009, when the cooperative faced eviction, he gave it larger quarters for its 5,000-film collection, charging a symbolic annual rent of $1.
As Canyon Cinema explores becoming a nonprofit group, it has also resorted to more traditional cost-cutting techniques: it has moved to cheaper office space in San Francisco and cut staff hours, and it has sent letters appealing for funds to its 325 filmmaker members and to 1,500 renters. The letter-raising campaign has raised about $500 so far, Mr. Angerame said.
''It's crisis to crisis,'' he said. ''Hopefully we're not too far under the radar out here for someone to notice.''

HEADLINE: Talks With Iran Over Its Nuclear Program May Resume Soon

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and RICK GLADSTONE; Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States and the European Union signaled on Friday that negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program could soon resume for the first time in more than a year, even as a telecommunications network vital to the global banking industry prepared to expel Iranian banks.
While senior American and European officials stopped short of declaring a diplomatic breakthrough, Iran dropped previously unacceptable preconditions for talks in a letter this week from its senior nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, who declared his country's ''readiness for dialogue'' at ''the earliest possibility.'' 
After weeks of official bluster, ominous threats of military action in the Persian Gulf, and assassination attempts on Israelis in India, Thailand and Georgia that Iranian agents have been blamed for, the offer appeared to be a genuine concession by Iran, the officials said, though one made under the duress of tightening economic sanctions against the country.
''I'm cautious and I'm optimistic at the same time for this,'' the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said after meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at the State Department.
''It also demonstrates the importance of the twin-track approach,'' Ms. Ashton added in her first public response to the Iranian letter, referring to the international effort to intensify sanctions while leaving the door open for a diplomatic resolution of concerns about the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons.
Yet another potentially crippling sanction against Iran moved a step closer on Friday when the Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, known as Swift, said in a statement on its Web site that it was ''ready to implement sanctions against Iranian financial institutions.''
Pressure has been building on Swift to expel the banks, which have already been penalized in varying degrees of severity by the European Union and the United States under a coordinated effort. The United States and others have called Iran's nuclear program a guise for developing nuclear weapons, while Iran has called its program peaceful and has denounced the sanctions as reckless intimidation.
Sanctions already applied to Iran's banks and other companies have disrupted its economy and could sharply reduce its ability to export oil, Iran's main source of foreign revenue, when the European Union imposes an oil embargo July 1. The sanctions have also impeded the ability of Iran's Central Bank to conduct a range of international business.
If the Central Bank and other Iranian banks in the Swift network were expelled, the implications for Iran could be far more drastic. The move would essentially choke off Iran's entire banking system by denying it the main conduit for exchanging crucial financial transaction information with banks in most countries. According to Swift's 2010 annual report, the most recent available, 19 Iranian banks are members of the network, which processed nearly 2.3 million messages for Iranian financial institutions that year, a 7 percent increase from the year before.
''A clear multilateral legal framework in relation to international financial sanctions against Iran is emerging,'' the Swift statement said, referring to the European Union regulations that would apply further restrictions to Iranian financial institutions. The statement said Swift was also ''closely following the progress'' of a bill under consideration in the United States Senate that has similar intentions.
Swift is overseen both by the National Bank of Belgium and the central banks of the other countries that form the so-called Group of 10: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.
There was no immediate comment from Iran on Swift's announcement, but advocates of tougher sanctions viewed the step as a significant advance.
''Swift appears to have made the right decision to end its relationships with sanctioned Iranian institutions,'' United Against Nuclear Iran, a New York-based group that has been pushing for stricter sanctions, said in a statement.
It said Swift's action ''has the potential to significantly isolate the Iranian regime from the world's markets, and lessen the capital it has to pursue nuclear weapons and fund terrorism.''
''Now is the time,'' it continued, ''for the most robust sanctions in history, and more pressure on the regime than ever before.''
The relatively muted official response to Iran's offer to negotiate reflects the wariness of American and European officials who fear that Iran would merely use negotiations to ease international pressure while continuing to pursue activity that could bring it closer to the capability to build a nuclear bomb.
''They're the ones in a sense who have to demonstrate they are actually prepared to engage seriously on steps that would matter,'' said Dennis B. Ross, a former State Department and National Security Council official, who argued this week that diplomacy still had a chance to succeed.
The United States and other countries involved in negotiations -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia -- have not yet agreed on the structure of any talks, including what reciprocal steps would be needed from both sides for them to continue. Previous offers to negotiate have, for example, included demands that Iran allow expanded inspections of its nuclear facilities, which the Iranian authorities have rejected until now, and did not specifically address in the letter this week.
''We must be assured that if we make a decision to go forward, we see a sustained effort by Iran to come to the table, to work until we have reached an outcome that has Iran coming back into compliance with their international obligations,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
Even so, she welcomed the Iranian letter as ''an important step.''

HEADLINE: On Boeing Stage, Obama Pushes Exports

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
EVERETT, Wash. -- President Obama, wrapping himself in one of the country's most glamorous exports, Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, vowed on Friday to boost government help for American companies seeking to sell their goods overseas.
''I want us to sell stuff,'' Mr. Obama said as he finished a trip to the West Coast, calling on Congress to continue supporting export financing agencies and announcing an array of plans aimed at helping manufacturers. 
As this is an election year, Mr. Obama went for the ultimate photo op, using the spectacle of a new United Airlines Dreamliner as his backdrop to ask Congress not to cut financing for the Export-Import Bank, the American export credit agency.
The event exceeded the standards of the usual presidential factory tour. Boeing's plant here, Mr. Obama said, is the biggest building in the world, and the president seemed to delight in his tour of the new plane, marveling at windows that tint turquoise at the touch of a button.
Mr. Obama even struck a nostalgic chord, telling workers that the plane he arrived on -- Air Force One -- was made at this Boeing plant 25 years ago. ''One of the guys I met on the tour worked on the plane,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I told him he did a pretty good job. It's flying smooth.''
For Mr. Obama, export growth is one area where he can point to success. Two years ago, he said in his State of the Union speech that he would work to double United States exports in five years, an announcement that sparked incredulity among trade economists. At the time, Mr. Obama had yet to articulate a trade policy.
Since then, the president's goal seems less pie-in-the-sky, thanks in part to, of all countries, China. While China still serves as a foil for American politicians who want to talk about unfair trade practices and to score points with labor unions and manufacturing companies simultaneously, the reality is that China's economic growth -- and the ascendance of its middle class -- have enlarged the market there for American goods. United States exports last year hit record levels, buoyed by export growth to China, the Commerce Department reported.
The Obama administration has had some success in its efforts to pressure the Chinese government to allow its currency to appreciate; administration officials took up the issue again this week, when China's presumed next leader, Vice President Xi Jinping, was in Washington.
The president lavished praise on Boeing during his visit for helping to lead American export growth. But the White House also carefully calibrated the optics of the trip, choosing to visit a unionized Boeing plant in Washington State just a few months after the National Labor Relations Board dropped a lawsuit against Boeing over complaints that it built a nonunion plant in South Carolina to retaliate against the union in Washington State for strikes.
The case was dropped after the machinists' union approved a contract extension with Boeing, but the issue has been trumpeted on the Republican presidential campaign trail as an example of the government -- and Mr. Obama -- trying to beat up Boeing.
A spokesman for Boeing said there was no connection between the dropped labor complaint and Friday's visit by the president.
Labor leaders were buoyed by Mr. Obama's visit, interpreting it as a sign of presidential support. During his remarks, the president steered clear of the labor-management fight, filling his visit with oratory about Boeing, and its new 787, as the perfect example of American ingenuity. But he also managed to entwine his remarks with homages to American workers.
''In December 2009, the first Dreamliner took off on its maiden flight right here in Everett,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It was a cold and windy day, but that didn't stop more than 13,000 employees from coming out to see the product of all their hard work finally take to the skies.''
He spoke of one Boeing worker, Sharon O'Hara, who was there, and who was in the audience on Friday, and quoted her as saying: ''I had goose bumps and tears. We said we would do it and we did.''
Mr. Obama concluded: ''You said you would do it, and you did. That's what we do as Americans.''

HEADLINE: Working All Day For the I.R.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is not alone. I thought Mr. Romney's 13.9 percent federal tax rate would be hard to beat. But among the 400 Americans with the highest adjusted gross incomes in 2008, 30 of them paid less than 10 percent and another 101 paid less than 15 percent. And these people earned, on average, more than 10 times Mr. Romney's $21.7 million -- an average of $270.5 million each.
After I disclosed a few weeks ago that I pay 37 percent of my adjusted gross income and 74 percent of my taxable income in combined federal, state and local income and payroll taxes, I asked the Internal Revenue Service how that compares with other taxpayers. I never got a simple answer (and an I.R.S. spokesman said the agency could not discuss individual returns).
But this week, the I.R.S. sent me reams of data, including analyses of returns from taxpayers reporting adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 and returns from the top 400 taxpayers. Some data were from 2009, but most went back to 2008. (The agency offered no explanation as to why it takes so many years to compile.) But the data helps explain why many people are so angry about the tax code. 
Relatively few taxpayers pay an enormous percentage of the total federal income tax, and most of them are people who work for a living and have adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 to $500,000, which is the sweet spot for tax revenue. They account for 20.2 percent of total returns but pay a whopping 44.9 percent of total tax. The average tax rate for this group ranges from 11.9 percent for those with less than $200,000 in adjusted gross income to 19.6 percent for those with $200,000 to $500,000. Above those income levels, the rate rises to close to 25 percent and then declines to 22.6 percent for taxpayers earning more than $10 million.
The I.R.S. doesn't break down the data for incomes above $10 million, but the results for the top 400 returns suggest that the rate continues to decline as incomes rise. The top 400 paid an average of $49 million, or 18.1 percent of their adjusted gross income, in federal tax -- lower than taxpayers in the $200,000 to $500,000 bracket. They reported an average $14.1 million in state and local taxes, bringing their total income tax level to about 23 percent of adjusted gross income, far below my rate. And not one of them paid more than 35 percent of their adjusted gross income in federal tax.
I spoke this week to the investigative reporters Don Barlett and Jim Steele, who are working on a sequel to their best-selling book ''America: What Went Wrong,'' first published in 1992. They said that tax inequities had gotten worse since 1994, when they published ''America: Who Really Pays the Taxes,'' and described the tax system as ''out of control.''
Now, ''The tax code has been so skewed against most people, with remarkable tax cuts for folks at the top, that the whole concept of fairness has gone out the window,'' Mr. Steele said. Mr. Barlett, pointing to disparate rates even among people in the same income brackets, added: ''There's enormous horizontal inequity, enormous.''
The budget that President Obama unveiled this week included some hot-button tax measures aimed at some of these inequities: capping deductions and raising taxes on people earning more than $1 million (the so-called Buffett Rule), scrapping the alternative minimum tax and raising the tax on dividend income and carried interest. The liberal Economic Policy Institute noted, ''No budget is perfect,'' but applauded the president's stab at tax reform. ''The need for the Buffett Rule,'' it said, ''is largely driven by the preferential tax treatment of investment income over work income.''
The I.R.S. data makes clear that the differing treatment of earned and unearned income accounts for most of the disparity between tax rates for the ultrawealthy and those who make much less. Salaries and wages accounted for only 8.8 percent of adjusted gross income for the top 400 taxpayers. Interest and dividends made up 16 percent and net capital gains accounted for nearly 57 percent. So on average, 73 percent of their income was unearned and taxed at favorable rates.
For people with incomes of more than $200,000, salaries and wages make up nearly 50 percent of their adjusted gross income. Interest income accounted for 4 percent and dividends were just under 5 percent. Capital gains were 17.3 percent. ''The people who pay all the taxes are the same people who are working,'' Mr. Barlett said. ''If you're paying a huge amount of tax, then you're working.''
While proponents of lower rates for capital gains have argued that they stimulate capital investment, thereby generating jobs and economic growth (while others dispute these claims), many people wrote me to complain that by the same logic, higher rates on earned income discourage people from working.
Teresa Allen-Piccolo told me that she and her husband ran a small business in California that manufactured electronic monitoring systems for the environment. ''We represent what almost every politician purports to love -- self-made, no loans, no government assistance, just hard work,'' she wrote. ''After decades of hard, virtually unpaid work, in 2009 and 2010 the business finally picked up. Our total taxes went from $17,000 to $106,000 in 2010 -- about half of our taxable income! What can one say? Were it not that we are committed to environmental protection and giving employment, we would be much better off shutting down the business and just doing some consulting work on the side.''
Jeff Hoopes noted that as a low-paid Ph.D. candidate in accounting at the University of Michigan, his average tax rate was low, but his marginal rate reached 35 percent because his earned-income credit was reduced when he made extra money from ''house-sitting, selling books and tutoring.'' He went on: ''For providing incentives to work, the marginal rate is what counts. So while my average rate suggests that I am lightly taxed (perhaps unfair to others who pay more), my marginal rate suggests I have lesser incentives to work, as I take home less than 65 percent of what I earn. It is the worst of both worlds.''
Mr. Obama's proposal to raise taxes on dividends attacks just one aspect of the disparity between the ultrarich and others, but it is significant. The top 400 taxpayers reported average dividend income of $25 million in 2008, which accounted for 4.55 percent of total dividend income.
That such a tiny sliver of the population would account for nearly one-twentieth of total dividend income ''drives me crazy,'' Mr. Steele said. ''Although roughly 50 percent of Americans own stocks or mutual funds, dividends go overwhelmingly to the top 2 percent of the taxpayers. Those are the people who rake in the dividends. Why should that money be taxed at a lower rate?''
Like many defenders of the lower rate, Curtis Dubay, senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that ''the dividends tax is a double tax, since the corporate income that dividends come from are already taxed 35 percent at the business level.'' The effective rate on dividends, Mr. Dubay maintained, ''would stand at more than 63 percent if President Obama's misguided policy became law. This would significantly curtail investment and slow economic growth.''
Mr. Steele countered: ''What difference does that make? It's still income to the recipient. What matters is what's in your pocket in the end, after you've paid your taxes.''
The returns of the top 400 also show the failure of the alternative minimum tax to perform its original function, which was to make sure that those at the top pay a fair share of taxes. The A.M.T. captured an average of $3.2 million in added tax for the top 400 taxpayers, just over 6 percent of their total average tax. (By comparison, the A.M.T. bolstered my tax liability by 40 percent.) Their total A.M.T. payments amounted to just 1.77 percent of the $25.6 billion in A.M.T. payments collected in 2008. Taxpayers reporting adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 paid $23.2 billion, or over 90 percent of the total.
Predictably, the president's proposals drew hostile reactions this week from many conservatives. The Heritage Foundation, which advocates a flat tax and insists that any tax reform be revenue-neutral, put on a full-court press. ''The president's much-touted Buffett tax is not a fleshed-out policy in the budget but is paid lip service in a halfhearted outline for tax reform,'' Mr. Dubay said. ''The still-frail economy cannot withstand the barrage of tax hikes the president calls for.''
I've never minded paying my taxes. I've always been proud of it. But when people making hundreds of millions a year are paying a substantially lower rate than I and the many people who wrote to me do, something has gone haywire.

HEADLINE: Music Meets Chavez Politics, and Critics Frown

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN; Maria Eugenia Diaz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- In a country sharply divided by its blustery populist president, Hugo Chavez, Venezuelans can agree on one thing: El Sistema, its training system for young musicians, is a cherished vehicle for social uplift and a source of national pride.
But in recent years cracks have been appearing in that musical consensus. The way Mr. Chavez has embraced El Sistema has angered some of its supporters and has been seized on by Chavez opponents, provoking rare criticism of two of Venezuela's most celebrated and popular figures: the movement's revered founder, Jose Antonio Abreu, and its most famous product, the conductor Gustavo Dudamel.
''A lot of us are upset that Chavez has taken Sistema as his own child, and it's not,'' said Gabriela Montero, a Venezuelan pianist with an international career who has written a piece, ''Ex Patria,'' denouncing the Chavez government and the fraying of civil society here. ''It's almost like he's stolen something that we lived with for the past 40 years and dirtied it with his presence.'' 
El Sistema still has a huge reservoir of good will, and most people are loath to criticize anything associated with it publicly. It was founded in 1975 by Mr. Abreu, 72, a musician, economist and former cabinet minister who has built it into an effective social program for disadvantaged youths, bringing hundreds of thousands of them off the streets and into musical ensembles. It has also become the darling of the classical music world. Mr. Dudamel, 31, is its music director, a position he also holds with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which is on tour here.
Various ministries oversaw El Sistema until two years ago, when the president's office took direct control. El Sistema's mission runs parallel to Mr. Chavez's program to provide subsidies and services to the poor. ''The government doesn't see this as an expense but as one of the strategies for overcoming poverty,'' said Andres Izarra, the minister of information.
The suggestion that Mr. Chavez is using El Sistema to burnish his image, Mr. Izarra said, ''is off the wall.''
''Opposition people have appeared very creative in denigrating Chavez,'' he added.
Mr. Dudamel has acquired heroic status among most people here. Mr. Abreu, his mentor, is a beloved figure and has been showered with international awards and with attention from the classical music world.
But in the eyes of some musicians and public figures, their positions have been harmed by associations with Mr. Chavez, who is known for his efforts to consolidate power and nationalize businesses, as well as for the social programs that the government claims have raised the standard of living for the poor.
The situation evokes age-old questions about the intersection of art and politics: Should they remain separate? Should artists denounce politics they don't agree with? At what cost should culture be kept alive?
The critics cite numerous examples of what they call manipulation of El Sistema.
When the president of the National Assembly introduced three string-playing children from the program to the body last month, for example, he made sure to point out that they had been ''born in revolution'': the revolution of Mr. Chavez.
The official, Diosdado Cabello, a former military associate of the president who took part in Mr. Chavez's failed 1992 coup attempt, noted that the children were younger than the regime of Mr. Chavez, who came to power in 1999. They represented ''the beautiful homeland that is being built with Bolivarian socialism,'' Mr. Cabello said, referring to the South American hero of independence.
Photographs of Mr. Chavez meeting with Mr. Abreu and Mr. Dudamel ''reminded us of other sad times, like Chamberlain's meetings with Hitler'' and ''Ezra Pound's with Mussolini,'' wrote Gustavo Coronel, a former Venezuelan member of Congress and government oil official, in an editorial in Petroleum World, an online publication.
The opinion columnist Saul Godoy Gomez wrote in El Universal, a daily, that Venezuelan orchestras were being used as ''facades, as a grotesque spectacle to cover up one of the governments of the world that most violates human rights.''
Eduardo Casanova, a Venezuelan writer commenting on a blog, said that the ''buying of consciences has come to the last missing bastion: music.''
''Now dictatorship has a musician who sings its praises,'' Mr. Casanova added, referring later to Mr. Abreu's appearance several years ago on ''Alo Presidente,'' Mr. Chavez's rambling Sunday television show.
Ms. Montero, the pianist, said: ''When you're dealing with a man who is a complete kleptocrat and tells lies and believes his lies, it is up to the artist with a public voice to make truth be known.''
Mr. Abreu, in an interview, deflected the suggestion. ''We are in a free country where everyone can express their own opinions,'' he said. ''But our relationship with the state is very simple. Our kids have the right, the constitutionally given right, to musical education.''
He also rejected the notion that he should take a political stand, as sought by anti-Chavistas. ''I respect the opinion of any other person on this matter,'' he said. ''But I live in a country where a few days ago the Chavez opposition attended a vote in a massive and peaceful way,'' he said, referring to the presidential primary on Sunday. ''I feel I am in a country where democracy is being felt through votes and continual freedom. I've never felt any pressure of a political character.''
Another connection that rankled Chavez critics was Mr. Dudamel's conducting the national anthem for the opening broadcasts of a government-financed television station. The station replaced an anti-Chavez channel that the government had effectively shut down.
Mr. Dudamel also led a rousing version of the ''Mambo'' from Leonard Bernstein's ''West Side Story'' in a giant outdoor celebration of Venezuela's bicentennial that was dominated by images of Mr. Chavez and the phrase ''Onward, Commandante!''
In an interview Mr. Dudamel said the music had been played for all Venezuelans.
''We as an orchestra, as citizens of the country, we have to bring the best for our country,'' he said. ''We are giving an education to our children. People love to politicize, and that is not the right thing to do.''
Some Chavez opponents say that while it is important to point out that El Sistema quietly flourished through six governments before Mr. Chavez's election, it is unfair to condemn Mr. Abreu and Mr. Dudamel, whose main concern is to keep El Sistema going and expanding for the sake of children.
''I don't want him to go to war against Chavez,'' said Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan minister who is now a senior associate in the international economics program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, referring to Mr. Abreu. ''If that happens, Sistema will suffer. But I as a Venezuelan have to lament the fact that the only way El Sistema can survive is that the head of that remarkable institution has to stay silent about the government.''

HEADLINE: By Approving Shell's Spill Plan, U.S. Moves Closer to New Drilling in Arctic Alaska

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Milwaukee, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

 BODY:
In a crucial step toward the ultimate approval of new oil drilling off the North Slope of Alaska, the Interior Department on Friday tentatively approvedShell'splans for responding to a potential spill in the frigid Arctic waters.
Shell still needs to cross several more regulatory barriers before it will be permitted to begin drilling as many as six exploratory wells in the Chukchi Sea in July. But the green light from the Interior Department on the company's oil spill response plan is a clear sign that the Obama administration is disposed toward allowing the drilling despite the dogged opposition of many environmentalists. 
''Alaska's energy resources -- onshore and offshore, conventional and renewable -- hold great promise and economic opportunity for the people of Alaska and across the nation,'' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement. ''In the Arctic frontier, cautious exploration -- under the strongest oversight, safety requirements and emergency response plans ever established -- can help us expand our understanding of the area and its resources, and support our goal of continuing to increase safe and responsible domestic oil and gas production.''
''We are taking a cautious approach, one that will help inform the wise decisions of tomorrow,'' Mr. Salazar said.
Shell has spent more than $4 billion over five years in its quest to exploit the vast oil and natural gas resources believed to lie beneath the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas off the north coast of Alaska. It has faced opposition from environmental groups and Alaska Natives who worry that extensive petroleum activities will foul the pristine seas and harm wildlife, including bowhead whales, ice seals, polar bears and walruses. Such environmental groups are likely to try to block any drilling in court if final federal approval is granted in coming months.
''We're disappointed but not surprised,'' said Brendan Cummings, senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group long opposed to Shell's drilling plans. ''I don't see any way the Interior Department could be deemed in compliance with the law. There's a lack of infrastructure and insufficient demonstrated ability to clean up in the Arctic. It's likely that this approval will be challenged in court.''
Shell has proposed drilling up to six wells over the next two years within the Burger prospect, about 70 miles off the coast in approximately 140 feet of water.
Shell welcomed the decision, describing it as a ''major milestone'' in its plans to drill off the Alaska shoreline.
''We recognize that industry's license to operate in the offshore is predicated on being able to operate in a safe, environmentally sound manner,'' said Pete Slaiby, Shell's top executive in Alaska. ''Shell's commitment to those basic principles is unwavering.''
Shell still must obtain permits from the Environmental Protection Agency for wastewater discharge and from the Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to drill each specific well. The company must also demonstrate that its well-capping technology can work in the harsh conditions of the Arctic, and its drilling program must survive any court challenges.
Opponents said that Shell and the Obama administration had not fully absorbed the lessons of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 rig workers and spilled millions of gallons of crude into the gulf.
''This decision is premature,'' said Marilyn Heiman, director of the Arctic program at the Pew Environment Group. ''We need an additional two or three years of study to get the science right, to ensure proper monitoring and to protect wildlife.''
Ms. Heiman added, ''They still don't have standards for the Arctic, which is very different from the temperate waters of the gulf -- the ice, the wind, the darkness. We think there are major gaps in this plan, and they need to take more time.''
Interior Department officials insisted that they had conducted an extensive scientific inquiry before moving ahead with the spill response plan. They also said this work would continue before and after Shell was allowed out on the water and that officials would conduct several spill response drills before any drilling began.
They have also shortened the season that Shell will be allowed to operate offshore to ensure that it has shut down operations and has time to take any remedial actions before ice forms in the Chukchi.
''This decision has been based on our new standards and our commitment to ensure the highest standard of safety and environmental preparedness in the world and our commitment to bringing science to all our activities in the Arctic,'' said David J. Hayes, the Interior deputy secretary who is coordinating the Arctic offshore drilling policy.
Shell's response plan is designed to ensure that in case of a blowout or spill, the well could be shut down and any oil discharged quickly contained. If necessary, and with approval, spilled oil could also be burned off. The company promises to have personnel and equipment specifically dedicated to spill control near the rigs at all times.
Boats, skimmers, booms, helicopters and barges will be on hand or at most an hour away from drilling rigs in case of an emergency. The equipment will all be specifically designed for harsh Arctic conditions, with reinforced hulls and materials designed for subfreezing weather. One skimmer, the 300-foot Nanuq, will be able to store 12,000 barrels of oil, and a tanker will have a 513,000-barrel capacity.
A separate rig would be available to come from nearby waters in case a relief well needed to be drilled to intercept and seal a leaking well.
The company says its blowout preventers are designed to close a well within seconds, and, learning from the BP disaster, the preventers have been enhanced with an additional set of shear rams. Tests will be done weekly. Shell also promises that its underwater capping system will be able to quickly close a leaking wellhead.

HIGHLIGHT: The latest political news from today's Times and a summary of the president's weekly address, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Congress ended a contentious policy fight on Friday with a vote to extend payroll tax cuts and unemployment benefits, Robert Pear and Jennifer Steinhauer report. The bill would maintain a 2 percentage-point payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans, provide added unemployment benefits for millions and protect doctors who accept Medicare from a large reimbursement cut.
President Obama on Friday toured the Everett, Wash., factory of one of the country's most glamorous exports, Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, vowing to boost government help for American companies seeking to sell their goods overseas, Helene Cooper reports. For Mr. Obama, export growth is one area where he can point to success, as United States exports hit record levels last year.

        
The Maryland House passed a measure legalizing same-sex marriage on Friday, Sabrina Tavernise reports.
The legislation is expected to pass in the Senate and then it will go to Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat who proposed it, to be signed into law.

        
Newt Gingrich still enjoys leading poll numbers in his home state of Georgia, but he expressed a touch of pessimism about the possibility of losing to Rick Santorum, who is surging among evangelical and Tea Party voters, Trip Gabriel reports.

        
Peter G. Flaherty, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's campaign, is a mild-mannered anomaly in the hard-charging world of presidential politics, Michael Barbaro writes. As Rick Santorum's standing continues to rise among Republicans, Mr. Flaherty has been handed the urgent and tricky task of winning over social and religious conservatives who remain suspicious of Mr. Romney's ideological commitment.
Weekly Address

        
 President Obama outlined his goals for supporting companies that open factories in the United States and create jobs for unemployed Americans. To encourage new manufacturing and help create a more stable economy, Mr. Obama wants to change the tax code. "No company should get a tax break for outsourcing jobs," he said. "Instead, tax breaks should go to manufacturers who set up shop here at home." In his plan, bigger tax breaks would go to high-tech manufacturers who create "jobs of the future," and any company that relocates to a struggling community would get help to pay for a new plant, new equipment or training for new employees.

HEADLINE: Santorum Calls Obama's 'Agenda' About 'Some Phony Theology'

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: At a campaign appearance, Rick Santorum described the "president's agenda. " "It's about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology. But no less a theology." 

 BODY:
3:55 p.m. | Updated COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Was Rick Santorum trying to imply that President Obama, who is Christian, actually responds to another theology?
At a campaign appearance here on Saturday morning, Mr. Santorum described the "president's agenda" as being "not about you. It's not about your quality of life. It's not about your job."
"It's about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology. But no less a theology," Mr. Santorum said, to wide applause.
His comments brought a swift rebuke from the Obama re-election campaign, which in the past has tended to focus more on attacks by Mitt Romney. Their quick attention may be an indication that Democrats believe Mr. Santorum's momentum now means he stands a decent chance of defeating Mr. Romney for the Republican nomination and facing Mr. Obama in the general election this fall.
"This is just the latest low in a Republican primary campaign that has been fueled by distortions, ugliness, and searing pessimism and negativity," Ben LaBolt, an Obama spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. He also described Mr. Santorum's comments as "a stark contrast with the president, who is focused every day on creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class."
In comments later made to reporters here, Mr. Santorum was asked if he believes Mr. Obama was less of a Christian for -- in Mr. Santorum's view -- "imposing his values" on the church.
"No one's suggesting that," Mr. Santorum said. "Obviously, as we all know in the Christian church there are a lot of different stripes of Christianity. I'm just saying he's imposing his values on the church, and I think that's wrong."
He added, "If the President says he's a Christian, he's a Christian."
Veiled suggestions that Mr. Obama is not a Christian - or not an American - have been an element of fringe politics since the last presidential election.
It go sot bad in 2008, in the opinion of Mr. Obama's general election opponent that year, John McCain, that Mr. McCain took back the microphone from a woman at one of his rallies who asserted that Mr. Obama was "an Arab." Mr. McCain then corrected the woman.
This year, Mr. Santorum has passed up similar opportunities to publicly correct misstatements about the president's background.
Last month, a woman at one of Mr. Santorum's campaign stops in Florida declared during a question-and-answer session that Mr. Obama was Muslim. According to an account by CNN, Mr. Santorum did not correct the woman's statement, and he later said it is not his job to correct such statements.
"My position is clear, the president's position is clear, I don't think the president's a Muslim, but I don't think it's my obligation to go out and repeat that every time someone who feels that way says something," Mr. Santorum said on CNN, after that Florida appearance.

HEADLINE: Bonds Backed by Mortgages Regain Allure

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Spurred by predictions of profits even in the worst forecasts, big-money investors are returning to the same complex loan pools that nearly washed away the financial system. 

 BODY:
Some Wall Street investors made money as the mortgage market boomed, while others profited when it fell apart.
Having reaped big gains during both of those turns, Greg Lippmann, a former star trader at Deutsche Bank, is now catching the next upswing -- buying the same securities built from mortgages that he bet against before the financial crisis erupted.
Mr. Lippmann is joined by other big-money investors -- mutual funds like Fidelity as well as hedge funds -- in riding a wave of interest in the same complex loan pools that nearly washed away the financial system.
The attraction is the price. Some mortgage bonds are so cheap that even in the worst forecasts, with home prices falling as much as 10 percent and foreclosures rising, investors say they can still make money.
"Given its significant underperformance in 2011, we believe the product is as cheap to broader markets as it has been in a long time," Mr. Lippmann, whose portfolio is heavy with subprime mortgage securities, wrote in a recent letter to investors.
More broadly, the nascent recovery in the mortgage bond market supports a view that the housing slump may have bottomed out. Sales of existing homes are picking up. State and federal authorities have reached a $26 billion settlement with the big banks that is expected to provide some mortgage relief. And the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been able to auction off billions of dollars of mortgage securities that it acquired as part of the financial crisis bailouts.
"There is light at the end of the tunnel," said Kenneth J. Taubes, the head of United States investment for Pioneer Investments, a global investment manager that owns these securities. "The mortgage crisis is getting behind us, and things are getting back to some semblance of normality."
That optimism is an about-face from 2006 and 2007, when Mr. Lippmann and others told investors that housing was a bubble ready to burst. On Wall Street, Mr. Lippmann became known as "Bubble Boy," and one of his traders wore a joking T-shirt that read, "I Shorted Your House."
His exploits were chronicled in Michael Lewis's best seller, "The Big Short," which described him as somewhat brash and crass. He was known for maintaining a sushi spreadsheet, where he ranked the top Japanese restaurants in Manhattan on ambiance, quality and cost.
These days, industry competitors describe Mr. Lippmann, who runs LibreMax Capital, as a more mellow presence. And he is much more positive about the market, telling investors that his fund is reducing its hedge against a potential market crash. Through a spokesman, Mr. Lippmann declined to comment.
Others in the industry are also bullish, pouring money back into mortgage securities. Trading has surged in recent weeks. Prices have risen more than 15 percent in the first two months of 2012, after dropping by as much as 40 percent last year.
"There was a lot of money waiting on the sidelines because yields were starting to look very attractive," said Jasraj Vaidya, a strategist at Barclays Capital. "Lots of it seems to have come out now."
Yet the tide could turn again and wipe out investors. Chief among the risks is Europe. The Continent's banks still hold a significant amount of United States mortgage securities, and if they are forced to sell assets, it could wreak havoc on the market.
Washington is a question mark, too. If banks have to pay for loans they issued under dubious circumstances, it would be a home run for investors, who could receive full payment for a mortgage in a security they bought at a discount. But if borrowers whose houses are worth less than their mortgages are able to reduce principal on a large scale, bond investors could suffer because the securities would be worth even less than they paid.
"As a money manager, you can't close your eyes to that potential outcome," said Jeffrey E. Gundlach, a founder of DoubleLine Capital, who has been buying mortgage securities since 2008. "To believe that this time we are really out of the woods and the prices will not drop again is dangerous. People made that argument a year ago."
The mortgage bond market is a very different creature than it was before the financial crisis. For one, it is much smaller. Very few residential mortgage-backed securities have been issued since the crisis. The market, at $1.3 trillion, is half the size it was at its peak and shrinks by an estimated $10 billion every month.
Despite the limited supply, prices remain cheap, in part because the assets are difficult to value. Hedge funds and big investors use computer systems to analyze the underlying loans and estimate, among other things, how many borrowers will default and how much money can be recovered in a foreclosure.
Take one security, JPALT 2006-S1 1A11, which was built from Alt-A loans, or mortgages that required little documentation verifying a borrower's income.
On the surface, the numbers are not encouraging. Of the 799 mortgages underpinning the bond, many in foreclosure-heavy California and Florida, about 21 percent are more than 60 days late on payments.
The annual default rate is about 7 percent, and of the homes sold out of foreclosure, investors take a 54 percent hit, according to data from Bloomberg. On average, about 5 percent of the homeowners refinanced their mortgages before they were due over the last 12 months.
That bond recently traded at nearly 70 cents on the dollar.
At that price, even if defaults and the losses increase, an investor can still make more than 5.4 percent, an analysis shows. In a rosier prediction, where defaults drop slightly and the losses on the sale of foreclosed homes stay flat, the bond returns nearly 8.7 percent.
"Price is a wonderful thing," said Chris Flanagan, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Yields in this market range anywhere from 4 or 5 percent up to 12 percent."
With long-term interest rates close to zero, such returns are hard to resist, even for investors who were punished in the housing bust. The American International Group, whose mortgage securities were acquired by the New York Fed in its more than $100 billion bailout in 2008, has been buying back some of those bonds. And a former mortgage team from Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt in 2008, formed One William Street, a hedge fund that manages more than $3 billion in assets.
As for Mr. Lippmann, his reputation has made it both easier and more difficult to get commitments from investors. Some are impressed by his well-publicized bet against the mortgage market. Others are turned off by his high profile in an industry known for secrecy and discretion.
LibreMax, made up of several members of Mr. Lippmann's team from Deutsche Bank, has raised more than $1 billion in a little over a year. His performance has been relatively strong during a period of market turmoil - up 2 percent last year and a little more than 6 percent since beginning operations.
Like his rivals, Mr. Lippmann cites his experience in the housing market - including its boom and bust - as a principal selling point for his fund.
"Because we have a trading history, I think we understand very well how the street works, better than perhaps people who didn't work in trading before that haven't had that experience," he said at a Bloomberg hedge fund conference in 2010.

HEADLINE: In Georgia, Gingrich Campaigns on Guns and Gas

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich would not predict victory in the Georgia primary on March 6, but he did hammer at President Obama's energy policy. 

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- In every state where he campaigns, Newt Gingrich weaves local issues into his stump speech, and in Georgia he aimed at a sweet spot: "Let's be clear what this election is all about," he told supporters. "We believe in the right to bear arms, and we like to bear the arms in our trucks."
His audience burst into laughter and applause. Mr. Gingrich repeated the line during two days of Georgia rallies on Friday and Saturday, where he met large, enthusiastic crowds, including at his final event at a hotel here where teenage cheerleaders, in town for a competition, stood on one another's shoulders at the back of the room to be able to see. 
Mr. Gingrich would not predict victory in the Georgia primary on March 6. Rick Santorum's appeal among the large base of evangelical Christians is growing, and a group supporting Mitt Romney is attacking Mr. Gingrich in television ads. "This is the wildest process I've ever seen," he said of the nominating race, comparing it to the Space Mountain roller coaster at Disneyland. 
"It is obviously my home state, and it's very, very important we do well here," he told reporters. "We actually have a very good chance of doing well here, and that gives us a springboard then to go across the whole country. I think that's part of what we are counting on."
He raised an aggressive argument with President Obama over energy, framing it as a policy disagreement and a skirmish in the culture wars. 
It was in the context of lengthy discussions at each stop of what he calls his "American energy policy," a plan to dramatically increase oil and natural gas drilling on federal lands and offshore, which he promises will drop the price of gasoline to $2.50 a gallon from its current national average of $3.52.
His emphasis dovetailed with a decision by Republicans in Congress this week to hammer the president on the increasing price of gasoline. 
"This debate is a debate we want to have," House Speaker John A. Boehner told his caucus in a closed-door meeting this week.
Mr. Gingrich used similar language, saying, "I think gasoline has reached a tipping point where people really want to talk about energy more intensely."
Indulging his appetite for policy details, he described in depth a bonanza in natural gas that has become accessible through deep drilling in shale around the country, as well as shale oil reserves in North Dakota. The North Dakota gusher, he said, has led to a state unemployment rate of 3.5 percent and a series of state tax cuts.
These new energy sources, he said, "are destroying the left's argument that we have limited resources and therefore we need government to ration."
Many experts in the economics of oil dispute that more domestic drilling would significantly lower prices at the pump, because the United States produces only a small fraction of world oil, around 10 percent, and prices are determined by global supply and demand. 
A study in 2009 by the government's Energy Information Administration found that with unlimited offshore drilling, the country would produce 500,000 more barrels a day, but on the world market, that would translate to prices of only 3 cents a gallon less for American drivers.
The United States now produces more oil from all sources than during the past 20 years, but gasoline prices are still rising - because of increased global demand.
Mr. Gingrich pushed back on this objection. "It would be pretty hard to argue it wouldn't be less expensive than under the Obama model," he said.
Rather than framing the argument as one between the "drill, baby, drill" camp and environmentalists, Mr. Gingrich said he viewed it as a skirmish with liberalism. "This is all a matter of cultural warfare," he said. "These are people who believe if you're a tenured faculty member who rides your bicycle" to work, you object to others driving a pickup truck. "This is an administration that is deeply opposed to Americans having the right to choose the kind of car they want to drive," he said of the president. 
A liberal's ideal car, Mr. Gingrich maintained, was a Chevy Volt. And that led him to his new joke. "Here's my point: you can't put a gun rack in a Volt."

HEADLINE: In Germany, Choosing The Future

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
DUSSELDORF, Germany -- A hockey jersey hung in each player's locker. It bore Germany's national colors, black trimmed in red and gold. The front was emblazoned with an eagle above the word Deutschland. This would be Evan Kaufmann's first time wearing the jersey. He removed it from the hanger and turned it around to see his family name spelled in capital letters.
He would recall feeling a tingle of excitement. He felt something else, too, emotions that crisscrossed like the laces of his skates. He was proud to wear the jersey but also solemn about what history had done to the name on the back. His great-grandfather starved to death by the Nazis. His great-grandmother herded to extermination on a train to Auschwitz. His grandfather shuttled between ghettos and concentration camps, surviving somehow, finding a displaced sister after the war, pushing her from a hospital in a wheelbarrow after her lower left leg was amputated because of frostbite.
On Feb. 10, Kaufmann finished dressing and skated onto the ice at a tournament in Belarus. With his initial shift, he became one of the few Jews to represent Germany in elite international sports since World War II, the first in ice hockey since the 1930s and perhaps the most visible to have had family members murdered in the Holocaust, according to sports historians and Jewish officials. 
''It was almost surreal,'' said Kaufmann, 27, a forward who was born in Minnesota and is the second-leading goal scorer here for the DEG Metro Stars of the German professional league. ''From an achievement standpoint, it was amazing to represent the country. But it was pretty insane to think about what my grandpa had to survive to allow me to be where I am today and how it's come a long way from then to now.''
He came to Germany four years ago, not as a symbol but as a yearning hockey player. Slight at 5 feet 9 inches and 165 pounds, undrafted by the N.H.L. out of the University of Minnesota in 2008, Kaufmann found his best pro opportunity in perhaps the least likely place. The country where his great-grandparents and other relatives were murdered now offered him accelerated citizenship because of his family's brutalized past.
In hockey terms, Kauffmann is considered fully German, eligible for the national team, unbound by restrictions on the number of foreigners allowed to play in the domestic pro league.
On his Dusseldorf club team, some international players wear a small flag on their jerseys denoting their home countries. Kaufmann displays the German flag.
''With each year, you do feel a little more loyalty toward Germany, a stronger connection,'' he said. ''I still consider myself more American, but from a hockey standpoint, I've committed myself to Germany. It's something I'm proud about.''
Issues Beyond Game
In June, Kaufmann's wife, Danielle, 25, is due to give birth to the couple's first child. As fatherhood approaches and news of his personal story begins to spread, there is an issue beyond hockey to consider: while the murder of six million Jews was a barbaric collective, forgiveness among their descendants must be individual. Has enough time passed? Will enough time ever pass? Each must decide for himself.
''Obviously, you never want to forget,'' Kaufmann said. ''But everybody deserves a second chance and a right to rectify their mistakes. Most people today had nothing to do with it. I'm not going to hold it against a whole country for what happened long ago. You're never going to move forward if you keep doing that.''
Those who agree with him point out that more than 100,000 Jews live in Germany today, far fewer than the 550,000 before the Nazis came to power but many more than two decades ago, before an influx from the former the Soviet Union. They note that Germany has confronted its Nazi past and made Holocaust denial a crime, that many Germans are committed to reconciliation and acceptance of responsibility.
''We're not there yet, but we are on the way to being less exotic and a little more normal,'' said Dieter Graumann, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Kaufmann's presence on the national hockey team ''is something to be glad about and rejoice.''
''It shows that Jews in Germany are not strange and something to be wondered at,'' he said, ''but that they are normal citizens, wanting to take part in all of society.''
No one can say precisely how many elite Jewish athletes have represented postwar Germany. Fewer than a dozen, many say, but even that might err on the high side.
''Of course it's absolutely rare because we have so very few Jews in Germany,'' Graumann said. ''There were only 30,000 here 20 years ago.''
A South African-born swimmer named Sarah Poewe won a bronze relay medal for Germany at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Another swimmer, Herbert Klein, won a bronze medal at the 1952 Helsinki Games, but there is debate whether he was Jewish. For some, such ambiguity represents thankful progress that Jews are no longer so easily put on lists, filed into categories.
''We don't ask those kinds of questions anymore, fortunately,'' said Ella Rujder, the executive secretary of the sports organization Maccabi Germany.
The German women's team that won the European indoor field hockey championship last month included two or three Jewish players, Rujder said. About 200 participants from Germany took part last July at the European Maccabi Games, a kind of Olympics for Jewish athletes.
Germany and Israel also have regular exchanges of young athletes. An Israeli forward named Itay Shechter plays in the Bundesliga, and yearly, the German soccer federation honors those who fight racism and anti-Semitism in memory of Julius Hirsch, a Jewish star killed at Auschwitz.
''I think it's fine for an American Jew to represent Germany,'' said Margaret Bergmann Lambert, a champion high jumper who was prevented from competing for Germany at the 1936 Berlin Olympics because she was Jewish and who, at 97, now lives in Queens. ''It's a step forward.''
A Question of Allegiance
It is not so unambiguous for everyone. In May, Kaufmann and Germany could face the United States at the world hockey championships. And again at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. It is a silly question to ask, as someone did, whether he would want to defeat the Americans. Any competitor would want to defeat his opponent. But it is another aspect to sort out in a story that will never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.
''I have mixed emotions,'' said Menachem Z. Rosensaft, a New York lawyer who is the vice president of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendants. ''I think everyone has to make his own decisions in this respect. It is clear for Kaufmann that hockey is the most important priority. Just like there are Israelis or other Jews who have settled in Germany out of economic or career convenience, he is doing the same. I do not presume to judge him.''
At the same time, Rosensaft said he felt ''a bitter aftertaste and a certain degree of sadness'' for Kaufmann. ''He has effectively turned his back on the United States and has willingly taken on citizenship to identify henceforth as a German,'' Rosensaft said. ''That, in terms of his family history, is at best a somber reality. There is a question in my mind whether a Jew should voluntarily go to Germany and take on that role.''
Recently, Kaufmann was interviewed by Rabbi Jason Miller of Detroit, who wrote in a blog that he approved of his career choice, saying, ''This is just one more way in which the Jewish community will come to view Germany differently.''
One of Miller's readers, Jason Klein, the president of a Web-based company that helps patients find discounted drugs, responded online: ''My family is 25 percent of what it once was pre-WWII. I subscribe to never forgive, never forget and I can't imagine (no matter how talented I was) a meaningless sport being worthy of this. ...Don't get me wrong. I don't blame the Germans of today for the crimes of their grandfathers, but I certainly wouldn't be in the spotlight supporting their country and waving their flag.''
The Ancestral Village
Kaufmann has seen this and similar rebukes. He and his family believe such views are corrosive. Perhaps the best understanding of their mercy for others comes from the place where their forebears found none for themselves. It is the family's prewar village of Wittlich, located three hours south of Dusseldorf in the wine-making region of the Moselle River Valley.
On Thursday, the village of 15,000 was full of young people costumed for Carnival. At the local Jewish studies center, a photograph from 1935 showed Evan Kaufmann's grandfather, Kurt, smiling a thin smile and wearing a crown at school for the Jewish festival of Purim. Kurt's sister Ilse sat next to him in a fancy outfit. But these joyous times were ending as persecution of the Jews accelerated. According to the book, ''Jewish Life in Wittlich,'' Kurt and Ilse Kaufmann would become the only students to survive deportation to the concentration camps.
In a postwar letter, Kurt Kaufmann wrote of persisting on chance, turnips and potato skins. After being liberated, he found his sister in a Berlin hospital. Eventually, they made their way to the United States. As he aged, he still had nightmares and other psychological scars, but he felt no ill will toward Germany and its people, said Farley Kaufmann, Kurt's son and Evan's father. The elder Kaufmann continued to drink wine from the region, gave an oral history and, before he died at age 68 in 1990, he had planned to visit Wittlich for the first time since his family fled in 1939.
It is a place, like other places, that took everything the Kaufmanns had. But it has since become a place of remembrance. There is a Jewish cemetery there, a study center. The desecrated synagogue had been restored as a museum and culture center. On display is a Torah scroll that Kurt Kaufmann helped rescue, storing it in the attic of his father's upholstery business. It was found years later at the family home, refurbished by new owners and still standing at 26 Tiergarten Street.
''I'm sure some people don't like it,'' Farley Kaufmann, a certified public accountant in suburban Minneapolis, said of his son's playing in Germany. ''I understand and sympathize. It's bittersweet to me. I thought long and hard, would my dad be happy or not with what Evan is doing? I honestly feel my dad would be very proud. He didn't hold grudges.''
In visits to Wittlich and elsewhere in Germany, Farley Kaufmann said it had begun to feel ''more like home.''
''The people are nice,'' he said. ''I see German people trying to educate about what happened. I don't see anybody denying what happened. I don't see anything but people trying to make sure it doesn't happen again.''
Unsettling Moments
On the first day Evan Kaufmann spent in Germany, in July 2008, he went for a walk in Dusseldorf to stay awake after a transatlantic flight. An elderly man approached and began saying something repetitive in German. Kaufmann did not understand. Then the man said in English, ''Jew? Jew?''
Kaufmann was shocked. He had only just arrived; already a random encounter had validated every reservation he and his family had about him being in Germany.
''I don't know,'' he told the man guardedly. ''Are you?''
''Yes, I am,'' the man said. ''I saw your nose. I thought maybe you were Jewish, too.''
The man explained that he had gone to Israel before or after the war. Then he went on his way.
''I had a feeling in my stomach that something bad had just happened,'' Kaufmann said.
There have been other unsettling moments. He and his wife were once intercepted by the police at a synagogue here and made to show their identification. Security was tight because the synagogue had been firebombed in 2000. Down the street from their apartment, a swastika has been spray-painted on an electrical box.
''It makes us a little hesitant when we decorate for Hanukkah,'' Danielle Kaufmann said. ''But it doesn't stop us. We feel very comfortable here. We're not hiding who we are. We are very proud where we came from. We've been embraced. Germany's a different place now.''
On a daily basis, life here feels no different from life in Minneapolis, Evan said. Jewish customs and holidays have become a connecting point between himself and his German club teammates. Evan takes a break from play for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. Danielle bakes Hanukkah cookies for the Metro Stars' holiday party and pastries to share for Purim.
''They never really understand that we don't celebrate Christmas,'' Evan said with a laugh.
Gradually, he has shed his reluctance and begun to share some details about his family history. If it is not exactly healing, it is an attempt to inform, to build a bridge, to help show that Germany is a more open place now. His teammates seem curious, surprised.
''Evan is the first Jew I really met,'' said Patrick Reimer, a teammate on the Metro Stars and Kaufmann's roommate last weekend on the German national team's trip to Belarus.
Reimer said he felt a sense of gratitude that a Jew could be named to the national hockey team and sad that it had taken so long. Since the 1930s, in fact, when a star named Rudi Ball led Germany to a bronze medal at the 1932 Winter Olympics and was said to be the only Jewish participant for Germany at the 1936 Winter Games in the Bavarian resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen.
To be honest, Reimer added, he did not pry into details of the darker events in the Kaufmann family history. ''There is still a barrier in the head,'' he said. ''We both know it should never have happened, what happened 70 years ago.''
Frieder Feldmann, a spokesman for the DEG Metro Stars and a history teacher at a private school, has encouraged Kaufmann to tell his story. But even Feldmann fumbles for the words, seeks the neutral ground of euphemism.
''I can't speak with someone when my people killed his people,'' Feldmann said.
Hockey is safer territory. On that subject, the Metro Stars speak effusively of Kaufmann, his calm, his ability to read the game, his willing muscularity for a small player. ''I can use him in any situation,'' Coach Jeff Tomlinson, a Canadian, said.
At the tournament in Belarus, Kaufmann was named Germany's star of one game. On Tuesday, in league play, he scored in a victory over first-place Berlin. On Friday, he scored again in a shootout victory. There are still times, he said, he wonders whether he is doing the right thing. What would his grandfather think?
''Knowing he was planning on coming back after all those years, I think it shows he was ready to forgive,'' Kaufmann said. ''That helps me be comfortable with it.''
Next season, he will play for Nuremberg, which has its own fraught history. It trivializes the Holocaust to call Kaufmann's presence in Germany closure or a happy ending, Feldmann said. ''But if it is ever possible to have peace in this story,'' he said, ''maybe it is a small brick in a good wall.''

MICHELLE DOCKERY
It's a ''Downton Abbey'' scandal at least as shocking as Lady Mary's dalliance with that Turkish diplomat: in some Season 2 scenes, Michelle Dockery, who plays the eldest Crawley daughter on the PBS period drama, wasn't wearing her restrictive undergarments! ''There are a few costumes that I am corset-free,'' Dockery says, ''but I had to keep that very quiet on set because the other women would have been very jealous.'' The trend will continue when ''Downton'' hits the 1920s next season -- and elsewhere. ''I tend to avoid corsets and floor-length skirts in real life,'' she says.
Annie Merrylees, owner of London's My Big Buddy, the first all-male nanny -- or manny -- agency, refuses to make the obvious joke. ''Nobody asks for men who are hot, no,'' she says. But she notes that part of the demand comes down to the fact that ''men are new to this. And when you are this new, you are open to doing anything.'' Well, almost anything.

First came ''soccer moms,'' then ''Nascar dads'' and ''wired workers.'' What will this year bring? Tebow teens? IPad stepdads? There's at least one subgroup that candidates might do better to ignore: ''overemployed consultants.''

HEADLINE: Push to Save Fighting Sioux Name Leaves North Dakota in Costly Limbo

BYLINE: By PAT BORZI

 BODY:
The lobby of Ralph Engelstad Arena at the University of North Dakota contains multiple nods to the Fighting Sioux nickname the university must retire to avoid N.C.A.A. sanctions. Besides the huge Indian head logo in the marble floor and assorted historical photographs, there is the Sioux Shop, where more than 90 percent of the merchandise features the logo or the nickname.
''That's where the demand is,'' the store manager Jason Carlson said. ''Basic economics, right?'' 
The shop and the arena are operated by a management company, not the university, which is why so much Sioux merchandise remains. To comply with N.C.A.A. policy prohibiting Native American imagery, the university spent more than two years scrubbing references to the nickname and logo, including buying new uniforms and renaming its Web site and booster clubs. The state Board of Higher Education mandated the transition be substantially completed by Dec. 31, 2011. Selling off Sioux items in the shop figured to be one of the last steps.
Now, it is all at a standstill.
On Feb. 7, a group supporting the nickname filed enough petition signatures to force a statewide referendum on whether to retain it. That complicated an issue that finally appeared settled last November after seven years of debate, when the state legislature repealed a law requiring the university to keep the nickname. The law had failed to budge the N.C.A.A., which reaffirmed to state officials that the university could not host or participate in an N.C.A.A. postseason game as the Fighting Sioux.
The signatures led to, as North Dakota Athletic Director Brian Faison said, ''a repeal of the repeal.'' Under state law, that meant reinstating the original law passed in March 2011. So while the fight they thought was over continues, university officials have been forced to halt the transition, reverse it, then manage the consequences.
As recently as Feb. 11, North Dakota fans visiting the university's athletics Web site found their browsers redirected from fightingsioux.com to a new domain name, UNDsports.com. By last Monday, fightingsioux.com had been restored, and announcers resumed calling teams the Fighting Sioux. Under the legislation passed in November, the team had three years to come up with a new nickname.
Until this is resolved, either by referendum in June or by a state Supreme Court decision before that, the university finds itself in a costly pickle. Faison said the athletic department spent $750,000 on the original transition. He declined to predict the cost of changing back.
''To do it twice, it's hard to estimate, but it's going to be costly, no question,'' Faison said in a telephone interview from Grand Forks. ''And we may be turning around and doing it again.''
Meanwhile, Faison and other university officials are trying to convince voters that retaining the nickname would do irreparable harm to North Dakota's athletic teams. Faison fears it will jeopardize the university's move from the Great West to the Big Sky Conference on July 1 in all sports but men's hockey. Faison said he had that impression from a conference call with Big Sky athletic directors last week.
''The reality is, our ability to be in a Division I conference is definitely at risk here,'' Faison said, adding, ''We cannot survive as a Division I independent in this area.''
Persuading teams to play nonconference games in Grand Forks can be difficult because of its remote location, Faison said. Filling a basketball or football schedule without a conference affiliation would be impossible, he said, especially because many institutions refuse to play anyone using an Indian nickname.
Faison said the reversal caused Iowa to cancel a home-and-home women's basketball series beginning next season in Grand Forks. ''As you can imagine, the opportunity for North Dakota to host a Big Ten school, that's a big deal,'' Faison said.
The university also lost a swim meet with the Hawkeyes and a softball series with Wisconsin, he said.
And future series with North Dakota's biggest rivals in hockey remain in peril. Minnesota and Wisconsin generally do not schedule games against programs that use Indian nicknames but made an exception for North Dakota, a fellow member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. All three leave the W.C.H.A. for other conferences in 2013.
''By institution policy, if we continue to be the Fighting Sioux, they can't play us,'' Faison said. ''So you've lost the ability to play your two top rivals. How important is that? It's important.''
The Big Sky commissioner, Doug Fullerton, said the conference still planned to add North Dakota. But, he added, that may change if more nonconference universities objecting to the nickname refuse to play North Dakota. ''I know, because I know coaches, that it's already being used against them in recruiting,'' Fullerton said in a telephone interview.
Even the men's hockey coach Dave Hakstol, a former Sioux defenseman and a vehement supporter of the nickname, said last week that the time had come to let it go. Hakstol believes the Big Sky will not admit North Dakota as the Fighting Sioux, and that will cost all teams top recruits.
''It's no longer a debate on the use of the Fighting Sioux name,'' he said during his weekly news conference. ''It's becoming more of a straight-up decision based on cold, hard facts.''
Carlson is not sure how to proceed. He said the university told him to stop ordering Sioux items after June 30. Several times, he has asked the university's licensing agency whether the referendum call negates that deadline. ''There's still no change,'' he said in a telephone interview.
Sioux fans are not storming the store to stock up, Carlson said, though a few are thinking ahead.
''We had one gentleman say he was going to buy six hats so he could break out a new one every year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: It Ain't Just Pickles

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
A couple of years ago, Chris Woehrle grew sick of corporate life and decided to become an artisanal food craftsman -- any kind of artisanal food craftsman. ''I spent a month making every item I could think of: kimchi, harissa, salsa, every kind of pickle imaginable, a bunch of different herb mustards,'' says Woehrle, who worked for a music conglomerate. And every time, he quickly discovered, ''there were eight companies already doing it well.''
This is because Woehrle lives in Brooklyn, ground zero of the artisanal-food universe, where competition is intense. Eventually, though, he and his partner stumbled upon a hole in the market: handcrafted, all-natural beef jerky. And so Kings County Jerky was born. Woehrle expects that the company will be profitable in a year or two, which is pretty good for a new small business. 
Like many successful entrepreneurs in the United States, Woehrle followed what seems like an ancient business model: making things by hand. He rejected the high-volume, low-margin commodity business in which ConAgra and Pepsi/Co compete against each other with their Slim Jim and Matador jerky products. Instead, Kings County found a niche in which engaged consumers will pay a premium for a specialty product.
Contrary to popular belief, the revival of craft manufacturing isn't just a fad for Brooklyn hipsters. (Woehrle resists the term. His beard is too short, he says.) Jason Premo, an entrepreneur I recently met in Greenville, S.C., is also studying the unmet needs of his customers and carefully making the things they most value, albeit on a more industrial scale. Premo, a former corporate manager, learned that many large companies faced challenges getting their hands on precision parts (like rocketry propulsion housings for ICBMs or rotor hardware for Black Hawk helicopters) that must be made of high-performance metal alloys and cut to exacting standards. So he and a partner bought a tiny metal-machining shop, invested in some precision machines and hired a few advanced machining experts. Their company, Adex Machining Technologies, now has contracts with Boeing and G.E.
It's tempting to look at craft businesses as simply a rejection of modern industrial capitalism. But the craft approach is actually something new -- a happy refinement of the excesses of our industrial era plus a return to the vision laid out by capitalism's godfather, Adam Smith. One of his central insights in ''The Wealth of Nations'' is the importance of specialization. When everyone does everything -- sews their own clothes, harvests their own crops, bakes their own bread -- each act becomes inefficient, because generalists are rarely as quick or able as specialists.
For most of human history, though, people needed to do a bit of everything to survive. The result was a profoundly inefficient economy that required almost everyone to work very hard just to create enough of the essentials for survival; even then, famines were still disturbingly common. Efficiency, Smith explained, comes when individuals focus on specific tasks. The miracle of the Industrial Revolution was that through specialization, humankind became far more productive.
In the United States, this works so well that, despite all the economic pain we're enduring, the average American leads a shockingly good life by any historical or international standard. As other countries move into mass production, the United States, even in the depths of economic doldrums, has a level of wealth that translates to fewer people willing to do dreary, assembly-line work at extremely low wages. More significant, we're entering an era of hyperspecialization. Huge numbers of middle-class people are now able to make a living specializing in something they enjoy, including creating niche products for other middle-class people who have enough money to indulge in buying things like high-end beef jerky.
Economically, this was an expected outcome. The hot field of happiness economics argues, rather persuasively, that once people reach some level of comfort, they are willing -- even eager -- to trade in potential earnings at a lucrative but uninspiring job for less (but comfortable) pay at more satisfying work. Some research by the Chicago economist Erik Hurst suggests that half of entrepreneurs start businesses as much to pursue happiness as to make money.
When it comes to profit and satisfaction, craft business is showing how American manufacturing can compete in the global economy. Many of the manufacturers who are thriving in the United States (they exist, I swear!) have done so by avoiding direct competition with low-cost commodity producers in low-wage nations. Instead, they have scrutinized the market and created customized products for less price-sensitive customers. Facebook and Apple, Starbucks and the Boston Beer Company (which makes Sam Adams lager) show that people who identify and meet untapped needs can create thousands of jobs and billions in wealth. As our economy recovers, there will be nearly infinite ways to meet custom needs at premium prices.
Meanwhile, the idea (or at least the hope) is that as China and other emerging nations develop, the United States can stay on the profitable forefront, delivering specific high-tech parts to their factories and the latest upmarket foods to their middle class. According to this view, the fracturing of industrial manufacturing, however painful, has helped prepare parts of the economy for this new course.
The transition to an increasingly craft-centered economy will not be without agony. Woehr/le and Premo succeeded because both had access to investors and the innate ability to segue from the salaried confines of corporate life to a much riskier, entrepreneurial world. A craft economy is far less stable: those who succeed this year may fail the next, as their once-unique products become commodities made cheaply overseas. Still, this new world seems, to some extent, inevitable. Instead of rolling our eyes at self-conscious Brooklyn hipsters pickling everything in sight, we might look to them as guides to the future of the American economy. Just don't tell them that. It would break their hearts to be called model 21st-century capitalists.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. The craft economy is the fulfillment of Adam Smith's notion of capitalism.
2. And it extends to all kinds of industries.
3. With luck, someone is already studying the I.P.A. tastes of middle-class Chinese.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Uniting America Through National Service?

 BODY:
Readers react to a proposal to reinstitute the draft, with civilian service as an alternative.
The Letter
To the Editor:
David Brooks suggested in a recent column that the country needs a national service program to unite the diverging classes in society. He's right.
Not long ago, we had one that did so very well. It was the draft. Every young man -- regrettably, only men -- shared a potential obligation to his country.
Any serious discussion of comprehensive national service means talking about a draft. It's hard to imagine the Supreme Court upholding nondefense conscription, but if civilian service were an alternative to military duty, the prospects would improve.
The all-volunteer military is exemplary for its professionalism, sacrifice, meritocracy and diversity. (I have a son with two college degrees who enlisted.) But the benefits and burdens need to be shared more widely. There have been too many multiple deployments of regulars and reserves, and if draftees were in the mix once again, perhaps there would be no more wars of choice. 
Many domestic needs could be served by a comprehensive national service program. Like the Depression's best idea, the Civilian Conservation Corps, it could involve people from all classes in repairing our parks, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. It could also bring fresh ideas and talent to teaching, law enforcement, social work and other underpaid public services. The benefits to our national character, as Mr. Brooks suggests, would be immense.
There are past and present models of a national service program in more than a dozen other nations. It is time we gave it a try.
MARTIN A. DYCKMAN Waynesville, N.C., Feb. 14, 2012
The writer is a retired associate editor and columnist for The St. Petersburg Times.
Readers React
Mandatory national service, let alone reinstatement of the military draft, would be a giant step backward from America's general progress toward greater personal freedom. I have little sympathy for so-called libertarians who fulminate about taxes and environmental regulations destroying our freedoms.
But I have a real problem with the government uprooting young people from their homes, careers and families and dictating to them what they must do for the next few years. And if they say no, presumably they would go to jail -- the traditional and only effective penalty for draft resistance.
When the fate of the world and the lives of millions are at stake, as in World War II, conscription is justified. But to test out a questionable social hypothesis, proposed and enacted by older people who would no doubt find an excuse to themselves be exempted? No thanks.
GREG SCHWED New York, Feb. 15, 2012
Although a high school science teacher, I was drafted into the Army in 1968. I was, in my own words, ''a reluctant warrior,'' but I saw no personally acceptable alternative to answering my country's call. In 1969 I was commissioned as a lieutenant, and I served in Vietnam in 1970 and 1971.
This was a formative time in my life for many reasons, but perhaps most important I learned to work with and lead others from diverse religions, social classes and education levels under the most difficult of conditions. I hope that my comrades in arms learned something from me as well.
Today, much of the nation under 50 has become insulated from such experiences, making it hard to ''feel another's pain.'' I strongly support the concept of mandatory national service, not only as a character builder and unifying experience but also as a way of joining together to rebuild our infrastructure and economy and improve our education system.
JOHN HENNINGSON Guilford, Conn., Feb. 15, 2012
The death of my nephew, Sgt. Will Stacey of the Marines, in Afghanistan last month, on his fourth tour of duty, has led this liberal academic to examine her own assumptions and to consider, deeply and painfully, the implications of an all-volunteer military.
I have concluded that an all-volunteer military, while professional and effective, is bad for the country. It allows the rest of us not to have to think about the war; it allows us not to engage politically; it allows politicians to wage war lightly.
Further, it enables those of us who have chosen not to enlist or serve to think about the military and those who volunteer (and fight and die) in ways that diminish them.
Ultimately, I believe, an all-volunteer military diminishes that very necessary idea that we are all in this nation together, and that there are times our individual comfort and desires must be subordinated for the good of that nation.

Go ahead, print all those level-headed, thoughtful letters about bringing back the draft. I'm betting not many will come from anyone who's ever been drafted, could be drafted or wants to be drafted. Every time this issue comes up, every time some pundit or politician starts in about the goodness of national service, I think of that old saber-rattler Dick Cheney, who cited ''other priorities'' when asked why he didn't serve.
Only someone who has never experienced the attention-focusing qualities of being shot at can write self-assuredly about a draft's character-building benefits. National service doesn't build character, it reveals character, and you need character to even consider serving. If you haven't walked that walk, don't even think about talking the talk.
GARRETT TOMCZAK Golden Valley, Minn., Feb. 15, 2012
The writer served in Vietnam with the Third Marine Division.
Why shouldn't we all be expected to devote meaningful time in our lives to doing work of genuine benefit to others? This national service program should apply to a broad age range, should offer some tax advantage to those participating as a sliding alternative to compensation, and should extend to service in other countries as well as other communities, in addition to a local service option for those who do not want to go somewhere else.
Imagine the conversations around the country with everyone posing the same question: How will you fulfill this new responsibility in being a good citizen?
TERRY MAGUIRE Chapel Hill, N.C., Feb. 15, 2012
The idea of a civilian service program is a distraction from the need for real jobs. Rather than dragging unwilling breadwinners from the working class into forced labor, we need to implement a national job creation program. I guarantee that there will be no shortage of applicants.
JERRY ENGELBACH Patzcuaro, Mexico, Feb. 15, 2012
I have always agreed that a comprehensive national service program for 18-year-olds could be of great benefit to America, both for infrastructure maintenance and expansion and for the positive effect it would undoubtedly have on national unity.
But I do not believe that the program should be centered around the military draft. Military service should be part of the plan, but the emphasis should be on civilian service.
Also, it is critically important that every able-bodied young American participate. One of the negative aspects of the Vietnam-era draft was that it allowed the privileged many ways to escape service.
Finally, a speculation: Perhaps the introduction of a large number of relatively unskilled, government-sponsored young workers into the work force would have an impact on at least two of our labor-related woes: large numbers of undocumented immigrant workers who seem to have little difficulty finding jobs, and the lack of empathy for workers shown by many of the corporate and academic elite.
GREG SHENAUT Davis, Calif., Feb. 15, 2012
Not only does the nation face practical problems that youthful energy could help solve, but we also face a profound malaise of meaning. We have no common bonding agent, no leadership capable of igniting us in common cause. We have lost our appetite for the notion of collective pain and collective good. A year or two of mandatory national service would help revive not just a ''can do'' but a ''must do'' spirit.
My family and I recently spent a year in Israel, where there is such a common expectation. While there may be problems in a system that socializes youth into protecting a nation and its values, there are great benefits as well. Young people have a sense of purpose and responsibility -- they see themselves as having a stake in the future and they value what the nation stands for.
We in the United States would benefit from such a perspective. Mandatory national service is a solution whose time is now.
JILL BLAIR Seattle, Feb. 16, 2012
The writer is the founder and former executive director of the Grantmaker Forum on Community and National Service.
Mr. Dyckman's plan to give American young people the choice of serving the nation through the military draft or a national service program is a splendid, outstanding idea. It would help resolve a whole host of problems.
Unfortunately, like all splendid, outstanding ideas in 21st-century America, it will face so much criticism and opposition that it will never be implemented.
ROBERT JOHN BENNETT Dusseldorf, Germany, Feb. 15, 2012
The Writer Responds
America fought World War II for three years and eight months, less time than has now been spent in harm's way by troops serving their fourth or fifth combat tours. The loss of Dr. Sainsbury's nephew is a consequence of having allowed the politicians, as she writes, ''to wage war lightly.'' When so few families bear the risks, burdens and sorrows of military service -- however voluntarily -- it means that the majority have invested nothing of themselves. But they cannot escape moral responsibility.
As several of the writers observe, national service could also pay rich domestic dividends. The prospects may be as politically remote as Mr. Bennett asserts, but that should not stop Americans from asking whether the investment might benefit our society more than keeping some people's taxes low.
As for Mr. Tomczak's skepticism, I can speak only for myself as a veteran and the father of a soldier in Afghanistan, but I'd wager that support for a draft, if fairly administered, would be highest among those who have served. The old draft gave me the option of enlisting in the Army Reserve, where I learned -- as did so many others -- that America was made up of more than college boys. We simply had to get along.
I'm convinced from observing government over the ensuing four decades that the loss of this shared experience is largely to blame for the uncivil state of today's politics.

HEADLINE: Getting the Job Done On Route 53

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for The Chicago News Cooperative.
Since American politics now meets the Webster's definition of gridlock, the entire Congress should descend on busy Route 53 at the Cook-Lake county border.
There, lawmakers could meet long-dueling parties who may end a 50-year-old policy dispute and show what can happen when deep differences change to constructive regional vision. ''Perhaps this will be a model of how to work with others in a sandbox,'' said David Stolman, chairman of the Lake County Board.
The ''this'' is the Illinois Route 53/120 Blue Ribbon Advisory Council. Sexy title, eh? It was formed last year by the Illinois Tollway to fish or cut bait on extending Route 53 about a dozen miles, an issue that has exhausted policy makers since 1962. 
Route 53 just dies at Lake Cook Road on the Cook County-Lake County line. Think of it as a high-pressure hose on the edge of your property -- in this case, spewing traffic over local roads that cannot handle it. About 103,000 cars exit at that point each day, many driven by Chicago commuters.
Lake, the state's third-most-populous county, grew nearly 10 percent in the past decade and is an extremely sensitive area environmentally. The mayors of some communities want to lure business, but others worry about sprawl and its impact on wetlands, organic farms, heron rookeries and endangered species.
Haggling began when Kennedy was president, and the Illinois Legislature much later approved an extension of Route 53. But spats and litigation -- disputes short of Middle East passions but epitomizing counterproductive rancor -- derailed it.
The notion of some kind of resolution was hatched by Paula Wolff, a politically adroit Hyde Park resident. She is the chairwoman of the Tollway and Chicago City Collegesboards.
Let's decide if an extension of Route 53 should be built, she urged -- what it might look like, how much it would cost and how it would be paid for.
The council has two co-chairmen, Mr. Stolman, an advocate for an extension, and George Ranney, a civic-minded and wealthy businessman-conservationist who developed Prairie Crossing, a sustainable community of national renown in Grayslake, and a longtime opponent.
The 29 council members include politicians, planners, union leaders, environmentalists, engineers, techies and college presidents. Prominent planning, transportation and environmental consultants assist as real democracy upends a tradition of transit agencies jamming already-hatched plans down taxpayers' throats.
The secret sauce is the planners' agreement on goals of greater mobility, relieving congestion, environmental sensitivity, design innovation and transparency. A public meeting at Willis Tower in Chicago last week underscored that process.
There were presentations on land use, population impact and economic effects. One of the consultants, Walter Kulash, a traffic engineer in North Carolina, explained how a 45-mile-per-hour road can handle just as many cars and trucks as a 60 m.p.h. road because there can be less space between cars.
Later, breaking into separate groups, ideological counterparts worked together. Maria Rodriguez, the village president of bucolic and road-wary Long Grove, labored beside Jacky Grimshaw, a longtime Chicago Democratic activist, and together they suggested locations for underpasses and bypasses. Panel members later voted in a nonbinding secret ballot on five proposals, ranging from tree-lined low-speed parkways to a high-speed, six-lane expressway. There were estimates of the impact, cost and revenue potential of each, and choosing one did not commit the voter necessarily to favoring a road.
Mr. Ranney and all but one other member voted for a version of a 12-mile, four-lane open-tolled parkway with a maximum 45 m.p.h. speed limit.
''They seem to be settling on something almost never done in the United States: a lower-speed, smaller-footprint, environmentally benign tollway that hasn't really been built since the 1930s,'' said John Fregonese, a planner based in Portland, Ore. who specializes in contentious land-use issues.
''The real story is the process,'' Mr. Kulash said. Considering the scope and complexity, nothing quite like this has happened before anywhere in the country, he said.
Members extol Mr. Stolman and Mr. Ranney as co-chairmen and hope to have a final recommendation by May.
''Until this process, I would have voted no to everything,'' Mr. Ranney said.
''I'm not there yet,'' he said. ''But the process leads me to understand that there is some possibility for having a four-lane tolled road that protects the community character.''
If this works, Hyde Park's most famous resident should send these guys to the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Psst, You in Aisle 5

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG. 
This article is adapted from ''The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,'' by Charles Duhigg, to be published by Random House on Feb. 28.

 BODY:
Andrew Pole had just started working as a statistician for Target in 2002, when two colleagues from the marketing department stopped by his desk to ask an odd question: ''If we wanted to figure out if a customer is pregnant, even if she didn't want us to know, can you do that? ''
Pole has a master's degree in statistics and another in economics, and has been obsessed with the intersection of data and human behavior most of his life. His parents were teachers in North Dakota, and while other kids were going to 4-H, Pole was doing algebra and writing computer programs. ''The stereotype of a math nerd is true,'' he told me when I spoke with him last year. ''I kind of like going out and evangelizing analytics.'' 
As the marketers explained to Pole -- and as Pole later explained to me, back when we were still speaking and before Target told him to stop -- new parents are a retailer's holy grail. Most shoppers don't buy everything they need at one store. Instead, they buy groceries at the grocery store and toys at the toy store, and they visit Target only when they need certain items they associate with Target -- cleaning supplies, say, or new socks or a six-month supply of toilet paper. But Target sells everything from milk to stuffed animals to lawn furniture to electronics, so one of the company's primary goals is convincing customers that the only store they need is Target. But it's a tough message to get across, even with the most ingenious ad campaigns, because once consumers' shopping habits are ingrained, it's incredibly difficult to change them.
There are, however, some brief periods in a person's life when old routines fall apart and buying habits are suddenly in flux. One of those moments -- the moment, really -- is right around the birth of a child, when parents are exhausted and overwhelmed and their shopping patterns and brand loyalties are up for grabs. But as Target's marketers explained to Pole, timing is everything. Because birth records are usually public, the moment a couple have a new baby, they are almost instantaneously barraged with offers and incentives and advertisements from all sorts of companies. Which means that the key is to reach them earlier, before any other retailers know a baby is on the way. Specifically, the marketers said they wanted to send specially designed ads to women in their second trimester, which is when most expectant mothers begin buying all sorts of new things, like prenatal vitamins and maternity clothing. ''Can you give us a list?'' the marketers asked.
''We knew that if we could identify them in their second trimester, there's a good chance we could capture them for years,'' Pole told me. ''As soon as we get them buying diapers from us, they're going to start buying everything else too. If you're rushing through the store, looking for bottles, and you pass orange juice, you'll grab a carton. Oh, and there's that new DVD I want. Soon, you'll be buying cereal and paper towels from us, and keep coming back.''
The desire to collect information on customers is not new for Target or any other large retailer, of course. For decades, Target has collected vast amounts of data on every person who regularly walks into one of its stores. Whenever possible, Target assigns each shopper a unique code -- known internally as the Guest ID number -- that keeps tabs on everything they buy. ''If you use a credit card or a coupon, or ll out a survey, or mail in a refund, or call the customer help line, or open an e-mail we've sent you or visit our Web site, we'll record it and link it to your Guest ID,'' Pole said. ''We want to know everything we can.''
Also linked to your Guest ID is demographic information like your age, whether you are married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how long it takes you to drive to the store, your estimated salary, whether you've moved recently, what credit cards you carry in your wallet and what Web sites you visit. Target can buy data about your ethnicity, job history, the magazines you read, if you've ever declared bankruptcy or got divorced, the year you bought (or lost) your house, where you went to college, what kinds of topics you talk about online, whether you prefer certain brands of coffee, paper towels, cereal or applesauce, your political leanings, reading habits, charitable giving and the number of cars you own. (In a statement, Target declined to identify what demographic information it collects or purchases.) All that information is meaningless, however, without someone to analyze and make sense of it. That's where Andrew Pole and the dozens of other members of Target's Guest Marketing Analytics department come in.
Almost every major retailer, from grocery chains to investment banks to the U.S. Postal Service, has a ''predictive analytics'' department devoted to understanding not just consumers' shopping habits but also their personal habits, so as to more efficiently market to them. ''But Target has always been one of the smartest at this,'' says Eric Siegel, a consultant and the chairman of a conference called Predictive Analytics World. ''We're living through a golden age of behavioral research. It's amazing how much we can figure out about how people think now.''
The reason Target can snoop on our shopping habits is that, over the past two decades, the science of habit formation has become a major field of research in neurology and psychology departments at hundreds of major medical centers and universities, as well as inside extremely well financed corporate labs. ''It's like an arms race to hire statisticians nowadays,'' said Andreas Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon.com. ''Mathematicians are suddenly sexy.'' As the ability to analyze data has grown more and more fine-grained, the push to understand how daily habits influence our decisions has become one of the most exciting topics in clinical research, even though most of us are hardly aware those patterns exist. One study from Duke University estimated that habits, rather than conscious decision-making, shape 45 percent of the choices we make every day, and recent discoveries have begun to change everything from the way we think about dieting to how doctors conceive treatments for anxiety, depression and addictions.
This research is also transforming our understanding of how habits function across organizations and societies. A football coach named Tony Dungy propelled one of the worst teams in the N.F.L. to the Super Bowl by focusing on how his players habitually reacted to on-field cues. Before he became Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill overhauled a stumbling conglomerate, Alcoa, and turned it into a top performer in the Dow Jones by relentlessly attacking one habit -- a specific approach to worker safety -- which in turn caused a companywide transformation. The Obama campaign has hired a habit specialist as its ''chief scientist'' to figure out how to trigger new voting patterns among different constituencies.
Researchers have figured out how to stop people from habitually overeating and biting their nails. They can explain why some of us automatically go for a jog every morning and are more productive at work, while others oversleep and procrastinate. There is a calculus, it turns out, for mastering our subconscious urges. For companies like Target, the exhaustive rendering of our conscious and unconscious patterns into data sets and algorithms has revolutionized what they know about us and, therefore, how precisely they can sell.
Inside the brain-and-cognitive-sciences department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are what, to the casual observer, look like dollhouse versions of surgical theaters. There are rooms with tiny scalpels, small drills and miniature saws. Even the operating tables are petite, as if prepared for 7-year-old surgeons. Inside those shrunken O.R.'s, neurologists cut into the skulls of anesthetized rats, implanting tiny sensors that record the smallest changes in the activity of their brains.
An M.I.T. neuroscientist named Ann Graybiel told me that she and her colleagues began exploring habits more than a decade ago by putting their wired rats into a T-shaped maze with chocolate at one end. The maze was structured so that each animal was positioned behind a barrier that opened after a loud click. The first time a rat was placed in the maze, it would usually wander slowly up and down the center aisle after the barrier slid away, snif ng in corners and scratching at walls. It appeared to smell the chocolate but couldn't gure out how to nd it. There was no discernible pattern in the rat's meanderings and no indication it was working hard to find the treat.
The probes in the rats' heads, however, told a different story. While each animal wandered through the maze, its brain was working furiously. Every time a rat sniffed the air or scratched a wall, the neurosensors inside the animal's head exploded with activity. As the scientists repeated the experiment, again and again, the rats eventually stopped snif ng corners and making wrong turns and began to zip through the maze with more and more speed. And within their brains, something unexpected occurred: as each rat learned how to complete the maze more quickly, its mental activity decreased. As the path became more and more automatic -- as it became a habit -- the rats started thinking less and less.
This process, in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine, is called ''chunking.'' There are dozens, if not hundreds, of behavioral chunks we rely on every day. Some are simple: you automatically put toothpaste on your toothbrush before sticking it in your mouth. Some, like making the kids' lunch, are a little more complex. Still others are so complicated that it's remarkable to realize that a habit could have emerged at all.
Take backing your car out of the driveway. When you rst learned to drive, that act required a major dose of concentration, and for good reason: it involves peering into the rearview and side mirrors and checking for obstacles, putting your foot on the brake, moving the gearshift into reverse, removing your foot from the brake, estimating the distance between the garage and the street while keeping the wheels aligned, calculating how images in the mirrors translate into actual distances, all while applying differing amounts of pressure to the gas pedal and brake.
Now, you perform that series of actions every time you pull into the street without thinking very much. Your brain has chunked large parts of it. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any repeated behavior into a habit, because habits allow our minds to conserve effort. But conserving mental energy is tricky, because if our brains power down at the wrong moment, we might fail to notice something important, like a child riding her bike down the sidewalk or a speeding car coming down the street. So we've devised a clever system to determine when to let a habit take over. It's something that happens whenever a chunk of behavior starts or ends -- and it helps to explain why habits are so difficult to change once they're formed, despite our best intentions.
To understand this a little more clearly, consider again the chocolate-seeking rats. What Graybiel and her colleagues found was that, as the ability to navigate the maze became habitual, there were two spikes in the rats' brain activity -- once at the beginning of the maze, when the rat heard the click right before the barrier slid away, and once at the end, when the rat found the chocolate. Those spikes show when the rats' brains were fully engaged, and the dip in neural activity between the spikes showed when the habit took over. From behind the partition, the rat wasn't sure what waited on the other side, until it heard the click, which it had come to associate with the maze. Once it heard that sound, it knew to use the ''maze habit,'' and its brain activity decreased. Then at the end of the routine, when the reward appeared, the brain shook itself awake again and the chocolate signaled to the rat that this particular habit was worth remembering, and the neurological pathway was carved that much deeper.
The process within our brains that creates habits is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain gure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop -- cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward -- becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become neurologically intertwined until a sense of craving emerges. What's unique about cues and rewards, however, is how subtle they can be. Neurological studies like the ones in Graybiel's lab have revealed that some cues span just milliseconds. And rewards can range from the obvious (like the sugar rush that a morning doughnut habit provides) to the infinitesimal (like the barely noticeable -- but measurable -- sense of relief the brain experiences after successfully navigating the driveway). Most cues and rewards, in fact, happen so quickly and are so slight that we are hardly aware of them at all. But our neural systems notice and use them to build automatic behaviors.
Habits aren't destiny -- they can be ignored, changed or replaced. But it's also true that once the loop is established and a habit emerges, your brain stops fully participating in decision-making. So unless you deliberately ght a habit -- unless you nd new cues and rewards -- the old pattern will unfold automatically.
''We've done experiments where we trained rats to run down a maze until it was a habit, and then we extinguished the habit by changing the placement of the reward,'' Graybiel told me. ''Then one day, we'll put the reward in the old place and put in the rat and, by golly, the old habit will re-emerge right away. Habits never really disappear.''
Luckily, simply understanding how habits work makes them easier to control. Take, for instance, a series of studies conducted a few years ago at Columbia University and the University of Alberta. Researchers wanted to understand how exercise habits emerge. In one project, 256 members of a health-insurance plan were invited to classes stressing the importance of exercise. Half the participants received an extra lesson on the theories of habit formation (the structure of the habit loop) and were asked to identify cues and rewards that might help them develop exercise routines.
The results were dramatic. Over the next four months, those participants who deliberately identified cues and rewards spent twice as much time exercising as their peers. Other studies have yielded similar results. According to another recent paper, if you want to start running in the morning, it's essential that you choose a simple cue (like always putting on your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (like a midday treat or even the sense of accomplishment that comes from ritually recording your miles in a log book). After a while, your brain will start anticipating that reward -- craving the treat or the feeling of accomplishment -- and there will be a measurable neurological impulse to lace up your jogging shoes each morning.
Our relationship to e-mail operates on the same principle. When a computer chimes or a smartphone vibrates with a new message, the brain starts anticipating the neurological ''pleasure'' (even if we don't recognize it as such) that clicking on the e-mail and reading it provides. That expectation, if unsatisfied, can build until you find yourself moved to distraction by the thought of an e-mail sitting there unread -- even if you know, rationally, it's most likely not important. On the other hand, once you remove the cue by disabling the buzzing of your phone or the chiming of your computer, the craving is never triggered, and you'll find, over time, that you're able to work productively for long stretches without checking your in-box.
Some of the most ambitious habit experiments have been conducted by corporate America. To understand why executives are so entranced by this science, consider how one of the world's largest companies, Procter & Gamble, used habit insights to turn a failing product into one of its biggest sellers. P.& G. is the corporate behemoth behind a whole range of products, from Downy fabric softener to Bounty paper towels to Duracell batteries and dozens of other household brands. In the mid-1990s, P.& G.'s executives began a secret project to create a new product that could eradicate bad smells. P.& G. spent millions developing a colorless, cheap-to-manufacture liquid that could be sprayed on a smoky blouse, stinky couch, old jacket or stained car interior and make it odorless. In order to market the product -- Febreze -- the company formed a team that included a former Wall Street mathematician named Drake Stimson and habit specialists, whose job was to make sure the television commercials, which they tested in Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Boise, Idaho, accentuated the product's cues and rewards just right.
The first ad showed a woman complaining about the smoking section of a restaurant. Whenever she eats there, she says, her jacket smells like smoke. A friend tells her that if she uses Febreze, it will eliminate the odor. The cue in the ad is clear: the harsh smell of cigarette smoke. The reward: odor eliminated from clothes. The second ad featured a woman worrying about her dog, Sophie, who always sits on the couch. ''Sophie will always smell like Sophie,'' she says, but with Febreze, ''now my furniture doesn't have to.'' The ads were put in heavy rotation. Then the marketers sat back, anticipating how they would spend their bonuses. A week passed. Then two. A month. Two months. Sales started small and got smaller. Febreze was a dud.
The panicked marketing team canvassed consumers and conducted in-depth interviews to figure out what was going wrong, Stimson recalled. Their first inkling came when they visited a woman's home outside Phoenix. The house was clean and organized. She was something of a neat freak, the woman explained. But when P.& G.'s scientists walked into her living room, where her nine cats spent most of their time, the scent was so overpowering that one of them gagged.
According to Stimson, who led the Febreze team, a researcher asked the woman, ''What do you do about the cat smell?''
''It's usually not a problem,'' she said.
''Do you smell it now?''
''No,'' she said. ''Isn't it wonderful? They hardly smell at all!''
A similar scene played out in dozens of other smelly homes. The reason Febreze wasn't selling, the marketers realized, was that people couldn't detect most of the bad smells in their lives. If you live with nine cats, you become desensitized to their scents. If you smoke cigarettes, eventually you don't smell smoke anymore. Even the strongest odors fade with constant exposure. That's why Febreze was a failure. The product's cue -- the bad smells that were supposed to trigger daily use -- was hidden from the people who needed it the most. And Febreze's reward (an odorless home) was meaningless to someone who couldn't smell offensive scents in the first place.
P.& G. employed a Harvard Business School professor to analyze Febreze's ad campaigns. They collected hours of footage of people cleaning their homes and watched tape after tape, looking for clues that might help them connect Febreze to people's daily habits. When that didn't reveal anything, they went into the field and conducted more interviews. A breakthrough came when they visited a woman in a suburb near Scottsdale, Ariz., who was in her 40s with four children. Her house was clean, though not compulsively tidy, and didn't appear to have any odor problems; there were no pets or smokers. To the surprise of everyone, she loved Febreze.
''I use it every day,'' she said.
''What smells are you trying to get rid of?'' a researcher asked.
''I don't really use it for specific smells,'' the woman said. ''I use it for normal cleaning -- a couple of sprays when I'm done in a room.''
The researchers followed her around as she tidied the house. In the bedroom, she made her bed, tightened the sheet's corners, then sprayed the comforter with Febreze. In the living room, she vacuumed, picked up the children's shoes, straightened the coffee table, then sprayed Febreze on the freshly cleaned carpet.
''It's nice, you know?'' she said. ''Spraying feels like a little minicelebration when I'm done with a room.'' At the rate she was going, the team estimated, she would empty a bottle of Febreze every two weeks.
When they got back to P.& G.'s headquarters, the researchers watched their videotapes again. Now they knew what to look for and saw their mistake in scene after scene. Cleaning has its own habit loops that already exist. In one video, when a woman walked into a dirty room (cue), she started sweeping and picking up toys (routine), then she examined the room and smiled when she was done (reward). In another, a woman scowled at her unmade bed (cue), proceeded to straighten the blankets and comforter (routine) and then sighed as she ran her hands over the freshly plumped pillows (reward). P.& G. had been trying to create a whole new habit with Febreze, but what they really needed to do was piggyback on habit loops that were already in place. The marketers needed to position Febreze as something that came at the end of the cleaning ritual, the reward, rather than as a whole new cleaning routine.
The company printed new ads showing open windows and gusts of fresh air. More perfume was added to the Febreze formula, so that instead of merely neutralizing odors, the spray had its own distinct scent. Television commercials were filmed of women, having finished their cleaning routine, using Febreze to spritz freshly made beds and just-laundered clothing. Each ad was designed to appeal to the habit loop: when you see a freshly cleaned room (cue), pull out Febreze (routine) and enjoy a smell that says you've done a great job (reward). When you finish making a bed (cue), spritz Febreze (routine) and breathe a sweet, contented sigh (reward). Febreze, the ads implied, was a pleasant treat, not a reminder that your home stinks.
And so Febreze, a product originally conceived as a revolutionary way to destroy odors, became an air freshener used once things are already clean. The Febreze revamp occurred in the summer of 1998. Within two months, sales doubled. A year later, the product brought in $230 million. Since then Febreze has spawned dozens of spinoffs -- air fresheners, candles and laundry detergents -- that now account for sales of more than $1 billion a year. Eventually, P.& G. began mentioning to customers that, in addition to smelling sweet, Febreze can actually kill bad odors. Today it's one of the top-selling products in the world.
Andrew Pole was hired by Target to use the same kinds of insights into consumers' habits to expand Target's sales. His assignment was to analyze all the cue-routine-reward loops among shoppers and help the company figure out how to exploit them. Much of his department's work was straightforward: find the customers who have children and send them catalogs that feature toys before Christmas. Look for shoppers who habitually purchase swimsuits in April and send them coupons for sunscreen in July and diet books in December. But Pole's most important assignment was to identify those unique moments in consumers' lives when their shopping habits become particularly flexible and the right advertisement or coupon would cause them to begin spending in new ways.
In the 1980s, a team of researchers led by a U.C.L.A. professor named Alan Andreasen undertook a study of peoples' most mundane purchases, like soap, toothpaste, trash bags and toilet paper. They learned that most shoppers paid almost no attention to how they bought these products, that the purchases occurred habitually, without any complex decision-making. Which meant it was hard for marketers, despite their displays and coupons and product promotions, to persuade shoppers to change.
But when some customers were going through a major life event, like graduating from college or getting a new job or moving to a new town, their shopping habits became flexible in ways that were both predictable and potential gold mines for retailers. The study found that when someone marries, he or she is more likely to start buying a new type of coffee. When a couple move into a new house, they're more apt to purchase a different kind of cereal. When they divorce, there's an increased chance they'll start buying different brands of beer.
Consumers going through major life events often don't notice, or care, that their shopping habits have shifted, but retailers notice, and they care quite a bit. At those unique moments, Andreasen wrote, customers are ''vulnerable to intervention by marketers.'' In other words, a precisely timed advertisement, sent to a recent divorcee or new homebuyer, can change someone's shopping patterns for years.
And among life events, none are more important than the arrival of a baby. At that moment, new parents' habits are more flexible than at almost any other time in their adult lives. If companies can identify pregnant shoppers, they can earn millions.
The only problem is that identifying pregnant customers is harder than it sounds. Target has a baby-shower registry, and Pole started there, observing how shopping habits changed as a woman approached her due date, which women on the registry had willingly disclosed. He ran test after test, analyzing the data, and before long some useful patterns emerged. Lotions, for example. Lots of people buy lotion, but one of Pole's colleagues noticed that women on the baby registry were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester. Another analyst noted that sometime in the first 20 weeks, pregnant women loaded up on supplements like calcium, magnesium and zinc. Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date.
As Pole's computers crawled through the data, he was able to identify about 25 products that, when analyzed together, allowed him to assign each shopper a ''pregnancy prediction'' score. More important, he could also estimate her due date to within a small window, so Target could send coupons timed to very specific stages of her pregnancy.
One Target employee I spoke to provided a hypothetical example. Take a fictional Target shopper named Jenny Ward, who is 23, lives in Atlanta and in March bought cocoa-butter lotion, a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag, zinc and magnesium supplements and a bright blue rug. There's, say, an 87 percent chance that she's pregnant and that her delivery date is sometime in late August. What's more, because of the data attached to her Guest ID number, Target knows how to trigger Jenny's habits. They know that if she receives a coupon via e-mail, it will most likely cue her to buy online. They know that if she receives an ad in the mail on Friday, she frequently uses it on a weekend trip to the store. And they know that if they reward her with a printed receipt that entitles her to a free cup of Starbucks coffee, she'll use it when she comes back again.
In the past, that knowledge had limited value. After all, Jenny purchased only cleaning supplies at Target, and there were only so many psychological buttons the company could push. But now that she is pregnant, everything is up for grabs. In addition to triggering Jenny's habits to buy more cleaning products, they can also start including offers for an array of products, some more obvious than others, that a woman at her stage of pregnancy might need.
Pole applied his program to every regular female shopper in Target's national database and soon had a list of tens of thousands of women who were most likely pregnant. If they could entice those women or their husbands to visit Target and buy baby-related products, the company's cue-routine-reward calculators could kick in and start pushing them to buy groceries, bathing suits, toys and clothing, as well. When Pole shared his list with the marketers, he said, they were ecstatic. Soon, Pole was getting invited to meetings above his paygrade. Eventually his paygrade went up.
At which point someone asked an important question: How are women going to react when they figure out how much Target knows?
''If we send someone a catalog and say, 'Congratulations on your first child!' and they've never told us they're pregnant, that's going to make some people uncomfortable,'' Pole told me. ''We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. But even if you're following the law, you can do things where people get queasy.''
About a year after Pole created his pregnancy-prediction model, a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation.
''My daughter got this in the mail!'' he said. ''She's still in high school, and you're sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?''
The manager didn't have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man's daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.
On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. ''I had a talk with my daughter,'' he said. ''It turns out there's been some activities in my house I haven't been completely aware of. She's due in August. I owe you an apology.''
When I approached Target to discuss Pole's work, its representatives declined to speak with me. ''Our mission is to make Target the preferred shopping destination for our guests by delivering outstanding value, continuous innovation and exceptional guest experience,'' the company wrote in a statement. ''We've developed a number of research tools that allow us to gain insights into trends and preferences within different demographic segments of our guest population.'' When I sent Target a complete summary of my reporting, the reply was more terse: ''Almost all of your statements contain inaccurate information and publishing them would be misleading to the public. We do not intend to address each statement point by point.'' The company declined to identify what was inaccurate. They did add, however, that Target ''is in compliance with all federal and state laws, including those related to protected health information.''
When I offered to fly to Target's headquarters to discuss its concerns, a spokeswoman e-mailed that no one would meet me. When I flew out anyway, I was told I was on a list of prohibited visitors. ''I've been instructed not to give you access and to ask you to leave,'' said a very nice security guard named Alex.
Using data to predict a woman's pregnancy, Target realized soon after Pole perfected his model, could be a public-relations disaster. So the question became: how could they get their advertisements into expectant mothers' hands without making it appear they were spying on them? How do you take advantage of someone's habits without letting them know you're studying their lives?
Before I met Andrew Pole, before I even decided to write a book about the science of habit formation, I had another goal: I wanted to lose weight.
I had got into a bad habit of going to the cafeteria every afternoon and eating a chocolate-chip cookie, which contributed to my gaining a few pounds. Eight, to be precise. I put a Post-it note on my computer reading ''NO MORE COOKIES.'' But every afternoon, I managed to ignore that note, wander to the cafeteria, buy a cookie and eat it while chatting with colleagues. Tomorrow, I always promised myself, I'll muster the willpower to resist.
Tomorrow, I ate another cookie.
When I started interviewing experts in habit formation, I concluded each interview by asking what I should do. The first step, they said, was to figure out my habit loop. The routine was simple: every afternoon, I walked to the cafeteria, bought a cookie and ate it while chatting with friends.
Next came some less obvious questions: What was the cue? Hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? And what was the reward? The taste of the cookie itself? The temporary distraction from my work? The chance to socialize with colleagues?
Rewards are powerful because they satisfy cravings, but we're often not conscious of the urges driving our habits in the first place. So one day, when I felt a cookie impulse, I went outside and took a walk instead. The next day, I went to the cafeteria and bought a coffee. The next, I bought an apple and ate it while chatting with friends. You get the idea. I wanted to test different theories regarding what reward I was really craving. Was it hunger? (In which case the apple should have worked.) Was it the desire for a quick burst of energy? (If so, the coffee should suffice.) Or, as turned out to be the answer, was it that after several hours spent focused on work, I wanted to socialize, to make sure I was up to speed on office gossip, and the cookie was just a convenient excuse? When I walked to a colleague's desk and chatted for a few minutes, it turned out, my cookie urge was gone.
All that was left was identifying the cue.
Deciphering cues is hard, however. Our lives often contain too much information to figure out what is triggering a particular behavior. Do you eat breakfast at a certain time because you're hungry? Or because the morning news is on? Or because your kids have started eating? Experiments have shown that most cues fit into one of five categories: location, time, emotional state, other people or the immediately preceding action. So to figure out the cue for my cookie habit, I wrote down five things the moment the urge hit:
Where are you? (Sitting at my desk.)
What time is it? (3:36 p.m.)
What's your emotional state? (Bored.)
Who else is around? (No one.)
What action preceded the urge? (Answered an e-mail.)
The next day I did the same thing. And the next. Pretty soon, the cue was clear: I always felt an urge to snack around 3:30.
Once I figured out all the parts of the loop, it seemed fairly easy to change my habit. But the psychologists and neuroscientists warned me that, for my new behavior to stick, I needed to abide by the same principle that guided Procter & Gamble in selling Febreze: To shift the routine -- to socialize, rather than eat a cookie -- I needed to piggyback on an existing habit. So now, every day around 3:30, I stand up, look around the newsroom for someone to talk to, spend 10 minutes gossiping, then go back to my desk. The cue and reward have stayed the same. Only the routine has shifted. It doesn't feel like a decision, any more than the M.I.T. rats made a decision to run through the maze. It's now a habit. I've lost 21 pounds since then (12 of them from changing my cookie ritual).
After Andrew Pole built his pregnancy-prediction model, after he identified thousands of female shoppers who were most likely pregnant, after someone pointed out that some of those women might be a little upset if they received an advertisement making it obvious Target was studying their reproductive status, everyone decided to slow things down.
The marketing department conducted a few tests by choosing a small, random sample of women from Pole's list and mailing them combinations of advertisements to see how they reacted.
''We have the capacity to send every customer an ad booklet, specifically designed for them, that says, 'Here's everything you bought last week and a coupon for it,' '' one Target executive told me. ''We do that for grocery products all the time.'' But for pregnant women, Target's goal was selling them baby items they didn't even know they needed yet.
''With the pregnancy products, though, we learned that some women react badly,'' the executive said. ''Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We'd put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We'd put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes. That way, it looked like all the products were chosen by chance.
''And we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn't been spied on, she'll use the coupons. She just assumes that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. As long as we don't spook her, it works.''
In other words, if Target piggybacked on existing habits -- the same cues and rewards they already knew got customers to buy cleaning supplies or socks -- then they could insert a new routine: buying baby products, as well. There's a cue (''Oh, a coupon for something I need!'') a routine (''Buy! Buy! Buy!'') and a reward (''I can take that off my list''). And once the shopper is inside the store, Target will hit her with cues and rewards to entice her to purchase everything she normally buys somewhere else. As long as Target camouflaged how much it knew, as long as the habit felt familiar, the new behavior took hold.
Soon after the new ad campaign began, Target's Mom and Baby sales exploded. The company doesn't break out figures for specific divisions, but between 2002 -- when Pole was hired -- and 2010, Target's revenues grew from $44 billion to $67 billion. In 2005, the company's president, Gregg Steinhafel, boasted to a room of investors about the company's ''heightened focus on items and categories that appeal to specific guest segments such as mom and baby.''
Pole was promoted. He has been invited to speak at conferences. ''I never expected this would become such a big deal,'' he told me the last time we spoke.
A few weeks before this article went to press, I flew to Minneapolis to try and speak to Andrew Pole one last time. I hadn't talked to him in more than a year. Back when we were still friendly, I mentioned that my wife was seven months pregnant. We shop at Target, I told him, and had given the company our address so we could start receiving coupons in the mail. As my wife's pregnancy progressed, I noticed a subtle upswing in the number of advertisements for diapers and baby clothes arriving at our house.
Pole didn't answer my e-mails or phone calls when I visited Minneapolis. I drove to his large home in a nice suburb, but no one answered the door. On my way back to the hotel, I stopped at a Target to pick up some deodorant, then also bought some T-shirts and a fancy hair gel. On a whim, I threw in some pacifiers, to see how the computers would react. Besides, our baby is now 9 months old. You can't have too many pacifiers.
When I paid, I didn't receive any sudden deals on diapers or formula, to my slight disappointment. It made sense, though: I was shopping in a city I never previously visited, at 9:45 p.m. on a weeknight, buying a random assortment of items. I was using a corporate credit card, and besides the pacifiers, hadn't purchased any of the things that a parent needs. It was clear to Target's computers that I was on a business trip. Pole's prediction calculator took one look at me, ran the numbers and decided to bide its time. Back home, the offers would eventually come. As Pole told me the last time we spoke: ''Just wait. We'll be sending you coupons for things you want before you even know you want them.''

HEADLINE: 60 Lives, 30 Kidneys, All Linked

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Rick Ruzzamenti admits to being a tad impulsive. He traded his Catholicism for Buddhism in a revelatory flash. He married a Vietnamese woman he had only just met. And then a year ago, he decided in an instant to donate his left kidney to a stranger.
In February 2011, the desk clerk at Mr. Ruzzamenti's yoga studio told him she had recently donated a kidney to an ailing friend she had bumped into at Target. Mr. Ruzzamenti, 44, had never even donated blood, but the story so captivated him that two days later he called Riverside Community Hospital to ask how he might do the same thing.
Halfway across the country, in Joliet, Ill., Donald C. Terry Jr. needed a kidney in the worst way. Since receiving a diagnosis of diabetes-related renal disease in his mid-40s, he had endured the burning and bloating and dismal tedium of dialysis for nearly a year. With nobody in his family willing or able to give him a kidney, his doctors warned that it might take five years to crawl up the waiting list for an organ from a deceased donor. 
''It was like being sentenced to prison,'' Mr. Terry recalled, ''like I had done something wrong in my life and this was the outcome.''
As a dawn chill broke over Chicago on Dec. 20, Mr. Terry received a plump pink kidney in a transplant at Loyola University Medical Center. He did not get it from Mr. Ruzzamenti, at least not directly, but the two men will forever share a connection: they were the first and last patients in the longest chain of kidney transplants ever constructed, linking 30 people who were willing to give up an organ with 30 who might have died without one.
What made the domino chain of 60 operations possible was the willingness of a Good Samaritan, Mr. Ruzzamenti, to give the initial kidney, expecting nothing in return. Its momentum was then fueled by a mix of selflessness and self-interest among donors who gave a kidney to a stranger after learning they could not donate to a loved one because of incompatible blood types or antibodies. Their loved ones, in turn, were offered compatible kidneys as part of the exchange.
Chain 124, as it was labeled by the nonprofit National Kidney Registry, required lockstep coordination over four months among 17 hospitals in 11 states. It was born of innovations in computer matching, surgical technique and organ shipping, as well as the determination of a Long Island businessman named Garet Hil, who was inspired by his own daughter's illness to supercharge the notion of ''paying it forward.''
Dr. Robert A. Montgomery, a pioneering transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which was not involved in the chain, called it a ''momentous feat'' that demonstrated the potential for kidney exchanges to transform the field. ''We are realizing the dream of extending the miracle of transplantation to thousands of additional patients each year,'' he said.
The chain began with an algorithm and an altruist. Over the months it fractured time and again, suspending the fates of those down the line until Mr. Hil could repair the breach. Eventually, he succeeded in finding needle-in-a-haystack matches for patients whose antibodies would have caused them to reject organs from most donors.
Until now, few of the donors and recipients have known one another's names. But 59 of the 60 participants consented to be identified by The New York Times and to tell the stories, each with distinct shadings, that ultimately connected them.
Despite an intensely bitter breakup, a Michigan man agreed to donate a kidney for his former girlfriend for the sake of their 2-year-old daughter. A woman from Toronto donated for her fifth cousin from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, after meeting him by chance in Italy and then staying in touch mostly by text messages.
Children donated for parents, husbands for wives, sisters for brothers. A 26-year-old student from Texas gave a kidney for a 44-year-old uncle in California whom he rarely saw. In San Francisco, a 62-year-old survivor of Stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma donated for her son-in-law.
On Aug. 15, Mr. Ruzzamenti's kidney flew east on a Continental red-eye from Los Angeles to Newark and was rushed to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. There it was stitched into the abdomen of a 66-year-old man.
The man's niece, a 34-year-old nurse, had wanted to give him her kidney, but her Type A blood clashed with his Type O. So in exchange for Mr. Ruzzamenti's gift, she agreed to have her kidney shipped to the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison for Brooke R. Kitzman's transplant. It was Ms. Kitzman's former boyfriend, David Madosh, who agreed to donate a kidney on her behalf despite their acrimonious split.
Mr. Madosh's kidney flew to Pittsburgh for Janna Daniels, a clerical supervisor, who got her transplant at Allegheny General Hospital. And her husband, Shaun, a mechanic, sent his kidney to Mustafa Parks, a young father of two at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego.
On and on the chain extended, with kidneys flying from coast to coast, iced down in cardboard boxes equipped with GPS devices and stowed on commercial aircraft.
In a system built on trust, one leap of faith followed another. The burdens of scheduling operations all across the country -- so donors would not have to travel -- meant that operations were not always simultaneous, or even sequential. The most worrisome risk was that donors would renege once their loved ones received kidneys.
After John A. Clark of Sarasota, Fla., got a transplant on Sept. 28 at Tampa General Hospital, his wife, Rebecca, faced a 68-day wait before it was her turn to keep the chain going. Ms. Clark said that it crossed her mind to back out, but that she swatted away the temptation.
''I believe in karma,'' Ms. Clark said, ''and that would have been some really bad karma. There was somebody out there who needed my kidney.''
An Organ to Spare
It is considered a quirk of evolution that humans have two kidneys when they need only one to filter waste and remove excess fluid from the body. Yet when kidneys fail, whether from diabetes or high blood pressure or genetic disorders, they tend to fail in tandem.
Death can arrive in a matter of weeks for many renal patients if they do not have their blood cleansed through dialysis. The process takes almost four hours, three times a week, and leaves many too drained to work. Only half of dialysis patients survive more than three years.
Many of the 400,000 Americans who are tethered to dialysis dream of a transplant as their pathway back to normal. But with the demand for kidneys rising faster than the number of donors, the waits have grown longer. While about 90,000 people are lined up for kidneys, fewer than 17,000 receive one each year, and about 4,500 die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which maintains the wait list for the government.
Only a third of transplanted kidneys come from living donors, but they are coveted because they typically last longer than cadaver kidneys. For kidneys transplanted in 1999, 60 percent of organs from live donors were still functioning after 10 years, compared with 43 percent of organs from deceased donors.
Although other living tissue can be transplanted -- slices of pancreas, liver and intestine, bone marrow and lobes of lung -- kidneys are uniquely suited because donors have a spare and the operations are almost always successful.
A reason there are not more live kidney donations, however, is that about a third of transplant candidates with a willing donor find that they are immunologically incompatible. Some, because of previous transplants, blood transfusions or pregnancies, may have developed antibodies that make them highly likely to reject a new kidney.
Using a blood-filtering technique known as plasmapheresis, doctors can now lower the odds that a recipient will reject an incompatible kidney. But the procedures are taxing and expensive.
Domino chains, which were first attempted in 2005 at Johns Hopkins, seek to increase the number of people who can be helped by living donors. In 2010, chains and other forms of paired exchanges resulted in 429 transplants. Computer models suggest that an additional 2,000 to 4,000 transplants could be achieved each year if Americans knew more about such programs and if there were a nationwide pool of all eligible donors and recipients.
Such transplants ultimately save money as well as lives. The federal Medicare program, which pays most treatment costs for chronic kidney disease, saves an estimated $500,000 to $1 million each time a patient is removed from dialysis through a live donor transplant (the operations typically cost $100,000 to $200,000). Coverage for kidney disease costs the government more than $30 billion a year, about 6 percent of the Medicare budget.
Dialysis, which in the United States is almost always administered in outpatient clinics, saps the productivity of caregivers as well as of patients. Nearly two years ago, Kent Bowen, 47, of Austin, Tex., gave up his job hanging gutters, and much of his freedom, so he could provide dialysis at home to his mother, Mary Jane Wilson.
Before donating a kidney for her as part of the chain on Dec. 7 at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Mr. Bowen said he looked forward not only to helping his mother, but also to a long-deferred fishing trip.
''In all actuality,'' he said, ''giving a kidney is a small price to pay for getting my life back.''
Understanding the Pain
Garet Hil and his wife, Jan, may never fully recover from the snowy night in February 2007 when they took their 10-year-old daughter in with flu symptoms and emerged with a shocking diagnosis of nephrophthisis, a genetic kidney-wasting disease. They could not imagine sacrificing her youth to dialysis.
Because Mr. Hil and his daughter shared the same blood type, he assumed he would be able to give her one of his kidneys. But two days before surgery, doctors canceled the operations after discovering that his daughter had developed antibodies that would most likely cause rejection.
Jan Hil and six other family members volunteered but were also ruled out. Mr. Hil and his daughter joined several of the registries that had started to arrange kidney exchanges, but the pools were small and they never found a match. Fortunately, one of Mr. Hil's nephews then was tested and was able to donate.
After the successful transplant, Mr. Hil, a veteran business executive, could not shake his frustration that a more effective registry for paired kidney donation did not exist. ''The exchange systems out there weren't industrial strength,'' he said.
By the end of 2007, the Hils had formed the National Kidney Registry and rented office space in an old clapboard house in Babylon, N.Y. The couple invested about $300,000 to start it, and Mr. Hil, who is now 49, ran the registry without a salary.
''The goal was very simple: get everybody transplanted in under six months if you had a living donor,'' he said. ''One of the things that drove us was the enormity of the problem. The other thing that drove us was that we understood the pain of being in that situation.''
Mr. Hil turned out to be the right person to infuse the budding science of kidney exchange with an entrepreneurial spark. A former Marine reconnaissance ranger with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School, he had managed a series of data and logistics companies in Boston and New York and understood the worlds of both computing and finance.
He had made his money and could step off the career track to give the registry his time and the resources of his software-consulting firm. He had a background in quantitative math and enough drive to plow through medical texts about organ compatibility. Over time, he led a team in designing sophisticated software that evolved to build ever-longer chains.
Disney-hero handsome, with a cleft chin and thick wavy hair, Mr. Hil marketed his registry to hospitals with PowerPoints and passion. The transplant world initially regarded him as an interloper. But he has now persuaded 58 of the country's 236 kidney transplant centers, including many of the largest, to feed his database with information about pairs of transplant candidates and their incompatible donors.
Starting at 5 a.m. each workday, Mr. Hil manipulates several hundred pairs into transplant chains with a few clicks of a mouse. Last year, he arranged 175 transplants this way, including the 30 in Chain 124, more than any other registry. On average, patients received transplants about a year after being listed.
The same year that Mr. Hil's daughter got sick, Congress amended the National Organ Transplant Act to clarify that paired exchanges do not violate federal laws against selling organs. The blessing from Washington broke down resistance in many hospitals just as the National Kidney Registry was opening for business.
The Evolving Chain
Although the first live kidney was transplanted in 1954 in Boston, three decades passed before a Stony Brook University surgeon named Felix T. Rapaport first theorized about kidney swaps in a 1986 journal article. Korean surgeons completed the first exchanges in 1991, but they were not successfully attempted in the United States for nearly another decade.
Simple swaps among two pairs, with the operations performed at the same hospital on the same day, quickly evolved into complex exchanges among three pairs and then four and then six.
Then in 2007, a transplant surgeon at the University of Toledo Medical Center, Dr. Michael A. Rees, had a forehead-slapping insight. If an exchange began with a Good Samaritan who donated to a stranger, and if the operations did not have to be simultaneous, a chain could theoretically keep growing, limited only by the pool of available donors and recipients. Dr. Rees reported in 2009 that he had strung together a chain of 10 transplants.
Mr. Hil seized on the idea and set out to build an algorithm that would enable even more transplants. Nowadays, his pool typically consists of 200 to 350 donor-recipient pairs. That is enough to generate roughly a googol -- 10 to the 100th power -- of possible chains of up to 20 transplants if all of the pairs are compatible, said Rich Marta, the registry's senior software designer.
The program quickly eliminates matches that will not work because of incompatible blood types or antibodies, or because a transplant candidate insists that a donor be under a certain age or a close immunological match. It then assembles up to a million viable combinations at a rate of 8,000 per second.
The algorithm ranks the possible combinations by the number of transplants they would enable, with weight given to chains that find kidneys for hard-to-match patients and those who have waited a long time.
There are several registries like Mr. Hil's, each with a distinct approach. Largely unregulated by government, they invite sensitive questions about oversight and ethics, including how kidneys are allocated. A number of medical societies are convening in March to seek consensus on that and other issues related to paired exchanges.
Mr. Hil knows the patients in his pool only by code names and leaves all personal interactions to the hospitals. He keeps several chains running at a time, and says tending to them is like playing three-dimensional chess.
Chain 124 even included one pair that was immunologically compatible. Josephine Bonventre, a 40-year-old real estate agent from Toronto with Type O blood, could have donated a kidney directly to her fifth cousin, Cesare Bonventre, a 27-year-old tile worker from Brooklyn with Type B.
But a second level of matching requires the synching of six antigens, a series of proteins that determine compatibility. By joining the chain and donating down the line, on Dec. 6 at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Josephine enabled Cesare to get a stronger match -- three antigens instead of one. Her donation as a valued Type O then set off the final 11 transplants.
The registry did not charge transplant centers for its services until 2010, when Mr. Hil imposed fees to help cover costs. Hospitals now pay membership dues and a charge of $3,000 per transplant that is reimbursed by many private insurers but not by Medicare. The transplant recipients must be insured.
Each year, the registry's chains have grown longer, with Chain 124 topping the previous record by seven transplants. ''We've just scratched the surface,'' said Mr. Hil, who wears gold kidney-shaped cufflinks.
Long transplant chains save more lives than short chains. But they come with trade-offs because the longer they grow, the higher the risk that a donor will renege or that a link will break for other reasons.
The record-breaking chain survived its share of logistical setbacks. On Aug. 29, after the first five transplants, Mr. Hil lost a link because a donor could not take the necessary two to four weeks away from work. Later that day, he lost another when a transplant coordinator informed him that a potential recipient was an illegal immigrant and therefore could not be covered by Medicare.
In late October, an entire segment fell apart when a donor at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco backed out for unexplained ''personal reasons.'' It was as if one domino had fallen short of the next, leaving those still standing frozen in place.
''This makes us all sick,'' Dr. Steven Katznelson e-mailed Mr. Hil. ''We did not see this coming.''
''Wow,'' Mr. Hil wrote back. The donor ''just put 23 patients at risk.''
The dependency of each link on the others kept patients on edge. ''Things can happen,'' Candice Ryan fretted a few days before her Dec. 5 transplant at Massachusetts General Hospital. ''You just pray that everything goes well. I can't relax until I'm asleep and on the table.''
Depending on the makeup of his registry at any moment, Mr. Hil likes to stretch his chains as long as reasonable and then end them if a donor is difficult to match or if one chain is draining others of potential transplants.
He does so by arranging for the final kidney to go to a fortunate transplant candidate like Mr. Terry who does not have a willing donor.
The Initial Link
Until recently, hospitals regularly turned away Good Samaritan donors on the working assumption that they were unstable. That has changed somewhat with experience. But when Rick Ruzzamenti showed up at Riverside Community Hospital asking to give a kidney to anyone in need, he still underwent rounds of psychological screening as well as medical tests.
The doctors and social workers did not know what to make of Mr. Ruzzamenti at first. He had a flat affect and an arid wit, and did not open up right away. As the hospital's transplant coordinator, Shannon White, pressed him about his motivations and expectations, he explained that his decision seemed rather obvious.
''People think it's so odd that I'm donating a kidney,'' Mr. Ruzzamenti told her. ''I think it's so odd that they think it's so odd.''
The hospital wanted to make sure that he was not expecting glory, or even gratitude. Mr. Ruzzamenti stressed that no one should mistake him for a saint.
He had, after all, been a heavy drinker in his youth and had caroused his way through the Navy. He could be an unsmiling presence at work, where he helped manage a family electrical contracting business. He admitted that he did not visit his parents or grandmother enough.
Despite his occasional surliness, Mr. Ruzzamenti said he felt driven to help others when possible. And as he considered the relative risks and benefits of organ donation, particularly to relieve a whole chain of suffering, it just made so much sense. ''It causes a shift in the world,'' he said.
Perhaps, he said, there was some influence from a Tibetan meditation he had practiced when he was first drawn to Buddhism six years ago. It is known as Tonglen. ''You think of the pain someone's in, and imagine you take it from them and give them back good,'' he said.
Mr. Ruzzamenti said he was in a position to donate only because the economy had dried up so much of his work. He was essentially unemployed and could take time off to recuperate. The 30 kidney recipients, he observed dryly, could ''all thank the recession.''
When Mr. Ruzzamenti told his wife, My Nhanh, about his plans, she made it abundantly clear, despite her rudimentary English, that she would leave him and return to Vietnam if he followed through. She had immigrated only eight months before, after a marriage largely arranged by the Buddhist temple where Mr. Ruzzamenti volunteered as a groundskeeper. If he died on the table, she demanded, how would she get by in a country where she felt so out of place?
''I wanted to scare him,'' Ms. Ruzzamenti, who is known as Lucy, said as she combed her husband's close-cropped hair with her fingers. ''And to tell him that it scares me.''
Mr. Ruzzamenti was impressed by his petite wife's ferocity -- ''She's a bully,'' he said -- but he disregarded her threat. He knew research showed that the risk of death from kidney retrieval surgery was 3 in 10,000 and that people with one kidney live as long as those with two. To him, there was little doubt that any good he created would far outweigh any temporary discomfort to him or his wife.
As it happened, Mr. Ruzzamenti experienced an unusual level of pain during his recuperation at Riverside. It sometimes left him balled up in agony, and the Demerol only made him hallucinate. He did not really want company. But when the pain stirred him awake at night, he could see Lucy sleeping in the hospital bed beside his.
Acts of Devotion
There were other love stories along the way.
Gregory Person and Zenovia Duke, both now 38, had been junior high prom dates in 1987 in Astoria, Queens. They lost touch and then reconnected on Facebook after each had divorced. They saw each other occasionally, but he lived in Queens and she near Albany, so the relationship never got serious.
Not long after they reconnected, Mr. Person's half-sister died of kidney failure and he pledged to help someone else beat the disease if ever given the chance. Then Ms. Duke learned she needed a transplant.
On Aug. 31, Ms. Duke received a kidney from a woman in California and Mr. Person sent his to Ohio. As they recuperated at NewYork-Presbyterian , Mr. Person found himself regularly hobbling down to her room. Once they were both back on their feet, they started dating more regularly.
''I've never had any person in my life actually do what they say they're going to do,'' Ms. Duke said, ''especially men. It spoke volumes that he was a man of his word.''
It was a different kind of devotion that led David Madosh, 47, to donate a kidney for Brooke Kitzman, 30. Their four-year relationship, which had produced a 2-year-old daughter, soured just as he was getting tested as a potential donor. The breakup, caused partly by the strains of her illness, was ugly enough that when Ms. Kitzman later matched to become part of the chain, she put the odds at no better than 50-50 that Mr. Madosh would still donate.
But Mr. Madosh, who lost his mother when he was 5, did not want his daughter, Elsie, to lose hers.
The youngest of 12 children, he said he had been passed from one foster home to the next, eight in all, some that he described as little more than labor camps. ''I don't want my daughter to have to experience that,'' said Mr. Madosh, a tree cutter by trade. ''No matter what it takes, a daughter needs her mother.''
Ms. Kitzman said she was grateful for Mr. Madosh's kidney, and had told him so when they visited in a hospital corridor. But both made it clear that his act of charity had barely eased the tension between them.
Mr. Madosh said he took satisfaction enough from seeing Elsie at play with her re-energized mother. ''When her mama comes to get her, and she gives her hugs and kisses, that's it right there,'' he said.
A Wish Come True
On Dec. 19, Chain 124 hurtled toward its conclusion with a final flurry of procedures at Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. Between dawn and dusk, three kidneys were removed and three were transplanted in neighboring operating rooms. One flew in from San Francisco. The last took off for O'Hare.
At the end of the cluster were Keith Zimmerman, 53, a bearish, good-humored man with a billy-goat's beard, and his older sister, Sherry Gluchowski, 59. She had recently moved from California to Texas but returned to donate her kidney.
The siblings had always been close, although family members marveled at their ability to bicker for 15 minutes over the proper way to construct a peanut butter sandwich. Their mother, Elsa Rickards, remembered teaching them as children ''that they might not have their mommy and daddy all the time, but they will always have each other.''
Mr. Zimmerman, who runs a repossession firm with his wife in Santa Clarita, had been given a diagnosis of kidney disease 25 years ago. With the help of a nutritionist, he had managed to avoid dialysis until the very last day before his transplant, when his doctor said the procedure was needed to clear his body of excess fluid.
In his hospital room before surgery, with seven family members shoehorned into every nook, Mr. Zimmerman calmed his nerves by listening to Aaron Neville on his iPod. He said he considered himself ''the lottery winner'' in the chain because his kidney would be coming from a healthy 28-year-old, Conor Bidelspach of Bend, Ore.
The surgery to remove a kidney, known as a nephrectomy, is remarkably bloodless these days. With Mr. Bidelspach on the table, Dr. Peter G. Schulam cut four dime-sized incisions on the left side of the abdomen. Through tubes inserted in the openings, the surgeon and his team maneuvered their cauterizing scalpels and a laparoscopic camera, which relayed images of Mr. Bidelspach's insides to monitors overhead.
The scalpel's super-heated pincers clamped down like crab claws, searing the kidney from surrounding tissue. There was no need to cut any muscle.
Once the kidney was free of connective tissue, Dr. Schulam clamped and snipped the renal artery and vein and ureter. He captured the kidney in a plastic bag, cinched it shut, and withdrew it quickly through a finger-length incision along the pelvic line.
The doctor poured the kidney into a bowl of ice and drained it of remaining blood. The slush in the blue bowl turned fruit-punch pink.
As others stitched up Mr. Bidelspach, Dr. Schulam wheeled the kidney on a cart into an adjoining operating room, where Mr. Zimmerman was already anesthetized. After stretching a hole in Mr. Zimmerman's midsection with a metal retractor, Dr. Jeffrey L. Veale lowered the kidney into place and sewed in the renal artery and vein. As soon as he unclamped them, the kidney pinked up with blood flow. Before attaching the ureter to the bladder, he gently massaged the tip of the narrow tube between two fingers and watched it spurt a few drops of urine.
''No more dialysis for Mr. Zimmerman,'' Dr. Veale declared. ''This total stranger's kidney is making him pee.'' He left Mr. Zimmerman's own kidneys to shrivel harmlessly in place (removing them would add to surgical risk).
Meanwhile, Dr. Schulam was in yet another operating room removing Ms. Gluchowski's kidney. He placed it in a plastic bag filled with a preservative solution and knotted it shut, like a goldfish brought home from the pet store. It was packed in a plastic tub, topped with ice, and loaded into a cardboard box marked ''Left Kidney -- Donated Human Organ/Tissue for Transplant -- Keep Upright.''
A courier in one of Quick International's big red vans drove Sherry Gluchowski's kidney through stop-and-go traffic on Interstate 405 to the Los Angeles airport. Cynthia Goff, an operations supervisor for the courier company who had volunteered to accompany the kidney to Chicago, rolled the box into the terminal strapped atop her carry-on with a bungee cord. A pit bull, waiting to be placed in its travel kennel, strolled by and sniffed.
After security agents checked the box with a desktop scanner, Ms. Goff rolled the kidney down the concourse, past a currency exchange and a store selling Elmo dolls for Christmas. Escorted onto United 564, an overnight flight that would land in Chicago at 5 a.m., she stowed the box in the business-class closet, next to a flight attendant's overcoat.
Airplanes carrying donor organs are granted special status, allowing them to move to the front of takeoff lines and ahead of air traffic. Mr. Hil, who tries to avoid routing kidneys on connecting flights and always schedules backups, said none of his registry's transplants had been held up by transportation problems.
By the time Ms. Gluchowski's kidney made it to Loyola and was transplanted into Mr. Terry, it had been cold for almost 12 hours. Early studies have found no evidence that shipping live kidneys such distances affects their immediate function.
Chain 124 ended at Loyola because Mr. Hil had arranged for the final kidney to go to a hospital that had produced a Good Samaritan donor to start a chain in the past, thus closing a loop. Dr. John Milner, a transplant surgeon at Loyola, said he then selected Mr. Terry to receive the kidney because he was the best immunological match on the hospital's wait list.
When Dr. Milner called with the news in early December, Mr. Terry was floored at his remarkable good fortune. Having felt unfairly condemned when he was first placed on dialysis, he now wondered what he had done to deserve a gift that 90,000 others needed just as much.
As it sank in that his would be the last of 30 interconnected transplants, Mr. Terry began to feel guilty that he would be ending the chain. ''Is it going to continue?'' he asked Dr. Milner. ''I don't want to be the reason to stop anything.''
''No, no, no,'' the doctor reassured him. ''This chain ends, but another one begins.''

HEADLINE: 20th-Century Ideas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Francis Fukuyama's review of the book I helped Tony Judt to write, ''Thinking the Twentieth Century'' (Feb. 5), is an ironic text. The age of ideology being over, Fukuyama says, we should respect Judt the historian but disregard Judt the intellectual. 
Yet Fukuyama is himself an intellectual, the ideologist of ''the end of history.'' The Iraq war, which Fukuyama's ideas justified and which he advocated, left America morally incapacitated, politically divided, economically weak and beholden to China. It also killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of human beings. Judt was right and Fukuyama was wrong, about the war in particular and the nature of history in general.
Fukuyama takes Judt's criticism personally, which is understandable since he has changed his mind about the war. Regrettably, he avoids applying his enviable mind to the real question, which is why he and so many other brilliant people could generate so much persuasive error on such a crucial issue. Part of the answer is that denying the significance of the past generates poor decisions. The claim that we have outgrown ideas is itself a dangerous ideology, depriving citizens of the intellectual tools they need to defend themselves. The Republican presidential debates, for example, rehearse discredited 20th-century ideas over and over again, and woe to the voters who do not see this.
Fukuyama closes with the dreamy admission that his own students know little of the 20th century: well, the semester has just started, so there's plenty of time to hit the books.
TIMOTHY SNYDER New Haven The writer is a professor of history at Yale University.
To the Editor:
Francis Fukuyama does a fine job of reviewing Tony Judt's conversations with Timothy Snyder and using them as a window on Judt's intellectual development as an observer of the 20th century. His conclusion that Judt's view was wrong, however, seems more a defense of his ''end of history'' concept than a realistic look at today's world. ''Totalitarianism has disappeared, except in a few small countries like Cuba and North Korea,'' he writes. Tell that to Syrians, to the people of Myanmar, to those in sub-/Saharan Africa where failed states like Somalia make totalitarian states like Zimbabwe look good by comparison, to inhabitants of Kazakhstan . . . the list goes on and on.
Fukuyama says his students find the ideological battles of the 20th century ''neither meaningful nor interesting.'' Perhaps he can make those battles interesting to them; if not, they may get firsthand experience.

HEADLINE: Giving Ideas a Kick in the Wallet

BYLINE: By HANNAH MIET

 BODY:
When Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, announced a partnership between the Council and the Manhattan Internet company Kickstarter during her State of the City address this month, there may have been some head-scratching in the room.
Ms. Quinn said the City Council would create its own page on the three-year-old fund-raising Web site this spring to promote community projects in neighborhoods with high unemployment rates; the hope was to spur development in those areas. 
Kickstarter is as far from a bureaucratic appropriations process as one can get. Anyone can propose a creative project on Kickstarter and sites like it, and set a goal for donations: a few thousand dollars to finance a mural, or hundreds of thousands for an independent film. Donors are charged only if the goal is met, and are often promised sweeteners in return for their contributions, pledge-drive style. (In government, that might be called a bribe.)
An interesting aspect of Kickstarter is that while people's pitches are presumably aimed at their friends and (ever-expanding) social networks, anyone who happens to be browsing on the site could decide to offer a few dollars to a total stranger whose dream seems worth supporting. We did a little browsing and present here some New York City Kickstarter dreams. (No City Council endorsement is implied.)
''Love Ever After,'' a photography book by Lauren Fleishman of Brooklyn
Three years ago, Ms. Fleishman began photographing and interviewing New York couples who had been married for at least 50 years. Through Kickstarter, she is raising money to continue, and she has already surpassed her $15,000 goal. She plans to photograph 15 other elderly couples and turn the series into a book. ''We met in 1939 and we didn't have money,'' Fran Futterman, half of a couple Ms. Fleishman photographed playing their piano side by side, told her. ''So we enjoyed each other's company.''
Snap's, Snap's, a biodiesel-powered food truck, by Liz and Zeph Courtney of Brooklyn
The Courtneys are trying to raise $10,000 by March 12 to get their Chicago-style hot-dog truck on the road; the vehicle will run on the leftover oil from their deep fryer. Donors backing Snap's will be rewarded with certificates for free food, like panko-crusted avocado fries, to be served alongside the Brat Mi, a Vietnamese-style bratwurst sandwich.
The Harlem Arts Festival
The festival team needs $12,000 by March 18 to produce a free showcase of music, dance, theater and visual art by Harlem artists, to be put on in a park this June. ''We want to celebrate the artistic legacy of Harlem by taking a contemporary look at the art that's made here now,'' Chelsea Goding, the festival's development director, said in its Kickstarter pitch video.
Wonder Threads, laptop and iPad cases by Diana Rodgers of Astoria, Queens
Ms. Rodgers, a fashion designer, is trying to raise $14,000 by March 5 for the materials to make laptop and iPad cases that look like interoffice envelopes and marble composition notebooks.
''Pavilion,'' a feature film made by Tim Sutton of Brooklyn
Mr. Sutton, a filmmaker who founded Video Kid Brooklyn, a digital media arts workshop for New York City youth, got his first feature film accepted into the South by Southwest Film Festival. Called ''Pavilion,'' it is about ''the secret lives of teenagers,'' its Kickstarter page says. Mr. Sutton has already surpassed his goal of $25,000 to promote and color-correct the film, in addition to perfecting the audio.
''Death Boogie,'' a hip-hop musical directed by Jennifer McGrath of the Lower East Side
The Mighty Third Rail, a trio that mixes hip-hop, poetry, beat-boxing, violin and upright bass, is working with Ms. McGrath, a theater director, to take the production ''Death Boogie'' to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. They are asking for $20,000 by March 4 to do so.
''American Ecstasy,'' a photographic memoir by Barbara Nitke of Manhattan
While working in New York as a set photographer for pornographic movies in the 1980s, Ms. Nitke captured the reality behind the fantasy: the male hunks yawning between takes, the bored eyes of starlets surrounded by dildos, the sudden shifts from camera-ready ecstasy to tired desensitization. She is trying to raise $25,000 to create and distribute ''American Ecstasy,'' a memoir of what she calls ''the golden age of porn.''
''Heavenly Sight,'' an audio history project by Artemis Media and Murray Street Productions; the latter is in Manhattan
The groups are seeking $18,000 to develop a living-history Web site on blind musicians to complement a Black History Month radio special. If financed, heavenlysight8.org will be developed, based on guidelines from the National Federation of the Blind and the Perkins School for the Blind, to be easier for the vision-impaired to use.
''It Rides Upon Us,'' a photobook by Ross Goodwin of Washington (one day to go)
Mr. Goodwin photographed rural and urban decay alongside Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line between Washington and New York City. He already surpassed his (very precise) goal of $1,776 and will use the money to take more photos along the tracks, then design and produce a book of his photos and accompanying vignettes. The inspiration for the book's title comes from a Henry David Thoreau quotation: ''We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us.''
''Crazy and Proud,'' an e-book that mixes photography and audio, by Lowell Handler of Manhattan (one day to go)
In 1999, Lowell Handler, who has Tourette's syndrome, began teaching photography to mentally ill women at a city shelter. He has already reached his $3,300 goal and will use all the money he raises by his deadline - Saturday night - to make an e-book of the photographs taken by these women, accompanied by audio interviews he conducted with them.
''I found that these women in these shelters were taking better photographs than the students I taught in colleges,'' Mr. Handler said. The students ''knew a little about photography, but they knew nothing about life,'' he said, adding, ''The women knew nothing about photography, but they knew everything about life.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
