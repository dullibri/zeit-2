HEADLINE: HOUSE PROUD;
It Was a Dark and Stormy Rewrite . . .

BYLINE: By JULIE MICHAELS 

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
JONATHAN HARR is a homebody. His world by day and most nights -- is a book-lined study at the front of a turn-of-the-century Victorian house in this college town. In his study, Mr. Harr spent eight years writing "A Civil Action," a nonfiction blockbuster that has sold a million copies since its publication in 1995. The story of an ambitious lawyer with a passion for social justice, Mr. Harr's book follows a lawsuit against two companies accused of dumping toxic wastes and causing leukemia in children in Woburn, Mass.
A meticulous reporter with a novelist's gift for narrative, the author fashioned a legal thriller out of an enormously complex case. Even John Grisham, master of the genre, has called the book, published by Random House, "the most compelling chronicle of litigation" he has ever read. 
 Hollywood agreed. Mr. Harr sold the film rights to Robert Redford and the Walt Disney Company for $1.25 million. The film, starring John Travolta, is to open on Christmas Day. For Mr. Harr and his wife, Diane, the windfall was a happy ending to years of struggle. His $80,000 advance petered out long before the manuscript was completed. To get by, they relied on Mrs. Harr's salary as a part-time art teacher. Their one buffer against hard times was their house.
Within walking distance of Northampton's trendy downtown, the house sits on a sleepy, tree-lined street, its wraparound porch reminiscent of an Andy Hardy movie. The couple bought the place for $86,000 in 1981. But with interest rates at 17 percent, they could afford it only by converting the upstairs into two rentals.
"I hated being a landlord," Mr. Harr, 49, recalled during a late-summer lunch at his house. "We had only one thermostat, which meant we paid for the heat. I'd lie in bed at night, hear the furnace turn over and listen to my money going up the chimney."
As Mr. Harr struggled with his book, he never dreamed of having a best seller, much less a movie sale. He hoped "A Civil Action" would earn enough for a new roof.
"When you go from $2,500 in the bank to $1.25 million, a strange delirium sets in," he said, reaching down to pet his creaky basset hound, McPhee (named for the nonfiction master John McPhee). Finally they asked their tenants to leave, then moved out themselves, for six months of renovation.
The couple had two priorities: Mr. Harr's office and the kitchen. Although south-facing, the office was darkened by the overhanging porch. During endless months of reading and annotating court documents -- stacked up, they'd have stood as tall as a three-story building -- he had longed for light. "I look back," he said, "and it seems to me it was always winter, always dark. I felt I had lived eight years in a cave."
When he wasn't in his cave, Mr. Harr was in the kitchen. Both Harrs are passionate cooks, as evidenced by a garden heavy with ripe tomatoes and the chilled orange-and-carrot soup Mrs. Harr had made for lunch.
In preliminary interviews with architects, the kitchen expanded and contracted, the study moved upstairs and down. But it wasn't until the Harrs met Tom Douglas, of the Northampton firm bearing his name, that they found someone who shared their vision.
"It was a great house," Mr. Douglas said, "but the interior was chopped up into a bunch of small, dark rooms." By moving a staircase and consolidating some rooms, the architect was able to open up the downstairs area. An addition at the rear -- what Mrs. Harr calls the "Victorian ranch" wing -- was rebuilt with a guest bedroom, a bath and an expanded dining room.
Mr. Douglas left the study at the front of the house. He solved the light problem by linking the room via an open arch to the former living room, now a library. The area is flooded by light from a bay window.
"Initially, I envisioned a more formal room, with a library table and chairs," Mr. Douglas said. But Mr. Harr's work habits required a couch. He does his best thinking -- and his best worrying -- lying down.
Like any struggling writer, Mr. Harr worried constantly about money. Midway through the book, broke and mired in rewriting, he considered applying for a job at a Burger King. That goes a long way toward explaining his Depression-style spending habits. But he couldn't resist splurging on the new kitchen.
Anchored by a 48-inch professional Viking stove and a Sub-Zero refrigerator, it is designed to accommodate two cooks working side by side. One wall is lined with pale maple cabinets, specially designed by Lance Hodes of Haydenville (Mass.) Woodworking and Design. The black counter tops are made of Ashfield schist, a local slate.
But some costs Mr. Harr could not countenance. For the kitchen, Mr. Douglas chose a handsome German faucet by Grohe but didn't note that it listed for $600. Mr. Harr rejected it. "But it haunted me," the architect said with a laugh. "At every meeting that followed, Jonathan always managed to bring up the Grohe faucet."
Mrs. Harr cheerfully conceded that she learned early on not to miss meetings with the architect. One time, Mr. Harr eliminated a shower in the master bath and counters of crow's-foot schist, a spectacular black slate with pale flecks that mimic avian footprints. "I made him put them back," she said.
Mr. Douglas confessed that his greatest concern was Tracy Kidder, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author, who is Mr. Harr's best friend and Northampton neighbor. Mr. Kidder wrote "House," an account of the design and construction of a house in nearby Amherst -- and the disputes and misunderstandings that occurred as it went up. "Any architect would be nervous if he knew the guy who wrote 'House' was scrutinizing his drawings," Mr. Douglas said.
He need not have worried. The Harrs, who spent $300,000 on the project, said they are delighted. Over lunch, the couple spoke of their old house -- its faulty wiring, its old furnace -- the way one would speak of an old friend. They bickered good-naturedly over who saw it first and just how much they charged in rents. Finally, Mr. Harr escaped to walk McPhee, while Mrs. Harr offered an upstairs tour.
The larger apartment has become a second guest room and the master bedroom suite, with its fancy counter tops and walk-in shower. The second apartment became Mrs. Harr's studio. Then she opened a door to reveal that apartment's old kitchen.
"We decided we'd keep it," she said, ever the pragmatist. "Jonathan wants to write another book, and you never know -- if we need the income, we can always rent it out."

Mortgage Debate: Wait Or Seize the Moment?

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
HOW loooooooow can they go?
With the rates for many mortgages almost a percentage point below where they were a year ago, prospective co-op and condominium buyers in Manhattan are asking their mortgage brokers whether they should take the plunge or wait until the stock market -- or interest rates -- take another dive. 
 The answer depends on whom you talk to. The heads of New York City's two biggest mortgage brokerages -- Skyscraper Mortgage and Manhattan Mortgage -- give intriguingly different advice.
Neil Bader, the chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage, said he tells clients who don't have to buy now to "hold off for six months." Mr. Bader, who wrote $750 million in mortgages last year, predicts that real estate prices in Manhattan will soften further -- financial parlance for "go down" -- and that mortgage interest rates will also decrease.
Since the Dow Jones industrial average's 512-point plunge on Aug. 31, Mr. Bader has been besieged with calls from nervous buyers. His purchase business -- as opposed to the refinancing of existing mortgages to take advantage of the low rates -- is down 35 percent from what it was in September 1997, he said.
Meanwhile, his chief competitor, Melissa Cohn, the president of Manhattan Mortgage, said that the number of customers applying through her company for a new mortgage, not a refinance, has stayed almost the same. What has changed are the percentages those new mortgages represent. In September 1997, new mortgage applications made up 76 percent of the company's $800 million-a-year business. This September, new buyers made up 59 percent. The number of refinancings almost doubled -- from 24 percent in September 1997 to 41 percent last month.
Ms. Cohn is advising buyers to seize the moment.
"It's impossible to predict the future," she said. "First, the apartment you love may not be there in six months. Second, nothing says that prices -- after one month of softening -- may not turn around and start going up again. And third, interest rates could go up."
The discrepancy between the Skyscraper figures, which show a significant drop in applications to buy, and those from Manhattan Mortgage, which show about the same number of applications, can be readily explained. Skyscraper, Mr. Bader said, owes 80 percent of its business to Wall Street -- brokers, bankers and lawyers. Only 40 percent of Manhattan Mortgage's business comes from Wall Street, Ms. Cohn said.
"The people closest to Wall Street -- the high-flying folks -- may not be coming into the marketplace," said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president with HSH Associates, of Butler, N.J., a financial publisher that surveys lenders across the country. "Whereas people not connected with it, more middle-market folks, just don't notice any difference."
For those who have decided to buy, Mr. Bader, Ms. Cohn and other mortgage brokers surveyed this week offered the following advice:
If you're wondering whether to go for a 30-year fixed mortgage or one of the tailor-made 5-, 7- or 10-year adjustable mortgages -- in which the interest rate remains fixed for the first 5, 7 or 10 years and then adjusts relative to the prevailing rates -- consider this. Current 30-year fixed-mortgage interest rates, which were around 6.69 percent yesterday, according to HSH, are the lowest in three decades. So, if you're a bit of a gambler, or if you know you're going to live in your new house for, say, exactly 10 years, you'll pay less per month with a 10-year adjustable.
Match the product to the time frame, brokers say. They agree that if you need a $300,000 mortgage, you'll pay $120 less a month in the first decade of a 10-year adjustable than for a 30-year fixed.
But with the rates for 30-year fixed loans so low, some buyers may prefer to pay the extra and relax. After all, over the next 30 years, rates will almost certainly go up. (Remember when mortgages hit 16 percent during the Carter Administration?)
"It may be that with all the uncertainty, you feel most comfortable by jumping into a 30-year fixed," Mr. Gumbinger of HSH said. "It provides the most stability, but you'll have to pay for it."

HEADLINE: G.M. to Open Doors of On-Line National Showroom

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
THE burgeoning Internet has often been compared with the automobile industry in the early days of mass production. Now the big auto makers want to take more of their business on line.
The General Motors Corporation intends to become the first auto maker to offer nationwide Internet shopping for the cars and trucks sitting on participating dealers' lots. 
 The company announced this week that GM Buy Power (www. gmbuypower.com), a Web site, would start operating in the first quarter of 1999, enabling customers to do everything over the Internet except actually buy and take delivery of a vehicle, which must still be done at a dealership.
The on-line customer will be able to schedule a test drive, ask the dealer to hold or locate a specific vehicle, find out the dealer's best price on a selected vehicle and apply for pre-approved financing from the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. The Web site will list all vehicles in inventory at dealers participating in the service, with the list updated daily.
Unlike such other on-line buying services as Autobytel and Microsoft's Carpoint, GM Buy Power will not limit consumers to shopping a specific geographic area, giving them a wider choice, a spokesman for G.M. said.
G.M. dealers will not pay a monthly subscription fee to participate in the service and, for the first nine months of 1999, G.M. will not charge dealers an enrollment fee. Other services require a monthly fee in return for limiting the number of dealers in an area who can participate.
All G.M. dealers can be part of GM Buy Power if they agree to certain customer standards; install required computer hardware, which costs about $1,000, and send a dealership manager through training.
G.M. research shows that customers want the time needed to buy a vehicle at a dealership to be an hour to an hour and a half instead of the usual three to five hours, said Ron Sobrero, the Chevrolet general sales and service manager who is a leader of the national roll-out of the site.
The Internet is becoming too popular with car shoppers for auto manufacturers to ignore.
Nearly 25 percent of vehicle shoppers search the Internet for information before buying, a number that is likely to rise to 50 to 60 percent in 2000, according to a recent study by J. D. Power and Associates of Agoura Hills, Calif.
G.M.'s decision to take the on-line shopping service nationwide follows a successful test started in October in four Western states: California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. In the test, the Buy Power site received more than 670,000 visits in its first 10 months, with users spending an average of 11 minutes there, making it one of G.M.'s most active sites. More than 60 percent of the dealers in the region participated in the service, and consumers made more than 300,000 on-line searches for GM Buy Power dealers.
Both Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation plan to upgrade their Web sites (www2.Ford. com) and (www2.Chryslercorp. com) to offer similar listings of dealer inventory and the ability to find out a dealer's best price. Both currently offer model specifications (but not listings of specific vehicles) and the ability to get a quote from a dealer on a car or truck via phone or E-mail.

HEADLINE: Germany's Futile Look Back

BYLINE: By Norbert Walter; Norbert Walter is chief economist of the Deutsche Bank Group.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
Everyone is attributing Helmut Kohl's defeat in the German elections to one decisive factor: that, after 16 years, the people here wanted a change. In fact, the opposite is true: the voters in the world's third-largest economy essentially expressed their desire to leave things unchanged.
In Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democratic victor, they have chosen a leader who has nurtured a happy-go-lucky isolationism, allowing them to hold on to all those cherished notions of the German welfare state. After all, if they really looked across their borders, they would discover that many Europeans have sobered up and changed their ways. 
 In his campaign, Mr. Schroder vowed to "modernize" Germany. Yet he has already announced that some of the very modest cuts the Kohl Government had sought in the welfare system would be revoked. Succumbing to redistributionist policies generous even by German standards is surely no way to "modernize." Nor can the unemployment problem be solved by continuing the huge subsidies that prop up old-line industries like coal and steel.
Holding on to the illusions of the past only means that Germany will waste more time on the road to reform. But reform is inevitable, as Mr. Schroder surely understands.
When push comes to shove, one can ultimately count on the new Chancellor to be a pragmatist. His Government will eventually come around to discovering what virtually everybody else, including Britain's reformed Labor Party, has already learned. In the long run, the only way to solve the scourge of unemployment is to bring wage costs in line with international levels. As long as German industrial workers, with their generous benefits, cost up to 80 percent more than their American counterparts, unemployment will not decline dramatically.
I assume it will take a year or two for the new Government to find its proper step. In the meantime, the world can judge Mr. Schroder's seriousness -- or perhaps even his ability to speed up this timetable -- with two important tests. The first is whether he announces that some of the policies he had promised are too expensive to be carried out because of the deficit left behind by the previous Government. That is what Bill Clinton and Lionel Jospin, the French Prime Minister, did after they were first elected. If Mr. Schroder does not resort to this old trick, he can count on having a much harder time reining in his parliamentary troops.
The second big test is whether the Chancellor-elect will succeed in integrating Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democrats' powerful chairman, into his Cabinet as Finance Minister. If Mr. Lafontaine takes the post, as many expect, Mr. Schroder can be relieved that his main political competitor will have effectively become a member of the inside team. But if Mr. Lafontaine does not join the Government, trouble lies ahead. Unlike Tony Blair, Mr. Schroder is not clearly in control of his party, and Mr. Lafontaine is influential enough to undermine any reformist tendencies. His economic instincts are, for the most part, similar to those of the old-line British Laborites, who saw the state as the overriding factor in the economy.
Fortunately, even if Mr. Schroder fails both of these early tests, there is yet another check to keep Germany from going overboard. Today, most European Union countries are governed by social democrats. In the past, such a political landscape translated into a push for more public spending. But these days, thanks to the disciplinary forces of the European Monetary Union, that tendency is being reined in. The German budget for next year is already set, and it will meet the deficit limit set by the European Union. The new Government can shuffle money around a bit, but it cannot exceed the spending levels.
The monetary union exerts an enormous amount of peer pressure. If Germany's Social Democrats are inclined to overdo it on social spending, the finance ministers and prime ministers of the other European countries, most of them left-leaning, will probably come down hard on them. After undergoing painful belt-tightening themselves, the Europeans won't want to see the benefits of their sacrifices squandered. And the Germans, who have been the enforcers of fiscal discipline in Europe, will not want to become the objects of that enforcement themselves. Such are the disciplinary wonders of the new Europe.

HEADLINE: Clinton Putting Off Visits to India and Pakistan

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The White House said today that President Clinton had put off a visit to India and Pakistan, whose tests of nuclear devices in May set off alarm around the world.
"The President has decided to postpone his visit to India and Pakistan, which had been under review, which also means he will not be making a separate visit to Bangladesh," Michael D. McCurry, the President's spokesman, said at today's White House briefing. 
 He said the President would go ahead with plans to attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in Malaysia in mid-November. While he did not say what new countries might be put on the itinerary now that India and Pakistan are off it, other officials said South Korea and Japan might be added.
A year ago, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to visit India and Pakistan this fall "if all goes well." But in May, India exploded five nuclear devices. The United States imposed sanctions on India and warned Pakistan, India's longtime enemy, not to set off nuclear devices of its own. But Pakistan did, incurring sanctions.
The most severe sanctions against both countries have been lifted, and last week India and Pakistan pledged at the United Nations to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would prohibit nuclear testing.
But details of their participation in the treaty remain to be worked out. Mr. McCurry said today that the atmosphere was still not conducive to a Presidential visit, although he expressed pleasure that India and Pakistan had announced resumption of diplomatic talks.
"At the same time, the issues that we have been discussing with both Governments are complex and we believe will require more time to be addressed to our mutual satisfaction," Mr. McCurry said.
He said Mr. Clinton "is still eager to make the visit when we have had further significant progress with our respective security concerns."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Home Sales Down Again; Economic Indicators Flat

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes fell in August for the second consecutive month, a sign that the lowest mortgage rates in more than three decades might not be enough to give the housing market, and the economy, a lift in coming months. Separately, a measure of future economic activity held steady during August.
The Commerce Department said today that home sales dropped 4.4 percent in August from July, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 838,000 units. During July, sales had declined 4.9 percent from June's record sales level. 
 In a separate report, the Conference Board said the index of leading economic indicators was unchanged in August after having risen half a percent in July. That suggested the economy would keep expanding "through at least early 1999," the Conference Board, a private research organization, said.
"Domestically, the general health of the economy is pretty strong," Dan Seto, an economist at Nikko Securities Company International in New York, said. Although the economy is not likely to maintain its growth rate of the first half, when it expanded at a 3.7 percent annual rate, "we could easily get by with a 2 percent" rate in the second half, he said.
The two economic reports were released one day after the Federal Reserve cut the overnight bank lending rate to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent in an effort to keep the financial turmoil elsewhere in the world from doing too much harm to the American economy.
The level of home sales in August was the lowest since March. All of the weakness was in the South, where sales fell almost 14 percent, the biggest drop in three years. The Northeast, Midwest and West all registered single-digit gains.
The stagnant index of leading indicators sent a mixed signal. While the Conference Board said the report pointed to a continuation of the economy's expansion, which is nearly eight years old, the index has registered only one increase in the last four months. In contrast, the index rose in every month but one between July 1997 and April of this year.
Of the index's 10 components, five made a positive contribution in August, four were negative and one was unchanged. The biggest gain for August's index came from an increase in the money supply. The largest negative contributor was the slumping stock market.

Canada Drops CurrencyTrigger

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada has abandoned its policy of regular, predictable intervention in currency markets in defense of the Canadian dollar in favor of a more discretionary approach, bank officials said today.
The decision by the Canadian central bank and the Department of Finance marks the formal abandonment of the bank's policy of intervening in currency markets whenever the United States dollar moved 70 basis points against the Canadian dollar in either direction from the previous day's official close. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 The policy, first adopted by the bank in April 1995, was intended to smooth out volatility in Canadian dollar trading.
An official statement on the change said it was intended to increase the effectiveness and "signaling impact" of intervention.
In conformance with the change, the central bank stood on the sidelines this morning as the Canadian dollar tumbled through what would have been the central bank's normal intervention trigger.

HEADLINE: Possible I.M.F. Bailout Stirs Brazilians' Bitter Memories of 80's

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 30

 BODY:
With the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting about to start in Washington, with officials' weighing the cost and wisdom of bailing out Brazil from its deepening economic crisis, the prospect of a rescue package, however urgent, is stirring bitter memories among a cross-section of Brazilians.
Although Brazilian officials have been negotiating the size and conditions of possible aid for weeks, and the I.M.F. said today in Washington that it was negotiating a substantial aid package, the issue is so sensitive that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, hoping to be re-elected on Sunday, has not announced a formal request to the fund for assistance. 
 That has not stopped Mr. Cardoso's main opponent, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of the left-of-center Workers's Party, from attacking Mr. Cardoso as a slave of foreign bankers. In the free air time that candidates receive, the Workers' Party shows Mr. Cardoso with head bowed as an announcer discusses the sacrifices that foreign lenders demand.
Mr. da Silva has called the administration's attempts to negotiate an accord with the fund a crime and said it would "tighten one more knot on the neck around Brazilians."
A cartoon in Jornal do Brasil, the newspaper, struck the same theme, showing a drowning man being thrown a noose.
The outcome, due after the elections, will depend on the winner and the course of negotiations with the monetary fund. Talks with the United States and the fund have focused on a loan package most likely to exceed $30 billion.
Brazil had a bruising experience with the fund in the 80's, and the effects linger. A new accord, even attached to billions of dollars, is widely seen an admission of the Government's failure to put its house in order and a humiliating surrender of sovereignty over economic policy.
The Government in has recent years made once unimaginable strides in cutting inflation, from 3,000 percent a year four years ago to 3 percent this year. But its budget deficit has ballooned, to 7.2 percent of the gross national product, and a broad measure of the flow of goods and services, the current account, is running a deficit close to $35 billion.
Deficits are not new. But the shortage of credit for emerging markets has pushed Brazil to the brink of crisis. Since the Russian crisis began last month, foreign reserves have shrunk, from $70 billion to $42 billion, despite moves to protect the currency by doubling interest rates.
Brazil today is different from the country that defaulted on its foreign debt in 1981. It is six economic plans later. Many of the officials who lashed out at the monetary fund for imposing stiff conditions for aid 10 years ago are struggling to hold firm to stability and have answered the crisis with pledges to cut entitlements and other costs.
But among ordinary Brazilians, the I.M.F. is associated, if not faulted, for a punishing recession through the 1980's and with issuing spending limits that Brazil failed to meet.
"There was the idea that by freezing prices and other gimmicks you could get somewhere," said Sebastian Edwards, a professor of international economics at the University of California at Los Angeles who wrote "Crisis and Reform in Latin America" (Oxford University Press, 1996).
Although it signed 11 agreements with the monetary fund throughout the 80's, Professor Edwards said, Brazil insisted that because of its size and importance, it should not be subject to the same conditions as other nations in trouble.

HEADLINE: Red Ink No More;
With Deficits Gone, Benefits of Surplus Are Debated

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
For the better part of two decades, economists and elected officials promised that all kinds of good things would happen if the Federal Government stopped running huge budget deficits.
Today the Government closed the books on its fiscal year, and for the first time since 1969 the budget will show a surplus, which President Clinton said should be about $70 billion when all the calculations are completed in a few weeks. That is slightly higher than the $63 billion projected in August by the Congressional Budget Office. 
 So where's the payoff?
To some degree, the answer is straightforward: Interest rates are lower than they would be otherwise, a development that has helped push unemployment down and the stock market up throughout much of this decade. That shift has also helped establish the United States as an anchor of stability in a world now at risk from the deepening global financial crisis.
But even now, some economists and analysts think the benefits from fiscal prudence have been overstated, and some wonder whether the projected surpluses will materialize if the economy should slip into recession. There is still a debate about how much the strong economy reflects the nation's improved fiscal condition and how much the improved fiscal condition is a result of the strong economy.
There is also some lingering doubt, especially among liberal Democrats, about whether the fiscal belt-tightening will prove a good deal for low- and moderate-income people in the long run, or whether it primarily benefited Wall Street and the wealthy.
Moreover, there is no consensus yet about what to do with coming surpluses, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated will total $1.55 trillion over the next decade. The debate over tax cuts, additional spending, reducing the national debt and strengthening entitlement programs is only the beginning.
Indeed, there is a growing battle over whether the Government should consider itself to be in surplus at all, since nearly all of the excess revenues in coming years come from payroll taxes supposed to be earmarked for the Social Security trust fund.
The dawn of the surplus era passed all but unnoticed today in the financial markets, which have long since factored in the anticipated good news. Meanwhile, in Washington, it was a day for celebration and contention, with both Democrats and Republicans claiming credit for the turnaround while laying out their own priorities for the future.
Mr. Clinton reiterated his position that the surplus be kept in reserve until Congress and the Administration settle on a plan to shore up Social Security for the coming retirement of the baby-boom generation. Republicans kept up their demands that a chunk of the surplus be allocated to tax cuts so that it is not used for increased spending, and said that Mr. Clinton had already raided the surplus by proposing as much as $17 billion in emergency spending next year for domestic and military programs that fall outside the normal budget process.
Beyond the political posturing, there is agreement among many economists that fiscal rectitude, when combined with unexpectedly high tax receipts stemming in part from the rapid run-up in the stock market, helped to push down interest rates. That happened because the Government's borrowing requirements declined, and because the absence of fiscal stimulus convinced investors and the Federal Reserve that inflation was less of a threat.
Just how much lower rates are than they would have been in the absence of fiscal improvement is largely a matter of guesswork, given the myriad of interrelated factors that influence rates.
But there is little question that lower rates have been a key factor in keeping the economy growing since 1991 and in generating new jobs at a healthy pace while stimulating business investment in productivity-enhancing machinery and computers. As a result, many analysts say, the United States is facing a period of deepening global economic crisis with considerable strength and resilience, a far cry from its position a decade ago when it was frequently judged to be in economic decline.
"The strength of the economy that we're all enjoying now is in no small part attributable to the efforts we've made to eliminate the deficit," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the research group. "We can be buffeted by the winds from Asia and the waves from Latin America, and still our economy chugs along."
In the long run, moreover, moving from deficits to surpluses provides the United States with greater flexibility in economic and social policy, from cutting taxes to increasing spending and coping with the strains that will result from an aging population.
"All of our policy for years was driven by nickel-and-diming the deficit rather than asking what's the right policy," said Van Doorn Ooms, a former chief economist for the House Budget Committee who is now with the Committee for Economic Development, a business-sponsored research group.
"If we maintain our heads and approach this sensibly, it's much easier now to take on issues like Social Security and Medicare," he said.
Still, there have been challenges to the prevailing fiscal orthodoxy from both the left and the right.
To begin with, many liberals have long been uncomfortable with the notion that balancing the budget was more important than financing social programs. To some Democrats, the emphasis on eliminating the deficit remains little more than cover for Republicans who want to shrink the size and influence of the Federal Government. But they also acknowledge real benefits from fiscal prudence, particularly the Federal Reserve's willingness to cut interest rates early in the Clinton Administration and its increased tolerance for extremely low unemployment rates even as growth has remained strong.
"Those cuts in real interest rates were very important in propelling the economy forward," said Robert B. Reich, who was Labor Secretary during Mr. Clinton's first term. "On the other hand, deficit reduction meant cuts in domestic discretionary programs, especially those for the less well off. And the President was unable to do anything close to the $50 billion a year in education, training and research and development investments that he had built his 1992 campaign around."
Whether the sacrifices turn out to be worthwhile will depend on how well the economy holds up the next time the business cycle turns down and on how the country chooses to use the coming surpluses, Mr. Reich said.
"If they're turned into tax cuts that are mostly for people in the top 20 percent of income or wealth, then many of the sacrifices made by those in the bottom half, in terms of programs lost or investments not made, will have been for very little," Mr. Reich said. "If the surpluses are turned into investments in the productive capacities of people in the bottom half -- education, job retraining, an expanded earned-income tax credit, for example -- then the payoff may be quite substantial."
John F. Cogan, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former Reagan Administration budget official, questioned the premise that eliminating the deficit -- or more precisely, imposing higher taxes and restraining spending -- had been the key to the economy's strong performance.
"The causality is working in the other direction here," Mr. Cogan said. "The reason we have a budget surplus is not so much because we have had fiscal restraint -- although we have had more fiscal restraint in recent years -- but because of a healthy economy."
Mr. Cogan said the surpluses provided the nation with an opportunity to change its tax system, strengthen Social Security or reduce the $5.5 trillion national debt.
"Having said that, the surpluses can also represent a large problem," Mr. Cogan said. "Along with surpluses come, inevitably, the pressure to spend more, and we're already seeing the manifestation of that pressure.'
The assumption that the elimination of the deficit has brought tangible economic benefits is not universally accepted, either.
"Yes, we seem to be moving away from chaos and toward stability," Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant in New York, wrote recently in Challenge magazine. "It should be good news. And yet the payoff we were promised from reducing the budget deficit remains unfulfilled."
Mr. Bernstein argued that the trade deficit, which some economists had predicted would fall in tandem with the budget deficit, remained stubbornly high, even before the Asian crisis sent it even higher. And he made a case that interest rates, adjusted for inflation, have actually remained high despite the fiscal improvement.
The idea that the trade and budget deficits were inextricably linked may have been questionable from the start, since trade is subject to political and business influences as well as fiscal change. And given the tangle of complicated factors that determine interest rates, it is difficult to say what would have happened to rates had the nation not balanced its budget.
But Mr. Bernstein also made a point that would resonate with many economists in a world subject to rapid economic change: that it is hazardous to assume that changing one element in the country's economic mix could be counted on to have a certain result.
"The advocates of the mainstream hypothesis fell into error because they forgot one of the primary lessons of macroeconomics," Mr. Bernstein wrote. "Partial equilibrium -- moving one variable while holding all else constant -- is an interesting but a hazardous basis for prediction."
As a case in point, Mr. Bernstein cites savings rates. While deficits declined, reducing what economists call public dissaving, the savings rate in the private sector was falling.
"The profligate private sector, and a swelling stream of both domestic and foreign investment in the United States," Mr. Bernstein said, "thwarted the result that the mainstream had assured us was in the cards."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Reality Finally CatchesUp With the High-Flying Blue-Chip Stocks

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Even after many lesser stocks had faded, America's blue chips sailed into the third quarter seemingly headed for yet another year of improbably outsize gains. On July 17 the Dow Jones industrial average reached 9,337.97, with commentators still talking of the just-right "Goldilocks economy" and mulling over the existence of a possible "new era."
That turned out to be the pinnacle. Before long, the blue chips joined the rest of the stock market in a general slide as an array of negatives came together at once. Yesterday the Dow dropped 237.90 points, dragging the popular index back into minus territory for 1998. 
 "The big consumer stocks are the ones that took the beating," said Rao Chalasani, investment strategist at Everen Securities in Chicago, summing up the worst quarter for the stock market in eight years. "Finally things started catching up to them."
Laszlo Birinyi, consultant on trading strategy to Deutsche Bank Securities, said: "It was like a New Year's Eve party that ended at 11 o'clock. People were still dancing when the music stopped."
Asian problems flared again, Russian leadership grew shakier, the hoped-for gentle deceleration of the United States economy suddenly threatened an acute profit squeeze and President Clinton's grip on the White House came into serious doubt.
Weeks of tumbling prices preceded a gut-wrenching drop on the final day of August, a 512.61-point reality check that was the second-biggest point loss on record. After this, the Dow and the rest of the market regained some footing before sagging again at quarter's end.
There was little that escaped the third-quarter carnage. The 30-stock Dow industrials dropped 12.39 percent during the July-September period, the worst since its 14.86 percent decline in the third quarter of 1990.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.30 percent and the Nasdaq market index -- bolstered by a few technology giants -- eked out a gain of 61-hundredths of 1 percent.
The legacy of this summer's swoon remains. Nervousness and volatility now mark most trading sessions. The specter of an overseas meltdown, profit erosion and other worries are beginning to be reflected in the American economy in the form of lower capital spending, diminished consumer confidence and more caution among lenders.
Numerous market leaders have warned recently of profit shortfalls, further battering their shares. Coca-Cola, for example, lost 32.6 percent of its share value during the last three months. American Express lost 31.8 percent; Sears, Roebuck, 27.6 percent, and Walt Disney and J. P. Morgan, 27.7 percent each.
"Find another time in recent stock market history when the thinking shifted so dramatically," said Byron R. Wien, chief United States strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "This is a major change in attitude -- and it probably isn't over yet."
Not surprisingly, the shift was reflected in statements -- and this week in action -- by the Federal Reserve, where officials kept reappraising the balance of economic and financial risks and found that concern about unsustainably rapid growth and revived inflation had given way to their opposites. On Tuesday the Fed cut the target rate for short-term interest rates, the first reduction in nearly three years.
In a single quarter, observed Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, "you've seen Fed policy go from potentially restrictive to neutral to ease" as it became increasingly worried about exposure to foreign economic and financial storms.
Among the Dow components, the biggest loss was 38.1 percent by the Travelers Group, which succumbed to the general implosion of financial shares and the large foreign exposure of Citicorp, its merger partner. Citicorp finished the quarter at 93, barely half its April peak of 182.
As always, however, there were exceptions -- stocks that powered through the downdraft, indeed attracting some money pulled from those that stumbled.
Dell Computer, for example, soared 41.7 percent to close at $65.75, a performance that topped the company's 37 percent surge during the spring when its market value surpassed that of General Motors. I.B.M., not that long ago mired in the category of fallen star, climbed 11.5 percent over the summer, the second-best Dow performer, following a 10.5 percent second-quarter gain.
The top Dow stock among its eight quarterly gainers was Philip Morris, up 17 percent, as the legal cloud over tobacco issues lifted a bit and some skittish investors, mindful of the company's strong food and Miller beer businesses, turned defensive.
Stocks of two other major brewers, Anheuser-Busch and Coors, had strong summers before surrendering some gains in the quarter's final week.
Utilities, another defensive sector that benefits from falling interest rates as well, bucked the down trend, too. The Dow Jones utility average rose 4.4 percent for the quarter, with Peco Energy up 25.3 percent and Con Edison up 13.2 percent.
Health-related issues also showed resilience. Johnson & Johnson climbed 5.7 percent, and Long's Drug soared 39.2 percent as the second-best gainer among the S.& P. 500. Amoco, which British Petroleum is buying, jumped 29 percent to top a generally stable energy group as depressed oil prices edged higher.
Some analysts took some comfort in scattered strength among cyclical stocks because their continued slump could have pointed toward recession. International Paper, for example, was the third-strongest Dow stock during the quarter, rising 8.4 percent, while Alcoa was right behind with a gain of 7.7 percent.
"Maybe the domestic economy is healthier than we anticipated," Mr. Birinyi said.

HEADLINE: Iraq Stiffens Defiance to U.N. Demands for Spot Arms Checks

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Iraq today hardened its defiance of Security Council demands that it allow spot arms inspections to resume. At the same time it publicly staked its hopes of ending sanctions by calling on Secretary General Kofi Annan to take over a major review of Baghdad's stalemated relations with the United Nations.
Behind the scenes Iraqi officials are working diplomatic circles to try to reopen Security Council splits as Baghdad moves into a critical period in its relations with the organization, which is now united in demanding Iraqi cooperation before any concessions are made. 
 Calling the effects of the embargo on Iraq, "tantamount to internationally proscribed acts of genocide," Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf of Iraq told the General Assembly in a speech that an across-the-board look at more than eight years of sanctions could break the impasse.
But he appeared to assume that Iraq could expect the broad review -- different from periodic reviews of sanctions, which have now been suspended -- before making concessions.
On Aug. 5, Iraq stopped on-site inspections by arms monitors, prompting the Security Council resolution that freezes the regular 60-day reviews but leaving open the chance to look at the bigger picture if -- and after -- Iraq falls back into line.
"There is no reason for Iraq to believe that it can renegotiate the resolution and thereby change the sequence of events," said Peter Burleigh, the acting United States representative. In an interview today Mr. Burleigh said that he knew of no one who was prepared to make that case for Baghdad.
The United States is the only permanent Security Council member to refuse to meet this week with Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister and a liaison aide with the United Nations on sanctions. Mr. Aziz has met envoys from Britain, China, France and Russia.
The British, who have been strongest supporters of the United States on Iraq, take over the rotating presidency of the Council on Thursday for the month of October.
Next week the United Nations Special Commission, or Unscom, and the International Atomic Energy Agency are due to present major reports to the Council amid reports that Iraq has continued to try to assemble parts for a range of prohibited weapons in the country through purchases abroad or in cooperative efforts with friendly nations like Sudan.
At the independent Nuclear Control Institute in Washington, the research director, Steven Dolley, said today that in nuclear weapons Iraq might be "just a Russian smuggler away" from being able to build a bomb with illegally obtained material. Large stockpiles of natural uranium also remain in Iraq.
Large questions also surround chemical and biological weapons programs, Unscom arms inspectors say.
Some Security Council members say that all questions about all possible weapons can never be answered and that the Council should begin closing files wherever possible as an incentive to Iraq. The diplomats say it was a mistake not to have closed the nuclear file in July, when it came up for review.
Restitution is being paid to victims of the Iraqi campaign against Kuwait through the United Nations Compensation Commission in Geneva, which has been given one-third of all money earned on limited Iraqi oil sales through the program that is intended to counter the problems that Iraqis face because of sanctions.
Today in Geneva, where the Compensation Commission once languished for lack of money before the "oil for food" program, the panel announced today that it had paid $1.9 billion in claims.
Iraq and some United Nations officials have been critical of the Security Council decision to take off the first 30 percent off oil sales for compensation rather than allowing it all to go to food, medicine and other urgent civilian needs.
Today in Baghdad, Denis Halliday, who resigned as head of the program in Iraq and is leaving the United Nations, called the results of the oil sales "a shot of oxygen for Iraq and the people of Iraq." He said that the country had received more than seven million tons of food since March 1997.
But Mr. Halliday, who is to meet 40 members of the United States Congress next week to assess the effects of the sanctions, said he was uncomfortable with what he called the incompatibility of tough sanctions' inflicting suffering on one hand and relief aid on the other, both coming from the United Nations.
"I think nobody anticipated the duration of these sanctions," he said, "and therefore the human cost that they represent in terms of child mortality, infant mortality, chronic and acute malnutrition, and the collapse of many of the most positive aspects of Iraq's society."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Big Amount Withdrawn From Equity Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Investors made net withdrawals of $11.2 billion from equity mutual funds in August, the biggest outflow on record and the first month in eight years that more money flowed out of stock funds than went in, according to industry statistics released yesterday.
The Investment Company Institute, a trade group, confirmed yesterday what many fund companies had reported anecdotally since the tumultuous final days of August, when the stock market fell 19 percent below its July peak. Two independent trackers of mutual fund flows, AMG Data Services and Trim Tabs Financial Services, also reported earlier this month that stock funds experienced net withdrawals in August. 
 For the mutual fund industry, the withdrawals ended an extended streak during which the fund industry had expanded enormously. In September 1990, the last month when investors made net withdrawals from stock funds, those funds had $227 billion in assets, well below the $308 billion in bond funds.
Last year alone, stock funds received as much in new investments as they had total assets in 1990 -- $227 billion. And even with the August withdrawals, assets of stock funds had grown to nearly $2.4 trillion, more than double the $1.1 trillion invested in bond and hybrid funds. In the first seven months of this year, stock funds took in, on average, $20 billion a month in new investments.
In September, however, investors appeared to have returned to their old ways. With the worst of the volatility of late August and early September beginning to subside, mutual fund companies have again begun to see money flowing in, analysts said.
Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., estimates that in September, stock funds took in net new investments of $19.3 billion. AMG, based in Arcata, Calif., also reported that stock funds had received positive cash flows last month, although the amount is uncertain because a significant number of fund companies report their cash flows to AMG once a month.
In addition, some leading mutual fund companies, such as Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price AssociatesInc., said investors put money in stock funds during September after redeeming money in August.
As investors fled from stock funds in August, they sought out the relative safety of bond funds and other more conservative investments. The trade group said fixed-income funds added $5.82 billion in net new investments in August, compared with net new investments of $6.84 billionin July. Hybrid funds, which spread their assets among stocks, bonds and cash investments, had an outflow of $887.5 million in August, after adding $1.07 billion in July.
Money market funds also proved a sought-after haven for investors, according to the data released yesterday. The institute said that money market funds received a record $50.94 billion in net new investments in August, compared with $24.93 billion in July.
Equity fund managers also raised the amount of cash on hand in their portfolios in August, to 6 percent of assets, on average, from 5.2 percent in July.
As the major stock market indexes headed lower in August, mutual fund managers were said by traders at several large Wall Street firms to be heavy sellers of stocks. That selling might have been in anticipation of possible waves of redemptions from investors alarmed by a rapidly declining stock market.
One reason equity fund managers might have been forced to sell was that they have been steadily slicing away at the amount of spare cash in their portfolios over the last three years. The July percentage of assets in cash was down from 7 percent two years ago and nearly 13 percent in the fall of 1990, before stocks and stock funds went on their eight-year tear.
The recent streak is not the longest period of consecutive months of positive cash flow ever recorded, however. For more than 15 years, from October 1954 through May 1970 -- a stretch that coincided with a strong bull market in stocks -- investors similarly made monthly deposits into equity mutual funds, according to the Investment Company Institute.
In all likelihood, that streak was even longer. Before October 1954, the Investment Company Institute tracked fund flows on a quarterly basis, rather than monthly; stock funds recorded positive quarterly net flows of cash dating back to the first quarter of 1944.
Mutual fund shareholders have also gone through extended periods of disillusionment with equity funds. In the eight years from November 1971 through October 1979, which includes the bear market of 1973-74, investors each month took more money out of stock funds than they put in.
The data for monthly fund flows reported by the Investment Company Institute measure new sales of funds less reinvested dividends and withdrawals, or redemptions, plus the net amount of money switched between stock funds and other types of mutual funds, mainly those investing in bonds or money markets.

HEADLINE: Farm Prices Fell in September, U.S. Says

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Prices received by United States farmers for their crops and livestock were down 8.4 percent in September compared with the month last year, according to the Agriculture Department.
The All Farm Products Index, which reflects prices for a mix of commodities, had a September reading of 98, compared with 101 in August and 107 in September 1997, the department said in its monthly agricultural prices report. 
 The news will not come as a surprise to United States farmers, who have seen prices drop this year as huge worldwide crops and meat production and the decline of export demand from Asia, the top foreign market for United States farm products, weigh heavily on income.
Congress is currently working on a package to help United States farmers during the price crisis.
Wheat prices slid to their lowest level since August 1987, the department said. Wheat prices during September reached an average $2.37 a bushel, down 2 cents from the previous month and $1.29 lower than the same month last year.
The average corn price at $1.76 a bushel was the lowest since December 1987. The September corn price was down 14 cents from August and 76 cents from September 1997, the Agriculture Department said.

HEADLINE: White House to Increase Efforts To Help Fight Software Piracy

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore will announce today a stepped-up program intended to help combat software piracy worldwide.
The effort, which was applauded by industry executives yesterday, has two main elements. First, the White House will issue an executive order that directs all Federal agencies to insure that the Government and its contractors do not buy or use pirated software. And the White House is also directing the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshevsky, to press foreign governments to embark on similar programs. 
 "By making sure its own house is in order, this puts the United States Government in a stronger position to make the anti-piracy message overseas," said Brad Smith, general counsel for international affairs at the Microsoft Corporation, the largest software company.
The nation's software industry is thriving, having grown at seven times the rate of the economy over all during the 1990's. But software piracy is a growing concern for the industry, especially as foreign nations close the gap with the United States in computer use.
An estimated 27 percent of the software used in the United States has been illegally copied, violating copyright laws, estimates the Business Software Alliance, a trade group. In countries like China and Russia, however, the piracy rates are estimated at more than 90 percent. Even in nations like Taiwan and Spain, the piracy rates are roughly 60 percent. The Government announcement will show that the software industry is raising its voice in Washington and it is being heard.
"This is a big deal from our perspective and having the White House weigh in certainly strengthens the message the industry has been making for some time," said Eric Schmidt, chairman of Novell Inc., a networking software company in San Jose, Calif.

HEADLINE: Germany's New Leader Gives France Reassurances About Ties

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 30

 BODY:
He will not become Chancellor until after the new German Parliament is sworn in and he can form a coalition Government, maybe at the end of October, Gerhard Schroder said today, but that did not stop the French from hanging on his every word for signs that he might love them less than he loves the British.
Making his first foray abroad since Sunday's election, Mr. Schroder reassured President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and French journalists today that he wanted to strengthen Germany's relations with France every bit as much as those with Britain, for the greater good of Europe. 
 And he made music to Mr. Chirac's ears by agreeing with him on the need for better regulation of global capital flows to head off world recession. France will press that demand at coming meetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and finance ministers of leading industrial democracies.
Though that and much else Mr. Schroder said today does not yet amount to official policy, as French officials said they realized, they were happy with what they heard.
Standing side by side with President Jacques Chirac in the courtyard of Elysee Palace, where heads of state and Government are received though he is neither, Mr. Schroder said, "The President and I are of one opinion on the necessity of regulating capital flows and financial markets better than in the past."
At a news conference at the German Embassy later, he added, "We need more coordination in international economic policy, especially for uncontrolled capital flows that can bring whole economies under pressure."
The French had been unsettled by earlier statements by Mr. Schroder that he wanted to build his European policy not only on close ties with France but on a trilateral basis that would also include Britain.
French officials said Mr. Chirac had raised the urgent issue of the need for a coordinated position of the NATO alliance on how to stop Yugoslav Army attacks on civilians in Kosovo, a province of Serbia.
France and Britain sponsored a resolution on Kosovo that the United Nations Security Council adopted last week, warning Yugoslavia to stop the attacks, and French officials said their view now was that this resolution provided sufficient authority for the alliance to carry out threats of bombing Yugoslav forces.
Mr. Schroder said his party's position agreed that a Council resolution was needed before NATO could act.
Mr. Schroder, a Social Democrat, had lunch at the German Embassy with the conservative Mr. Chirac and then spent the afternoon with Prime Minister Jospin, a Socialist, and key French ministers.
After the meetings, French officials said their leaders had agreed with the Chancellor-elect that jobs and the social consequences of economic policy ought to rank high in European priorities after years of reducing deficits, at German insistence, to prepare the Continent for a common currency that will be introduced in 11 countries in January.
Mr. Schroder agreed with Mr. Chirac to set up joint working groups to find ways of invigorating French-German relations and of working out a common position on how to modify the cumbersome institutions of the 15-nation European Union.
Visibly reassured after finishing off his lunch with Mr. Schroder with Cuban cigars, Mr. Chirac told him he should feel at home at Elysee Palace.
Both said they believed that strengthening relations with Britain was no threat to any third country.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Volume of New Issues Slows Sharply

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Wall Street's core business -- the underwriting of stocks and bonds -- slowed significantly in the third quarter after relatively smooth growth in recent years.
Securities firms and banks issued $392.6 billion of bonds and stocks in the three months ended Sept. 30 amid much more volatile markets, greater caution among American investors and issuers of securities, and the swoon in the stock market that began in mid-July as global economic problems spread -- particularly in Japan, other Asian countries and Russia. 
 The volume was up 5 percent from the quarter a year earlier. But the pace of underwriting has slowed sharply from the first six months of this year, when banks and securities firms raised almost $1 trillion as companies issued bonds and shares at record rates in the most buoyant securities markets in a generation.
The ranking of the firms most active in managing securities issues for the third quarter was led by Merrill Lynch & Company, which raised $59 billion, followed by Goldman, Sachs & Company, Salomon Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Lehman Brothers.
Wall Street executives who have had a run of good markets in recent years were buffeted by this summer's more difficult markets.
"It was tough," said Steven D. Black, vice chairman and chief operating officer of Salomon Smith Barney, the brokerage subsidiary of the Travelers Group. "The longer the quarter went, the worse it got. September will show up as one of the worst months in terms of equity issue business.
"No matter what you did, you felt you were trying to catch a falling knife," Mr. Black said. "If you were an issuer, why go into the market with all the uncertainty? You're better off just to sit and wait."
Some see some improvement in the equity markets in recent weeks. "July globally was an unbelievably good market," said Mark Hantho, a managing director in equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, "In August the brakes were firmly applied, almost nothing was working in the market. But in September, the market was slowly emerging on a very selective basis," with some big companies gradually coming back to the markets.
The summer difficulties have taken a toll on even the best companies. "In a market crack like we have had, good and bad names suffer," said Vincent T. Pica, group president of the capital finance group at Prudential Securities.
The bond markets practically froze over after Russia defaulted on some obligations in mid-August.
The securities industry went "from printing about $7 billion a week of investment-grade debt to zero," in August, and has only begun to revive in recent weeks, said Kevin M. Kelly, the managing director at Goldman, Sachs in charge of new bond issue business. Last week, he said, the industry had continued its recovery, issuing about $5 billion of investment-grade debt. Recent debt issue activity, he noted, involved blue-chip borrowers almost exclusively. "We have quite a long way to go before we can get to covering the gamut of issuers."
Mergers and acquisitions also slowed markedly in the third quarter, as raising money for acquisitions became more difficult and company managers grew more cautious. There were $327.7 billion of mergers and acquisitions announced in the third quarter, according to preliminary figures compiled yesterday by the Securities Data Company of Newark. That represents a decline of more than 50 percent from $701 billion of mergers in the second quarter of this year, although it still represents a considerable increase from $192 billion of such transactions in last year's third quarter.
The decline in the volume of new securities issues was particularly pronounced in more speculative markets, such as those for initial public offerings and high-yield bonds. The industry managed 69 initial public offerings, raising $5.3 billion in the third quarter of this year, down substantially from the 158 such issues that raised $10.4 billion in last year's third quarter.
Wall Street issued $20.6 billion of high-yield bonds, in the third quarter, yet in the first six months of the year the securities industry issued more than $100 billion of such securities, which are also known as junk bonds. "It went from records to wreckage," said Richard J. Peterson, a spokesman for Securities Data.
Many on Wall Street are pessimistic about the prospects for underwriting. "I don't think it's going to change till you get some kind of leveling-off process from these wild swings," Mr. Black of Salomon Smith Barney said. "Individual stocks and industries moving all over the place."
Mr. Pica of Prudential said: "There's still a fair amount of uncertainty out there. Traditionally, October is a tough month."

HEADLINE: Congress to Debate Greater Oversight of Hedge Funds

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
As the financiers who rescued Long-Term Capital Management try to salvage what is left of the hedge fund, Congress will debate whether these secretive, risky investment funds that cater to the very rich should be subject to greater scrutiny.
The House Banking Committee will take up the issue Thursday at a hearing where Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve; William McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank; securities officials, and top financial regulators will testify. 
 Long-Term Capital nearly collapsed last week from an enormous amount of bad bets with borrowed money in turbulent global markets. A group of big banks and brokerage houses, fearful that a collapse would further destabilize the markets, rescued the fund with a $3.6 billion package of loans.
For as long as hedge funds have been around, since the late 1960's, Congress and regulators have struggled over how to properly supervise investment funds that can cause financial damage but are organized in ways that escape securities laws and minimize the information they must disclose.
For that reason, future attempts to bring about greater governmental oversight of hedge funds might become mired in the same tangled issues, politics and complicated details that have kept regulators away.
At present, lawmakers are long on concern but short on specific ideas. Following other hedge fund calamities, whether the 1992 Salomon Brothers "squeeze" on the Government securities market using hedge funds or the 1994 collapse of the $600 million Askin Capital Management hedge fund, hearings, reports, studies and recommendations have flowed from Washington.
The results have been mild tweaks in existing regulations even as the industry has expanded to about 4,500 domestic and offshore funds with nearly $300 billion in assets.
At the same time, the types of financial transactions done by hedge funds have become more complicated and could present greater global risks.
"Hedge funds have been allowed to exist in a regulatory black hole," said Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the House Banking Committee. "Hedge funds are defined by what they are not. They are not mutual funds. They are not banks. They are not brokers. They are constructed in ways in which the wealthiest people in America can invest and do it without any regulation. And this creates huge problems since hedge funds have acted so irresponsibly as to threaten a global financial collapse."
So far, Mr. Greenspan has dismissed the need for more oversight, saying that hedge funds are "strongly regulated by those who lend the money," mainly banks and Wall Street firms. But even Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who is not scheduled to testify, has admitted the free market may have faltered. In response to Mr. Greenspan's comment, Mr. Rubin said, "That assumes the creditors are careful."
Part of the difficulty of regulating hedge funds is the slipperiness about what a hedge fund is. No precise legal definition exists. The term "hedge fund" is not even used in Federal securities law. Generally, though, hedge funds in the United States are private partnerships of wealthy, sophisticated investors that buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and more exotic derivative securities, using sophisticated strategies to make bets on their direction.
Offshore hedge funds are usually mutual funds with headquarters in a tax-haven country, with some structured so that they can accept American customers.
As early as 1992, a joint report on hedge funds by the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Fed concluded that "regulators have little access to information about these entities and their day-to-day activities" and warned of the "potential of these funds, due to their size, active market presence and use of leverage, to cause market disruptions." Hedge funds are generally not subject to S.E.C. oversight because they are private. They do not have to register with the S.E.C. as broker-dealers and provide disclosure because they fall under a "trader" exemption because hedge funds trade for themselves.
Hedge funds escape oversight, too, from the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates mutual funds, because, again, hedge funds do not make public offerings. As a result, hedge funds are exempt from regulations on disclosure, fees and borrowing.
Conversely, hedge funds face indirect regulation since they do business with regulated entities, banks and brokers. Moreover, since 1992, when efforts at hedge fund regulation began, leading hedge fund managers have learned to play the Washington game and have effectively avoided closer Government scrutiny through adroit lobbying and heavy campaign contributions.
Hedge fund managers were especially active in 1994, when a Democrat-controlled House Banking Committee considered Federal hedge fund oversight, and three leading managers, including Julian Robertson of Tiger Management, contributed $550,000 in soft money to Republicans. When Republicans took over Congress in 1994, a "Large Trader Reporting System" for hedge funds seriously considered by the Democrats died quickly.
The main regulatory question raised by the Long-Term Capital episode was why banking regulators never saw early warning flags that would have indicated banks had extended too much credit to an already overly indebted fund. Banks lending to Long-Term Capital are regulated primarily by the Federal Reserve and by the State of New York.
"Someone was asleep at the switch," said Paul N. Roth, vice chairman of the American Bar Association's task force on hedge funds. "It's not like the banks making these loans don't have sufficient regulatory oversight. There is sufficient regulation in place, but it's a question of whether the people were paying attention to this."
Bert Ely, head of an Alexandria, Va., bank consulting firm, said the focus of regulatory concern in Long-Term Capital should have been over threats to the safety and soundness of the banking system.
"Long-Term Capital would have never been able to grow and have the leverage it had, if it had not been lent the money," Mr. Ely said.
One question securities regulators will be examining is whether brokerage firms' loans to Long-Term Capital were made through their broker-dealer operations, which are regulated by the S.E.C., or by their corporate holding companies, which are not.
Despite concern about what happened at Long-Term Capital, even advocates of more scrutiny profess some cynicism.
"It's like going back to the savings and loan crisis, which caused us so much grief," said Thomas E. Petri, a Wisconsin Republican, who advocates higher bank premiums for higher-risk activities. "Anything the Government comes up with, you will find some really smart people to manipulate it."

HEADLINE: Eugene L. McCabe, 61, Founder Of Harlem Community Hospital

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
Eugene L. McCabe, a management consultant who founded and was president of North General Hospital, a thriving, minority-operated community hospital in Harlem, died there yesterday. He was 61.
The cause was breast cancer, his family said. 
 "He was indefatigable in putting it together," said Mario M. Cuomo, who, as Governor, approved many of the grants and loans to build North General. "His strength was his will and his total commitment."
North General, a 200-bed hospital on 121st Street and Madison Avenue, is the only minority-operated hospital in the state. Most of its trustees are black. The hospital specializes in treatment for diabetes, cancer and hypertension, which occur widely among low-income blacks. It recently built 300 units of condominium housing for low- and middle-income residents of Harlem.
"It is a wonderful hospital," said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. "And Gene did it through sheer dogged persistence and sharp business acumen."
When another specialized hospital moved out of Harlem in the late 1970's, Mr. McCabe, along with Randolph Guggenheimer, a lawyer, developed the idea for North General: a community hospital to serve the impoverished, medically deprived area.
"It became his passion, his life work," said Livingston S. Francis, chairman of the board of North General.
Mr. Cuomo, who described the hospital's creation as "a miracle," said it took all of Mr. McCabe's persuasive powers to talk him and others into approving the necessary loans. At the time, many small community hospitals, overwhelmed with the unexpected demands of AIDS patients and crack addicts, were being closed. "It didn't make financial sense," Mr. Cuomo said. "But he made a case for that hospital. He was always entreating. He was never offensively pushy, but he was insistent."
As a result of Mr. McCabe's entreaties in Albany, Washington and New York City, the state appropriated $150 million to build the hospital. From the start, it was rooted in the community. At one early point, the union asked the hospital workers to continue working despite a missed pay period, Mrs. Gugggenheimer said. With the help of banks, local businesses and politicians, it pulled through several financial crises.
As president of the new hospital, Mr. McCabe drew on the resources of the staff in unexpected ways, Mr. Francis said. Nurses helped choose color schemes, and engineers installed lighting and laid floors -- tasks that would ordinarily be done by outside workers. The process was repeated seven years ago, when North General moved into its current facility, a modern brick building on 121st Street and Madison Avenue, with a bright interior decorated with art selected by staff members.
"That hospital," Mr. Cuomo said, "was his."
Mr. McCabe, who grew up in New Haven, graduated from Southern Connecticut State University.
He is survived by his wife, the former Elsie Crum, who is the president of the Museum for African Art in SoHo; their 1-year-old twins, Eugene and Erin, and a son, Kevin, from a previous marriage.

Saudi Prince Meets Chiefs Of Big Oil; Talks Cordial

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
A quarter-century after Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil industry and put narrow limits on investment by Western oil companies, the heir to the Saudi throne, Crown Prince Abdullah, has asked top executives of seven major United States oil companies how his financially pressed country should be developing its vast oil and natural gas reserves.
Whether the Saudis are now prepared to shift policy and open their vast oil reserves and refining industry to investment by American companies remains unclear, according to several participants in a private meeting held on Saturday in McLean, Va., at the residence of the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan. 
 But a person who attended the meeting, Nat Kern, president of Foreign Report, a Washington consulting company to the oil industry that also publishes a newsletter, said in an interview that there was an openness by the Crown Prince and by Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister.
He related that they were saying, "Tell us what things would be beneficial for us." And when the oil executives held a general discussion of ideas for exploration and production, the Saudis nodded in agreement. "There were no taboos," he said. "They were open-minded. Before, they were closed-minded."
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said that both sides realized they needed each other, more than in the past and that this would lead to more cooperation. Mr. Richardson added that he would visit Saudi Arabia in December, the first time an Energy Secretary has been there in six years.
Attending the meeting were top executives of Mobil, Exxon, Texaco, Chevron, Atlantic Richfield, Conoco and Phillips Petroleum. The Washington Post reported the meeting yesterday.
Since nationalization, Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, has produced and refined most of the oil. Production namounts to eight million barrels a day, and Saudi Arabia is the world's largest exporter.
Mobil, the biggest American investor in Saudi Arabia, and some other companies have been allowed to develop the likes of petrochemical and lubricant plants, but Saudi Arabia has kept foreign companies from bringing the vast fields into production and out of basic refining.
Yesterday, Lucio A. Noto, chairman and chief executive of Mobil, said in a statement that the meeting was "about the sharing of ideas." He added that the discussions were not specific on whether the exploration and production of oilfields or the refining industry would be involved.
Lower oil prices have severely cut into the revenue of Saudi Arabia, which has been running huge budget deficits, even though its proved reserves of 260 billion barrels are the world's largest.
Some neighbors, like Kuwait, have been courting Western oil companies and attracting big investments. Iran, which is off limits to American companies, has been seeking to open its industry to European companies.
Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Associates, a consulting group based in Boston, said that with lower oil prices the Saudis could be seeking partners so they would not have to absorb all the risk.
"There are benefits in sharing the risk with other companies," he said.

HEADLINE: FISCAL YEAR ENDS WITH U.S. SURPLUS, FIRST IN 3 DECADES

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
President Clinton announced today that the Government was ending the fiscal year with a budget surplus of about $70 billion, the first since 1969 and the largest on record. "It is a landmark achievement," he said.
"Tonight at midnight," the President declared in a ceremony here as the clock ticked toward the close of the 1998 fiscal year, "America puts an end to three decades of deficits and launches a new era of balanced budgets and surpluses." 
 But the President's celebration of the surplus did little to mask an untidy budget process that is unfolding on Capitol Hill and must be resolved in the next nine days, before Congress leaves town for the fall election campaigns.
Indeed, the surplus is contributing to the untidiness: both the Administration and Congressional Republicans have found the emergence of an extra pot of $70 billion or so -- the exact size will not be known until the Government makes a final accounting in a couple of weeks -- too tempting to ignore, especially in an election year. House Republicans would use part of the surplus to finance a tax cut, while the Administration has proposed billion of dollars in new spending.
Although a new fiscal year begins on Thursday, Congress has finished work on only 2 of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the Government running beyond tonight. As a result, Congress and the President have agreed to a stopgap measure to finance most of the Government through Oct. 9, a device used in 8 of the last 10 years to buy the two sides more time to resolve their differences.
Enthusiasm over the surplus has been tempered by the international markets' growing turmoil, which has made it unclear how long the United States can expect to sustain its own economic growth. In fact, whether the annual surpluses projected for the next decade will materialize if the nation slips into recession is just one of the questions being debated by wary economists. Page C1.
The availability of a surplus, anticipated for months, once seemed to offer the nation the opportunity for a philosophical debate over its direction in a new era of plenty. But that debate has been truncated in the last several weeks by the drive on Capitol Hill to impeach the President over the Lewinsky scandal, and the budget process, surplus and all, has been all but lost in the shuffle.
Beyond that, Congress, reflecting a rift within the Republican Party, has not even passed a budget resolution this year. Instead, it is using last year's agreement, which does not project a surplus until 2002, as its spending guide.
"Here we are starting a new fiscal year, and the road map is still in dispute," Representative David Minge, a Minnesota Democrat who is a member of the House Budget Committee, said incredulously.
In place of a broader debate in the era of surplus is the horse-trading and philosophical standoffs over abortion issues that have characterized the endgame of every recent budget season.
The only consensus as the session draws to a close is "to spend money and get out of town," said a discouraged Representative Tom Coburn, a conservative Republican from Oklahoma who wants Congress and the President to stay within the spending limits to which both agreed in the budget-balancing agreement last year.
Mr. Clinton has said for months, and reiterated today, that he wants to save all of the surplus to bolster the Social Security system for retiring baby boomers. At the same time, however, the Administration is seeking to spend $17 billion for "emergencies" that it did not calculate in its budget. These emergencies include peacekeeping in Bosnia, addressing the year 2000 computer bug, improving security at United States embassies around the world and providing disaster relief to American farmers.
Republicans say the Administration is dipping into the surplus to pay for these efforts. But Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said that under budget rules, a lifting of spending limits to pay for emergencies was permitted and that the surplus was not being tapped. Republicans say this is a distinction without a real difference.
"When you spend the money, you reduce the surplus," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee and has strongly opposed the effort by House Republicans to spend part of the surplus on a tax cut. The House passed an $80 billion tax cut last week, but the Senate appears ready to kill it; if not, the President has promised a veto.
If anything, the projected surplus has deepened the rift within the Republican Party, separating further the deficit hawks devoted to staying within spending limits from the supply-side tax-cutters who say lower taxes would spur growth.
In any event, Republicans appear prepared to go along with most of the President's requests and spend at least $13 billion on the emergency programs. This despite some grousing over the apparently elastic definition of "emergency," which provides for events like the year 2000 computer glitch and the Bosnia mission, both of them issues for some time.
The President today soft-pedaled his recent criticism of Congress but did urge Republicans to safeguard the surplus until Social Security was made secure.
"If we squander this surplus," he said, "and start spending a little here, a little there, a little yonder on the tax cuts, just because we are a few weeks before an election, before we take care of this, what are we going to do when times get tough?"
With his ceremony today, the President was able to assume credit for the surplus, and he gave credit as well to Congressional Democrats who voted for his tax increase in 1993. This annoyed Republicans, who resent Mr. Clinton's ability to take credit that they feel belongs to them.
"President Clinton's trying to make everybody assume that just because he raised taxes in 1993, he balanced the budget," said the Senate Republican whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma. Reflecting a longstanding gripe that Republicans have with Mr. Clinton, Senator Nickles added, "The President today even took credit for welfare reform, which he vetoed twice."
The increasingly sour atmosphere has only further hampered a budget process that was already largely stalled. Mr. Clinton's own proposals for child care and education programs were predicated on revenue from a tobacco bill that went nowhere. And the Administration has appeared so preoccupied with fending off the impeachment efforts that it has not seriously pushed a budget agenda. Nor have the Republicans stated clearly what issues they are prepared to hold firm on when they do finally negotiate with the Administration.

HEADLINE: Northwest Farms and Industry Pinched by Asia's Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: KAHLOTUS, Wash.

 BODY:
The huge piles of golden grain that rise like sand dunes along the banks of the Columbia and Snake Rivers are a beautiful sight, but to the wheat farmers of the Pacific Northwest, they are a sign of deep trouble. In a normal year, 90 percent of the region's wheat crop is exported to Asia, but this is not a normal year.
Hammered by a sharp fall-off in demand because of Asia's economic crisis, the region's farmers are faced with one of their biggest stockpiles -- 340 million bushels, enough to fill a line of hopper rail cars stretching from Seattle to Chicago. The price of wheat has dropped to a 21-year low, but even then, as Lonny Lightfoot, manager of the Port Wallula Barge Terminal explains, "There's just no selling it." 
 In central Washington, the heart of an apple industry that is by far the largest of any state's, growers are forecasting a record harvest this autumn. But the growers are so alarmed by the drop in Asian demand -- Thailand, Malaysia, China and Indonesia all bought 50 percent to 85 percent fewer apples from Washington over the last year -- that they recently voted to levy a 15-cent-a-box "promotional assessment" on themselves for an advertising campaign. The goal is to get Americans to eat an extra apple a day.
Here in what is by many measures the most trade-dependent region of the country, Asia's economic problems are clearly hitting home, starkly illustrating the domestic downside of a crisis that in other parts of the United States may still seem like an across-the-world abstraction, or perhaps even a welcome opportunity in the form of ever-cheaper imports.
Nor is the Pacific Northwest's sag in exports to Asia limited to wheat or apples. Sales to Asia of computers, semiconductors and software are all down sharply, and "a lot of that stuff's more perishable than the food," said Jeff Seely, president of the Netstock Direct Corporation, an Internet services company in Bellevue, Wash., speaking only partly in jest.
And the region's biggest employer, the Boeing Company in Seattle, has been hit by the worrisome news from Asia, which typically buys about a third of its planes and which was long seen as Boeing's big growth market. In recent weeks alone, China froze all of its airplane orders and delayed some deliveries, while the flag airline of the Philippines went out of business.
Even a cursory survey of industries here indicates the ways that the strong American dollar can do harm at home. And while the Northwest's overall economy remains strong, Asia's difficulties have led some government officials to project a noticeable slowdown in growth.
In Washington, for instance, the state's top economist, Chang Mook Sohn, recently cited Asian problems in revising his estimates for growth. He lowered projected job growth in the next two years to 1.5 percent (it was 4.1 percent in 1997), and he lowered estimates for the state's tax revenue in that period by almost $200 million.
Washington's unemployment rate, 4.7 percent in August compared with 4.5 percent nationwide, has been sable over the last year and only slightly above the national average.
At the Port of Seattle, imports increased 37 percent in the first six months of 1998, compared with that period last year, while exports dropped 24 percent, an imbalance many experts find troubling.
"Trade is crucial to the economy in this part of the country, and anything that happens in Asia affects us very quickly and very deeply," said Patricia Davis, a port commissioner and president of the Washington Council on International Trade.
"There are signs of a real downward spiral," Ms. Davis added, ticking off statistics on the decline in current state exports to 10 Asian countries -- 48 percent in crops, 38 percent in apparel, 54 percent in lumber and wood, 22 percent in computers and industrial equipment.
Nowhere is the pain felt more keenly than in the farmlands here in eastern Washington, where the interconnectedness of world economies is illustrated by the detailed knowledge local farmers have of the ups and downs of the Thai baht, the Japanese yen or the Indonesian rupiah.
These farmers are long accustomed to the vagaries of the weather, but the uncertainty of Asia's economy seems almost more vexing.
"It's very frustrating," said Gary Galbreath, 58, who planted 4,200 acres of wheat this year. "Here it seems like you're cutting a pretty nice crop and Mother Nature is smiling on you, but then you go to market and you're not making any money at all."
The local price for wheat recently dropped to $2.24 a bushel -- it was as high as $5.20 two years ago -- and most farmers estimate that they need to make $3.25 to $3.50 a bushel to turn a profit. The price drop is pushed not only by bumper crops here and in Canada, but also by the promise of a big crop in Australia.
"It's a tough situation all over," said Jonathan Schlueter, executive vice president of the Pacific Northwest Grain and Feed Association in Portland, Ore. "Farmers know they have a good crop, they know they have the quality foreign buyers want, and yet the buyers are waiting for the markets to go down. And it gets cheaper the longer they wait."
Properly covered and aerated, the grain can last for years, but with all elevators in the area at capacity, wheat is piling up along the rivers and in unlikely settings, like the broad lawn of a go-cart track in St. John. But the stockpiles are ominous in themselves: As the supply grows, prices are likelier to stay low, so that another bountiful crop next year may only add to the problem.
Farmers here say they can generally ride out one bad year but what is worrisome about the Asian crisis is that no one knows when it will lift.
"If prices stay like this another year or two, you're going to see a crisis around here," said Vern Regennitter, general manager of the Ritzville Warehouse Company, a grain elevator operator in Ritzville. "A lot of people are going to be in a world of hurt."
In conversations with residents at places like Ritzville's branch of the Wheatland Bank or the Wheat and Barley, a diner in nearby Colfax, the worries that Asia's crisis could drag down American farms are palpable.
"Farmers in general have to deal with the weather, and we're accustomed to taking the bad with the good, but you really get to wondering if this thing in Asia is the big one," said Al Curtis, a St. John wheat farmer whose summary of his harvest resembles a grim haiku:
"Excellent yield, terrible price, no profit."
What is also clear is that many farmers are increasingly angry over the trade embargoes that the United States has imposed on many nations around the world. Many here believe that they might have faced ruin if Congress had not temporarily lifted a ban on food sales to India and Pakistan. The ban was imposed after the two countries tested nuclear weapons in May.
"They're not going to turn around and launch a nuclear missile filled with grain at us," said State Representative Mark Schoesler, a Republican and a Ritzville farmer. "If we take their money and they take our grain, I don't think that's going to hurt anybody. I can't think of any country we've turned around because of food sanctions anyway. Castro's still Castro, Saddam's still Saddam, and we're not making those sales."
Recently, in a broad reflection of such discontent, the leaders of groups representing wheat, grain, barley, pea and lentil growers in the Northwest signed a petition calling for elimination of all sanctions on American food exports except in cases of "compelling national emergency" or a declaration of war.
Apple growers are also deeply worried by Asia's problems. Indonesia, which bought 4.1 million boxes of Washington apples in the 1996-97 season, the most of any Asian nation except Taiwan, bought just 670,000 boxes in the last season. A box weighs about 42 pounds.
American consumption of apples has flattened in recent years at about 21 pounds annually per person, compared with 35 pounds in Canada and 50 pounds in some European countries, said Jim Thomas, of the Washington State Apple Commission in Wenatchee.
Hence the new marketing campaign, which comes amid a projected record harvest of 103 million boxes in a state that typically grows nearly two-thirds of all the nation's apples.
"We have to compete for all those stomachs out there," Mr. Thomas said. "We're competing against Frito-Lay and all those people who are spending millions of dollars to try to come up with what we already are -- fat-free stuff, sodium-free, etc."
The $23 million advertising campaign is not exactly huge -- Mr. Thomas estimates that is the amount spent to market a Snickers candy bar -- but it is a start. "It gets us into the ball game," he said.
For the moment, the computer industry's problems in selling to Asia have been generally offset by continued strong sales to Europe, Canada and Mexico. William T. Archey, president of the American Electronics Association, the largest high-technology trade group in the country, said that he could not break down specific figures for sales from the Northwest, but he noted that the region had a heavy and growing concentration of computer companies, including Microsoft, and that many companies here had been specifically trying to increase sales in Asia.
Over all, Mr. Archey said, sales to Asia of computer equipment and software in the first six months of this year fell to $28.7 billion from $32.5 billion in the same period of 1997. That 12 percent decline is even greater if sales to China are factored out, he said.
"The issue that I think is the most important, and only the prophets can deal with it, is when this is all going to turn around," Mr. Archey said. "I think the most optimistic expectation at this point is another two years."
Especially in the farm region, Northwesterners are trying to treat the Asian problems with some stoicism.
"There's an old saying," said Pearson Burke, a grain merchandiser and commodities broker at the Ritzville Warehouse. "Low prices cure low prices and high prices cure high prices."
But as Mr. Burke offered a visitor a tour of his company, including an elevator full of wheat in a million-bushel pile stretching more than half the length of a football field and 80 feet high, he said the forces at work in this crisis felt far more remote than those brought on by nature.
"There are a lot of things a farmer can't control, including the weather," he said. "But this is something else entirely. The most skilled farmer here can't control what's going on in the economy half a world away."

HEADLINE: On Eve of Key Meeting, I.M.F. Paints a Gloomy Global Picture

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
In an unusually pessimistic report, the International Monetary Fund said today that it now expects the Russian economy to contract by 6 percent this year and next, and Japan to sink into its deepest recession since the end of World War II.
The report, issued a day before finance ministers from around the world arrive here for annual meetings of the World Bank and the I.M.F., also drastically scales back estimates of how fast other economies will grow. It urges 90 percent of the world's central banks to cut interest rates in an effort to spur growth and calls for greater cuts in the United States. The Federal Reserve announced its first cut in three years -- a modest quarter-percent off one of its key short-term rates. 
 Usually the I.M.F. puts the very best spin on bad news. Repeatedly it said the Asian crisis -- and then its contagion effects around the world -- was abating. Today, instead, it warned that "Chances of any significant improvement in 1999 have also diminished and the risks of a deeper, wider and more prolonged downturn have escalated."
Another notable change in this report was the call for interest rate cuts. Just months ago the I.M.F. was prescribing high interest rates in Thailand, Korea, Indonesia and then Russia, confident that once their currencies were stabilized there would be a chance to cut rates again and resume growth. But now the I.M.F. -- and the United States Treasury, which deeply influences the fund -- regard the choking off of growth as the greatest risk.
The news about Russia came as the World Bank, in another blow to the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin, suggested that it might have to cancel $6 billion in planned aid for the country. The money was promised in July, before Russia let its ruble devalue and forced out virtually all of its economic reformers. Since then the I.M.F. has suspended its aid, which was part of the same package, which totaled $17 billion.
"Whether or not a total of $6 billion for the 18-month period makes sense is, I think, debatable at this point," Johannes Linn, World Bank vice president for Europe and Central Asia, told a news conference today.
In Moscow earlier today, Russia's former top tax collector urged the I.M.F. not to make further loans to Russia because the Government's commitment to economic reform is shaky and that aid could do more harm than good. Instead, Boris G. Fyodorov said, the Group of Seven industrialized nations should present Russia with a list of 10 steps to build a market economy and make sure they are carried out before handing over billions of dollars in new loans and aid.
The reluctance by the I.M.F. to restart aid until Russia begins to cut taxes and avoid printing money so fast that it brings back hyperinflation has led many in Moscow to believe they may not see any more cash from the fund for months, and perhaps longer. But the World Bank, which focuses on poverty, was always considered a surer bet by the Russians, more concerned about keeping Russia's fraying social safety net together. Now that, too, seems threatened.
In its report today the I.M.F. predicted that world growth would be limited to 2 percent this year. That is a huge step backward: A year ago, before its last annual meeting in Hong Kong, the Fund forecast that the global economy would expand by 4.3 percent this year.
Japan's slowdown is perhaps the most worrisome news. The fund predicted that the world's second largest economy would shrink by 2.5 percent this year. Until recently, most economists have guessed that Japan's growth would be zero to negative one percent.
Japan's growth is critical because it serves as the engine for other Asian economies. But the downturn in Japan is so severe that the country's banks have stopped lending -- causing a credit crunch that is freezing economies in the region.
The I.M.F.'s revised figures also show that five of Asia's most critical economies will be deep in recession this year: Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and South Korea. Indonesia's downturn will be the worst, and rice shortages there are increasingly severe. China, the I.M.F. said, will grow at 5.5 percent, making it the healthiest major economy in the region.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Despite Cut in Rates, Stocks Fall As Investors Choose U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Worries about containing the economic crisis abroad and fears of financial problems at home prompted investors to sell stocks and buy bonds yesterday, pushing long-term Government yields below 5 percent for the first time in more than 30 years.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 237.90 points, or 2.9 percent, to 7,842.62, but prices of Treasury securities rose, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond down to 4.97 percent, a rate that most of those working on Wall Street have never seen in their professional lives. 
 While the bond market has rallied spectacularly since the stock market peaked in mid-July, the third quarter was the worst for the Dow in eight years, down 12.4 percent for the three months. Shares of financial services companies and makers of consumer products were among the hardest hit in the quarter. Page C1.
At the close yesterday, the Dow was down 16 percent since its peak and just 303 points from its 1998 low on Aug. 31. The only good news was that the Dow overcame the odds last month. Historically, September is the worst month for the Dow. But the Dow rose 4 percent last month.
Yesterday, the day after the Federal Reserve cut its short-term interest rate target one-quarter point in an effort to prevent the financial crisis abroad from derailing the American economy, all the news seemed to point to things getting worse, not better.
More companies offered warnings that their earnings would come in below forecasts, adding to the gloom that has analysts predicting that earnings will decline in the third quarter for the first time since the fourth quarter of 1991.
There was speculation about the collapse of another hedge fund on the heels of last week's rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, which needed an infusion of $3.6 billion from Wall Street's major brokerage firms and banks to stay afloat. While the fund denied the rumor, the fact that such rumors spread so easily these days is a sign of negative investor sentiment. The rumor helped drag down shares of banks and brokerage firms, which have been among the hardest hit in the stock market decline since mid-July.
And even the news of declining interest rates was not all that positive. "The current rally is based on growing expectations of negative economic developments," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company. Robert V. DiClemente, the chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney, added, "This is not the way we would have liked bonds to go through 5 percent."
In addition, while lower interest rates will help home buyers and consumers, the downward rush in Government yields has left the rates on other debt, like that of corporations, much higher as investors have chosen the safety of Government-backed bonds over even those of companies with good credit ratings.
Mr. DiClemente said that overall credit was already tightening as the cost of corporate borrowing had risen and banks were becoming more averse to risk. As the Fed cuts interest rates, he said, "there is no assurance that financial conditions will be easier."
The drop in interest rates was apparently a key contributor to the losses at Long-Term Capital, meaning that further declines could mean harder times for it and other hedge funds that bet that Treasury yields would not fall this far this fast.
It is also probably contributing to losses for many Wall Street firms for the same reason.
While the decline in Treasury rates may be hurting firms on Wall Street, many analysts say the Fed did not cut rates enough on Wednesday to send a reassuring signal to other countries that the American economy will continue to grow and be a market for their exports.
"I think this is a time when you have to take pre-emptive action," said Nicholas P. Sargen, the global market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients. In his view, it is clear that the global economic crisis is now impinging enough on the American economy to offset any inflationary threat from an interest rate cut that encourages growth.
The price on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, jumped 1 29/32, to 108 4/32. The yield of 4.97 percent was down from 5.09 percent on Tuesday and is off three-quarters of a percentage point since the Dow hits its peak on July 17. The yield on the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for home mortgages, dropped to 4.41 percent, from 4.56 percent on Tuesday, its lowest since the end of 1965.
In the stock market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 32.01 points, or 3 percent, to 1,017.01, while the Nasdaq index dropped 40.21 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,693.84. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks dropped 2.21 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to 363.59.
"When you see bond prices go up this much and stock prices go down this much, the message is clear," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "Investors are becoming much more worried about the economy and earnings than they had been."
Among the companies issuing third-quarter earnings warnings yesterday or after the market closed on Tuesday were RJR Nabisco Holdings, which cited declining sales in Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union; Arch Coal, the second-largest American coal producer, which said maintenance costs were reducing profits, and Healthsouth, which runs outpatient surgery clinics and said it might have to revise its earnings forecast because of price pressure from managed-care companies. These announcements came a day after Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Viacom and CBS all fell because of earnings concerns.
In addition, there were signals from Europe that earnings are under pressure there. Benetton Group, the Italian clothing retailer, said earnings fell 14 percent in the first half of the year in part because of reduced sales in Asia.
According to I.B.E.S. International, which monitors analysts' earnings forecasts, profits for the companies in the S.& P. 500 will fall by 2.2 percent in the third quarter.
Bank and brokerage stocks fell again yesterday. Chase Manhattan fell 1 7/8, to 43 1/8, and Citicorp fell 4 3/4, to 93.

South Korea Cuts A Key Interest Rate

BYLINE: Bridge News 

 BODY:
South Korea's central bank cut its key interest rate yesterday by a full percentage point in an effort to ease the credit squeeze that is hurting many South Korean companies. The Bank of Korea lowered its overnight call rate, the rate it charges commercial banks for overnight loans, to 7 percent from 8 percent. 
 The Bank of Korea said the quarter-point rate cut by the United States Federal Reserve on Tuesday had eased concerns that lower rates in Korea would prompt investors to move funds out of the country and into American investments. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting that the South Korea economy will shrink by 7 percent in 1998 -- its sharpest decline in more than four decades.

HOECHST AND KOHLBERG KRAVIS RETHINK HERBERTS DEAL

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Hoechst A.G., the European drug maker, said yesterday that it was still in talks with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company on the price of the Herberts paint unit, which Kohlberg Kravis has agreed in principle to buy. Hoechst suggested that Kohlberg Kravis, the largest buyout firm in the United States, was pushing to pay less than the 3 billion marks ($1.79 billion) announced last month for Herberts, which makes paints for the European auto industry. Since then, chemical companies' shares have plunged on concern that recession in several markets will dampen worldwide growth and depress commodity prices. The continuing talks were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal.

SILICON VALLEY GROUP TO CUT 300 JOBS AS SALES DECLINE

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Facing continued weakness in the semiconductor business, Silicon Valley Group said yesterday that it would reduce its work force by about 11 percent, or 300 employees, in the next few months. The company, a maker of wafer processing equipment that had tried to control costs through a hiring freeze and unpaid days off for its workers, also cut 700 jobs in July. Silicon Valley Group, of San Jose, Calif., said it expected sales in its fourth quarter to fall 10 percent to 15 percent from the previous quarter and sales for the first half of the 1999 fiscal year to be 10 percent to 15 percent below those of the second half of the current fiscal year. Silicon Valley shares fell $1.0625, to $8.

American Banana To Stay in the Bronx

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
American Banana Company will remain in the Bronx and expand its operations with assistance from the city's Industrial Development Agency, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday.
The fresh-fruit distributor has outgrown its Bronx warehouse in Hunts Point and was considering relocating to Jersey City. Instead, the company will buy a 40,000-square-foot building at 250 Coster Street in Hunts Point. 
 The company will install loading docks and modern banana-ripening equipment, including 16 specially equipped ripening and refrigeration rooms. The estimated cost of the project is more than $3 million. American Banana has 25 employees at its warehouse and plans to add 15.
"American Banana was one of the first vendors at the Hunts Point Market," Mr. Giuliani said. "Now this 52-year-old, family-run company is continuing in its pioneering tradition by modernizing its operations. The Hunts Point Market is a tremendous asset to the Bronx, and the city applauds companies like American Banana that continue to bring jobs and revenue into the community and deliver high-quality service."
Through the development agency's Industrial Incentive Program, American Banana will receive tax incentives in the form of a mortgage recording tax waiver, a land tax abatement, stabilization of building taxes and a sales tax exemption, for a net value of $546,051. American Banana will also apply to the Energy Cost Savings Program and seek benefits from the Hunts Point Economic Development Zone.
American Banana will also receive a sales tax exemption on hard construction costs for renovations. Because the site is within the Hunts Point Economic Development Zone, the company is eligible for full land tax abatement annually for 25 years. NICK RAVO

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:
Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.
* denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums 

 * "BAULE: AFRICAN ART/WESTERN EYES," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Jan. 3). Once again this exemplary museum proves that connoisseurship and anthropology do not make strange bedfellows. This assembly of 135 breathtaking objects includes elegant portrait masks, spirit spouse figures, feared and fearful animal masks and objects for everyday use. Supplemented by an unorthodox but effective use of dioramas and videotapes, they illuminate nearly every aspect of Baule life -- private and public, religious and secular -- and belief systems without stepping on the viewer's visual pleasure. The show has been organized by Susan M. Vogel, the museum's founding and former director, who has spent three decades studying the Baule, who live on the Ivory Coast; it forms a rare, sharply delineated cultural portrait. Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.; Saturdays, noon to 8 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $5; $2.50 for children, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 * "BONNARD," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Oct. 13). Don't miss this exhibition. Americans still don't appreciate Pierre Bonnard enough. He doesn't fit comfortably into the history of modernism, so he tends to be regarded as an anachronism, an Impressionist after Impressionism was dead. But his best art deserves to be ranked with Matisse's and Picasso's, and if you doubt this, spend time in the last rooms of the show. It ends with the paintings of Bonnard's wife, Marthe, in the bath -- mysterious elegies of love -- and with his self-portraits, which are unequaled, and that's not forgetting Rembrandt, van Gogh or anyone else. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M. (pay what you wish after 4:30 P.M.). Admission: $12.50; $9.50 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
 * "THE CEASELESS CENTURY: 300 YEARS OF 18TH-CENTURY COSTUME," Costume Institute, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Nov. 29). The theme of this scintillating show is the continuing impact on fashion of the elegant, extravagant 18th century, when aristocratic taste prevailed and luxury knew no bounds. Even in our Minimalist modern age a yearning for unabashed finery keeps breaking out, the show proposes, and it compares some magnificent examples of 18th-century style with 19th- and 20th-century counterparts. Echoes of the wasp waists, buttressed busts with deep decolletage, flaring hips and elaborate surface adornment beloved by those in the 18th century reappear in the 19th century in a gown made by Elise, dressmaker to the Princess of Wales, for example, and in the 20th century in clothes by designers like Worth, Lanvin, Christian Lacroix, Hubert de Givenchy and Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel. The examples, from the Met's collection, are strikingly handsome, and the presentation has panache. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Admission: $8; $4, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
 * "WALKER EVANS: SIMPLE SECRETS," photographs from the collection of Marian and Benjamin A. Hill, International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, (212) 768-4682 (through Nov. 29). The personal vision, technical perfection and headlong momentum of Evans's astoundingly prolific career is outlined in these 89 photographs, drawn from a private collection. They span from Evans's early, nearly abstract images of New York architecture, influenced by the European avant-garde, to his Polaroids of graffiti made in his final years. In between are the great images from the mid-1930's, when Evans captured the psychic and physical reality of American life, while also making finely textured pictures whose every centimeter contributed to a visual whole as intense and as important to American art as any of Jackson Pollock's drip paintings. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Fridays, 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $6; $4, students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 * "FROM VAN EYCK TO BRUEGEL," Early Netherlandish Paintings, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 3). A patch of heaven has touched down in Manhattan. This dream of a show is exactly what it says it is: a display of more than a hundred 15th- and 16th-century Flemish paintings representing the bulk of the Met's impressive holdings. Long-hidden pieces have been pulled from storage; familiar works brought together from throughout the museum. And the big news is also old news: the unrivaled genius of the Netherlandish artists, and the inventive vitality of a culture that saw the natural and the supernatural worlds as mirror images. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).
 
 * "INSIDE OUT: NEW CHINESE ART," Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Jan. 3). Art in China has changed dramatically in the last few decades and this big, stimulating, two-location show gives a sense of vanguard developments on the post-Mao mainland, in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and among expatriate Chinese artists in the West. The work ranges from video to Western-inspired Pop painting, from spectacular, room-filling installations to ink scrolls. The messages are complex and contradictory: myth, humor, pessimism and nostalgia rub shoulders, often in a single work. There are ups and downs in this tip-of-the-iceberg showcase, but it's a benchmark event. Asia Society: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays to 8 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. P.S. 1: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission to both is $4; $2, students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
 * MARK ROTHKO, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Nov. 29). "Only that subject matter is valid which is tragic and timeless," was Rothko's famous remark, but his art, though resonant, has always remained obstinately vague. The best rooms in this handsome survey include pictures from the early 50's in which the colors all seem to be ecstatic and springlike: chartreuse, pink, peach, orange, saffron, lavender and white, layered in veils with the quality of breath on a pane of glass. There's a sense of rhapsodic abandonment on Rothko's part to some exquisite and mysterious new discovery. It's a feeling akin to fresh love. If there is a religious dimension here it involves the intensity of the esthetic experience, which in Rothko's ambitious terms may have constituted a failure. Important artists often don't achieve the goals they set for themselves, but they achieve something else, which they may not appreciate. Hours: Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M. (free after 6 P.M.) Admission: $9; $7, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 BOB THOMPSON, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Jan. 3). This radiant exhibition of 100 works from 1959 to 1966 traces the brief headlong career of Thompson (1937-1966), a black American artist and one of the rising stars of the early 1960's. Thompson lived hard and died young, and was also tremendously productive. Trips to Europe fired his enthusiasm for the Old Masters, whose religious and mythological themes and compositions he modernized with flat bright color. These reds, blues and yellows also functioned metaphorically, implying a multiracial world alternately pastoral or violent in mood. Thompson died too early to achieve greatness, and as the middle third of the exhibition demonstrates, his paintings could be simultaneously formulaic and hesitant. But there are several remarkable works here, especially his small paintings and studies. And the biggest painting, "Garden of Music" (1960), may be his masterpiece. A group portrait including Thompson's friends Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane and other jazz musicians, it is set in a bright-dark abbreviated landscape and has the enigmatic power of a Gauguin or Munch expanded to the scale of Pollock. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
 Galleries: Uptown
 
 SIMON LEE, Sculpture Center, 167 East 69th Street, (212) 879-3500 (through Oct. 17). Mr. Lee, who has done a lot of outdoor, site-specific work, here presents an installation consisting of large glass panels on which dust has been sifted in vague patterns and a revolving light that causes shadows of the dust patterns to be cast on the gallery walls. The shadows are too pale and amorphous to be as visually compelling as you want them to be (Ken Johnson).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
 MEL CHIN, ARLAN HUANG, BING LEE, China 2000 Fine Art, 5 East 57th Street, (212) 588-1198 (through Oct. 24). A fresh arrival on 57th Street, this gallery has been conceived with the good idea of exhibiting traditional and contemporary work together. The low-key inaugural show makes a promising case for the project. The work by three mid-career artists on display in one room sets up subtle connections with the scholar's objects and painted scrolls handsomely installed in another (Cotter).
 
 SHARON HORVATH, "Rome Series and Other Works," Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 262-5050 (through Oct. 10). Maps are the basis of Sharon Horvath's work, but not your basic Rand McNally variety. A trio of big, dense and convoluted maplike compositions influenced by medieval renderings of Rome form the set piece of this show. They combine architectural elements, labyrinthine street patterns, mathematical symbols and a host of imaginary icons, the whole suggesting an ambitious topology of the mind. There are simpler works here, too, like "Heaven and Sea," in which a large potato-colored cloud represents the celestial; and the sea as something of a free-form navigational aid. Other works have a bizarre but appealing rebuslike imagery that demands a cryptographer to decipher it. The show is aerated by Ms. Horvath's imaginative draftsmanship, which seems to make mystical contact with the unseen as well as the visible (Glueck).
 
 JASON MARTIN, Robert Miller Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 980-5454 (through Oct. 10). These paintings, whose lusciously monochromatic surfaces are striated with a comb-like tool, are smart, economical, optically jazzy and pedigreed to the hilt. Their no-hands process relates most obviously to Pollock, their dancing optical wave patterns to Bridget Riley, their surfaces (aluminum, stainless steel, Plexiglas) to Robert Ryman. But it is mostly for naught. Not only do they suffer from tacky retro-chic, they seem machinemade. They have the thin, brief dazzle of a Slinky toy making its way down the stairs (Smith).
 
 KENNETH NOLAND, "Circles," Andre Emmerich Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-0124 (through Oct. 17). Forty years ago, Mr. Noland's stained, concentric circle paintings made him a force in avant-garde painting. Now, after working through all sorts of other geometric permutations, he's come full circle. His new, targetlike pictures are small and have thick, shiny acrylic paint, mechanically generated rings and a wide variety of pleasing color combinations. It's certainly unintentional, but these confections look a lot like kitsch (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
 JAYASHREE CHAKRAVARTY, Drawing Room, 40 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through Oct. 22). This 42-year-old painter from India is making her New York solo debut with a show of beautiful, formally inventive paintings done on scrolls of paper that twist down from the gallery ceiling. The subject is urban: windows, street signs and figures, wrapped in smoggy clouds of hatch lines and swirling strokes. The energy is high and sweet, with the sensation-packed verve of a first morning's walk through the streets of a strange city (Cotter).
 
 MILES COOLIDGE, Casey Kaplan Gallery, 48 Greene Street, (212) 226-6131 (through Oct. 10). Mr. Coolidge continues his investigation of real and pictorial scale with color photographs that document the agribusinesses of California's Central Valley in long, thin, but thrillingly expansive slices. The layered views of fields, roads and buildings render actual size ambiguous, as if it might all be a scale model. They also make one think of 19th-century paintings of the untouched American West, the oppressive Americanness of the Conceptual photographs of Dan Graham and Ed Ruscha and the three-dimensional desolate landscapes of Michael Ashkin. They suggest the American heartland as seen through the artillery slot of a bunker. Call it the paranoid sublime (Smith).
 
 PEGGY CYPHERS, Donahue/Sosinski, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 226-1111 (through Oct. 10). Sandy-textured, subtly colored semi-abstract paintings in which hieroglyphs, loosely improvised patterns, dripped strands of glue and passages of staining are layered over screen-printed bird or insect illustrations. Some of these meditations on natural history are overworked to the point of muddiness; the best have an airy poetry (Johnson).
 
 CADENCE GIERSBACH, "Plastic Replicating Garden," Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300 (through Oct. 17). Smart, shiny, eight-foot-tall folding screens, each panel of which is upholstered in stuffed white vinyl on which the artist has painted atomized, black-and-yellow copies of distorted photographs of English topiary gardens, creating a kind of radioactive Pointillism. Though hideous to look at, the layering of cultural signifiers is conceptually dizzying (Johnson).
 
 JIM HODGES, CRG Gallery, 93 Grand Street, (212) 966-4360 (through Oct. 10). This reticent show about fragmentation and time includes a mural made of carefully pieced-together mirror shards and a wall drawing depicting two lovers as interlocking patterns of concentric circles, like the growth rings of trees. Most moving, though, is a self-portrait: dozens of shirts layered inside one another in sizes from adult male to baby. Each shirt is tailored from materials suggesting a different time or event in the artist's life (Cotter).
 
 RICHARD KALINA, Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-1012 (through Oct. 10). Lively collages on canvas in which photocopied botanical illustrations, painted stripes and cut-out shapes of things like airplanes, pipes and telephones are densely layered in grid-based compositions. They're visually enthralling if not heavily meaningful (Johnson).
 
 ALIX LAMBERT, Curt Marcus Gallery, 578 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 226-3200 (through Oct. 10). Ms. Lambert is a multitasking conceptual artist who has no qualms about mixing art and life. The main work in this show is a series of large-scale photos of tattoos that the artist executed on the bodies of intrepid friends. In each case, she asked the subject to produce the design, and the results amount to a gallery of portraits, indelibly recording whims, passions, private jokes and obsessions (Cotter).
 
 SOL LeWITT, Pace Wildenstein, 142 Greene Street, (212) 431-9224 (through Oct. 10). For years the simple procedures of Mr. LeWitt's wall drawings have landed them in the vicinity of other artists' work, deflating the notion of originality by suggesting distant cousins of Matisse, Malevich and Frank Stella. Now, in a series of undulating lines and shapes rendered in bright colors and booming scale, Matisse is joined by Keith Haring and Victor Vasarely. The results are among the most optically vibrant works of Mr. LeWitt's long career, invigorating eye-candy, sugar-free and made with all natural ingredients (Smith).
 
 SANTI MOIX, Paul Kasmin, 74 Grand Street, (212) 219-3219 (through Oct.10). In each of the funky, richly sensual paintings of Mr. Moix, a Barcelonan who now lives in New York, agglomerations of blobby, mud- or flesh-colored forms appear against expansive blue fields, suggesting a wedding of the visceral body and the expansive mind (Johnson).
 
 CHARLINE VON HEYL, Friedrich Petzel, 26 Wooster Street, (212) 334-9466 (through Oct. 10). Colorful, gestural but dry abstract paintings by a German artist who recently moved to New York. Ms. Von Heyl's works involve much painterly process, combining staining, smearing, layering, drawing and mark-making; they come out looking well-designed but flat and disaffected, as though the artist believed there was nothing left for painting but the rearrangement of cliches (Johnson).
 
 ALLAN WEXLER, Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232 (through Oct. 10) Proceeding with relentlessly inventive logic, Mr. Wexler, who was trained as an architect, systematically develops formal variations on the archetypal house and the straight-backed chair. In paper, cardboard, fabric or wood, he unfolds, flattens, deconstructs, turns inside out and otherwise transforms the basic object in so many different ways you begin to feel metaphysically dizzy (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
 JOHN AHEARN, Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 367-7474 (through Oct. 24). Mr. Ahearn, who is famous for his portrait busts of people in low-income neighborhoods, cast from life, has not had a gallery show since 1991. This one, including thinly painted portraits of children, two life-size studies for a public commission and a series of unpainted reliefs of multiple pairs of hands, offers little in the way of provocative new developments (Johnson).
 
 ANDREA BELAG, Bill Maynes, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 741-3318 (through Oct. 10). Abstract stripe and plaid paintings in which wide, watery swaths of sweet color ranging from near black plums to luminous transparencies of orange cross the canvas horizontally and vertically, overlapping in places. Ms. Belag, a mid-career New Yorker, works with relaxed confidence; you only want to see her push her color into less predictably palatable territory (Johnson).
 
 BARBARA GALLUCCI, "Carpet Bottle Flock & Shine," Derek Eller Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-6411 (through Oct. 10). Mock kitsch sculptures in the form of big, flat but thick flower images, assembled from puzzlelike parts made of tacky carpet remnants, polished copper and Formica; also, some odd, mirror-glass bottles. Ms. Gallucci's works are amusing and have material presence but they need to be more over the top (Johnson).
 
 KLAUS LUTZ, De Chiara/Stewart, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 967-6007 (through Oct. 10). Mr. Lutz is a Swiss-born experimental filmmaker and performance artist. Here he has orchestrated an enjoyable, Rube Goldbergesque installation in which his jerky, home-made looking films of a little man moving about in the deep, illusory spaces of abstract paintings are projected onto three big, white weather balloons (Johnson).
 
 "SCULPTURE," Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105 (through Oct. 10). An exceptionally handsome show of five vintage and recent Minimalist and Post Minimalist works. The conceptual ironies of a set of Gerrit Rietveld side tables reincarnated 50 percent bigger than the originals by Sherrie Levine play off the pristine geometries of works by Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Tony Smith and Jackie Winsor (Johnson).
 
 JASON SIMON, Pat Hearn Gallery, 530 West 22d Street, (212) 727-7366 (through Oct. 24). An installation that looks like the aftermath of a disaster at a rock concert. Two giant black speaker horns appear to have come unmoored from the ceiling and crashed to the floor, where they sit among broken chairs and scattered food containers quietly playing ambient sounds of a deserted arena. Could this be the end of the society of the spectacle? (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
 MAYA LIN, "Topologies," Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Oct. 31). Ms. Lin is best known for her powerfully understated public monuments, notably the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. This show focuses on her less familiar studio work and does much to clarify the themes that have shaped her work, from the merging of nature and science to the subliminal play of Asian thought. The show's three largest sculptures cohere into a mountain-sea-moon landscape, crystalline in its simplicity but resonant with implications of change (Cotter).
 
 "PERSONAL TOUCH," Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473 (through Nov. 7). Except for Amy Sillman's gouaches, there is little of the hands-on personal touch in this show. Rather, it's a mixed bag of quirky, high-concept work, including Sora Kim's brown office for "Unlimited Concept Company Cleaning Department"; funny, body-oriented videos by Jozef Robakowski, like "My Foot Is Painful"; rich photographs of low-rent family relations by Tracey Baran; a red rubber text by Meg Belichick and a banner bearing Jenny Holzeresque admonitions by Ryszard Wasko (Johnson).
 
Last Chance "AHAB'S WIFE," Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500 (through Sunday). The intriguing title of this six-artist exhibition was inspired by a reference in Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick." Only Ellen Driscoll explores the possibilities of the theme directly in murky, expressionistic works on paper, enigmatic sculptures and props for a performance to be presented Thursday through Sept. 20. The painter Janet Gillespie offers finely made, surreal paintings of the ocean; Arden Scott fashions elegantly abstracted boat sculptures. Ahab's wife remains disappointingly unrealized as a character or a metaphor. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $2 (Johnson).
 
 "ROBERT COLESCOTT: RECENT PAINTINGS," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through Sunday). Nineteen paintings by Mr. Colescott that represented the United States at the Venice Biennale last year. His raucous pictures swarm with cartoon characters who act out wildly scrambled blackface burlesques of race, sex, violence and death. Nothing if not contradictory, his paintings are also beautiful, smart and poetic. Though raw, they have a lush, painterly sensuality, and though bumptious, they speak to complex philosophical matters through metaphorically loaded images. Hours and admission: See above Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $4; students and the elderly, $2 (Johnson).
 
 "DAVID GOLDBLATT: PHOTOGRAPHS FROM SOUTH AFRICA," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Tuesday). This exhibition of 46 photographs of South Africa under apartheid is a dispassionate inventory of churches, monuments, shantytowns, apartment houses, graveyards, toilet seats, billboards, hedges and house trimmings. Mr. Goldblatt practices social iconography, photographing ordinary objects packed with historical and sociological meaning. He was drawn "to the quiet and commonplace, where nothing 'happened' and yet all was contained and immanent." But all is not contained and immanent in these images. Many of the pictures cry out for explanation, and their cry is answered with a torrent of text. Sometimes the words help, turning uninflected pictures into illustrations of the twisted social relations and hideous inequalities of apartheid. Sometimes, though, the text is just a tidal wave of words in which the crucial information drowns. Hours and admission: See above (Sarah Boxer).
 
 BILL JENSEN AND LEONARDO DREW, Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929 (through tomorrow). These two solo shows go in opposite directions. Mr. Jensen, long known for small organic abstractions, seems to be paring down and loosening up his work, testing how little he can get away with and still have a painting. Except for the vaguely nautical, poetically nocturnal painting "A Few Small Nips," the canvases here are mostly beautiful traces of the artist's involvement, or good starts. In contrast, Mr. Drew's latest rust-covered reliefs and sculptures, despite their found-object patinas, seem over-worked. They achieve toxic levels of artifice, like a stage set whose effects are meant to be read from a distance and thus seem overwrought when viewed more closely (Smith).
 
 JOHN MORRIS, D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22d Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460 (through tomorrow). Mr. Morris burrows so deeply into familiar territory -- ultra-fine, quasi-abstract drawing -- that he finds a bit of turf to call his own. His first solo show consists of about 200 small, obsessively perfect images made with various combinations of crayon, wax, graphite, ink and ballpoint pen; they are displayed unframed in tight formation on two big tables. Luminous and mysterious, the motifs range suggestively from the cellular to the architectural, from the decorative to the Tantric, and pulsate with a life that in more Romantic times might be called universal (Smith).
 
 LIISA ROBERTS, "Blind Side," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sunday). Borrowing a little too much from "Wavelength," the 1967 avant-garde film classic by Michael Snow, this young American artist has created a well-thought-out film installation involving twin life-size images of a formal sitting room through whose windows day changes to night and back again in about six minutes. The viewer's reflection and shadow provide the figurative element as the room disappears and reappears, and the windows, looking out on a bustling city, suddenly resemble little film screens. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
 ALEKSANDR RODCHENKO, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Tuesday). By turns illuminating, tragic and chilling, this fascinating exhibition details the work of an artist who spent much of his career on the cutting edge of art and history, a position that did not leave him unscathed. For a few short years in the early 1920's, Russian Constructivism was an artistic revolution in step with a political one, and Rodchenko was its most diversely innovative representative. He made paintings and sculptures that presaged Minimalism and photographs and graphic designs that were similarly ahead of their time, while also serving the needs of the new Soviet state. With Stalin, that state brutally switched its allegiance to Socialist Realism, dismissing, imprisoning and sometimes killing avant-garde artists or requiring humiliating "reconstructions." This was the path chosen by Rodchenko, as attested by the photojournalistic images that give this exhibition such a sad conclusion. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
 GEORGE SEGAL, Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92d Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Sunday). This retrospective presents Mr. Segal as something more than just the Pop artist he's been labeled; it shows him to be a humanist of expansive vision able to address difficult historical topics like the Holocaust or deep religious subjects like the biblical story of Abraham and Ishmael. But the works that look best are the mournful tableaux of white plaster figures fitted into diners, subway cars or telephone booths, which made him famous in the 1960's. Only three or four of these stark theaters of modern angst are included in this 42-work retrospective. Hours: Closed today and tomorrow; Sunday, 11 A.M. to 5:45 P.M. Admission: $7; $5 for students and the elderly; children under 12 free (Johnson)

Calder Works On the Move

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
The Calder Foundation is the latest suitor to make a play for 2 Columbus Circle in Manhattan, that white marble building with the slender arches and round holes that Edward Durell Stone designed to be the Gallery of Modern Art in 1965.
Alexander S. C. Rower, a grandson of the artist Alexander Calder and the director of the foundation, said he believed it was time to move the operation from its headquarters in Woodstock, N.Y., to Manhattan. He has spent the last six months looking at sites large enough to house a Calder museum as well as the foundation's archives and library. 
 Though 2 Columbus Circle would be an ideal spot, the fate of the city-owned building appears uncertain. In July 1996, the city asked for sealed bids from interested buyers. But three months later, after the deadline for bids, no selection was made.
"We were waiting to see who would be selected to develop the Coliseum site," said Charles Millard, president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation, referring to a building on the west side of Columbus Circle. "We wanted a selection that would be compatible. The real estate market has changed and we're evaluating the situation. None of the bidders have been rejected."
Although Mr. Millard declined to name the bidders, the Dahesh Museum, which specializes in 19th-century European art, has made public its interest in the building.
"It would be a wonderful addition to the city to have a Calder museum," said Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts, an advocacy organization in Manhattan. "Calder had a strong identification with New York and quite a following here."
Mr. Rower said he had been working with Schuyler G. Chapin, the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, to find a city-owned building that would be suitable for the Calder Foundation. "We've been looking everywhere from Battery Park City to Chelsea, TriBeCa, the West Village and a few sites in midtown," he said. He confirmed that 2 Columbus Circle was on his wish list, even though the foundation began to consider it after the bidding had been closed.
"We've asked to be able to put in a bid anyway, but the city hasn't gotten back to us yet," Mr. Rower said. "Schuyler Chapin thought we should go for it." A spokeswoman in Mr. Chapin's office said the commissioner declined to comment.
The foundation has large holdings, with some works owned by family members and others by foundation supporters. The art includes about 300 sculptures, 55 monumental outdoor works and more than 3,000 works on paper, many not publicly seen since 1943. The foundation was a large lender to the exhibition "Alexander Calder: 1898-1976," which opened in March at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and is now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The foundation also has extensive archives, with more than 100,000 documents.
"We've spent the last 11 years working on the artist's catalogue raisonne and have 16,000 works documented," Mr. Rower said. Though he was not sure when the catalogue would be published, he said it would be about 35 volumes. "It will be an encyclopedia," he said.
 
Hermitage West
 The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, may be short on cash, but not on vision. The latest of its many plans is to transform a home for the elderly in Amsterdam into a satellite of the Hermitage. The building, the 17th-century Amstelhof Nursing Home on the Amstel River, belongs to a church, which wants to sell it to a buyer that would make it into a cultural center.
Why not a Russian cultural center in Amsterdam, asked Mikhail B. Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage. "It would have permanent exhibition space to show two shows a year, one that would be up for a year and the other for six months," Dr. Piotrovsky said. "We would also like to exhibit works from other Russian museums."
Besides giving the Hermitage another site for showing its vast collections, Dr. Piotrovsky said, an Amsterdam location would make it easier for people to see the museum's treasures. It could also become a good source of much-needed revenue. "I'm very optimistic about the project," he said. "We're beginning to do feasibility studies."

Welcome, Please Stay
The long-awaited Berger Collection of British art is opening at the Denver Art Museum on Oct. 10. Originally the exhibition, which includes more than 200 works by artists like Reynolds, Gainsborough, Constable and Sir Alfred Munnings, was to have gone on view last November, when the museum reopened its European and American galleries after a seven-year facelift. But the collection was too big for the space. So now the museum has stored part of its permanent collection to make room for the British art.
Formed in just three years by William M. B. Berger, founder of the Denver-based Berger Group of mutual funds, the collection takes up about 10,000 square feet, the entire seventh floor of the museum. It will be on display for six months. The works span 600 years and, in addition to paintings, include the Bute Book of Hours and a Nottingham alabaster altarpiece.
Some experts say the Berger Collection was assembled too quickly to have the depth of the Yale Center for British Art or the Huntington Library Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif. But Mr. Berger defends his collection, saying that "even the Tate can't boast of having 600 years of British art."
The museum hopes the collection will never leave. "I think whenever a museum is able to host a show like this, it hopes to get the collection," said Lewis I. Sharp, director of the Denver Art Museum. "Our European holdings are small, so for this institution it would be a great gift."
Mr. Berger isn't so sure: "I tell the museum, you put up the gallery first and then we'll see what happens."

Van Gogh, or Beauty and the Blockbuster

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
Dear Theo,
Yesterday I received your letter in which you say my pictures make the rooms of your apartment in Paris look so gay. You embarrass and hearten me. However, I must tell you about the most incredible night that followed. I dreamed that I was coming to visit you and Jo, but on your doorstep a terrible beast, a Cerberus, barred my way. He called himself the Ticketmaster and he said I must pay a toll or he would not let me pass -- and to see my own paintings! 
 Well, it's so ridiculous, I know. I had a fit after waking but then fell into yet another terrible strange delusion in which my unfortunate paintings had now been assembled in some vast marble mausoleum. Thousands of people swarmed and shoved and jostled each other before them. I want my pictures to touch people, but I never conceived they would cause so many people to touch each other! They must have been devil worshipers because I clearly heard the devil speaking in strange tongues through horns clasped to their heads. Can you imagine? I need rest.
I hear there's a nice place at St.-Remy.
Vincent
The van Gogh exhibition opening at the National Gallery in Washington on Sunday is a beautiful retrospective of 70 paintings from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which is now closed for renovation. There really isn't much to say about the show, conceptually speaking. It doesn't pretend to tell us anything new about him. People will complain about the lack of the usual greatest hits and the number of minor works, as if all van Gogh retrospectives should look exactly alike. Actually, to the degree that the show stresses less familiar pictures, even some bad ones, it makes his evolution unfold freshly.
A few random notes apropos of the show:
We think of van Gogh as somebody whose art changed radically. Critics love the cliche of the ham-fisted yokel turned genius, but we see here how in important ways he really didn't change much at all.
His roots remained in the Netherlands. In Paris, for instance, he painted a gem in the manner of early Netherlandish portraiture (Memling and so on); it's a crisp self-portrait as boulevardier in blue-trimmed jacket and big bow tie.
In Arles, he gravitated to flat, patchwork fields that he associated with Dutch landscapes by Ruisdael and to places like the shore at Les Stes.-Maries-de-la-Mer, with its multicolored fishing boats, which recalled Dutch seascapes. He wrote from Arles to his brother, Theo: "I keep thinking of Holland, and across the twofold remoteness of distance and of time these memories have a kind of heartbreak in them." What he learned in Paris, he said, was "leaving" him: "I am returning to the ideas I had in the country before I knew the Impressionists."
Hence, "The Harvest," an orderly Dutchlike scene of ocher cornfields receding in ranks beneath a cobalt sky, and "The Yellow House," which echoes an early Dutch picture by him, "The Vicarage at Neunen." The house and vicarage are both silent, heraldic places, the discrepancy of palette (muted gray versus peppermint green and pink) making remarkably little difference in effect.
It's curious how amusing some of van Gogh's pictures are. He could be funny, though we don't ever think of him that way. An early work, "Flying Fox," with the animal backlighted, its translucent wings extended, is clearly a macabre joke, paired here with "Skull of a Skeleton With Burning Cigarette," an even funnier picture, and like the fox, lusciously painted in a way that somehow reanimates the dead subject. It's an image straight out of Gothic literature.
We know van Gogh read Poe. He was a voracious reader. His "Still Life With Books," painted on an oval Japanese tea tray, reveals his literary taste. Having done muddy landscapes and figure studies in the Netherlands, he moved to Paris to recast himself as a modernist of high-key palette and Japanese style. The still life is a little declaration of the conversion.
He takes pains to indicate the books' titles, including Zola's "Au Bonheur des Dames," the story of a certain Denise Baudu, a virginal heroine fresh from the provinces who comes to Paris and is corrupted by life in the metropolis. Van Gogh was the kind of reader who identified a bit too much with the subjects of the books he admired, Zola's especially. Maybe he intended to tell us something here: that, like Denise, he had also become jaded about, and corrupted by, the modern world.
He was savvier than most people think, after all. The catalogue of the show includes a chronology with a few useful reminders in it: for instance, that he was the one who decided not to sell any pictures until he had compiled a large enough group of what he considered to be world-class paintings with which to announce himself to the public; that in 1889, when he exhibited with the Societe des Artistes Independants, he was well reviewed, and in 1890 Albert Aurier's article about him was published -- not bad for a young painter who had been at it only a few years.
He was clearly no madman when it came to his art. By now it's trite to say this. He was, however, a visionary, which is a very different matter. One of his visionary pictures is "Almond Blossom," painted at St.-Remy in 1890, a gnarled scramble of branches and buds against an azure backdrop, nearly abstract. Sky fills the spaces between bits of unpainted canvas, the spaces, as if in ghostly recession, becoming branches of the tree.
The result is an amazingly flat and complex pattern of lines and shapes recalling Japanese art but pointing ahead to Mondrian. It's the essence of mature van Gogh: reality, painstakingly observed, filtered through his peculiar style of drawing to produce an image distinctly unreal.
In his final letter, van Gogh wrote to his brother that his paintings, "even in the cataclysm retain their quietude." This is true. "Landscape at Twilight," one of the last works, is a prime example.
All the elements in the picture -- bottle-green pear trees, heavy grass, citrine sunlight, blue chateau, clay road -- are broken down into wet dashes that recombine in a swirl. The surface roils and vibrates, but at its core the image stays remarkably calm.
In the end, van Gogh's work is never as simple as it first appears, and somehow it constantly looks new each time. That is the thing about great art: no matter how often it is reproduced or how trivialized it is by biographers and promoters, it manages to retain its strange power.
The most familiar works here, when you actually stand before them, still have an immediacy, an implacable aura, which is so arresting that, temporarily, it even silences the noise about blockbusters and pandering to the masses. At the end of the day, despite the hype, the work is the only thing you'll care about -- that is, if you can manage to see it through the milling backs.
"Van Gogh's van Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam," opens on Sunday at the National Gallery of Art, Fourth Street at Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, and runs through Jan. 3. It will travel to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Jan. 17 to April 4, 1999). All advance passes for the National Gallery of Art have been distributed. Beginning on Sunday, a limited number of free same-day passes will be available in the rotunda of the gallery. There is a limit of six passes per person.

Big Big Business

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The abnormal baseball season has produced a lot of media flapdoodle about the national psyche. The theme most commonly expounded is that the spirit of America has been saved from despair and lifted into exuberance by baseball.
The idea underlying this nonsense is that the media frenzy generated by a White House sex story had sent the nation reeling to the brink of terminal melancholy. Then -- hark! 
 Is that a bugle that sounds afar? No, it is not the cavalry. It is baseball. Baseball has restored the smile to the national pan, put happiness back in the American heart and helped the great Republic to rise out of the emotional trough.
To take this view of things seriously, you have to accept the demonstrably silly idea that the famous Washington scandal had left the country deep in despair.
The fact is that since last winter said scandal has been the nation's main, if not sole, source of entertainment. The national amusement dispensers -- press and television -- have dished it out with great lashings of titillation, and Americans have lapped it up hungrily.
It has provided millions with the smug joys of feeling morally superior to the great and famous. It has allowed schoolchildren, teachers, mothers, fathers, psychologists and parsons to enjoy gales of once forbidden sex chatter under the pretext of improving the cultural hygiene.
It has provided Republicans with the delicious prospect of crushing a Democratic President. Yes, Democrats are depressed all right, but Democrats have been so depressed by years of constant defeat that despair is their natural state.
That baseball has improved the national morale is as dubious as the notion that the national morale needed any improving.
To be sure, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa making a joke of Babe Ruth's and Roger Maris's home-run records was an entertaining story, and the Yankees' triumphal season was a pleasure to watch, especially for New Yorkers under the delusion that they have a "home team."
Neither spectacle, however, can dispel suspicion that there is something deeply wrong with baseball. And not only baseball, but also most sports, professional and amateur.
College football, as all morally righteous humanity knows, is a professional minor-league network churning out players for the National Football League and big money for its college sponsors.
The money in baseball is now simply stupendous, and not just for the players. During the Yankees' game with the Rangers Tuesday night, a roving TV camera paused for a moment on a trio that represents money on the cosmic scale.
Clumped together were the Yankees grandee George Steinbrenner, His Honor Mayor Giuliani and Rupert Murdoch, who buys professional sports teams because cable television now makes them hugely profitable. Just the other day he bought a British soccer team for -- so it's said -- $1 billion. Shortly before that he bought the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Watching the three together -- Murdoch, Giuliani, Steinbrenner -- you could see that baseball has traveled a far distance since the time New Yorkers booed Joe DiMaggio because he'd asked the Yankees to raise his pay to $45,000 a year.
Mr. Steinbrenner has been chatting up Mayor Giuliani about a new billion-dollar ball park he'd like in Manhattan. How much of the cost do you suppose local taxpayers would have to pay? Why was Mr. Murdoch making it a trio Tuesday night? Could it have been love of baseball that brought them together?
Well, yes, but --. With baseball nowadays what springs first to a skeptical mind is money.
The players are famous for being royally paid, at least compared with the $45,000 the Yankees once refused DiMaggio. Still, their talents have a short shelf life, and only a churl would begrudge a kid a few $1-million-a-year paydays.
These big paydays have a downside for fans. Take the antique concept of the "home team," for which people were supposed to root, root, root. The "home team" is now dead, dead, dead. With players moving from town to town at the call of the highest bidder, each year brings a new team to town. In the new culture the old cry "Wait till next year" would be senseless. Next year most of the "home team" will have skipped town.
Well, it's a market economy. Just bidness. It's not about rescuing the land from despair. Just bidness, Charlie.

Poland Stands Its Ground Next to Rapidly Sinking Russia

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Sept. 29

 BODY:
When Russia went into a tailspin earlier this year, Poland's stock market crashed. Investors pulled $1 billion in short-term capital out of the country and prepared for Poland to descend into the maelstrom.
Yet the panic that threatened to upset Eastern Europe's largest economy, and most notable success story, appears at the moment to have receded. Russia remains in distress, but Poland is moving forward. 
 Last week, the stock market sprang back 6.2 percent and the currency, the zloty, has gained against major currencies like the dollar and the mark.
 On Thursday, the stock market fell 6.74 percent as shares fell sharply in many countries, but it is up 4.8 percent over the last month.
Earlier this month, as if to demonstrate its confidence to a world hanging on every shift in mood and perception, the National Bank of Poland, the central bank, trimmed its key lending rate to 18 percent from 19 percent.
Boguslaw Grabowski, a member of the central bank's monetary policy council, which oversees the currency, described the zloty's recent volatility as "its biggest test ever" and said that "the exam was passed excellently, without intervention from the National Bank."
The volume of short-term capital flight, he said in an interview, was about $1 billion of a total $4.5 billion in short-term capital invested in the country, and the central bank has been heartened by a gradual revival of capital flows to Poland.
As an important engine for growth in the region, Poland's success has eased the fear that the crisis in Russia could spill over to its smaller neighbors to the west, which are still struggling to overhaul their economies after decades of Communist mismanagement.
"The zloty has fared remarkably well," said Krzysztof Sidor, head of research at the Pioneer investment fund in Poland. Outflows of capital, he said, have been largely a result of investors "taking profit in Poland to cover Russia."
Still, Poland is not home free. The economy's resilience can in large measure be attributed to its success in hooking itself to the locomotive of Western Europe, and an expected slowdown there could weaken Poland further.
The European Union accounts for about 70 percent of Polish trade, roughly the share that went to the Soviet Union and its allies before Communism collapsed in 1989, and the United States is the top source of foreign direct investment, which in the first half of this year totaled more than $5 billion.
Pierre Bergeron, head of research for Citibank in Warsaw, described Poland's economy as a "rail car attached to the high-speed European train." But Western Europe's train is fast losing steam as a result of the crisis in emerging markets and the slowing growth in the United States. Earlier this month, Mr. Bergeron modestly trimmed his Polish growth estimate for next year to 4.6 percent, from an earlier forecast of 5.8 percent. The central bank still expects growth of 5.4 to 5.5 percent, but with economies slowing in Western Europe, Poland cannot escape the effects, he said.
Much of Poland's success has been a result of large injections of foreign direct investment, which this year reached $20.6 billion, pushing Poland past Hungary as the region's biggest recipient since 1989. But with corporate profits under pressure in the United States and Western Europe, where most of that capital originates, the flow of money to Poland could dwindle.
While 65 percent of jobs in the economy are now in the private sector, large chunks of business remain to be privatized, including Telekomunikacja Polska, the phone company, which the Government plans to bring to the stock exchange in November. Moreover, heavily indebted branches of the nationalized economy, like health care and the coal and steel industries, continue to weigh heavily on the Government budget. A selloff of nationalized assets, given wildly gyrating world stock markets, will prove difficult.
What calms investors, however, is Poland's sound financial accounts, bolstered by an economy that is proving remarkably resilient. Though Poland's official trade with Russia accounts for only 8 percent of the total, it is supplemented by a vigorous cross-border trade, often based on barter, that adds about $500 million a month to Poland's export earnings. Thus far, that trade has not collapsed.
From January to July, Poland's total exports, which rose 20 percent from 1997 levels, outstripped imports, which rose by 15 percent, pushing the current account deficit down to $2.6 billion, from $3 billion in 1997. Even as capital gushed out of emerging markets from Indonesia to Russia and Brazil, Poland's currency reserves steadily rose to $27.5 billion from $24.3 billion in June, before Russia's troubles began.
"They're by far the best of a weaker bunch," Mr. Bergeron of Citibank said.

HEADLINE: The Consumer Will Prevail

BYLINE: By W. Michael Cox; W. Michael Cox, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is co-author, with Richard Alm, of the forthcoming "Myths of Rich and Poor."

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
American consumers account for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Their slice of the national spending has grown steadily, from 60 percent in the early 1950's to 68 percent today. Yet what should be seen as a sign of economic strength now spawns the latest nightmare scenario: With stock markets diving and overseas economies reeling, United States households may stop spending, tipping the world into a recession.
Well, I'm going to buck the current doom and gloom and say it's not going to happen. American consumers aren't going to shrug in any significant way, even if the weight of the world economy rests on their shoulders. 
 Pessimists are always with us. Their rallying cry in recent days has been the falling stock market and a downturn in consumer confidence. But with this week's losses, the stock market is still up 18 percent from Dec. 31, 1996, and up 155 percent from mid-1991 when the current expansion began. Yes, the consumer confidence index has slipped for three straight months, but it remains near historical highs, 25 percent higher than in 1995 and about the same as it was a year ago when the bull market was running strong.
And confidence levels are just one traditional indicator. When personal income, the unemployment rate, interest rates, financial assets and other fundamentals are in good shape, Americans open their wallets. Today, wages continue to rise, unemployment is running near its lowest level in 30 years and interest rates are favorable to the consumer (mortgages are below 7 percent, and car loans are about 6.25 percent, half of what they were when the current expansion began in 1991). Consumer debt relative to income is down slightly over the last two years and less than 2 percent higher than the yearly average since 1970.
But to focus on even these encouraging numbers is to miss the point; they don't by themselves explain why American consumers spend and why there's little reason for them to hunker down. The missing fundamentals center on the nature of demand in a mature economy, the market's penchant for new goods and services, the declining real costs of most products and the dynamism of our economy.
Americans are the world's most dedicated consumers. We've been on a buying spree for five decades. We've spent on everything -- clothing, electronic gadgets, travel, entertainment, services of all descriptions. Our houses got bigger and better equipped, from kitchen to garage. Vehicle ownership per capita jumped 83 percent in the past quarter century. One television used to be enough, but now three-quarters of the households in the United States have two or more.
Americans long ago moved beyond the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter. These categories today command just 37 percent of the average household's budget, compared with 76 percent in 1901. Yet there's always something more we want to buy, given the right price. Indeed, it's the mark of a wealthy society that consumers keep finding new goods and services to buy. Who can doubt it when we're paying for bottled water, free-range chickens, liposuction, pet orthodontists and psychics?
Early-1970's consumers had no idea that they would one day be buying videocassette recorders, satellite dishes, answering machines, personal computers, cellular telephones, in-line skates and micro-brewed beers. Even better, the next generation of commonplace consumer goods will consist of the luxuries only a handful of well-to-do households can afford today. We're already seeing markets emerge for satellite-based navigational devices, computers that listen to us, custom-fitted shoes and jeans, and cellular phones that ring anywhere on Earth.
Admittedly, this five-decade buying spree has had a few lulls, but I'm not worried about one now. Pauses in consumption usually occur when Americans get worried about the prospects for future income and slow their purchases of durable goods -- houses, cars, appliances -- by making existing stuff last longer. But two factors are on our side: the current low interest rates, and the fact that American consumers benefit from the economy's tendency to whittle down the cost of goods and services when measured in the currency that really matters, hours of work.
In time spent working at the average manufacturing wage, personal computer prices have fallen 85 percent since 1984. Cell phones are down to just 2 percent of their 1984 work-hour cost. Videocassette recorders cost a fourth of what they did in 1984. An eight-ounce serving of Coca-Cola goes for 56 percent less and a Big Mac 20 percent less than in 1970. A basket of food staples, including bread, milk, chicken and oranges, costs 26 percent less than in 1970.
Consumers don't make their buying decisions in a vacuum. Americans see an economy that's roiling with opportunity and innovation, one that should be able to grow even while Japan, Southeast Asia and perhaps Latin America suffer severe recessions.
Companies compete for customers through lower prices, better performance, new features, catchier styling, faster service, more convenient locations, higher status, aggressive marketing or attractive packaging. The payoff for employees lies in fatter paychecks, better working conditions, greater employment opportunities and even more time off. All these equal, of course, a happier and more confident consumer with more time and money to spend.
There's every reason to head for the malls.

HEADLINE: Fed's Deliberations in August Foreshadowed September Cut

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Policy makers at the Federal Reserve foreshadowed this week's interest rate cut when they voted in August to drop a bias toward raising rates, minutes of the August meeting, released today, showed.
The Fed also said that the officials held a special session on Sept. 21 to assess the health of financial markets and the economy as a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, was near collapse. 
 The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy body, voted 10 to 1 at its Aug. 18 meeting to leave at 5.5 percent the target for the main short-term rate it controls, according to the minutes. Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, dissented, citing strength in consumer demand. It was his fourth dissent this year.
The committee also backed away from its stance in favor of raising the interest rate target to guard against inflation. Instead, it adopted a so-called neutral bias. The panel had adopted the tougher stance at its March 31 meeting amid signs inflation was accelerating.
"While inflation risks were still a concern, given the high level of output and strong domestic demand, the uncertainties bearing on the economic outlook remained substantial, and indeed the risks on the downside seemed to have increased appreciably further," the minutes said.
Additionally, "even more serious disruptions in Asia could not be ruled out and would have important implications for the U.S. economy," the minutes said.
At its latest meeting, on Tuesday, the committee reduced its target rate for overnight loans between banks by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent, to keep the economy from tipping into recession. It was the first rate cut since January 1996. Minutes of this week's session will be released Nov. 19, following the next session on Nov. 17.
The minutes also showed that the committee held a telephone conference call on Sept. 21 to discuss "developments in domestic and international financial markets and their implications for the U.S. economy" in preparation for testimony Sept. 23 by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, before the Senate Budget Committee.
That meeting took place a day after officials from the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the Treasury Department met with partners of Long-Term Capital Management about the depths of the hedge fund's problems. It was announced on Sept. 23 that the New York Fed had helped organize a rescue plan under which the hedge fund received a cash infusion of more than $3.5 billion from a consortium of commercial banks and investment firms.

HEADLINE: Volvo Bus Deal In Mexico Set

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Swedish vehicle maker Volvo A.B. said today that it was investing $150 million in the Mexican bus company MASA as part of plans to build up its position in Mexico, Canada and the United States.
Volvo said the $70 million acquisition of Mexico's second-largest bus and coach manufacturer, Mexicana de Autobuses, and related investments would enable it to build both buses and cars for the North American Free Trade Agreement region. 
 "It is a fact that the Nafta region represents 26 percent of the world's total economy and provides substantial opportunities for increased trade between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada," Volvo's chief executive, Leif Johansson, said.
MASA's production plant in Tultitlan, on the outskirts of Mexico City, will be integrated into Volvo's North American production structure and allow the company to start producing its S70 and V70 passenger models next year.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Slumped Again In September

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Manufacturing weakened in the United States in September for a fourth consecutive month, as exports slumped, while prices paid by industrial companies fell to the lowest level in almost half a century.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said today that its index of factory activity stood at 49.4 last month, unchanged from August. An index below 50 means the number of manufacturers who said business had deteriorated was greater than the number who said it had improved. 
 The association's index of prices factories paid for materials fell to 34.4 in September -- the lowest level since 1949 -- from an August reading of 38.4.
The nation's factories have been struggling because of weak foreign demand for their products. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates amid concern that the slowing economies in Asia would begin to have a more pronounced effect on the United States.
Despite the weakness in factory activity, consumer spending remained strong. Inflation, interest rates and unemployment were all at low levels.
Evidence of the economy's underlying strength came in a separate report today from the Labor Department, which said that new claims for state unemployment benefits were nearing their lowest level in a decade. First-time jobless claims fell by 5,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted total of 289,000, while the less volatile four-week moving average fell to its lowest level in nine and a half years.
A third report, from the Commerce Department, suggested that construction activity might be cooling. Construction spending increased only one-tenth of 1 percent during August, the same as a month earlier.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
As Treasuries Keep Rallying, 30-Year's Yield Hits 4.88%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged again yesterday for the fourth consecutive session and pushed yields down to levels not seen since 1967, reflecting a growing investor migration out of stocks and into the safety of Government securities.
The rally in bonds was also helped by a monthly report from the nation's factory purchasing executives that showed further weakness in American manufacturing -- the fourth consecutive month of decline. Bond investors regarded that report as fresh evidence that economic turmoil abroad is slowing the United States economy. 
 The 30-year bond rose 1 10/32 , to a price of 109 26/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.88 percent from the previous 31-year low of 4.97 percent set on Wednesday.
"Treasury securities continued on their moonshot," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. Worldwide alarm over falling stock prices, he said, means that "demand for Treasury securities is coming from all quarters."
Mr. Fine said he believes the Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to lower interest rates by one-quarter point was merely the first step in the easing process; another quarter-point reduction will likely come at its policy-making committee's next meeting in November, he said. Lower rates would increase the value of bonds already in circulation.
The bond market may also have derived some strength from expectations that the September employment report, scheduled for release today by the Labor Department, will show that job growth slowed because of weakening demand for American exports, which depressed manufacturing production and employment.
Many economists have forecast that the economy added 195,000 jobs last month following a gain of 365,000 during August. They have also predicted that the unemployment rate for September held steady at 4.5 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Big European Markets Fall Steeply, With Germany Worst

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 1

 BODY:
European stock markets, notably Germany's, plunged today, as investors across the Continent seemed to conclude that they are no longer insulated from crises elsewhere.
Banks and other financial institutions were among the biggest losers, battered by fears of more losses related to Asia, Russia and Latin America as well as by the shock waves from the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the American hedge fund. 
 But traders and analysts said that today's declines seemed to be driven more by a general anxiety than by specific news developments.
"There is nothing really specific behind it," said Martin Coughlin, a European equity trader with Salomon Smith Barney in London. "I think people are waking up to the fact that we are in a bear market."
Though European markets had seemed relatively stable, analysts said investors had become convinced that the Continent was in for a measurable slowdown in economic growth.
Germany's benchmark DAX stock index fell 7.59 percent, with renewed fears about the vulnerability of the nation's biggest banks. Dresdner Bank, which acknowledged on Wednesday that it would have to take additional write-offs, dropped nearly 8 percent, to 57.20 marks -- roughly $34.50. Commerzbank dropped 9 percent, to 41.40 marks.
Rumors circulated all day that more European banks would report write-offs or take provisions for loan losses. The fears have been in the air for months, but became more noticeable last week with the bailout of Long-Term Capital. UBS A.G. of Switzerland, Europe's biggest bank, announced last week that it would lose more than $700 million because of the global financial crises and its exposure to Long-Term Capital.
Today, UBS rattled nerves again by announcing plans for a news conference Friday morning in Zurich. Though bank industry executives doubted that UBS would report more bad news a week after its last disclosure, many investors were convinced that any news would be bad news.
But there was plenty to worry about elsewhere. German car makers and chemical companies saw their stocks sink amid fears that exports would be hurt by Asian recessions and by the recent increase in the value of the mark, which makes German goods more expensive elsewhere.
Most other European markets were caught up in today's selling -- including London, Paris and Madrid. Blue chips in London sank 3.08 percent. The CAC index of leading stocks in Paris plunged 5 percent. Spain took nearly as hard a hit as Germany, with the benchmark index losing 7.08 percent.
Serge Vanheurck, a stockbroker at Kredietbank in Brussels, said investors had suffered an abrupt and substantial loss of nerve. "It is a pure loss of confidence," he said. "People have lost confidence in the stock market in general, and in the European stock market."
Today's fall in prices may also have been a correction from too much complacency, as the storm clouds from Asia and elsewhere became more ominous. Some analysts began noting six months ago that European companies had been noticeably slower than American companies to lower earnings forecasts, and warned of earnings surprises.
European investors have tended to be more averse to risk than Americans. But in the first half of the year, European markets -- fueled by a long-awaited cyclical recovery and a rush into stocks -- grew faster than markets in the United States. Now they are falling faster, as sentiment shifts from a fear of being left out to a fear of being left in.
Optimists pinned their hopes late today on a recovery in the Dow Jones industrial average, but they were disappointed when Wall Street opened sharply lower. The markets sank even deeper. "It brought tears to your eyes," said Peter Pietsch, a spokesman for Commerzbank.
If there were not many concrete news developments today, there were reasons to feel grim. One was the International Monetary Fund's unusually bleak forecast on Wednesday for the world economy, which envisioned growth slowing by half to about 2 percent for 1998.
There was also new evidence today that European exports, which have been the engine of growth in Germany and France, are sputtering. Michael Rogowski, head of the German machine-tool manufacturers' association, said foreign orders dropped 4 percent in August. The industry is cutting its growth forecast for 1998 to 4 percent from 7 percent.
Mr. Rogowski said the Asian crisis had become worse than companies expected. But exports could also be hurt by a recent decline in the dollar's value, relative to the German mark and other European currencies. The dollar has dropped from 1.8 marks in August to 1.64 marks today, hastened lately by the Federal Reserve's reduction of American interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: Fed Finds Early Signs of a Credit Squeeze

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
A survey of bank lending conducted before this week's interest rate cut detected signs of what could be the start of a business credit squeeze, a Federal Reserve report suggested today.
"Results indicate that there has been a fairly widespread tightening of standards and terms for commercial and industrial loans to larger firms," the Fed said. 
 The Federal Reserve routinely polls senior loan officers at large banks every three months. But the report today was based on a special survey taken in mid-September "to assess the impact of recent financial turbulence on the bank loan market."
While large companies' ability to borrow is being pinched, the survey "revealed little change in standards and terms for loans to small firms or in banks' willingness to provide consumer installment loans," the Fed said.
The report comes amid increasing talk of the prospect for a credit squeeze, usually defined as a drop in lenders' confidence that leaves creditworthy borrowers unable to obtain loans. The last time that occurred was in the early 1990's during and after the savings and loan crisis and the 1990-91 recession.
The latest survey was conducted after the late August collapse of the Russian ruble touched off steep stock market drops in the United States and around the world.
And its release comes a week after credit worries intensified because of a private $3.6 billion bailout by big banks and brokerage houses narrowly averted the collapse of a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management L.P. of Greenwich, Conn.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, told the House Banking Committee today that credit worries were one factor motivating the Fed to step into the rescue talks.

HEADLINE: Rubin Urges More Disclosure in Global Finance and Making Investors Pay Bailout Share

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said yesterday that the United States would press for "a new openness in international finance" that would require private financial institutions to disclose far more information about their loans around the world and force investors to pay their share of the cost of bailing out troubled nations.
In a speech in New York on the day before the opening of the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, Mr. Rubin said, "The global economy cannot live with the kinds of vast and systemic disruptions that have occurred over the last year." 
 Although he offered specific proposals he also seemed intent on heading off proposals from countries that are going to the meetings intent on tough new rules that would control the flow of billions of dollars of funds in and out of small economies. Malaysia began invoking an extreme version of such "capital controls" today.
Mr. Rubin's speech to an annual conference on the Americas held by Dow Jones & Company began to flesh out vaguer proposals by President Clinton and others for a new "global financial architecture" that would constitute the largest overhaul of international financial regulation in a half-century.
But he offered few proposals for the short term, at a moment that countries around the world are calling for immediate steps to contain the global economic contagion that began in Asia and has now spread.
Mr. Rubin, a former trader at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said although part of the problem the world is facing today is a function of markets that move much faster than in the past, another part was simply the herd mentality that has again led investors "to go to extremes."
The best cure, he argued, is "making information more available, and making sure it is well used." A working group created this year of 22 nations involved in the instability, both the largest economies and emerging markets, will call this weekend on the monetary fund "to examine and broadly publicize countries' adherence to international standards" on making public important financial information.
Early in the Asia crisis Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea all hid crucial information, and Russia has consistently played a cat-and-mouse game about its finances. Japanese banks have done the same.
Mr. Rubin also called for some changes for the fund, saying the international financial institutions "must work harder on providing adequate social support and on reinforcing good governance and reinforcing political commitment to reform."
That sentence was full of code words. It suggests that the fund still pays too little attention to the effects of its programs on the poor and has to fight corruption and crony capitalism actively, directions where the fund management insists that it is going, anyway.
Mr. Rubin was more directly critical in the case of Russia, telling reporters after the speech: "I don't think it's the activities of the international community that have failed in Russia. I think what failed in Russia was Russian."
Russia, he added, illustrated that "if we don't have the political commitment to, or ability to deliver, reform," then whatever the rest of the world does "isn't going to be responsive or effective in dealing with the crisis."
Mr. Rubin's call for private investors to pay a larger share of bailouts is part of an effort, led by the United States and Europe, to create additional risks for investors that may make them think twice about pouring money into a troubled market -- with the assurance that the country is "too big to fail." But he did not specify how the investors would have to contribute.
"Private-sector burden-sharing is critical, not only because there will not be sufficient official money for all circumstances, but also because it is absolutely essential in inducing market discipline," he said.
Mr. Rubin issued his strongest warning yet on the danger of imposing controls on currency trading, saying, "We must avoid actions that may offer short-term relief but create permanent damage in developed and emerging-market countries."
Mr. Rubin was most direct in his criticism of Malaysia, which has led the drive to control currency trading, banning traders and speculators from holding its currency outside Malaysian borders. He said such controls were "tempting" but would "almost surely not be effective over time, will deter capital from flowing into a country and will often tend to be used as a substitute for real reform."

HEADLINE: H.M.O.'s Are Retreating From Medicare, Citing High Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Health maintenance organizations, once thought to be the hope for the future of Medicare, said today that they would drop tens of thousands of beneficiaries next year, in part because the Clinton Administration had refused to let them raise premiums or cut prescription drug coverage for the elderly.
Insurance executives said that health plans were withdrawing from 300 counties in 18 states because medical costs were higher than expected, while Medicare payments were lower than anticipated. 
 The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services rejected a last-minute lobbying blitz by H.M.O.'s, which had asked for permission to increase premiums, raise co-payments or limit costly benefits like prescription drugs.
Friday is the deadline for H.M.O.'s to say whether they will participate in Medicare.
Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, an industry trade group, said that "175,000 to 200,000 beneficiaries are being dropped" as a result of decisions already made. "And in the next two days," Ms. Ignagni said, "we expect a number of announcements that will push the total over 250,000 and potentially to 300,000."
Such cutbacks would affect 1 in 20 Medicare beneficiaries now enrolled in H.M.O.'s.
Consumers dropped from H.M.O.'s have two basic options. They can go into the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program, with or without supplementary insurance to cover extra items. Or they can enroll in another H.M.O.
Advocates for the elderly said the turmoil and uncertainty in this market could deter people from joining H.M.O.'s.
Cheryl Matheis, a lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "H.M.O.'s have left the Medicare market in the past, but far fewer people were affected. The knowledge that H.M.O.'s can and do leave the program may make people a little wary about going into these plans in the future."
Moreover, Ms. Matheis said, "many of these beneficiaries will have higher out-of-pocket medical costs if they have to buy supplementary insurance, and they may not have coverage of prescription drugs."
The association, using Government data, said Medicare beneficiaries paid an average of $104 a month last year for the supplementary insurance, known as Medigap policies. Medigap plans covering drugs often cost much more.
Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer group in New York City, said, "Beneficiaries leaving H.M.O.'s may be unable to get insurance to fill gaps in the traditional Medicare program because of their health, their age, the cost or other factors."
Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are elderly or disabled. About 5.9 million of them are in H.M.O.'s.
But Ms. Ignagni said Aetna, Prudential, Allina, Anthem, Pacificare, Humana, Intermountain Health Care and other H.M.O.'s were scaling back their Medicare operations.
Allina, for example, said that it was ending H.M.O. coverage for 10,000 of the 35,000 people in its Medicare health plans in Minnesota. "Reimbursement rates don't cover our costs," said Sarah A. Stoesz, a spokeswoman for Allina.
In a similar vein, the United Healthcare Corporation, based in Minnetonka, Minn., said today that it was withdrawing from 86 of the 206 counties where it has Medicare plans, in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Texas, among other states.
"That affects 13 percent of our total Medicare membership -- 59,000 of the company's 440,000 Medicare beneficiaries," said Sue B. Busch, a spokeswoman for United Healthcare, which has participated in Medicare since 1980.
Other Medicare H.M.O.'s are pulling out of counties in California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington.
H.M.O.'s submitted their bids for Medicare business on May 1. The Government issued new regulations for the program on June 26. In the last two weeks, H.M.O.'s said they should be allowed to revise their proposals to account for renewed medical inflation and for the cost of complying with the rules.
In a letter today, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Medicare agency, told Ms. Ignagni, "We do not believe that your proposal to allow plans to increase their premiums and cost-sharing and reduce benefits would be in the best interests of our Medicare beneficiaries."
Today's actions come after a yearlong battle in which H.M.O.'s have resisted President Clinton's proposals for new laws to define patients' rights and Administration officials have repeatedly denounced H.M.O.'s.
H.M.O.'s withdrawing from Medicare must notify beneficiaries in writing by Nov. 2. Some patients will need to find other doctors.

HEADLINE: A FUND OF TROUBLE: A special report.;
As Economies Fail, the I.M.F. Is Rife With Recriminations

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
When the world's finance ministers and central bankers gathered last year in Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other for containing -- at least for the moment -- a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. In a year's time, many predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles in Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 -- a rough bump in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity.
Talk about bad market calls. Twelve months later, as the same financial mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide through endless receptions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, just about everything that could have gone wrong in the world economy has: the worst downturn in Japan since World War II, economic meltdown in Russia, a depression in Indonesia that is plunging 100 million people below the poverty line, and deep fears over what happens next in Latin America. 
 What makes this year's meeting of the I.M.F. most remarkable, though, is that the harshest criticisms are directed at the monetary fund itself, and, by extension, at the United States Treasury, which is viewed as the power behind the fund.
This year, in place of confident predictions, there are mutual recriminations. Arguments are breaking out over whether the true culprits were crony capitalists and weakened leaders like Boris N. Yeltsin, or huge investors who poured money into the world's emerging markets with reckless abandon in the mid-1990's and panicked in the past twelve months. Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billions of dollars have fled from economies on four continents -- seeking the safest havens possible, often in the United States -- and the money is not returning anytime soon.
And the subtext of every seminar on capital flows and every conclave of nervous ministers will be some painfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? Or is the world headed for a global recession?
Fifty-three years ago the fund was created after the Bretton Woods conference, which sought to stabilize the world economy and secure the peace after World War II. Now it is under attack from all sides, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by misjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in some of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta to Moscow. For the first time there are disturbing questions about whether the institution itself is still capable, financially or politically, of containing the kind of economic contagion that caught the world unawares.
Once, the I.M.F.'s critics were largely found in Africa and South Asia, were the fund was often viewed as arrogant; today they include Wall Street's biggest players and top officials in the most powerful economies of Asia and Europe.
Only a few -- including former Secretary of State George Schultz and members of Congress who are increasingly suspicious of all international institutions -- are talking about scrapping the fund altogether. But almost everyone is talking about creating a "new financial architecture" that can do what the old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires before they leap around the globe.
President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other leaders, after months of silence, have edged into the debate, in some cases wresting the issue for the first time from their finance ministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, is that 15 months of financial turmoil are now threatening political stability.
The blunt-speaking Prime Minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong, recently described the cost of failure in stark terms that both President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin have avoided.
 "A prolonged economic downturn in Asia will revive latent tensions against the West," he warned.
Such worries have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled mass of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions. The Japanese, the French, the Southeast Asians are all arriving in Washington with different diagnoses of what went wrong, and different solutions about how to set it right. The United States has its own set of plans, a mix of suggestions to force more disclosure of financial data in countries around the world and to impose more American-style financial standards and regulation.
Meanwhile, an ideological argument is breaking out over whether the world should slow down a long march toward more free and open markets -- a strategy pressed by the Clinton Administration for the past six years. Others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding the hospital while the patients are still on the operating tables.
"Last year the standard answer that all of us were given came down to this: 'We have the I.M.F. and the World Bank and they know best,' " Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, said over breakfast here the other day, reflecting on how the crisis turned 30 years of astounding growth in his country into an overnight depression.
"Then they said everything that went wrong was our fault," he said. "But now, now I think people know that much of the problem came from the outside, and we need something better."
And the I.M.F. itself is beginning to fight back, an awkward role for an institution dominated by Ph.D. economists who are unaccustomed to being openly challenged.
"Every place you turn you read the same story, that we came in, that we made things worse," said Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director of the fund, who was born in Northern Rhodesia -- now Zambia -- and became chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's economics department before taking a job that has now put him in the center of the financial storm.
"We frequently get the blame, some of it well-deserved," he said. "But it is politically convenient for governments around the world to cry, 'The I.M.F. made us do it,' and pin their mistakes on us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd like to be effective."
 
The Miscalculations
Ignoring Politics And Safety Nets
On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s top official, slipped into Jakarta to the private residence of President Suharto and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off, line by line, the huge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in return for tens of billions of dollars in emergency aid. Two previous deals had collapsed when Mr. Suharto ignored the fund's conditions, so Mr. Camdessus insisted that he strike a deal directly with Mr. Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader. It was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power politics: Mr. Suharto rose as a general in central Java and Mr. Camdessus went up through the bureaucratic ranks of the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central bank.
"It was all there," a senior I.M.F. official recalled. "He was told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove monopoly, all the distribution monopolies."
At one point, Mr. Camdessus looked at the impassive Mr. Suharto and said, "You see what this means for your family," a reference to their vast investments in the country's key industries.
"He said, 'I called in my children and they all understand.' "
But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to symbolize the I.M.F.'s twin troubles: Its inability to understand and reckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical reform, and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social costs of its actions.
Mr. Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement. It was, one of his former Cabinet members said, "a delaying move that was obvious to everyone except Camdessus."
Perhaps one reason why the fund sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is almost entirely composed of Ph.D. economists. There are few officials with deep experience in international politics, much less the complexities of Javanese culture that were at work in Indonesia. Historically, experts in politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations, development experts to the World Bank, and economists to the I.M.F. -- creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one.
As a result, the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if its demands were met and all Indonesia's state monopolies were quickly dissolved. While that system lined the pockets of the Suhartos and their friends, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staples to a country that stretches for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands. To help balance the budget, the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low. But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians lose their jobs.
The fund -- unintentionally, its officials insist -- also sped Mr. Suharto's resignation, insisting on the elimination of "crony capitalism," code words for removing the Suharto family from the center of the economy. Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's salvation, if the new Government can contain the rioting against the ethnic Chinese minority -- whose money is desperately needed to save the country's fast-shrinking economy.
"It is worth noting," Mr. Fischer said this week, "that our programs in Asia -- in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand -- only took hold after there was a change in government."
Nonetheless, the Indonesia experience has revived the argument that the fund is so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on preventing capital flight and freeing up markets, that it is blind to the social costs of its actions. Among the toughest critics has been its sister institution, the World Bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty.
"You've seen the tension almost every day," one senior World Bank official said recently. The bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic chaos.
Even the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, has joined the argument, warning in a speech at Harvard recently that "if globalization is to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must deliver rights no less than riches. It must be harnessed to the cause not of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for the poorest of the world."
Fund officials say they are changing strategies when they see they are exacting too great a social cost.
"It's a very difficult formula to get exactly right," Mr. Fischer said in August, as Russia was teetering and the I.M.F. was sending in $4.8 billion in aid that was rapidly wasted. "You need enough discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing. But you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than they otherwise would."
In recent months, he noted, the fund has allowed more spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods in Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere.
"There is a new flexibility at the I.M.F." a senior Indonesian official concluded recently. "It is a lot better."
 
The American Role
Runaway Agency Or U.S. Pawn?
The Clinton Administration admits that the fund has many failings, many of them on display this year. But the world, it insists, has gone through global financial crises without an I.M.F. once before in this century -- and the result was the 1930's.
"I have no doubt the situation over the past year would have been much worse -- with greater devaluations, more defaults, more contagion, and greater trade dislocations -- without the program agreed with the I.M.F. and the finance it has provided," Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, told Congress last week.
Many Republicans and some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though the Senate has overwhelmingly approved an $18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight new crises, the House defeated that measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope of getting the money, which will free up nearly $100 billion in contributions from other nations waiting for the United States to act, will come when the House and Senate try to resolve their budget differences in a conference committee in the next 10 days. A rejection, Mr. Rubin insists, would send a message that the United States is turning its back on the one institution charged with restoring stability.
Everywhere else in the world, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one of the biggest problems with the I.M.F. is that, contrary to the view of Congress, it acts as the United States Treasury's lap dog. Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, and the response is the same: The fund never ventures far without looking back for the approving nod of its master.
That view may not be far wrong. In ordinary times, the United States largely leaves its hands off, as the fund's executive board -- made up of 24 representatives of the 182 member nations -- delve into the intricacies of budget policy in Greece or banking regulation in Argentina. "Surveillance" of the world's economies is the fund's main activity.
When the United States weighs in, however, is when the fund is called on to rescue a country in deep trouble. Only then does the fund -- and the Treasury -- have the leverage to extract commitments in return for billions in aid. In theory, the American influence is limited: It has an 18.5 percent vote in the fund. Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent each. But in practice the United States usually gets its way, exercising its influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Mr. Fischer and Mr. Summers.
The two met when Mr. Fischer was on the M.I.T. faculty and Mr. Summers was a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a colleague at M.I.T. Each served as chief economist of the World Bank. It was Mr. Summers who was instrumental in placing Mr. Fischer in the fund's No. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly.
"It's usually a warm relationship," Mr. Fischer said this summer. "Remember, this is a job where you cannot turn to outsiders for advice -- you can't call the chief economist at a Wall Street firm, or even many of your academic friends, because so many of the issues are confidential."
The Treasury's relations with Mr. Camdessus are often more strained as he plays the role of world diplomat, traveling the globe and trying to coax along political leaders. The tensions were obvious from the start of the Asia crisis. The fund made little secret of its displeasure that the United States was not offering direct aid to Thailand, a major United States ally, as a sign of support and confidence.
Mindful of the backlash in Congress when Mexico was bailed out with American money, that was the last thing the Treasury planned to do. Mr. Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not forcing the Thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture. Within the United States Government there was other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt the United States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when the Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their own budgets.
There were other conflicts. When Japan used the last I.M.F. meeting to propose setting up a $100 billion "Asia Fund" -- one that would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much more relaxed conditions than the I.M.F. does, Mr. Rubin called up Mr. Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese proposal would undercut the fund's authority.
"We've just had a dispute with Michel," Mr. Rubin reported to his aides as he returned to his orange juice and croissant. One of them shot back: "And it's only 8 A.M."
Mr. Camdessus backed down at Mr. Rubin's insistence and walked away from money that Asia could have used. Japan says it will be back with a similar proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund.
Mr. Camdessus has also rankled American officials with statements that amounted to cheerleading to reassure the markets -- sometimes in the face of the facts. In June, with Russia on its way to collapse, Mr. Camdessus declared that "contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining" about the slow collapse of Russia's economy, "this is not a crisis. This is not a major development."
The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of how Washington muscles into the fund's turf as soon as major American strategic interests are involved. Last Christmas, as South Korea slipped within days of running out of hard currency to pay its debts in December, it sent a secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. "I didn't bother going to the I.M.F.," Mr. Kim recalled recently. "I called Mr. Summers' office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington and went directly there. I knew that was how this would get done."
Within days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most experienced veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post as undersecretary for international affairs this month, to shadow the I.M.F.'s negotiations with the Government in Seoul.
Mr. Fischer was displeased. "To make a negotiation effective, it has to be clear who has the authority to do the negotiating," he said.
 
Who Lost Russia?
Pushing an Accord That Fell Apart
The pattern was repeated this summer, when the United States raced to put together a $17 billion package for Russia. The fund's staff in Moscow declared that Russia needed no money at all -- it just needed to enact policies that would restore confidence in investors. The Americans and Germans came to a different conclusion.
Soon after, American officials gathered in the White House situation room to consider what might happen to Russia if the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the I.M.F. to come up with emergency money. So the fund began assembling a last-ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform plans for seven years.
I.M.F. officials say Mr. Camdessus was still hesitant, questioning whether the fund should risk its scarce resources in Russia. "We had to pull Michel along," a United States official recalled, though Mr. Summers denied it.
As it turned out, Mr. Camdessus' instincts were right while the bet made by Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers quickly went sour. The first installment of that payment -- $4.8 billion -- was wasted, propping up the currency long enough, in the words of one fund official, "to let the oligarchs get their money out of the country." Then Mr. Yeltsin reversed his commitments, let the ruble devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and fired virtually every reformer in his Government -- resulting in a collapse of the I.M.F. agreements and the indefinite suspension of its aid program.
Now, inside the fund and on Capitol Hill, there are recriminations over "who lost Russia."
Mr. Fischer argues that "there are no apologies owed for what we attempted in Russia." But some fund officials complain privately that they let Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers run roughshod over them, striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian Parliament rebelled and Mr. Yeltsin backed away from his commitments.
Mr. Summers responds that the United States "took a calculated risk" because "it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not succeed."
The Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic contagion, with investors fleeing Latin America, and setting off huge losses in hedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich, Conn., investment firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street powerhouses whose money it had invested.
"Russia was a turning point," said Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Co. "It made the world realize that some countries can fail, even if the I.M.F. and the Treasury intercede. And that changed the perception of risk."
Now, as the countries meet to face a future that the fund has warned could be very bleak, they need to reverse those perceptions, or watch countries slowly starve for lack of capital. The emerging markets are calling for controls on short-term investments. The French want a stronger I.M.F. The Americans say the answer is more disclosure, so that investors are better warned, and tougher regulation.
"These are usually nice, quiet meetings, everyone very polite," one top American official said this week. "Not this year."

HEADLINE: FALLEN STAR: THE PARTNERS;
After Salomon, Friends Built And Lost 'Dynastic Wealth'

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
As their wealth grew rapidly, John W. Meriwether and some of his 15 partners at Long-Term Capital Management L.P. even considered buying a vineyard in France early this year.
Why not? Mr. Meriwether, his friend and partner Eric R. Rosenfeld, and some of their colleagues, were wine buffs who had amassed considerable cellars that boasted rows of the choicest vintages from the best vineyards in Bordeaux and Burgundy, friends said. 
 And money was certainly not a problem. Among them, the 16 managing partners had amassed spectacular wealth by the end of last year, totaling well more than $1.5 billion. "Dynastic wealth," as one of their friends put it yesterday, "Serious dynastic wealth." Which, he added, "they created in an extraordinary period of time, and then lost."
In a spectacular riches to rags story, that wealth has now, in just a few months, been all but dissipated, with a few of the 16 partners even facing the prospect of personal bankruptcy, said friends and colleagues interviewed in recent days.
In a settlement thrashed out this week at the Manhattan offices of the law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, a group of banks and brokerage firms took over 90 percent of Long-Term Capital, recapitalizing it with $3.6 billion and leaving the former owners with just 10 percent of the business. Of that 10 percent, the firm's 16 partners now hold less than a third of that.
With the exception of a few partners who joined more recently, 11 of the group started with Mr. Meriwether in 1993 when he organized the investment partnership after his 1991 ouster from Salomon Brothers. Capital was easy to come by, and the best brains in Wall Street had realized that raising one's own capital and running one's own hedge fund brought much bigger profits than working for some big old battleship like Salomon Brothers, where just paying the overhead for the firm's headquarters cost millions of dollars a day.
The group also had the cream of Wall Street supporting its venture: Merrill Lynch & Company helped it get established, acting as placing agent for the new fund; Simpson Thacher & Bartlett was the group's legal counsel.
The majority of the partners at Long-Term Capital came from Salomon's offices in downtown Manhattan, where they had gained fame and fortune for their work with Mr. Meriwether and Mr. Rosenfeld. They were Victor J. Haghani, Gregory D. Hawkins, Lawrence E. Hilibrand, Hans U. Hufschmid, Arjun Krishnamachar, Richard F. Leahy, Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes. As many as 12 of Long-Term's 16 principals, or managing partners, were Salomon veterans, but the core of the group was Mr. Meriwether, Mr. Rosenfeld, Mr. Hilibrand and Mr. Haghani, former colleagues said.
"They're all nice, good honest people; that's the tragedy of this whole thing," William A. McIntosh, a former Salomon partner who is now an adjunct professor at Howard University, said discussing the managing partners of Long-Term. "They're all intellectual, they all get along well, and they are all good friends to one another."
The group of former Salomon executives is also extraordinarily cohesive and complementary. Mr. Mullins, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve; Mr. Scholes and Mr. Merton, who are both former Nobel Prize winners in economics, form the core of the academic group at the firm. Mr. Meriwether, Mr. Rosenfeld, Mr. Haghani, Mr. Hilibrand and most of the other partners have the strategy and trading expertise. Robert Shustak is in charge of trading systems and operations.
Golf, one of Mr. Meriwether's favorite pastimes, is part of the glue that has bound the partnership together, friends said. "They all got into golf," the friend said. "Every now and again, they would go off and play golf together, down in the islands, or over in Waterville."
Waterville is the internationally renowned golf course in County Kerry, in southwest Ireland, where Mr. Meriwether, 51, and Mr. Leahy, a veteran of Salomon's mortgage sales business, are partners. "It's a world-class golf course," one of their friends said yesterday, Mr. Meriwether and a group of partners "bought it in a bar right from the owner, 10 or 11 years ago."
Mr. Hufschmid, who along with Mr. Haghani manages the Long-Term Capital office on Conduit Street in London's West End, had run Salomon's foreign exchange business, which had at times generated fabulous profits for the Wall Street firm. Mr. Hawkins had run the mortgage business on Salomon's renowned bond arbitrage desk.
Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for the partners of Long-Term Capital, declined to comment yesterday and several of the partners have not returned messages left at their homes or offices in recent days.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
The Selloff in Stocks Deepens as Markets Plunge Worldwide

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
A worsening meltdown in stock prices expanded yesterday to damage every market worldwide on growing concern about financial turmoil and the possibility of a global recession.
The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 210.09 points, or 2.7 percent, its third consecutive decline, as investors again sought the safety of United States Treasury securities, driving interest rates substantially lower. The Government's benchmark 30-year bond ended at 4.88 percent, a level not seen since the Administration of Lyndon Johnson, down nearly a quarter of a percentage point in two days. 
 Blue-chip stocks have now fallen 18.3 percent from their mid-July peak and stand just one percentage point above the low for the year reached when the Dow plummeted 512.61 points on Aug. 31. At 20 percent below its peak, the market would be widely considered to have entered a bear market.
Compared with price drops in the United States yesterday, damage overseas was worse. Stocks in Brazil, which will conduct elections on Sunday, plunged 9.6 percent while shares fell 7.6 percent in Frankfurt, 5 percent in Paris and 3.1 percent in London.
The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks fell 1.6 percent yesterday, to the latest in a series of 12-year lows after the Bank of Japan reported a drastic decline in business confidence and the International Monetary Fund predicted Japan's recession would become the most severe since the end of World War II.
Early today, the Nikkei plunged at the opening to below 13,000, nearly a 13-year low, before recovering to end the morning session little changed.
"It's sort of a referendum on the fact that the crisis keeps smoldering and no one has confidence that anybody's going to extinguish it," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis.
Stocks of financial institutions in the United States, exposed to turmoil in emerging markets, write-offs of hedge fund losses and other domestic debt as well as the possibility of recession, took some of the heaviest battering. Technology stocks were also hit hard, reflected in a 4.8 percent drop in the Nasdaq market. Utility and gold mining shares were among the few to post gains.
Yesterday's decline in the Dow followed a modest loss on Tuesday and a 237.90-point drop on Wednesday. The average was off nearly 260 points in the last hour of trading before recovering a bit.
One contributor to the latest selloff was the I.M.F. report predicting that the Japanese recession would be more severe than has been generally expected. It said that the world's second- biggest economy would contract by 2.5 percent this year; until recently, the worst outcome had been thought to be a shrinkage in the range of 1 percent.
The I.M.F. also said that "the risks of a deeper, wider and more prolonged downturn have escalated" for Asia as a whole.
The annual meeting of the I.M.F. and World Bank is to begin this weekend in Washington, but some analysts were skeptical that effective action would, or even could, be taken to restore confidence in arresting the downward economic and financial spiral.
"Worldwide events have superseded what the I.M.F. can handle," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. At the same time, however, he said that low interest rates provided a cushion, spurring demand, in the United States.
"The economy's not falling out of bed," he said, even though growth in the United States would not be much faster than a 2 percent annual pace in the quarter that ended Wednesday and perhaps as little as 1 percent in the year's final quarter.
The market's drop yesterday coincided with an extended public appearance by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, but his remarks did not produce a noticeable reaction. At a Congressional inquiry into hedge funds, one source of current instability, Mr. Greenspan resisted suggestions for tight regulation, saying that such moves might be counterproductive by driving those operations abroad.
Investor alarm about the turbulence in stocks was reinforced Wednesday by the latest trend data from the mutual fund industry, the most popular way for Americans to invest in the market. The Investment Company Institute, a trade group, said that investors withdrew $11.2 billion from stock funds in August, the biggest outflow on record. At the same time, they funneled a record $50.94 billion into relatively safe money market funds.
Merrill Lynch was one of the many prominent casualties among financial stocks, sliding 3 3/16 a share, to 44, after trading as low as 42 9/16 during the day -- down from a high of 109 1/8 on July 13.
Citicorp fell 4 3/4 , to 88 1/4 , and Bankers Trust fell 3 15/16 , to 55 1/16 .
American Express fell 4 1/8 a share, to 73 1/2 ; J. P. Morgan slid 3 5/8 , to 81, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter dropped 3 1/8 to 40. Providian Financial lost 8 7/16 , to 76 3/8 , and Capital One Financial shed 12 1/16 , to 91.
High-technology casualties included Yahoo, down 16 9/16 a share, to 112 15/16 ; Amazon.com, down 9, to 102 5/8 ; Microsoft, down 6, to 104 1/16 ; Ebay, down 5 1/16 , to 40, and Dell Computer, down 4 3/16 , to 61 9/16 .
Among stocks in the Dow industrials, Sears, Roebuck endured the biggest percentage loss -- 6.5 percent -- when its shares fell 2 7/8 , to 41 5/16 .
Philip Morris and McDonald's were among the only Dow stocks to eke out gains. Utilities mostly held their ground, as did major oil issues.
"You have a flight to stability and stocks with good dividends," said Daniel B. Eagan, a portfolio manager at Black Rock in Philadelphia.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.01 percent, to 986.39.

HEADLINE: FALLEN STAR: THE REGULATORS;
FED CHIEF DEFENDS U.S. ROLE IN SAVING GIANT HEDGE FUND

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Parrying a rare wave of criticism, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, defended the central bank's role in averting the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.P. today, saying that it had acted out of concern for the stability of the financial markets rather than a desire to assist the investment firm's wealthy owners.
Appearing before the House Banking Committee with William J. McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Mr. Greenspan built a case that it was the central bank's responsibility to play a role in addressing a crisis whose effects could extend far beyond the fate of Long-Term Capital's owners, investors and lenders. 
 "Financial market participants were already unsettled by recent global events," Mr. Greenspan said, referring to the spread into Russia and Latin America of the financial crisis that began last year in Asia.
"Had the failure of L.T.C.M. triggered the seizing up of markets, substantial damage could have been inflicted on many market participants, including some not directly involved in the firm, and could have potentially impaired the economies of many nations, including our own," he said. Excerpts, page C3.
Mr. Greenspan is usually heaped with praise for his stewardship of the economy when he appears before Congress, and the world has increasingly looked to him for leadership in containing the spreading financial crisis. But today, two days after the Fed cut interest rates in an effort to insulate the United States from that turmoil, Mr. Greenspan offered no words to reassure the markets, which fell sharply in another bout of selling. Page C1.
Instead, Mr. Greenspan sat through a four-and-a-half-hour hearing in which he heard respectful but nonetheless pointed questions and doubts from members of both parties about the Federal Reserve's involvement in saving a risky investment fund that catered to the wealthy.
Lawmakers expressed considerable reservations about the Federal Reserve's decision to use its influence to buy some time for Long-Term Capital last week by helping to arrange a $3.6 billion rescue package from a group of big banks and investment houses.
They also asked whether the Federal Reserve and other regulators should do more to regulate hedge funds, which often make high-risk bets on the direction of stocks, bonds and exotic securities. They are structured in ways that enable them to largely avoid disclosure requirements that apply to brokerage firms, banks and other financial businesses.
Representative Spencer T. Bachus 3d, Republican of Alabama, said the message from Washington to welfare mothers and small businesses had been "that it's not the job of the Federal Government to rescue you."
The same message, he said, "ought to also apply to rich Greenwich, Conn., investors who are multimillionaires, that we ought to use the same standards that we've used on the welfare mothers on these large hedge funds."
Representative Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, said there seemed to be a gap between free-market theory and policy makers' decisions.
"We hear a lot of speeches about free enterprise and the marketplace, but a lot of folks don't like to practice it," he said. "The problem we have as representing our constituencies is that there seem to be two rules, a double standard: one for Main Street and another one for Wall Street."
Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is the committee's chairman, said the structure of the rescue engineered by the Federal Reserve raised antitrust concerns. He also questioned whether it had undermined a separate offer from a group including Warren E. Buffett, the multibillionaire investor, and Goldman, Sachs & Company. The terms of that offer were reportedly less attractive to Long-Term Capital's owners, including its founder, John W. Meriwether, than the deal later struck by the group assembled by the Fed.
"Perhaps the only smart deal of the month that Long-Term Capital did was they played the Fed off against another party," Mr. Leach said.
Other members seemed to be searching in frustration for ways to contain the risks posed by a small number of investment firms operating outside the regulatory system.
"I hope that we are going to be comforted that the regulators do now, in fact, have plans in place that would help avert such unfortunate circumstances in our future," said Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana.
Mr. Greenspan, however, stuck to his position that it would be difficult or even counterproductive to impose more direct regulation on hedge funds. Regulating the funds, Mr. Greenspan said, would drive them to operate from other nations with looser regulations, undermining the ability of the United States to monitor them even indirectly through their lenders and investors.
The best way to rein in gambling by those firms, Mr. Greenspan said, is to encourage their lenders to assess rigorously the risks they are taking and deny credit to those whose bets become unwise. In that way, he said, banking supervisors and other regulators can act as a second line of defense by pushing lenders to make sure their risk assessments are adequate.
Under questioning from members of the panel, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that same approach had failed in the case of Long-Term Capital Management.
But he said that such failures were inevitable in markets, that he had been surprised at how few had occurred in the last five years and that he expected more of them in the future. Moreover, he said, if the financial system is unwilling to assume risks, the economy's ability to grow will be impaired.
"Let's not presume that the ideal outcome is more regulation," Mr. Greenspan said.
Under pressure from members of the committee to explain why Long-Term Capital's troubles justified help from the Fed in arranging a rescue plan, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. McDonough said no taxpayer money was used and that the case should not be seen as a precedent for future intervention by the Fed in the marketplace.
Indeed, they said, although the Fed brought all the players together, the deal that emerged stripped Long-Term Capital's owners of all but 10 percent of their stakes.
In the long run, Mr. Greenspan said, the plan "may well work to reduce the ultimate losses to the original owners of L.T.C.M., but that was a byproduct, perhaps unfortunate, of the process."
He acknowledged, however, that the case raised questions about what economists call moral hazard -- the idea that rescuing investors from a bet gone bad encourages further overly risky bets.
But wiping out investors through a forced liquidation of the sort that Long-Term Capital faced would have made investors perhaps too frightened to take risks, Mr. Greenspan said, hurting the economy's ability to grow. As a result, he suggested, it is appropriate to intervene in the markets to stem potential panic.
"Risk-taking is a necessary condition for wealth creation," he said. "The optimum degree of risk aversion should be governed by rational judgments about the marketplace, not the fear flowing from fire sales."
Representative Maurice Hinchey, Democrat of New York, pressed Mr. Greenspan on his opposition to further regulation of exotic securities called derivatives, which are essentially bets on the direction of stocks, bonds, currencies and interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan replied that the "degree of supervision and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system." He supported language in a spending bill now before Congress that would postpone efforts by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to develop tighter regulations on derivatives.
But Brooksley Born, the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, later told the committee that not requiring more disclosure from banks and investment firms of their derivatives positions could imperil market stability.

Greenspan Defends Role Of Fed to Save Hedge Fund
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, defended the central bank's role in averting the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, saying it had acted out of concern for the stability of the financial markets rather than a desire to assist the hedge firm's owners.
 Speaking to the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said it was the central bank's responsibility to play a role in addressing a crisis whose effects could extend far beyond the fate of Long-Term Capital's owners, investors and lenders. Page A1.
 
I.M.F. Is Receiving Harsh Criticism
As the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank begins, the harshest criticisms are being directed at the monetary fund and the United States Treasury. A1. 

Rubin Calls for Fiscal Openness
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the United States would press for "a new openness in international finance" that would require private financial institutions to disclose far more information about their loans around the world and force investors to pay their share of the cost of bailing out troubled nations. A10.
 
Venture to Develop Impotence Drug
Shares of Icos rose $1.625, or 9.15 percent, to $19.375, after the biotechnology company and Eli Lilly said they would form a joint venture to develop and sell an impotence drug that some evidence suggests could be superior to Pfizer's successful Viagra. The two companies will share the marketing and sales of the drug in North America and Europe and split the profits 50-50. C5.
 
Stocks Decline Sharply in Europe
European stock markets plunged, as investors across the Continent seemed to conclude that they are no longer insulated from the economic crises rocking other parts of the world. C6.
 
Bond Yields Decline to 4.88%
Treasury prices surged, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 4.88 percent from the previous 31-year low of 4.97 percent set on Wednesday. C7.
 
Chrysler Sales Soared Last Month
Sales of Chrysler cars and trucks increased 18 percent in September compared with a weak month a year ago. C6.
 
Exports Slumped in September
Manufacturing weakened in the United States in September for a fourth consecutive month, as exports slumped, while prices paid by industrial companies fell to the lowest level in almost half a century. C6.
 
Mizrahi Closing Fashion Business
Fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi startled the industry by announcing that he would close his business, which had been losing money. Chanel had been bankrolling the designer since 1992, but decided to end the funding. A1.
 
Gloom Gains in Japanese Companies
The Japanese central bank's quarterly survey of corporate sentiment showed that morale had sunk to the lowest level in four years. C4.
 
Poland Recovers From Its Troubles
When Russia went into a tailspin earlier this year, Poland's stock market crashed. Investors pulled $1 billion in short-term capital out of the country and prepared for Poland to descend into the maelstrom. But the panic has receded and Poland is moving forward. Although the Poland stock market fell yesterday, it is up 4.8 percent over the last month. C4.

HEADLINE: BILLION-DOLLAR BETTOR: A special report -- The Man Behind the Curtain;
Hedge Fund Wizard or Wall St. Gambler Run Amok?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
John William Meriwether was the consummate trader. He knew when to hold, he knew when to fold. But as the chairman of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., he failed to recognize that his luck and his money were fast running out.
Last week they did, as a consortium of big international banks and brokerage firms agreed to inject $3.6 billion into Long-Term Capital, the giant hedge fund that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, worried would disrupt the global financial markets if it failed. 
 A quiet, introverted man with a head for numbers and a love of chance, Mr. Meriwether by all accounts was deemed most likely to succeed by those who worked with him over the years. A student of the bond markets, he knew their anomalies -- and how to play them -- better than anyone. But in his previous work as a bond trading star at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Meriwether had something he would sorely come to need at Long-Term Capital: the backing of a big firm with the deep pockets that can let a trader ride out almost any market storm.
Throughout the very public bailout of recent weeks, Mr. Meriwether has remained a man of mystery. He has given only a couple of interviews over the years and is rarely seen on the celebrity charity circuit in New York, unlike other men and women of fortune on Wall Street. He has even bought up most of the photographs taken of him in recent years.
So what kind of a man is Mr. Meriwether? And how could such a reputedly brilliant trader who had chalked up so many successes over the last 25 years wind up decimating his partners and nearly bankrupting his firm?
Mr. Meriwether is not talking about his past, present or future. But conversations with people who have worked with him in his years on Wall Street reveal a man, revered by those around him, who nonetheless remained remote, even lonely. A man always hunting for the edge that would make his bets -- whether in bonds, at the race track or on a Chicago Cubs game -- more calculated than wild.
A man co-workers describe as scrupulously honest, yet who has been associated with two of the biggest disasters in Wall Street history: the 1991 attempt by a Meriwether underling to rig the market in two-year Treasury notes and now the fall of Long-Term Capital Management.
People who have never met Mr. Meriwether may remember him as the man featured at the start of Michael Lewis's book, "Liar's Poker." As recounted there, Mr. Meriwether supposedly challenged John H. Gutfreund, then the chairman of Salomon Brothers, to up the ante from $1 million to $10 million in a game of "I dare you" played with serial numbers on a dollar bill. Mr. Gutfreund, no pansy himself, walked away, according to the book.
This story almost certainly helped forge the romantic view of Mr. Meriwether as a Wall Street cowboy, willing to make a bet that even his rich boss shrank from. Only trouble is, it never happened. According to people who were there, it was not Mr. Meriwether who made the challenge. It was John O'Grady, a gregarious and blustery Salomon partner who ran technical support for the traders. Mr. O'Grady died in 1989. (Mr. Lewis was traveling and not available for comment.)
According to those who know him well, the story is also out of character, because Mr. Meriwether only made the most calculated of bets, both personally and for the firm. He loved to bet on Chicago Cubs games, for example, but would not do so until he had first received the weather report to see which way and how hard the wind was blowing at Wrigley Field. That way he could better guess how the Cubs home-run hitters might do against the opposing pitchers. "These weren't big bets," said a person who had knowledge of them at the time. "He just liked to have a lot of things he could analyze." More often than not, he came away a winner.
 
From Golf Caddie To Club Owner
Born in Chicago in 1947, Mr. Meriwether grew up on the city's South Side. Like another famed money manager -- Peter Lynch of Fidelity -- Mr. Meriwether caddied at a nearby golf course to earn money. Friends believe Mr. Meriwether is an only child.
In 1969, he received a bachelor's degree in business from Northwestern University. He earned an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1973.
The next year he came to New York, a 27-year-old recruit in Salomon Brothers' vaunted management training program. Another member of that program recalls that Mr. Meriwether was friendless in New York and roomed at a Manhattan athletic club. His first assignment was on the desk that arranged financing for the firm's customers, called the repurchase or repo department.
It was there that Mr. Meriwether first made his mark. The desk was a fairly limited operation and acted as a service function for the Government bond desk. "It had never been a money-making proposition," said a person who was there at the time. "But John Meriwether turned it into that."
Mr. Meriwether's second assignment was to trade short-term agency securities, such as those backed by the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank. Aided by what people who worked alongside him called a near-photographic memory, Mr. Meriwether took this backwater of the bond market and made it spectacularly profitable. He understood better than others the proper differences, or spreads, between the yields on agencies and those on Treasuries, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the Government.
In a precursor to this summer's events, spreads on agency securities began to widen dramatically in the mid-1970's. What caused the change? A near-bankrupt New York City propelled investors out of anything that looked at all risky for the relative safety of Treasuries. Mr. Meriwether knew two things: that the widening in the spreads was an aberration and that the agency securities he traded, while not formally backed by the Government, were still good.
He was right. "He bought every single one he could, with the acknowledgment of the senior partners," recalled a former associate. "He rode out the bad bumps. Boy, did it work well."
Then, in the late 1970's, Mr. Meriwether had an even better idea. Through dealing with Salomon Brothers' customers, he saw the beginnings of a business that would prove extremely profitable for the firm. It was the bond arbitrage business, the ability to capitalize on small discrepancies in prices between specific bonds and the newly developed futures contracts that were based on them. The business was in the infant stages -- a bank in Cleveland was good at it and some of the Wall Street dealers were getting better. Why not Salomon Brothers?
He approached the firm's partners -- it was still a partnership, not yet a public company. "Why should we be executing these trades for some of these new arb firms when we can do them ourselves?" he asked. Mr. Meriwether was given the go-ahead.
 
Deja Vu, of Sorts, But Different
The story of Mr. Meriwether's first home run on the arbitrage desk is eerily similar to the Long-Term Capital story now unfolding. But there is a big difference: Mr. Meriwether did the bailing out then and he, as the banks and Wall Street firms that poured billions into Long-Term Capital now hope to do, later capitalized on the comeback of a troubled portfolio.
A big player in the Treasury futures market was a firm called J. F. Eckstein & Company, which had made a big bet that a disparity in prices between Treasury bill futures and the underlying security would converge. But in a brief two weeks, the prices of the bills rocketed. Mr. Eckstein, who expected prices to fall, was quickly depleting capital, struggling to meet margin calls.
"It was the first real period of turmoil in the fledgling financial futures markets and Meriwether understood it," Mr. Eckstein recalled yesterday. Almost alone in the market as a willing buyer, Mr. Meriwether took over a good part of Mr. Eckstein's portfolio. "The Treasury bills loosened up and the prices converged," one trader said. "Meriwether made a fortune."
Eighteen years later, Mr. Meriwether finds himself in a similiar position. Unlike Mr. Eckstein, however, Mr. Meriwether is still running his firm.
Looking back, it is easy to see how Mr. Meriwether might later have been felled by thinking that when spreads widen, they always come back. After all, with spreads on emerging market debt, junk bonds and mortgage-backed securities much wider this spring than in years, they had to narrow, didn't they? Once they did, anyone willing to take the gamble would generate a windfall.
There is one big difference, however. At Salomon Brothers, when Mr. Meriwether asked for the necessary capital to make a huge trade or additional money to cover it when it temporarily lost value he always got it. At Long-Term Capital Management he was not so lucky.
Indeed, when he went to his clients in early September with hat in hand, he did so still a staunch believer that his money-losing trades would come back. Never mind that the paper losses in these roughly $90 billion in positions had eroded his capital to just $600 million from $4.8 billion at the start of 1998. Convinced the trades would work out in the end, he asked for more money to shore up his capital and allow him to keep the positions. Salomon Brothers might have given it to him. But this time, he was turned down.
Back at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Meriwether made partner in 1980. As his prominence in the firm grew, so did his ability to take greater risk. Indeed, he thrived on it, former colleagues say. "He liked to be involved with chance," one said. "But it was always calculated."
 
A Natural Gambler, But a Careful One
 Mr. Meriwether was a natural gambler. He would take his group to Atlantic City roughly twice a year. Department meetings would sometimes be held at the Meadowlands race track in nearby New Jersey.
Mr. Meriwether's love of horses extends beyond the track. He houses several thoroughbreds on his property in the northern reaches of Westchester County. And he is a trustee of the New York Racing Association, which operates Belmont Park, Aqueduct and Saratoga. Mr. Meriwether's wife, the former Mimi Murray, is a rider who trained for the Olympic team.
In 1982, Salomon Brothers was bought by Philipp Brothers, a commodity trading firm known on the Street as Phibro. Some sources who were at Salomon Brothers at the time say that one reason it took place was that top partners worried about what might happen if Mr. Meriwether's big trades went bad, wiping out the partnership. With the takeover, their own money was no longer on the line backing his bets.
Yet Mr. Meriwether's bigger and bigger bets kept paying off during the 1980's, generating bigger and bigger profits for the firm.
By today's standards, Mr. Meriwether did not earn an outsized paycheck at Salomon Brothers. In 1989 he took home roughly $8 million; the next year he received $10 million.
But in 1991, disaster struck. A trader on Mr. Meriwether's desk, Paul Mozer, tried to corner the market in an issue of two-year United States Treasury notes. While Mr. Meriwether reported the infractions to his superiors, the violations were not reported to the Treasury until much later.
The scandal shook Salomon Brothers to its core. Mr. Gutfreund and Thomas W. Strauss, the president, left when Warren E. Buffett, a big owner of Salomon stock, took over to help clean up the mess. Mr. Meriwether resigned. He later settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which he neither admitted nor denied that he had been negligent as a supervisor. He agreed to a three-month suspension and a $50,000 fine.
By this time, Mr. Meriwether was wealthy. But it was his investment in his new firm, Long-Term Capital Management, that brought him true riches. Although his net worth is a secret, former colleagues estimate that at the peak, he was probably worth more than $200 million.
 
One Calculation Left Undone
For years, Mr. Meriwether lived humbly. From 1981 until 1993, home was the same small apartment on York Avenue, on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
While he lived relatively modestly, he had expensive tastes in golf clubs, joining three of the most prestigious in America: Shinnecock Hills on eastern Long Island, Winged Foot Golf Club in Westchester and Cypress Point, near Pebble Beach, Calif. He is said to shoot in the 70's. He even owns a golf course in Waterville, Ireland, with some partners.
Mr. Meriwether is a deeply private man who lets in only a handful of people. These people are, in return, very protective. "He is a very quiet person, even introverted," one former Salomon partner said.
At Salomon, he was known to be always available to people who wanted to bounce an idea off him. "One of the reasons he inspired the loyalty he did was that he would not try to take the credit," said Stephen Modzelewski, a former colleague of Mr. Meriwether's who now runs a hedge fund. "Usually the managers would steal the ideas of subordinates."
Among his colleagues, his integrity was never in doubt. He would suddenly remember, on occasion, to pay up on a bet long since forgotten by everyone else.
Stunned by the recent unfolding of events at Long-Term Capital Management, former colleagues cannot help but wonder how such a bad thing could have happened to such a brilliant person. Apparently neither Mr. Meriwether nor any of his associates, including two Nobel laureates in economics, had bothered to do a worst-case scenario on their trades. If they had, these people believe, the firm would never have been leveraged to the degree that it was.
At Salomon, recalled a former trader there who worked with Mr. Meriwether, "we would always do what we called the 'yield-to-worst' calculation, which took into effect the world going down."
Apparently, yield-to-worst was one calculation Mr. Meriwether either ignored or forgot to do.

HEADLINE: Protesters Shadow Tribe's Pursuit of Whales and Its History

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: NEAH BAY, Wash., Oct. 1

 BODY:
Armed with a steel harpoon, a .50-caliber rifle and permission to conduct the first legal hunt for a gray whale in American waters in more than 50 years, members of a small Indian tribe gathered today on a beach on the rugged Olympic Peninsula of Washington to start an adventure intended to resurrect the glory and traditions of their whale-hunting forefathers.
But before the eight-man crew could even launch its 32-foot cedar canoe into the steely waters of the Pacific, the Makah Indians had to contend with a modern flotilla of animal-rights protesters, themselves equipped with a submarine painted to resemble a whale and an underground speaker system that the protesters said was capable of scaring off a whale and saving its life. 
 And the United States Coast Guard, intent on preventing the groups from clashing, kept close watch on a scene that has posed an exquisite quandary for many environmental groups. Finding themselves caught between the save-the-whales ethos represented by the protesters and the respect for centuries-old American Indian traditions that the Makah say their whale hunt is all about, many leading environmental groups have taken no position at all on the matter.
While they did practice today, there was no indication that the Makahs had ventured into the ocean for any sort of hunt; once they do, of course, it is impossible to say whether they will quickly achieve their goal.
Though no living Makah has ever hunted a whale, the Indian nation here at the northwestern tip of the contiguous United States was once renowned for its hunting prowess, and, under an 1855 treaty with the American Government, it is the only Indian tribe specifically guaranteed the right to hunt whales.
Supported by the Clinton Administration and a $310,000 grant from the Commerce Department, the tribe last year won a rare exemption from the worldwide whaling ban and, as of today, has the right to take up to five gray whales per year in the next five years. Though critics fear that the Makah hunt will open the door to commercial whaling here and elsewhere, the Indians say they plan to use the whale meat, oil and blubber only for their own food and for ceremonial purposes.
"The hunt is the missing link, the thing that brings us full circle to our traditions," said Marcy Parker, vice chairwoman of the Makah tribal council. "We're ocean families, whaling families. So much of what we are all about comes from the ocean, and we feel a deep spiritual need to do this."
Though the Makahs live in a spectacular forested setting hard by the sea and at the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, it is a community racked by unemployment and tainted by drugs and other modern plagues. Many here say the whale hunt has succeeded in instilling a new sense of purpose in the lives of the young men selected for the hunt, and in the Makah Nation at large.
Some tribal elders who can remember the taste of whale meat are not so sure the hunt is a good idea.
"I admire the young people for taking on the challenge, but I just hope to God that no one is hurt," said 82-year-old Hildred Ides, whose grandfather was a whale hunter. "Going for a whale is a very serious thing, a very dangerous thing."
Ms. Ides's cousin, Irene Ward Ides, 88, nodded in agreement as they sat watching dancers in the community hall here one recent evening.
"I wonder if they really know what they are doing," Irene Ides said. "The whale can get awfully mad. The whales know they're being chased."
Indeed, the gray whale, which can weigh as much as 40 tons and grow much longer than the hunters' canoe, was called the "devil fish" by 19th-century whalers for its propensity to thrash and fight when attacked.
Conversely, when not under attack, the whales can be inordinately friendly and are known to swim and play alongside boats, making them a popular tourist sight all along their annual migration route from Baja California to the Bering Sea.
"In 1995, all of the crew on board the conservation ship Edward Abbey were privileged to meet a young, friendly whale we named Buddy," says an alert posted on the World Wide Web by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a group based in Southern California that has taken the lead in opposing the Makah hunt and prides itself in having scuttled whaling missions around the world.
"This October," the alert adds, "Buddy may be blasted to death against those cliffs, near the reservation at Neah Bay."
The young men of the Makah Nation, who have been training for months and have traveled as far as Russia to learn whaling techniques, describe the hunt in sacred terms and say it is a powerful way to connect with prior generations of Makah hunters and with the tribe's traditions, which include hundreds of songs and dances oriented around the hunt. They defend their planned use of a powerful rifle to finish off the whale once it is harpooned as a modern protective measure that would be sanctioned by their ancestors.
"We are praying to be right with God," said Eric Johnson, a muscular 31-year-old who is a teacher in the Makah's Head Start program and the captain of the hunt team.
"God is the one to judge whether or not we get the whale, and whether or not we will survive," Mr. Johnson said at dusk the other night, just before he and other crew members slipped away into the coastal fog for a practice session, chanting songs that were intended to coax a whale toward their canoe.
With the gray whales driven almost to extinction by global whaling, the Makahs stopped whaling sometime in the 1920's, and the United States banned the hunting of gray whales in 1937 in an effort to protect the species. It has been a conservation success story: there are now an estimated 23,000 whales out in the Pacific, the highest number in at least a century, the National Marine Fisheries Service says.
The whale was officially removed from the endangered species list in 1994, an action that led to the Makah tribe's campaign for whaling rights.
Even as tribesmen huddled today on the beach and met with Coast Guard officials in an effort to find ways to keep the protesters at bay, the hunt's opponents were vowing to protect the whales.
"We're not talking about five whales, we're talking about thousands of whales," said Paul Watson, the leader of the Sea Shepherd, from his cellular phone aboard one of the group's boats, anchored off Neah Bay.
Mr. Watson said he believed that if the Makahs succeeded in taking even a single whale, it would open the floodgates to demands for whale hunts by other Indian tribes in the United States and Canada and, even more alarmingly in his view, to non-Indian whalers in countries like Iceland, Japan and Norway.
The protesters, who also gathered for a vigil on Wednesday in nearby Port Angeles, have drawn the wrath of many of the Makahs.
So have the hundreds of people from across the country who have made threatening telephone calls or written scornful letters to the Makahs, like this one from Vermont: "So much for the 'We love the earth, peace, harmony, etc.' What garbage. You people ought to stick to welfare. Your culture -- what a joke."
Janine Bowechop, the executive director of the Makah Cultural and Research Center here, which has a display about the tribe's whaling history in its museum, said she was frustrated by the way that animal-rights groups, in her depiction, had "slaughtered and distorted" the tribe's interest in a whale hunt.
"They are completely misrepresenting what is a very meaningful tradition, something that is centuries old," Ms. Bowechop said. "The question should be, What's the fuss all about? America is supposed to be about the acceptance of different values."
Keith A. Johnson, tribal treasurer and head of the Makah whaling commission, said: "They come all the way out here to harass the Makah, a little tribe that wants to take a few whales out of the ocean. They have no idea about the richness of our culture, what this is all about."
As he spoke in the tribal headquarters here, Mr. Johnson sprayed processed cheese spread on a cracker and popped it in his mouth. Even as he joked about his snack ("We hear you can make this stuff from whale blubber, too," he said.), it was a reminder of how modern forces pervade the 27,000-acre reservation.
Once whale meat constituted almost 80 percent of the Makah diet, and a successful hunt may revive the whale's importance in the community for both spiritual and sustenance purposes. But others think that time is past, and should be.
"I just don't like the idea of killing whales, that's all," said Valerie Brown, a Makah woman who works as a cook at Beebe's, a restaurant in Neah Bay. "Nobody around here knows what whale meat tastes like, anyway. Nobody ever asks if we have it on the menu."

HEADLINE: COLLEGE: FOOTBALL -- NOTEBOOK

BYLINE: By RON DICKER 

 BODY:

CENTRAL OKLAHOMA
 Major-college recruiters lost interest after Johnny Luter spent his senior high school season in the county jail for armed robbery. So Luter walked on at Central Oklahoma, a Division II school in Edmond, and has become a star linebacker while straightening out his life.
 Luter, an all-American in 1996, missed 1997 because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament. He has come back to record 39 tackles to anchor a Central Oklahoma defense that has allowed 26 points in four games.
 We scream, 'Unity! Unity!' Luter said. It's like one person moving as 11 on the field. The offense just feeds on us.
 The Bronchos (4-0), ranked third in the nation, play host to Langston (2-2) tomorrow.
 Luter, a 6-foot, 235-pound senior, is on time to graduate with a business degree. His coach, Gary Howard, believes he should be given an opportunity to make it in professional football.
 Luter's mother died from an asthma attack when he was 6 and his father, a preacher, drowned a few years later. In the summer of 1993, Luter and some friends held up a taxi, and Luter spent three months in the county jail because the juvenile facility was full.
 Joe Zuspann, Luter's coach on Lawton High School's national championship wrestling team, paid for Luter's legal expenses and became his unofficial guardian, believing that Luter, an honors student, was trapped by dreadful circumstances. I knew that wasn't him, Zuspann said.
 Now, Luter dreams of reuniting his entire family. He has maintained relationships with his three sisters, and he lives with a brother released from jail last Christmas. His other brother remains in prison. There's still a piece missing, he said.
 Luter and his siblings spent last New Year's Eve crying at the graveside of their parents. It's still an uphill battle, he said. As far as the goals my mother and father would have wanted for me, I'm on track. As far as spiritually, I'm getting back on track.
 
CONNECTICUT
 A tabled referendum last year did not end Connecticut's hopes of playing major college football in a new stadium. The school's focus has shifted from an on-campus stadium in Storrs to Hartford, where a downtown revitalization proposal would include an open-air, 70,000-seat stadium if the city could lure the National Football League's New England Patriots, or a 35,000- to 40,000-seat domed facility that could also house UConn basketball, said Lew Perkins, the university's athletic director.
 Perkins emphasized that the plans were in the preliminary stage, but that the Huskies' football program, now competing at the Division I-AA level, would be ready to upgrade if the stadium was built. The Huskies, already members of the Big East in basketball, intended to join the conference in football before the state Legislature dumped a proposal last November before bringing it to a vote.
 We hope the Big East won't close the door on us, Perkins said. That's our biggest concern.
 
COLUMBIA
 Last season Darren and Greg Bivens had purchased plane tickets to New York to watch their brother, Jason, play for Columbia. But Jason Bivens blew out a knee before they arrived, and the three had a pleasant reunion without football. This year the Lions' schedule is making it cheap and easy for the Bivenses to get together. Columbia (1-1) makes a rare West Coast trip this weekend to face St. Mary's, a half-hour drive from where the player attended high school, in Richmond, Calif.
 I'm going home, proclaimed Jason Bivens, who, as an occasional Wishbone quarterback, is Columbia's leading scorer this season with two touchdowns. As a rover back on defense, he has three tackles.
 The game is also a homecoming for the Lions running back Norman Hayes, Bivens's teammate at St. Mary's College High School. Hayes has run for 74 yards and a touchdown on 35 carries.
 
IONA
 The Gaels have left their 13-game losing streak behind with a two-game winning streak, their first since 1993. Leading the charge is running back Ralph Saldiveri, a 5-9, 200-pound sophomore who has rushed 81 times for 398 yards and 6 touchdowns.
 He's like Barry Sanders without the speed, Roy Rodriguez, an Iona assistant coach, said.
 Iona (2-1) plays host to Canisius (3-0, 2-0 Metro Atlantic Athletic) tomorrow in a conference game that will not count in the standing because the Gaels are on probation for financial aid violations.
 
ROWAN
 Quarterback Gus Ornstein, who played sparingly at Notre Dame and Michigan State, has not found instant success at the Division III level. The Tenafly, N.J., native completed 25 of 52 passes for 346 yards last week but threw four interceptions in a 9-6 loss to New Jersey City University. For the season, Ornstein has connected on 56 of 105 attempts for 785 yards and 5 touchdowns with 6 interceptions. RON DICKER

HEADLINE: City to Permanently Close Dilapidated Nursing Home

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Three weeks after evacuating residents of a dilapidated nursing home at Rockaway Beach, the city informed the State Health Department yesterday that it planned to close the center permanently.
Officials said that repairing the site would cost $51 million, and that it was not cost-effective. But union representatives and advocates for nursing home patients said that the facility could be made safe for far less, and that the city was hoping to make money by selling the beachfront site. 
 The 85-year-old Naponsit Health Center, which consists of four buildings on six oceanfront acres on Rockaway Beach Boulevard in Queens, was already suffering from severe structural problems when it was damaged by a heavy storm on Sept. 7, city officials said.
At a Sept. 10 meeting of the capital committee of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the agency that runs the city's 11 acute-care hospitals and long-term facilities, officials determined that the 279 residents, some 320 employees, and visitors to the nursing home were in danger of being hit by falling concrete and bricks. It was decided to temporarily empty the building beginning that night and to conduct a complete engineering assessment.
Over the next 48 hours, patients were moved to other city-owned hospitals and nursing homes, including Coler-Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, a long-term-care center; the Dr. Susan Smith McKinney Nursing Home, which was recently opened on the grounds of the Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn; Bellevue Hospital Center; Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, and the North Central Bronx Hospital.
From the start, officials of the Health and Hospitals Corporation expressed doubts about whether the residents would be able to return to Naponsit. Yesterday, Dr. Luis Marcos, president of the corporation, said that an engineering report by the Dormitory Authority persuaded him and other officials that such a move was not economically sound. The site is owned by the city and will revert back to it.
"The site at Naponsit is not safe and it will simply cost too much to make it safe," Dr. Marcos said. "It is true that to just do the roof and facade would cost only $9 million, but then we would be moving patients back to a building that is still not compliant with modern codes. The hallways are five feet wide instead of eight feet, and there is not as much square footage per patient as the state now demands. It doesn't even have a handicapped ramp."
But union officials said that the emergency evacuation of the residents and the decision to permanently close the Naponsit facility was a sham. "The building is on prime real estate by the ocean," said James H. Butler, president of local 420 of the American Federation of State, County and Municpal Employees, which represents about 11,000 public hospital workers, roughly 150 of them at Naponsit. "Saying this about safety is just a masquerade. I believe there is nothing unsafe about that building."
Mr. Butler said that his concerns did not have to do with the job security of his workers. All of them, he said, had been reassigned to other city-run institutions. He said he was upset by the sudden decision to relocate the frail and elderly residents of the nursing home.
Dr. Marcos said that while he recognized that it was traumatic for the residents to be moved on such short notice, "I felt I had to balance that potential trauma with the real risk of physical harm to patients, employees and visitors, and every effort was made to minimize the trauma by moving whole units of patients together with the staff who cared for them."
Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health, said that the state had been informed of the city's decision and was reviewing it.
"Our current role is to insure that residents of the home are appropriately placed in other facilities," she said.

Japan BankingLegislation Passes Hurdle

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Japan's Lower House of Parliament today took a major step toward stabilizing Japan's frail banking system, passing legislation that is also expected to improve the prospects for Japanese economic recovery.
The legislation, which could pass the Upper House and become law as early as next Friday, has been the focus of worldwide attention because of the pivotal role Japan could play in influencing the direction of the global economy. Despite complaints from around the world, Japanese politicians have been bickering for months over this legislation as the economy, the world's second largest, suffers its worst recession since the end of World War II. 
 The markets were not overwhelmed, and this morning even though it was clear that the bills would pass, stock prices in Tokyo briefly touched another 12-year low.
But some officials say that the bills passed tonight in the Lower House, the key legislative body, will help Japan chart a way out of its bad debt problems and confront the sensitive issue of how to deal with the country's largest and weakest financial institutions.
"This is an epoch-making incident," said Naoto Kan, the leader of the Democratic Party, the main opposition group.
The legislation, however, still faces challenges, and the economy will need more prodding before it improves. The Government says it expects the economy to contract by 1.8 percent in the year ending March 31, 1999, and senior American officials have renewed their calls for Japan to strengthen its financial system and stimulate growth.
Business sentiment is still gloomy, and worrying economic statistics keep piling up.
The number of jobless in August rose to 2.97 million people, the largest number on record, and brought the level of unemployment back up to its June level of 4.3 percent, according to statistics released today. If unemployment figures were calculated by American methods, the percentage would be higher.
On Thursday the Bank of Japan released its closely watched quarterly corporate survey, which suggested that capital spending could continue falling and that companies were encountering difficulties borrowing from the nation's banks.
Even as the legislation passed the Lower House today, politicians were snapping at each other.
"The fact that this law was made based on the opposition proposal is proof that the direction that the current Cabinet has been taking has not been the right one," Mr. Kan said.
The governing Liberal Democrats were relieved by the approval today, but shot back a response to Mr. Kan:
"We shouldn't talk about who won or who lost or who conceded or who pushed through," said Yoshiro Mori, the secretary general of the Liberal Democrats.
The legislation, the result of weeks of negotiations, was drawn up rapidly on the basis of proposals from a group of opposition parties. The centerpiece is a three-way strategy to manage an orderly disappearance of failed banks. Such banks may be temporarily nationalized, liquidated under a bankruptcy administrator, or turned into a publicly owned bridge bank that would separate out the good loans and good borrowers and sell or collect on the bad loans.
Another crucial element of the legislation will be the creation of a new ministry-level financial committee to deal with bank failures and draft plans to manage financial turmoil. Until this new committee is formed, the Prime Minister will be endowed with these powers.
There were suggestions in the Japanese media earlier today that the Finance Ministry would also play a role in these areas, but with passage tonight in the Lower House, few details were released.
One of the most debated issues has been the power of the Finance Ministry. The opposition has demanded that the ministry be stripped of some powers, but it has vociferously fought back. The ministry is expected to lose some of its financial policy- making authority by the year 2000, but the debate on this point has not yet ended.
A law passed earlier this year to inject taxpayers' money into weakly capitalized banks would also be abolished by the new financial bills, and politicians will begin creating a new plan to replace it. Today's legislation also calls for creating an American-style agency, similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation that helped clean up the savings and loan crisis in the United States, to expedite the disposal of more than $600 billion in bad bank debts.

HEADLINE: Economy Shift In Russia Worries U.S., Albright Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian Government of Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western policy.
In her first comprehensive review of United States-Russian relations since Mr. Primakov was confirmed as Prime Minister last month, Ms. Albright said Washington was "deeply concerned" about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate. 
 "We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing new money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and restoring state management of parts of the economy," she told the U.S.-Russia Business Council in Chicago. "We can only wonder if some members of Primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of the global economy."
While praising Mr. Primakov, once her counterpart when he was Foreign Minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key issues with Washington, she had harsh words of warning for him.
"Our initial reaction to some of the direction he's going in has not been particularly positive," she said, adding, "The question now is whether that cooperation can continue."
The United States must keep up its aid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy and student exchanges as well as arms control, Ms. Albright said. Washington does not favor more direct aid.
"More big bailouts are not by themselves going to restore investor confidence in Russia," she said. "In the long run, the gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment."
Ms. Albright sharply criticized as self-defeating the "many voices in Russia who want to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction with America and our allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition and defiance for its own stake."
Russia could not stand alone in the world, she said, and the United States' ability "to help Russians help themselves will go from being merely very, very difficult to being absolutely impossible."
At the same time, she said, Washington would not "assume the worst, for there are still plenty of people in Russia who will fight against turning back the clock." And she urged the world -- and American critics -- to "be patient with the workings of the democratic process in Russia" and "not start each day by taking a census of reformers in the Kremlin," a census that American officials themselves promoted before President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed the previous Government.
While Moscow may continue to oppose any NATO use of force against Serbian forces in the southern province of Kosovo, Ms. Albright said, NATO must be prepared to act regardless.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Reverses 2-Day Plunge but Ends Week With a Loss

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
After plunging the last two days, stocks rallied yesterday. But the recovery may be no more than the expected rebound after a long fall.
Although the Dow Jones industrial average rose 152 points, it had plunged 448 points on Wednesday and Thursday and ended the week lower, breaking a three-week rally. 
Yesterday's surge was led mostly by the stocks that had fallen the previous two days. And the forces that are pushing stocks lower have not gone away: financial crises abroad, declining earnings expectations at home and uncertainty about what the United States and its allies will do to contain the situation.
The selloff on Wednesday and Thursday, according to some analysts, was prompted by disappointment in the Federal Reserve's decision to limit its cut in interest rate to a quarter of a percentage point, instead of a half.
Now some analysts are saying the market rallied yesterday on the expectation of further rate cuts by the central bank.
Alfred Goldman, the director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis, had a simpler view. "The market was oversold and bargains showed up," he said.
The September employment report, released yesterday, showed that job creation was less than forecast, signaling an economic slowdown. That report raised expectations for further Fed rate cuts, which could encourage equity investors because lower short-term interest rates would help prevent a recession. But slower growth could also create more short-term earnings problems for American companies, which would be a negative for equities.
On a day when the stock market rallied, bond prices moved higher, which may also be a negative. On most days recently, when the stock market has risen, it has drawn investors out of the bond market, pushing bond prices lower and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, higher.
But yesterday's bond rally may mean that investors remain worried about the economy and skeptical that a stock market rally can last long enough to be worth joining.
The near-failure of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund, has caused such nervousness, said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., that some people believe there are only two assets to invest in: Treasury securities and everything else, which is too risky.
The 30-year bond yield dropped to 4.84 percent yesterday, the lowest for long-term government securities in more than 30 years. The Dow jumped 152.16 points, or 2 percent, to 7,784.69, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.21 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,002.60.
The Nasdaq index, which is dominated by big technology stocks, rose 2.65 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,614.98. It was held back by sharp falls in two software makers, Peoplesoft and BMC Software, which were hurt by fears of stiff competition and slow growth.
The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks fell 0.33 point, or nine-hundredths of 1 percent, to 349.71, indicating that the rally yesterday focused on the bigger-name companies that have drawn investor attention all year.
One of the big decliners was Monsanto. It plunged almost 15 percent before rallying to close at 52, down 2 1/8, on rumors that the company's pending acquisition by American Home Products was collapsing.
Analysts said investors had become suspicious of the deal's closing after American Home Products repeatedly delayed the release of the deal's proxy statement. American Home Products said yesterday that the acquisition was still on track.
As investors look ahead, the key to the outlook seems to be what the United States and its allies will do to try to contain the economic crisis that has toppled Asia and engulfed Russia and now menaces Latin America.
Mr. Goldman of A. G. Edwards argued that one of the sparks for yesterday's rally was the approval of bank reform legislation in Japan, a key part of any program to turn around the Japanese economy.
There are two obvious paths from here. Both seem to be positive for bonds. One is not good for stocks.
Under the first scenario, there would be more money for the I.M.F.; a provisional rescue package for wobbling countries in Latin America, and more international cooperation, reassuring investors that the contagion can be contained.
Although contained, the economic drag from the recessions in much of the rest of the world would still force the Fed to lower interest rates further. That would be good for bonds and could stabilize stocks.
Alternatively, there would be no rescue package for Latin America and no new money for the I.M.F. That would put more pressure on the Fed to cut rates. This would not be good in the near term for stocks, as it would encourage fears that the crisis might spread to Latin America and finally the United States. But a new flight to safety and prospect of much slower growth here would send bond prices higher and yields lower.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki's Fiscal Record

 BODY:
With the gubernatorial race in full throttle, New Yorkers might soon wonder which of the states described by the candidates is the one they live in. Gov. George Pataki boasts that he has cut taxes, held down spending and presided over an economic renewal. His Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, says the Governor has a poor fiscal record, saddling the state with more debt, budget deficits and a dismal credit rating. Tom Golisano, an independent candidate, is bombarding the airwaves with accusations that Mr. Pataki has generated $20 billion in new debt and actually raised taxes. Confused? In fact, these claims contain a blend of truth, distortions and misplaced blame.
Mr. Golisano's charges are the most questionable. Whatever can be said about Mr. Pataki, he did lower taxes. The personal and business tax reductions enacted under him -- mostly by lowering income tax rates -- amount to $5.5 billion this year, or $300 for every person in the state. State tax receipts did go up, but that was because of the economic boom, particularly on Wall Street, not because tax rates had been raised. 
 Mr. Golisano's other claim, that Mr. Pataki has failed to curb the growth of state debt, is more justified. More and more of the state's capital projects are being paid for by borrowing, rather than annual appropriations. Debt service as a percentage of the budget is also rising. The Governor likes to point out that the rate of growth of state debt during his term has been half the rate incurred in the last term of his predecessor, Mario Cuomo. But the rate under Mr. Pataki is about the same as that under all 12 years of the Cuomo administration, according to figures from the State Comptroller's office.
Though one bond-rating agency has upgraded New York a notch, the state still has one of the poorest credit standings in the nation. The main cause is the state's tendency to enact spending and tax-cut obligations that balloon in size in later years, without identifying the means to pay for them, a longstanding practice that Mr. Pataki has not changed. When Mr. Pataki entered office, he faced a deficit of $5 billion and had to cut spending in his first two years. Though the budget is balanced this year, and though he eliminated many budget gimmicks, the state still faces a projected deficit of $5 billion in two years.
Mr. Pataki likes to boast that he has cut the rate of spending growth considerably from the Cuomo years. That claim is both true and false. Over all, spending has risen at an average rate of 3.7 percent in the last four years, compared with 5.7 percent in the previous four. But in this election year, state spending has shot up about 8 percent to pay for a campaign season giveaway for school aid and other items. The voters have a right to ask whether Mr. Pataki the cutter or Mr. Pataki the spender is the one seeking re-election, and also to judge the accuracy of his opponents' charges. The Governor ran four years ago as a conservative determined to lower spending, debt and taxes. He has succeeded more than his opponents concede, but not as much as he maintains.

HEADLINE: Freedom's Loss in Malaysia

 BODY:
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia has never had much tolerance for criticism or for the legal rights of those who challenge his authoritarian rule. But his high-handedness has taken a dangerous turn in recent days with his treatment of Anwar Ibrahim. Until a few weeks ago, Mr. Anwar was Deputy Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Mr. Mahathir's chosen successor. He seemed to be Malaysia's best hope for a more democratic future. Then, abruptly, he was arrested and this week appeared in court, charged mainly with sexual improprieties.
The more likely cause of his abrupt fall was his outspoken campaign against the nationalist and restrictive economic policies Mr. Mahathir has been promoting. Mr. Anwar, a supporter of open international markets, rightly linked the controls on capital and currency movements Mr. Mahathir imposed to increased opportunities for corruption and a further erosion of individual freedoms. 
 Mr. Mahathir endangers Malaysia politically and economically. Temporary capital and currency controls might make sense if they were coupled with serious reforms, including measures to stabilize the exchange rate and shield the banking sector from political pressures. But Mr. Mahathir has never shown much interest in such reforms.
Mr. Anwar's arrest has sparked rallies and protests in favor of reform and an end to Mr. Mahathir's 17 years in power. Police have arrested several of Mr. Anwar's supporters. He appeared in court with a bruised arm and black eye and said he had been beaten nearly unconscious in custody. Mr. Mahathir has suggested that his former deputy's wounds were self-inflicted. An independent doctor who examined Mr. Anwar disputes this.
Several Asian leaders, normally silent on the human rights questions of their neighbors, have publicly criticized Mr. Anwar's beating. When President Clinton goes to Malaysia next month for a regional economic meeting, he should ask publicly for the freedom of Mr. Anwar and other detainees.

HEADLINE: When Democracy And Liberty Collide;
Finding Reasons for Optimism About Authoritarian Regimes

BYLINE: By ERIC ALTERMAN; Eric Alterman is the author most recently of "Who Speaks for America? Why Democracy Matters in Foreign Policy," which is due out this month.

 BODY:
The worldwide trend toward greater democracy is generally thought to be one of the clearest and most unarguable benefits of the end of the cold war. But recent developments in once hopeful nations like Russia, Peru, Algeria, Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia, among many others, have begun to give even the most devoted democrats pause.
In these countries and dozens of others, one can find leaders who were elected in reasonably respectable elections but who rule in a manner more consistent with traditional tyrannies, without the legal protections typically associated with life in Western democracies. 
 Fareed Zakaria, the managing editor of Foreign Affairs magazine, has labeled this disturbing phenomenon "illiberal democracy" and estimates that at least half the 118 "democratizing" countries in the world fit this model. "Illiberal democracy is a growth industry," Mr. Zakaria writes. "Seven years ago only 22 percent of democratizing countries could have been so categorized; five years ago that figure had risen to 35 percent."
Elections can do more harm than good, Mr. Zakaria argues, in nations lacking a firm foundation in constitutional liberalism, meaning the rule of law, a free press, an independent judiciary and open economic transactions.
Thus, Mr. Zakaria says that nondemocratic entities like Singapore and Indonesia "provide a better environment for the life, liberty and happiness of their citizens than do either dictatorships like Iraq and Libya or illiberal democracies like Slovakia or Ghana." The United States and the West, he urges, should show more patience with semi-democratic nations with one-party systems or elected authoritarian rulers as long as they "accord their citizens a widening sphere of economic, civil, religious and limited political rights."
His views, first published in Foreign Affairs magazine (November-December 1997) in an article called "The Rise of Illiberal Democracy," has started a passionate, worldwide debate. On one side are scholars who think the 34-year-old editor may have presented a new theoretical foundation for American foreign policy in the next century. On the other are those who fear his arguments will be exploited to excuse and embrace oppression abroad, in much the same manner that anti-Communism was used to justify the coddling of right-wing dictators during the cold war.
Owen Harries, the Australian-born editor of The National Interest, says Americans might benefit from a European "raised eyebrow approach" to nations that call themselves democracies in the third world. John Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, for example, complained in a responding article in Foreign Affairs: "Zakaria's liberal autocrats look liberal only in comparison with the totalitarian rulers that preceded them. The abuse of human rights and repression of political choice makes these autocracies poor alternatives to governments committed to democratization."
If an argument cautioning against the embrace of too much democracy sounds heretical to Western ears, Mr. Zakaria says, it actually mirrors the West's own historical experience. "Only in the late 1940's did most Western countries become full-fledged democracies, with universal adult suffrage," he observes. "But 100 years earlier, by the late 1840's, most of them had adopted important aspects of constitutional liberalism -- the rule of law, private property rights and increasingly, separated powers and free speech and assembly."
He says, "The factors most closely associated with full-fledged liberal democracies are capitalism, a bourgeoisie and a high per capita G.N.P." Most such regimes can be found in East Asia, with the model being Hong Kong under British rule. Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore is also a liberal autocratic hero to Mr. Zakaria, even though Singapore's chief delegate to the United Nations, Bilahari Kausikan, insists that his nation "has never pretended or aspired to be liberal."
But Mr. Zakaria insists that Singapore is nonetheless destined for democracy in the long run. "Lee Kuan Yew thinks Singapore will never hold elections," Mr. Zakaria says, but Emperor Franz Josef of the Austro-Hungarian Empire "thought the same thing."
Nondemocratic Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia all fall on the positive side of Mr. Zakaria's ledger as well because of the protections they offer their citizens regarding property rights, legal structures and trade.
Owing at least in part to meager competition, illiberal democracy seems to be the leading candidate to become American foreign policy's new guiding paradigm. During the "long, twilight struggle" with the "evil empire," the cold war foreign policy establishment steeled itself on the ideas front with a slender essay published in 1946 by a Moscow embassy official then relatively unknown, George F. Kennan. Published in the July 1946 issue of Foreign Affairs under the pseudonym X and called "The Sources of Soviet Conduct," it set out the principles of containment, which guided American foreign policy through the fall of the Berlin wall 43 years later.
Since 1989, however, American foreign policy mandarins have drifted aimlessly in an intellectual sea of circumstance without ideological ballast. That summer, Francis Fukuyama offered up a strong contender in the new paradigm sweepstakes, entitled "The End of History." This former State Department official argued that no great challenges to Western-style liberal capitalism were likely to arise and so, ideologically speaking, history had ended.
Critics found Mr. Fukuyama's thesis provocative but difficult to apply to the real world, and recently even Mr. Fukuyama has articulated reservations in light of Russia's backsliding toward the possibility of a state-controlled economy.
In 1994 Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political scientist and Mr. Zakaria's mentor, offered a thesis based on the notion of a global "clash of civilizations." Mr. Huntington divided the globe largely into Western nations and the Muslim world, which "threatened Western domination" with "kin-country rallying" and "the threat of broader escalation." Despite some initial excitement, his rigid division also failed to cohere as an agreed-upon new paradigm.
Mr. Zakaria's entry, which he plans to expand into a book, is therefore nothing if not well timed. Mr. Huntington, generally considered a conservative, is quite sympathetic to illiberal democracy. He sees it as building on work he did in the early 70's that was critical of modernization theory, then fashionable, under which it was assumed that capitalism would inevitably lead to progressive democracies. Mr. Huntington insisted that modernization models, which some scholars believe led directly to the Vietnam War, paid insufficient attention to the creation of sturdy political institutions.
Stanley Hoffmann, who was also an adviser to Mr. Zakaria in the Harvard government department, is considerably less sanguine. He notes that the idea that "universal suffrage can be exploited is something we have known since the French Revolution." He shares the view that the argument will be "used for a defense for authoritarian regimes that are preferable to democracy."
Critics of both the neo-isolationist left and the neo-conservative right join Mr. Hoffmann, a liberal internationalist, on this point. Bruce Cumings, a Korean specialist at the University of Chicago, says that Mr. Zakaria has wrongly attributed South Korea's progress as a democracy to the presence of liberal constitutional prerequisites, like an open economy and respect for the right to own property. "It was pressure from below," he argues, "from the unions and the radicalization of the middle class that forced the autocrats from power. Before this took place, whatever rights people had were to a considerable degree a sham, because property and liberty could be removed from any individual overnight at the whim of the ruling elite."
The conservative Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, is also unpersuaded. He says most of the countries Mr. Zakaria is talking about are simply dictatorships. "They are tyrannies," he says. "Fareed has labeled a phenomenon that doesn't exist." Mr. Kagan also worries about what will happen if paradigm and policy align themselves. He says Mr. Zakaria's proposal may soon guide American foreign policy because "the foreign policy community is dominated by realist thinking and business interests, and the corporate community would love to hear that you don't want to promote democracy."
Not everyone endorsing the theory fits Mr. Kagan's categories, however. Sherle Schwenninger, a senior fellow of the liberal World Policy Institute, thinks the adoption of the Zakaria paradigm would improve United States foreign policy by helping "to temper America's moralizing tendency to look only at the superficial aspects of democracy." The argument, he says, "helps people to understand that democracy building is a longer-term historical process that requires a lot of favorable conditions coming together."
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott says the word "democracy has come to stand for a bit of an oversimplification." Without directly addressing Mr. Zakaria's model, Mr. Talbott maintains, however, that it "would be wrong and unfair to suggest that the U.S. Government support for democracy is limited to a simple-minded 'vote free, vote fair, vote frequently' strategy.
It is much more sophisticated about fostering and sustaining liberal institutions than such criticisms imply."
Yet whether illiberal democracy gains currency as a governing paradigm may depend less on the idea's specific merits than on the historical moment itself.
As Mr. Hoffmann wearily observes: "Today is not a time for big ideas. Foreign policy paradigms today are a lot like French fashion. They are launched with lots of fireworks, but we move on so quickly, nothing can be resolved."

Taking Pride In the Gains Of a Nation

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 2

 BODY:
In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said today that he must "live with the consequences" of his mistakes, as he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements of his Presidency and take heart from its possibilities.
Mr. Clinton has stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica S. Lewinsky, but he has taken to making glancing, at times humble, references to it, before moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans' needs. He did so today at a series of fund-raisers. 
 In one deft sentence, he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country's economic strength, making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support in an appearance in Cleveland.
After thanking the gathered donors for the "very kind personal things" they had said to him, the President declared, "If I had to do it all over again, every day, I would do it in a heartbeat, to see America where it is today as compared to six years ago."
As the applause faded, Mr. Clinton continued, "I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live with the consequences of our mistakes in life." He added with a chuckle: "Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way. But nobody gets out of this life for free."
To the music of a saxophone and a hammered dulcimer, Mr. Clinton raised about $200,000 for the Democrats' Senate candidate in Ohio, Mary O. Boyle, over lunch in a home in Cleveland. Then he flew here to Philadelphia to raise half a million dollars for the Democratic Party.
By midsummer, the President's aides were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising remarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing. But as his troubles have grown and the midterm elections have approached, his free-form remarks have become longer. Today in Cleveland, he spoke for 26 minutes, and at one event tonight in Philadelphia, he spoke for more than 19 minutes.
These fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since Mr. Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. He is lauded, applauded and embraced by his hosts and the donors.
"Mr. President, these are your friends here today," said Tony George, the host of the Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who have played a similar role.
But in Cleveland as elsewhere, protesters scattered along the President's motorcade route were reminders of calls for his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some are heaping upon his Presidency.
As he rode into Cleveland, Mr. Clinton passed a billboard for a local radio station, WNCX. "Lovin', touchin', squeezin'," it read, over a cartoon of the President with his arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside them.
At a rally for the President outside City Hall here tonight, a group of teamsters chanted, "Two more years." Mr. Clinton's motorcade route was lined downtown with hundreds of people, some carrying supportive or condemnatory signs.
After an impromptu shopping trip, during which he was greeted with shouts of "We love you," Mr. Clinton told some donors at the beginning of an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: "I didn't even mind the protesters -- that's the American way." But, he added, he preferred it when they were in the minority, "and that seemed to be the case."
The President left it to his aides today to respond directly to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington. Instead, in his remarks, Mr. Clinton spoke with pride of his record and with urgency about addressing the international economic crisis and the needs of farmers and schoolchildren. As he typically does now before such partisan audiences, he also gave his political calculation for the midterm elections.
Mr. Clinton said in Cleveland that Republicans had bragged privately to him about their prospects: "They tell me, 'Oh, we're going to do very well, Mr. President, in these midterms because we have so much more money than you do,' " and because Democrats who turned out to re-elect Mr. Clinton would not return to the polls in an off-year.
That argument, of course, would also insulate Mr. Clinton from any blame for depressing the Democratic vote.
But he often goes further than that, saying that his predicament could actually help the Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not bother to vote in a typical election. However, he said, "adversity is our friend," because it can overcome apathy and "focus us on what is at issue here."
What should be at issue, Mr. Clinton said, are his achievements and agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly. "What have they done?" he asked in Cleveland. "They killed the minimum wage increase for 12 million Americans. They killed campaign finance reform. They killed the tobacco reform legislation."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Big Swiss Bank Is Shaken Up By Hedge Fund

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
As more fallout from the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.P. cascaded over Europe today, the chairman and three high-ranking officers of UBS A.G. of Switzerland resigned -- the most visible casualties to date of dealings with the United States hedge fund.
The departure of Mathis Cabiallavetta and the senior officers was designed to restore some confidence in UBS, which became Europe's biggest bank after the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation in June. 
 But the announcement at an early morning news conference in Zurich did little to reverse a weeklong slide in bank stocks. Shares of UBS closed at 285 Swiss francs ($210) -- up 10 francs from their close on Thursday but less than half their high of 657 Swiss francs in July. At one point, the shares dipped to 258 francs.
Falling bank shares have led a sharp decline in European stocks in general that continued today as investors sensed they were no longer immune to roiling markets from Asia to Wall Street.
Even the Bank of Italy, Italy's central bank, acknowledged on Thursday that it had invested $250 million in Long-Term Capital -- an extraordinary investment for a central bank, particularly because some of Long-Term Capital's arcane trading was based on the likely behavior of Italian Government bonds. Questions about the Bank of Italy's investment multiplied when Reuters quoted a Bank of Italy foreign-exchange official, Pierantonio Ciampicali, as saying the central bank had been unaware Long-Term Capital was a hedge fund when it had first invested in the risky American firm.
European banks, including Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest, have so far acknowledged about $1.1 billion in losses from the Long-Term Capital debacle -- the most at UBS -- at a time when Europe's banking industry seems headed for a sobering downturn.
ING Barings, the investment and corporate banking division of ING Groep in the Netherlands, said on Thursday, for instance, that it was cutting 1,200 of 9,000 jobs.
In London, J. P. Morgan analysts downgraded three European banks, including Dresdner and UBS, on Thursday, warning "there may be further negative surprises for the market as we peer deeper into a number of the black holes which have emerged recently."
At UBS, Alex Krauer, who has temporarily replaced Mr. Cabiallavetta, 53, told reporters today that the bank's problem "is not a financial crisis, rather a crisis of confidence." He said the bank's exposure to Long-Term Capital arose from poor judgment and "an improper assessment of the situation" rather than negligence.
Pressed to say whether any of the departed executives had held personal stakes in Long-Term Capital, UBS officials said that there was no evidence of this but that an internal audit was still under way.
UBS announced last week that it would write off $685 million because of losses connected to Long-Term Capital.
The resignations were a surprise partly because they came so soon after the the merger of Union Bank and Swiss Bank created UBS in late June. The combination had been trumpeted as a milestone in Swiss banking history, but the alliance has been dogged by pressures from American Jewish and political organizations in the so-called Nazi gold affair, falling markets and what now seems a remarkable gap in the bank's internal ability to calculate the risk of its investments.
Marcel Ospel, the chief executive of UBS, said at the news conference in Zurich today that as late as August the bank's most senior managers were aware of losses totaling only $50 million from dealings with Long-Term Capital because of the way the transactions had been recorded.
As markets began to collapse in July, he said, "we were talking about a large accrued position with major risks spread over different books."
In a statement, UBS said: "The evaluation and the ongoing management of risk positions were not carried out to the standards expected."
Apart from Mr. Cabiallavetta, the responsibility fell on three other bank officers: Felix Fischer, chief risk officer; Werner Bonadurer, the joint chief operating officer at the Warburg Dillon Read investment banking arm, and Andrew Siciliano, the head of rates at Warburg Dillon.
"The conviction that I am doing the right thing for my bank has prompted me to take this step," Mr. Cabiallavetta said in a statement.
The bank's inability to detect the risks has left many in Switzerland questioning its professionalism, and Mr. Ospel was pressed to acknowledge that the bank was considering bringing in foreign directors with greater market expertise to bolster its all-Swiss board.
Swiss regulators have also opened an inquiry into the bank's losses. "We will have to ask ourselves how a bank can enter such a huge engagement with a single hedge fund," Daniel Zuberbuehler, head of the Federal Banking Commission, said in a published interview this week. "We also need to know why there was no red light coming on earlier."
UBS is one of the institutions that helped assemble a $3.6 billion rescue package for Long-Term Capital in return for a 90 percent stake in the hedge fund, clearly hoping to recover some losses while averting broader market chaos. Chastened by the experience, UBS forswore further ventures into high-risk investment.
"Given the developments in the international financial markets, in the future UBS will -- within the framework of its defined strategies -- focus even more intensively on those areas of business likely to generate sustainable earnings with a justifiable level of risk," the company said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Job Growth Turned Slack In September

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Job creation fell in September to the lowest rate in more than two years, the Labor Department reported yesterday -- the most persuasive evidence yet that the financial crisis abroad is slowing the booming American economy.
The Labor Department said the unemployment rate edged up only slightly, to 4.6 percent, from 4.5 percent in August. But payrolls expanded by just 69,000 jobs, a fraction of the 309,000 jobs created in August or the roughly 200,000 that had been expected by forecasters. 
 Total hours worked dipped, suggesting that production and income were leveling out, and hourly pay barely inched up.
The Labor Department's monthly employment report is considered the most substantial assessment of the economy's health. Coming on top of other signs of weakness -- falling exports, slowing retail sales and weaker business investment -- the data reinforced a view among economists that the eight-year-old expansion was being crimped by the economic problems that began afflicting Asia last year and have since spread.
"It's a warning sign of slower economic growth ahead," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The department also reported that em ployment growth had been stronger in July and weaker in August than first reported, underscoring that the slowdown has been steep. Excluding the gyrations caused by the General Motors strikes, gains in employment shrank from 270,000 jobs in July to 160,000 in August to the very modest September gain.
"The revisions don't change our sense of where we are," said Katherine Abraham, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "But they make the decline in job growth more marked."
A fraying at the edges of what was until recently a vibrant labor market has already been reflected in a retreat in consumer confidence in the last few weeks from record highs. The University of Michigan, which tallies a widely followed index of consumer confidence, reported yesterday that the index slipped to 100.9 in September from 104.4 in August.
To be sure, the American labor market still remains healthy by any historical measure. The change in the overall unemployment rate, for example, reflected a shift of a few hundredths of a percentage point that was then magnified by rounding. Unemployment among most demographic groups -- at the lowest levels in 25 or 30 years -- has not budged. And the percentage of Americans working actually rebounded to a near-record of 64.1 percent.
"These are still signs of a very strong labor market," said Alan Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton University. "Most people who want jobs are still able to find them."
But the snapshot of the labor market confirmed that the risks facing the economy have shifted toward much slower growth, maybe even recession.
Signs of cooling were widespread. Factory payrolls continued to shrink in September, dropping by 16,000 jobs and bringing the total number of manufacturing jobs lost this year to 114,000. With exports to Asia and Latin America plunging, imports soaring and production flat or contracting, the makers of electrical equipment, machinery and other industrial products have been forced to lay off workers.
The weakness in manufacturing is likely to persist. Orders for long-lasting goods were up over all by nine-tenths of 1 percent in August, but excluding aircraft and automobiles (which were bolstered by the end of the G.M. strikes), orders declined 1.2 percent.
Construction in September contracted by 20,000 jobs, not just in residential building but also in heavy construction like roads and bridges. That is the first decline this year other than those that reflected the vagaries of weather and seasonal adjustment. It is also a sharp contrast to the average monthly gains of around 24,000.
Most striking, however, was a sharp slowdown in hiring in the sprawling service sector. Services added just 105,000 jobs in September, compared with the average of 215,000 a month since the start of the year. Particularly noteworthy was that the head count at temporary-help suppliers, a leading indicator of future permanent hiring, dropped sharply, by 44,000. Temporary hiring had been zigging up and down all summer, but the September number was farther off the average than any of those shifts.
Wage inflation, too, seems to be cooling with the labor market. The trend in hourly pay, which seemed to be picking up in the first half of the year, now seems to be leveling out or even slowing. Hourly pay was up just 4 percent from a year earlier, compared with a rise of 4.3 percent from May 1997 to May 1998.
Despite the overall pattern of cooling off, hiring did pick up in a number of industries, including wholesale and retail trade, computer services, management consulting and financial services. The brightest spot: the amusement industry, which includes theme parks, bowling alleys, movie theaters and video parlors, all places where Americans can leave their worries at the door.

Kennelly's Star-Crossed Campaign Spurs Search for Reasons

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 2

 BODY:
For Barbara B. Kennelly, the Democratic Congresswoman trying to unseat Gov. John G. Rowland, the indignities are becoming an almost everyday event.
Earlier this week, she held a noon rally in Hartford, her hometown, and the audience consisted mostly of bored-looking construction workers shepherded by union leaders from a nearby site. Last week, she spoke to a group of 200 business people in Danbury, and the audience had no questions. In the last week, two of the groups that most dependably endorse Democrats, the Connecticut Education Association and the Connecticut National Abortion Rights Action League, decided not to make a choice in the race. And on Thursday, a new poll by Quinnipiac College showed her 44 percentage points behind the incumbent among likely voters. 
 Things are so bad, in fact, that in Mrs. Kennelly's home district, the poll showed the Governor leading by 27 points. And now, Mrs. Kennelly, the stately scion of a political family that ruled the state for decades, faces the very real possibility that her 23-year political career will end in a comedy of errors.
"This is beyond a landslide -- we're looking at blowout proportions," said Douglas J. Schwartz, the poll's director. "Every issue and every group is moving Rowland's way. It's a wind that's catching everything and blowing it in his direction."
Mrs. Kennelly, who gave up her House seat to run for governor, professes to be mystified about the devastating trajectory of a campaign that once looked so promising. Perhaps, because her name recognition helped her in early polls, the campaign looked more promising than it ever was. But certainly no one anticipated she would be in this kind of trouble. Why not? To many experts, one answer may lie in her political upbringing.
Political operatives in the state say the campaign of Mrs. Kennelly, 62, reflects that of an old-style politician who has never embraced the tools and demands of a modern campaign. In fact, they suggest, her approach to politics seems to reflect more the attitudes of her father, John M. Bailey, a longtime state Democratic chairman, who spent party conventions in the green room behind the stage, where politicians would go to pay court. In addition, they say, she has not had tough re-election races during her 16 years in the House of Representatives, and she has thrived in the deal-cutting culture of the Ways and Means Committee.
These days, the tool kit of the successful challenger's campaign includes a simple message repeated endlessly, an elbows-out style, an agility with sound bites, a ferocious pace and a faith in the potentially decisive impact of television advertising.
By nature or necessity, Mrs. Kennelly appears to have gone forth with a shortage or lack of each.
"She doesn't know how to excite this generation," said Peter K. Breit, professor emeritus of government at the University of Hartford. "She's very much her father's daughter, but Connecticut is no longer her father's state. People today see that era as arid and nonresponsive."
But the biggest problem with her campaign may be her opponent. Governor Rowland has remained popular and well financed in a year when incumbents everywhere are enjoying high approval ratings, largely because of the strong economy. Take that environment, stir in a lackluster campaign, and the consensus of a wide range of Democrats and Republicans in the state boils down to: There was little she could do, and she did not do it.
Signs of trouble were evident from the beginning. Mrs. Kennelly had been reluctant to enter the race, but Democratic leaders seized on a poll -- conducted by the University of Connecticut in June 1997 -- that showed her four points ahead of Mr. Rowland, and they talked her into running. She warmed slowly to the race and did not immediately poke at what Democratic leaders considered Mr. Rowland's vulnerabilities, which included his record on education and the environment. He used last winter's session of the Legislature to record achievements in both areas, and she was left to accuse him of stealing her issues.
An early brochure for Mrs. Kennelly featured snapshots of her with prominent politicians -- including the late Speaker of the House Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. -- an indication that she might be trying to rely too much on reputation, not on ideas for the future. Republicans called the flier "The Dead Democrats."
A series of four debates that begins Monday gives Mrs. Kennelly one more chance to make a case against Governor Rowland. She has seemed to take little advantage of recent joint appearances with Mr. Rowland, however, declining to criticize him directly. Further, her pitch does not always come across as well honed. Speaking to the business audience last week, for example, Mrs. Kennelly said she planned to enforce environmental laws more rigorously, but did not mention her tax-cut plan.
Mrs. Kennelly clearly does not relish the give-and-take of the campaign trail. Most politicians are reluctant to leave the eye of a television camera. But with reporters surrounding her after her Danbury appearance, she saw the Governor arrive and urged reporters to go talk to him. Served a fat pitch by a reporter looking for a quote about her new hope on the day she began her television advertising, she replied: "Fine. I feel just fine. How do you feel?"
William A. McEachern, a political economist at the University of Connecticut, said: "She just wasn't ready for prime time, the rough-and-tumble of a statewide race. She's better speaking from the well of the House than on the street, and she was trying to run in good times with no memorable issue."
Even Republicans are agog at the decisiveness of her collapse. "She has gone from coronation to catastrophe in just a year," said Kevin F. Rennie, a Hartford lawyer and a former State Senator.
In the Quinnipiac poll released Thursday, 61 percent of the registered voters who were surveyed said they were for Mr. Rowland, 28 percent were for Mrs. Kennelly, and 8 percent were undecided. Quinnipiac polled 1,070 registered voters between Sept. 23 and 28. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. Among the respondents considered by the pollster to be the most likely to vote, the gap was even wider, 69 percent to 25 percent.
A comparison with Quinnipiac's previous Connecticut poll, taken in June, showed that the more Mrs. Kennelly campaigned, the lower her numbers fell. "As the campaign has worn on, she has gone from an overall positive evaluation to a mixed one," Mr. Schwartz, the poll's director, said. When she finally began her television advertising last week, the poll numbers stayed static. Mrs. Kennelly had hoped to impress voters with her concern about education and health care, but those who were polled said Mr. Rowland would do a better job in both areas.
After the poll results were released on Thursday, Mr. Rowland had to struggle to keep a straight face as he talked with reporters outside his office. He said he respected Mrs. Kennelly's "long and distinguished career," and warned against complacency among Republican voters, even though he said he was doing "fairly well."
Mrs. Kennelly's campaign said the poll numbers did not necessarily mean that her brand of politics was outmoded. "Barbara Kennelly is not about theater," said her spokesman, Kevin Lembo. "Barbara Kennelly is about substance."
Eating lunch between campaign stops several weeks ago, Mrs. Kennelly was recounting her glory days as a Hartford City Councilwoman. Recalling the crush of media attention that followed her every pronouncement about her investigation into a roof collapse, Mrs. Kennelly triumphantly turned to an aide and said, "That was when I was a good speaker."

HEADLINE: At Russian Post Office, Check Isn't in the Mail

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 2

 BODY:
In a season of crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, failing crops and rotating governments, maybe it is not the ultimate insult. But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov and still regards a well-written letter as a labor of love is buckling a little this week, because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk.
The Post Office is broke. 
 In 60 of the country's 89 state-like regions, more than 1,000 mail cars have been sidetracked, many stuffed with up to 18 tons of letters, newspapers and parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good on some 210 million rubles in old bills -- about $13 million in today's dollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago.
Air mail, which amounts to one of every four or five letters, was also suspended at one of Moscow's major airports until this week, when the Post Office coughed up five million rubles for old bills. A second airport is still demanding three million rubles for past-due debts.
So much mail is backed up that post offices in Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, except for areas that can be easily reached by truck. Delivery schedules have fallen weeks, and perhaps months, behind.
"The situation is really extraordinary," said Vladimir V. Sherekhov, the deputy chief of mail service administration in the Government's Communications Committee. "We've never had anything like this before."
Maybe the Post Office has been lucky. Extraordinary is the rule elsewhere in Russia.
Until today, the lower house of Parliament was preparing to sue the Government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown offices. It turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds by cutting short their recess and returning to address the nation's economic crisis.
Earlier in the week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping routes may close next month because half the nation's icebreakers are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them. The oldest of the ships is so ancient that its nickname is Granny.
Such anecdotal evidence that Russia is losing its wheels, like one of its old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, is everywhere. But oddly, real signs of public distress are not all that common, perhaps because the system rarely seems to shed a part as big as a postal system.
If America's Postal Service is increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills, the Russian Post Office still holds a special place in the national conversation. Russians still write letters to each other, frequently and fervently, and many in remote regions get their news through the mail.
Millions use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives and friends in faraway areas, an especially vital service in winter. And in the last few years, the Post Office has become a vehicle for a growing mail-order trade in books, clothes and other catalogue items not readily available outside big cities.
Exactly why all this has rumbled to a halt is in some dispute. What is clear is that the Post Office and the Railway Ministry both suffer from what ails every Russian venture, private and public alike: nobody pays his bills.
The state Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers who believe the railroads are honor-bound to carry freight whether they are paid or not. The Government has decreed nearly 40 categories of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing.
Among the biggest deadbeats are the "power ministries" -- the military and interior departments -- which did not pay during Soviet times and feel little need to pay now.
"It's a psychology formed during the socialist period," said Tatiana L. Pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry, "and the same situation exists with the Post Office. We've been in dispute for a very long time. Always we try to understand their differences. But we can't carry cargo for free."
No kidding, says the Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million rubles by Government agencies, and is barred from raising rates even though freight costs are outstripping revenues. Moreover, the Post Office is also required by the Government to carry some forms of mail, such as pension checks, at reduced rates.
Officials at the state Communications Department say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions: a struggle to dominate the thriving mail-order business.
"Here's competition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels, and I think decisions made by the railroads are mainly explained by this competition," Mr. Sherekhov said. "They blame us for carrying some commercial cargoes instead of mail."
The Railway Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said such "commercial cargoes" are indeed a problem, but only because the railroads know that the Post Office has already gotten cash to transport the packages. The railroads are still waiting for their share of that money, she said.
In the meantime, the situation has come to a boil. In late September, the railroads cut mail service in and out of Moscow, effectively decapitating the postal system and forcing officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and out of the city.
Hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged some local yards to the point where moving cars into position for unloading has become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars were awaiting service at one yard. And customers are getting angry.
"We've gotten all kinds of complaints," said Viktor Salikov, a deputy in the Communications Department's mail shipping center. "People are even coming to us, searching for mail that was sent weeks ago."

HEADLINE: CLINTON PROPOSES I.M.F. ACT EARLIER TO PREVENT CRISES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
President Clinton today proposed changing the strategy of the International Monetary Fund so it can act earlier to help countries ward off economic crisis, rather than waiting until disaster strikes, when bailouts are more expensive and painful.
Mr. Clinton's proposal came after a week of turmoil in world financial markets and growing fears that the I.M.F.'s severe shortage of money is paralyzing its ability to calm investors, who are pulling billions of dollars out of emerging-market countries. 
 The plan would work, however, only if all member nations provide their full contribution to the I.M.F., starting with the United States. Congress has not approved the $18 billion American share.
The plan does not call for new money to the I.M.F. Rather, it would allow the fund to spend some of that money differently.
The move is motivated, Mr. Clinton said, by mounting evidence that the financial turmoil is threatening the United States.
But details of the plan were left deliberately vague today, largely so that Europe and Japan could debate and perhaps alter it at a meeting on Saturday of finance ministers and central bankers from the world's largest industrial economies. Their meeting will immediately precede a far larger annual meeting of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, sessions that this year are focused on how to stop the global economic turmoil that many fear could set off a worldwide recession.
Mr. Clinton announced the plan this morning in a statement he read just before heading off to two political fund-raisers, a hasty presentation that suggested that the idea had been put together quickly. He said the American proposal would "provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion."
Later in the day, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin -- who developed the plan over the last week with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan -- described the idea as a line of credit that the I.M.F. could offer to countries that are basically economically sound, but are vulnerable to investor panic.
Though Mr. Rubin would not identify any specific countries, the plan might apply to places like Brazil, which despite taking bold measures to reform its economy has still been shaken by nervous investors pulling out their cash because they fear that it could be the next place hit by economic turmoil.
The hope, American officials said, is that the mere presence of the "standby credit" -- akin to a guarantee from a rich relative that a newcomer to town will be able to pay the rent -- will calm investors.
"The idea is to create a precautionary credit line that wouldn't be dispersed unless it is really needed," a senior Treasury official said.
Experts in international finance generally applauded the plan because it appears to be aimed at solving one of the I.M.F.'s greatest shortcomings: Right now it provides major aid to countries only after they are deep in trouble, and then usually with conditions -- chiefly austerity and high interest rates to bolster their currency -- that can trigger unemployment, recession and political backlash.
But politically, the proposal may run into several problems.
The plan would bring no new money into the I.M.F., whose coffers are badly depleted. It would only change the way the fund spends the money given by its 182 member nations.
And right now, Mr. Clinton's commitment to provide $18 billion in new money to the I.M.F. is still stuck in Congress, after being overwhelmingly approved in the Senate and overwhelmingly rejected in the House. A conference committee is expected to decide in the next 10 days or so, but other countries will not contribute their shares -- for a total of $90 to $100 billion in new money -- until the United States acts.
This puts Mr. Rubin in a particularly precarious position at the meeting on Saturday. He must press a plan that is bound to be met with some suspicion by Europe and Japan, at a time that the United States is not providing its share of the financing.
Mr. Clinton alluded to this quandary today during his brief speech on the South Lawn, just two hours before the House Judiciary Committee released thousands of pages of grand jury testimony and other evidence in the Lewinsky matter. The President said, "In the few working days it has left this year, the most important thing Congress can do to protect our farmers, our ranchers, our businesses and our workers, is to secure full funding for the International Monetary Fund."
This is the third time in two weeks that Mr. Clinton has spoken at length on the global financial crisis, after months of near-silence. His political aides say it is time for the President to show a strong American commitment to calming the chaos. And, they add, it may well be good politics by focusing on the economy while Congress seems consumed by its investigations.
The Administration refused to set any amount for this new line of credit for countries in economic danger, saying that will be part of the discussions in the next several days.
Regardless of its size, the new plan may help the White House sell I.M.F. financing in Congress by arguing that it would make the fund more agile and more sensitive to countries' domestic problems. But a fierce critic of the I.M.F. financing, Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said he was unimpressed.
"We need to recognize that it was the Clinton Administration's own policies that accelerated the financial collapse overseas that is threatening the U.S. economy today," Mr. Armey said in a statement this afternoon.
"If the President will not -- or, as yet another consequence of his diminished leadership, cannot -- bring about real changes in international financial institutions, then Congress must supply leadership in his place," he said, insisting that all I.M.F. loans should have a one-year limit and that the fund be prevented from imposing multi-year economic reform plans.
The theory behind the new approach is that the I.M.F. can do more to contain economic contagion, and do it less expensively, if its acts well in advance of a crisis. But announcing the goal and designing the instrument are very different. Mr. Rubin said at a news conference today that investors might feel more confident if they saw that a country had resources to fall back on if they got in trouble, thus diminishing the likelihood of defaulting on its debt.
That, of course, was the theory behind the first bailout of South Korea late last fall. The money proved insufficient, however, and a second infusion was required. It was also the theory behind providing $40 billion in commitments, including $3 billion in American backup financing, to Indonesia. But the political chaos in Jakarta was so great that no amount of money from the I.M.F. could stem the flight of capital from the country.
Still, the American proposal could help emerging-market countries that have essentially sound economies and have enacted real economic reforms but are still caught up in what Mr. Rubin today called the "herd mentality" that has led investors to pull out their money.

HEADLINE: Job Creation Slowed By Foreign Turmoil

 BODY:
The United States economy produced jobs at the lowest rate in more than two years during September, the Labor Department reported. Economists called it the most persuasive evidence yet that the financial crisis abroad is slowing the domestic economy. 
 The Labor Department said the unemployment rate edged up only slightly, to 4.6 percent, from 4.5 percent in August. But payrolls expanded by just 69,000 jobs, a fraction of the roughly 200,000 that had been expected by forecasters.

Not Rain or Sleet, but Rubles
Mail delivery in Russia ground to a halt in the midst of the country's financial crisis. The state Railway Ministry has refused to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good on old bills. A1
 
Secretary of State Madeline K. Albright expressed disappointment about the economic confusion in the new Russian Government of Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western policy. A6
 
No Cooperation From Iraq
Iraq decided not to resume cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors after days of hints that a change of policy could be imminent, diplomats and officials said. After a meeting between Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, above, a spokesman for Mr. Annan said only that the two had talked and would meet again on Wednesday. A4
 
U.S. List for Asia Sanctions
The United States is preparing a long list of companies and government institutions in India and Pakistan that Americans will be barred from doing business with if the sanctions on those countries stay in place. A5
 
Apparent Calm in Kosovo
Western officials concluded from the calm in Kosovo that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia had ordered his troops to halt obvious operations against separatist rebels to fend off threatened military action by NATO. But diplomats said Mr. Milosevic's forces had already completed a punishing offensive. A3
 
Several Republican senators criticized the Clinton Administration's approach toward Kosovo, after a second day of briefings about how NATO would respond if Serbia did not halt the violence against ethnic Albanian civilians. A3
 
Salinas's Fortune Grows
Prosecutors in Mexico say the fortune amassed by Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of Mexico's former President, may be even heftier than previously thought. They have added 289 bank accounts, with deposits totaling $119 million, to their investigation of how he had acquired the wealth. A3
 
Some Agreement in Lesotho
Nine days after South Africa's disastrous invasion of tiny Lesotho, the kingdom's Government and its opposition parties sat down and agreed that new elections would be held within 18 months.

Congress Makes Public More Tapes and Testimony
The House Judiciary Committee made public 4,600 pages of heavily edited testimony and transcripts that included Linda R. Tripp's 20 hours of secret voice recordings of Monica S. Lewinsky, as well as grand jury testimony from the Whitewater independent counsel's investigation. The White House denounced the release as part of "a partisan process designed for partisan gain." A1
 
President Clinton's lawyers said the Judiciary Committee was rushing toward a "dangerous, standardless inquiry" on impeachment and that none of the evidence was "remotely sufficient to warrant an impeachment inquiry." A8
 
Sidney Blumenthal, a White House adviser, testified that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton had suggested to him in separate conversations that Mr. Clinton was simply "ministering" to Ms. Lewinsky in a spiritual fashion. A9
 
Betty Currie, the president's private secretary, said in her first grand jury appearance that her memory about important events "was getting worse by the minute," and in subsequent appearances her testimony grew increasingly forgetful and confused, though she never totally disavowed much of her initial account, which seemed to be somewhat damaging to her boss. A8
 
Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel, asserted lawyer-client privilege and refused to answer grand jury questions even after an appeals court held that he was not entitled to such a claim. The White House has appealed to the Supreme Court. Mr. Lindsey also made claims of executive privilege in his first three grand jury appearances. A8
 
President Clinton said he must "live with the consequences" of his mistakes, as he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements of his Presidency and take heart from its possibilities. A8
 
Action in House Bogs Down
The House lurched through legislative business, stalling for hours, then passing the agriculture spending bill, but taking no action on a dozen or so major spending bills. A13

 BODY:
The Halliburton Company said yesterday that it would eliminate about 5,250 jobs and close about 400 offices worldwide as part of its plan to save about $250 million a year from its acquisition of Dresser Industries and to reduce expenses as lower oil prices cut into its business. The job cuts are in addition to about 2,000 workers the company has already eliminated because of low oil prices. The cuts reduce the work force of the Dallas-based company by about 7 percent.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF THE PRESIDENT: THE OVERVIEW;
Panel Releases Conversations Taped by Tripp

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The House Judiciary Committee today released the final mass of evidence in its consideration of impeachment charges against President Clinton, offering a pungent store of furtive tapes and grand jury delvings into Mr. Clinton's intimate relationship with a White House intern.
The release of the 4,600 pages of heavily edited testimony and transcripts featured Linda R. Tripp's 20 hours of secret voice recordings of the intern, Monica S. Lewinsky -- the seedbed tapes of the seven-month criminal investigation into the misbehavior with Ms. Lewinsky that Mr. Clinton denied before the nation for seven months. 
 The White House, braced for an all-out impeachment struggle with the Republican-controlled Congress, denounced this third release of evidence accumulated by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, as "the clearest indication that this is a partisan process designed for partisan gain," and one far afield from the constitutional requirement for impeachment.
To make that point, the President's lawyers submitted an argument for the House's consideration that reached back 200 years into the history of sex and politics and cited as precedent Congress's early refusal to impeach Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, after he paid off a blackmailer who threatened to disclose Hamilton's sexual peccadilloes. The 105th Congress should be no less tolerant in the case of Mr. Clinton's behavior, the 30-page brief argued.
The document release ranged from tiny details in the Tripp-Lewinsky confidences to hard combat in the grand jury room between prosecutors and the dozens of Clinton supporters subpoenaed as the President found himself targeted.
"Tell the grand jury all the conversations you had with the President of the United States about Monica Lewinsky since January 12, 1998 -- how's that?" one prosecutor demanded of Bruce R. Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel. Mr. Lindsey, the President's closest, most tight-lipped confidante, stolidly refused to answer.
While devoid of major new disclosures, the new material details the wide net thrown by Mr. Starr in trying to make the case to Congress that the President should be impeached because he allegedly committed perjury and tampered with witnesses in his effort to keep the Lewinsky affair private.
Mr. Clinton, on a fund-raising visit to Cleveland, observed that everyone has to live with the consequences of mistakes in life. "Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way," he said as donors laughed and the new disclosures flooded the nation.
The densely packed three-volume release, including the testimony of dozens of the President's staff members and political associates, was laced with second-hand accountings of the President's personal life and glimpses of the White House's extensive attempts to foil Mr. Starr in his mission. The material was the prelude to the committee's public meeting next Monday, when the Republican majority is widely expected to recommend a formal House impeachment inquiry.
The new evidence hardly settled the impeachment question as Mr. Clinton's critics and defenders each claimed material supporting their contentions. But the voluminous material confirmed the White House scandal as a heated farrago of personal, legal and political clashes that has put Mr. Clinton's incumbency at risk. The welter of documentation includes these:
*The repeated attempts of Mrs. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's erstwhile friend, to use her mentoring role to coach the younger woman -- even using the collective "we" in strategizing at some points. "I think you should say, 'Well, I really need to speak to the big creep,' " Mrs. Tripp advised in one taped exchange, referring to the Ms. Lewinsky's nickname for the President.
*The possibility of gleaning the Tripp-Lewinsky tapes for exculpatory material as much as indicting comments. In the one tape-recording that Mrs. Tripp made secretly for Mr. Starr last January, she asked Ms. Lewinsky a key question in the prosecutors' attempt to discover evidence of Presidential perjury: "What is the definition of sex?" On the tape, Ms. Lewinsky replied, "Intercourse." Echoing Mr. Clinton's later defense to the grand jury and the nation, she added: "I never had intercourse. I did not have a sexual relationship."
*The repeated grand jury questioning in which the recollections of the President's secretary, Betty Currie, who facilitated Ms. Lewinsky's Oval Office visits, grew less and less distinct. "My memory is a little better -- but not much," she told the jury after a consultation with her lawyer.
*The urgent dawning in the White House last Jan. 17, after the President was deposed in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct civil suit, that Mr. Starr was hotly pursuing Ms. Lewinsky as a witness in some larger criminal inquiry directed against the President. "Do you think you can reach Monica, see what's happening?" Mr. Clinton asked Mrs. Currie after his deposition. After tracking down Ms. Lewinsky, the secretary said the normally loquacious intern hung up the phone after declaring, "I can't talk to you."
*The combativeness of the President's loyalists in the face of Starr prosecutors. "I'm just not going to answer that," the President's close friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., snapped when asked whether he was misled by Mr. Clinton's distinctions about sexual conduct. "You seem to have the problem with oral sex," he told the prosecutor. "I don't."
Already split along partisans lines even before voting its own inquiry, the committee now has a wealth of submissions from Mr. Starr, including Ms. Lewinsky's testimony admitting to oral sex with the President, and Mr. Clinton's own four hours of grand jury testimony broadcast to the nation last month. In that testimony, the President criticized Mr. Starr's inquiry as little more than a politically driven "parsing of the definition of sex."
Mr. Clinton maintains that because his behavior with Ms. Lewinsky involved oral sex and not intercourse, he did not commit perjury in his Jones lawsuit deposition last January, when he denied a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. After confirming a relationship before the grand jury, the President also told the nation on Aug. 17, contending that his earlier denials were legally accurate though generally misleading.
The document release disclosed the grand jury testimony of a panoply of witnesses, from some of the highest Presidential counsels to Secret Service agents who guard the President. There were exceptions, notably the testimony of Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer who said Mr. Clinton had once groped her sexually. Mr. Starr previously said his office was continuing to look into possible obstruction of justice in the reaction to her charge by unnamed Clinton defenders.
Armies of lawyers and news workers gleaned the latest disclosures into the weekend, setting the stage for the Judiciary Committee's opening hearing on Monday. In particular, they studied the President's initial handling of the crisis as it broke last January, the Democrats' insistence that the evidence is more exculpatory than indicting and, above all, the interplay between Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Lewinsky -- with the intern remaining clueless until the end about her friend's duplicity. "You are a wise, savvy woman, and I truly value your opinions," she told Mrs. Tripp last November.
Mr. Jordan, the President's golfing buddy who helped look for a job for Ms. Lewinsky when she was being subpoenaed in the Jones lawsuit, testified that two days after his deposition Mr. Clinton was in an "incredulous state" about the Drudge Report on the Internet. The cyber gossip gave the first public hint of Mr. Starr's searching into the deposition and the President's personal affairs as he sought evidence of obstruction of justice.
"It's not true," Mr. Clinton declared of the Lewinsky matter, according to Mr. Jordan. With the new Starr threat emerging, Mr. Jordan had lunch with Mr. Lindsey.
"It was clear that there was a problem, and what to do about the problem we did not get into," Mr. Jordan testified.
The President, meanwhile, had already been talking to Mrs. Currie soon after his return from the deposition, and asked a series of questions that prosecutors consider witness-coaching but that the President insists was innocent. Before that point, even as Mr. Clinton was being deposed on Jan. 17, John Podesta, the President's deputy chief of staff, had heard the first rumors of Mr. Starr's possible entry into the affair -- "linking for the first time, in my mind, Monica Lewinsky to the Paula Jones matter," Mr. Podesta testified.
As the sense of crisis grew, Mr. Jordan repeatedly telephoned Ms. Lewinsky, to no avail. He got to know her during the job-hunting help he had offered her. Summarizing the young woman for the grand jury, Mr. Jordan recalled, "I was listening to a bobby-soxer who was mesmerized by Frank Sinatra."
The President telephoned Mr. Jordan in the early morning of Jan. 21, when the first newspaper disclosures were breaking about Mr. Starr's new inquiry.
"There's a story out," the President said, according to Mr. Jordan. "I'm concerned about it. And the story is about Monica Lewinsky and myself."
Mr. Clinton "just sort of emoted about his circumstances," Mr. Jordan said. In turn, he testified, he advised the President: "Not to worry about it. Tell the First Lady. Deal with it later in the morning."
The President's lawyers said the latest release of documents bolster their charges that Mr. Starr twisted the evidence he gained in his investigation to build an impeachment referral to Congress.
Gregory Craig, the special counsel to the President, said a close reading of the thousands of fresh pages show that Mr. Starr engaged in "a pattern of evidentiary manipulation and misdirection" in his report to the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Craig, who was recently added to the White House staff to direct Mr. Clinton's response to the impeachment inquiry, said Mr. Starr purposely failed to discuss evidence favorable to the President "and intentionally omitted direct exculpatory testimony, paraphrased unambiguous statements to obscure their plain meaning and systematically resolved conflicting testimony in its favor."
The principal evidence of that, Mr. Craig said, was that Mr. Starr's initial "narrative" -- a list of detailed charges presented to Congress -- did not contain some of the information that was finally released today, well after the initial sensation over Mr. Starr's impeachment recommendation last month. The President's lawyers cited Mrs. Currie's testimony that it was she and not Mr. Clinton who was responsible for trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job.
The President's lawyers sent a letter today to Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, outlining their objections and arguing that neither private sexual conduct nor the perjury alleged by the President's critics met the constitutional test of impeachment.
The White House's protests and references to the new material pointed once more toward a defense that Mrs. Tripp acted as an agent provocateur for the President's political opponents in her conversations and tapings of Ms. Lewinsky.
The release of the text, but not the sound, of the taped conversations, presents considerable excerpts from the long and winding feat of eavesdropping carried out by Mrs. Tripp on Ms. Lewinsky as she railed about her affair with Mr. Clinton.
"I don't think there's a detail she left out," Mrs. Tripp testified to the grand jury, as if from exhaustion.
The tapes present Mrs. Tripp's behavior as ranging the gamut. "I hate what he has done to you," she told Ms. Lewinsky in denouncing the President at one point. But at another moment, her mission in endlessly hearing about Ms. Lewinsky's version of her life and times exasperated Mrs. Tripp.
In an E-mail message last Oct. 27, she complained to Ms. Lewinsky about her constant "ranting and raving" over the affair. "Share this sick situation with one of your friends, because, frankly, I'm past nauseated about the whole thing," Mrs. Tripp snapped. (She obviously reconsidered, for she taped on into the New Year, and finally for Mr. Starr.)
Ms. Lewinsky replied, "That's fine," while urging that none of their confidences ever be broken.
In her own grand jury testimony, Mrs. Tripp denied being a secret agent for Mr. Starr and other Republican critics of the President. "My idea was never to manufacture evidence," she asserted. "In fact, I had never even thought about the independent counsel in my wildest dreams. My idea was I'm going to arm myself with records so when I'm in a position to speak under oath, I can do so truthfully."
For her part, Ms. Lewinsky often sounds self-absorbed and frustrated. "I think people call me 'the stalker,' " she lamented. "I think that's what they say. Oh my God, that gets me so mad. I hate that," she said, as Ms. Tripp quietly taped the tale of the President and the intern.

HEADLINE: New Curbs Set For Pakistan And India

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 2

 BODY:
While Congress debates a temporary waiver of sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan because of their nuclear tests in May, the Clinton Administration is getting ready to release a long list of companies and government institutions in those countries that Americans will be barred from doing business with if the sanctions stay in place.
Experts say that the list, required under an amendment punishing nations that test to develop nuclear weapons, is due out soon and could not come at a worse time for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Atal Behari Vajpayee of India. 
 Both men pledged last week in speeches to the United Nations that they would sign the nuclear test ban treaty within the coming year although both do not have solid support for the move at home.
In India and Pakistan, where the nuclear tests met with jubilation, there have been second thoughts about the consequences of those tests, which altered the strategic map of Asia and increased the number of countries with nuclear weapons for the first time in 30 years.
The American sanctions that followed -- covering loans, credits, credit guarantees, military and munitions exports -- were felt worse initially by Pakistan, which was already under Congressional restrictions, but India did not escape the effect, which will worsen if links to American trade and investment are disrupted. Even with a waiver, bars will remain on deals with Indian and Pakistani nuclear institutions. The United States earlier waived some restrictions on agricultural sales.
The hope of the two Prime Ministers had apparently been to convince people that signing the 1996 test ban treaty would bring benefits -- at the very least the lifting of sanctions. The publication of a list of prohibited business partners, however coincidental, could negate that argument.
Administration officials say that they have no option, since the drawing up of the list was required by Congress under the 1994 Glenn Amendment, named for its author, Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio. Officials call it an "entities list" because it is a mixed bag of targets, including government institutions, military units, government-owned companies and private firms doing business with the nuclear establishment in either country.
About a dozen Indian and Pakistani companies and fewer than 20 Government departments in India and 15 in Pakistan are involved, officials said, but dozens more subdivisions are also listed, bringing the list to 100 or more names. The most severe restrictions cover government organizations involved in nuclear or missile activities.
Karl F. Inderfurth, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, said that the impending release of the list did not in any way reflect disappointment with the statements made by the two leaders, although Administration officials said at the time the pledges were made that Washington also wanted to see progress in other disarmament areas.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 4, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A headline yesterday about Indian and Pakistan companies and government institutions with which Americans will be barred from doing business misstated United States policy toward those countries. The ban assumes that current sanctions imposed after those countries tested nuclear devices in May remain in place. No new sanctions are planned.

SECRECY
 The American Experience.
 By Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
 Introduction by Richard Gid Powers.
 262 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $22.50. 
 Just because the United States won the cold war doesn't mean our Government did everything right. On the contrary, as one of the most zealous cold war Presidents, Ronald Reagan, delicately put it when acknowledging the criminal excesses of the Iran-contra scandal, "mistakes were made." Indeed they were. The Central Intelligence Agency, in particular, was a command center of malfeasance in the 1980's. Under its Director, William Casey, the C.I.A. fed the White House exaggerated reports of Soviet military and economic strength and kept Congress in the dark, illegally at times, about various covert operations. Meanwhile, a mole within the agency, Aldrich Ames, was peddling secrets to the Kremlin, with the result that at least 12 prized overseas "assets" were killed.
 It would be unfair to pin all this on Reagan. What happened on his watch was simply the culmination of a long history of deceptions thrust on official Washington by official Washington. "Secrecy" is Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's withering account of the Government's bottomless appetite for "intelligence" -- that is, for collecting, concealing, suppressing and manipulating it. It is a dismaying tale, though Moynihan has told it with uncommon liveliness and a mordant wit. For example, he and his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee received a briefing on Bosnia in 1993. Before the spokesman for the C.I.A. began, he raised a question: "Is everybody here cleared?" Moynihan writes: "One asked oneself: cleared for what? Premature Chetnik sympathies? Latent Titoist tendencies? We had no secrets about the Balkans. But this was now Government routine."
 Yet this book is not primarily an insider's account of the Government in action. It is, more ambitiously, a historical assessment of the "culture of secrecy," particularly in the area of foreign policy.
 In a thoughtful and wide-ranging introduction to "Secrecy," the historian Richard Gid Powers, himself an authority on the subject, reminds us that Moynihan, "the quintessential liberal anti-Communist," is uniquely qualified to survey this terrain, since in 1993 he introduced legislation for a bipartisan study of the problem of Government secrecy. He was chairman of the resulting commission, which "interviewed more than 96 agencies, corporations and organizations and more than 300 individuals," including "some of the country's best-known historians, policy analysts and journalists," as well as "convicted spies" serving time in Federal prisons. What he learned, Powers tells us, augmented his already formidable distrust of official intelligence. In the 1970's, Moynihan had been among the few in government who openly questioned Washington's dogged insistence that the Soviet Union was steadily gaining in "military, political and economic strength" when any visitor could see that the people there "had no clothes, not to mention no shoes, butter, meat, living space, heat, telephones or toilet paper."
 How did the shapers of our foreign policy arrive at this state of educated ignorance? Through a fateful conjunction of secrecy and bureaucracy, Moynihan says, that dates all the way back to 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson dragged a reluctant nation into World War I and thereupon began, with missionary grimness, to crush all dissent. Wilson pushed the Espionage Act of 1917 through Congress, and then the Sedition Act of 1918. Thus did the apostle of forthrightness in international relations -- "open covenants . . . openly arrived at" -- leave successive generations to wrestle with the three-headed demon of conspiracy, loyalty and secrecy. As Moynihan notes: "In time there would be a Federal Bureau of Investigation to keep track of conspiracy at home, a Central Intelligence Agency to keep tabs abroad, an espionage statute and loyalty boards to root out disloyalty or subversion. And all of this would be maintained, and the national security would be secured, through elaborate regimes of secrecy."
 The next step came in the 1930's, when the United States was confronted with the rise of totalitarian powers abroad, both fascist and Communist. The latter, in particular, functioned as an international conspiracy, complete with underground spy networks and multiple front groups, and seemed to require counterconspiratorial remedies. Many of these were concocted by J. Edgar Hoover, who began compiling dossiers on subversives, real and imagined. In his enthusiasm he did not always distinguish Soviet operatives from, say, members of the now-forgotten League of Women Shoppers.
 Convenient elisions of this kind helped sow the bitter discords of the cold war, the era in which Government secrecy assumed its most treacherous proportions. A malign precedent was established with the handling of the Venona decrypts, interceptions of ingeniously coded cables relayed to Moscow by Soviet agents posted in the United States. In 1943, the National Security Agency captured a batch of these communiques and began the long, painstaking decoding process that eventually yielded the names of Americans who were spying for the Kremlin. By 1947 there was ample evidence that a Soviet spy network was flourishing inside the United States. It made sense that President Truman should be put on notice.
 Yet there was a complication. In 1946, J. Edgar Hoover had warned Truman that Communists had infiltrated the Government, but the evidence he adduced was weak -- a dubious list of names and gossipy allegations -- and Truman had scoffed. The Venona documents offered, at last, hard facts. "Now then," Moynihan asks, "did the Director of the F.B.I., who had been quite prepared the year before to rush to the President a report of an all but fictional 'enormous Soviet espionage ring in Washington,' inform the President of the possibly less than enormous but real Communist spying when real evidence became available?" The answer was no.
 It was not all Hoover's fault. The decision was made by Gen. Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who classified the Venona material as Army "property." Unlike Hoover, who hated Truman, Bradley liked and admired him. But his loyalty to the President was overcome by the bureaucratic imperative to hoard these valuable nuggets. As a result, in the early, critical stages of the cold war, the President had no firsthand knowledge of Soviet infiltration. "It gives one pause," Moynihan remarks, "to think now that all Truman ever 'learned' about Communist espionage came from the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee, the speeches of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and the like." Almost as bad, millions of Americans would remain convinced for years to come that domestic Soviet spying was the phantasmal invention of Hoover, HUAC and McCarthy.
 But there is more to this depressing story than Moynihan reports. In 1945 Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister of Canada, had traveled to the White House bearing a transcript of statements made by Igor Gouzenko, a Russian who had defected while employed in the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa and then gave a thorough rundown of a North American spy ring. Gouzenko identified a number of agents by profession only. He had no names. But Hoover was able to connect the dots and present a clear enough picture to Truman's Under Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, in a private meeting. Acheson, a New Dealer and no fan of Hoover, did not take the report seriously and so let the matter drop, although it offered stark confirmation that two senior Administration officials, Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White, were Soviet agents. Secrecy, then, was not the whole problem. Partisanship and personal feeling entered into the equation too.
 Beyond this, it may well be that more, not less, secrecy would have calmed the furies of those fraught years. Surely it was the public nature of the Hiss and Rosenberg spy trials that inflamed the nation, whereas comparatively secret prosecutions of the atomic spies Klaus Fuchs and Alan Nunn May caused far less furor in Britain. The contrast was clear, too, in subsequent spy scandals. The British Government cleaned up its intelligence agencies by means of quiet purges that created scarcely a ripple of interest, while the highly visible Red hunts superintended so clamorously by Joseph McCarthy left a permanent wound on the nation's political life. Openness, too, exacts a toll.
 Still, it is hard to quarrel with Moynihan's characterization of cold war secrecy as injuriously "all-consuming." For this reason it is surprising that he says so little about the Vietnam War. No President was served worse by experts than Lyndon Johnson, whose policy advisers and field generals, brandishing data that no outsiders were permitted to examine, used the absurd numerology of body counts to weave a fictional narrative of battlefield triumphs. Here, again, secrecy did not operate alone, for what motivated these experts to deceive the Commander in Chief was their determination to halt Communist expansion, and what persuaded Johnson to go along was, in large part, his fear of appearing "soft" on Communism.
 On the other hand, Moynihan's argument is thoroughly borne out in the case of Johnson's successor, Richard Nixon, whose passion for secrecy really was all-consuming. His undoing began, Moynihan observes, with the publication of the Pentagon Papers. Nixon persuaded himself that those documents were vital to national security and so set in motion the retributive machinery that ultimately led to his resignation.
 "Secrecy" carries the story forward to the period of Moynihan's own struggles with a C.I.A. grown lazy and fat over the years. Formed in 1947 as an information-gathering agency, it soon lunged into covert actions, supported by a hugely inflated budget that by 1990 was five times as large as the State Department's. Moynihan, who has repeatedly called for the agency's dismantling, points out that doubts about the C.I.A.'s performance arose as early as the 1950's.
 He also argues that there is no reason that information gathered secretly should be any more effective than that accumulated by open study. He cites the example of the egregious report on "Deterrence and Survival in the Nuclear Age." Prepared by a panel of the President's Science Advisory Committee in 1957, and forwarded to President Eisenhower weeks after the launching of Sputnik, the report envisaged a Soviet Union ineluctably on course to overtake the United States economically and militarily by the end of the century. This nonsense helped spawn the fiction of a "missile gap." Nonetheless, the report remained, in all its patent error, classified Top Secret until 1973.
 By then the damage was done. Misreading the Soviet Union had become de rigueur for policy experts. American analysts diligently ignored the truth about our rival superpower: its dysfunctional economy, its political spoils system rotten with corruption, its republics seething with ethnic hatreds, its satellite countries in rebellion. Our leaders insistently portrayed this creaking shambles of an empire as an indestructible colossus. When the truth overtook us in 1989, the custodians of the free world were suddenly clueless.
 Moynihan's account of all this is engaging and informed. But the question remains: Would it really have helped if the veil of secrecy had been lifted and if outside experts had been given a chance to assess the Government's slanted evidence? After all, dissenting voices were raised time and again, and from within the Beltway. George Kennan, the architect of Soviet containment, had seen as early as 1947 that, as Moynihan puts it, "Soviet Communism contained its own seeds of destruction." But his warnings went unheeded. So did Moynihan's 30 years later, when he adduced indisputable facts to show that the Soviet Union was in extremis. The trouble, as he pointed out in 1991, was that "our analysts had internalized a Soviet view of the world." Yes, secrecy was to blame. But so was an ideology so rigid that it had been transmuted into blind faith.

HEADLINE: FALL AND WINTER CRUISES;
The Romance of the Seas

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL, a business reporter for The Times, covers the travel industry.

 BODY:
THROUGH most of the first eight months of this year, almost everything seemed to be coming up roses for the cruise industry. The year-end passenger count is likely to surpass last year's 5.05 million total, and the industry forecast of 7 million passengers by the year 2000 seemed well on target. Even the arrival in Florida two days ago of the Grand Princess, the world's biggest cruise liner, which departs on its initial Caribbean cruise today, did not give rise to the usual laments that the industry cannot absorb so many berths. 
 But the stock market slide that turned into a plunge on Aug. 31, and the financial roller-coaster ride that followed, sent the euphoria packing. For they served as reminders that cruises are especially vulnerable to penny-pinching during tight economic times, when many potential passengers opt instead for day trips, vacations visiting family or friends, or staying home altogether.
Hurricane Georges caused few canceled cruises in the Carribean and the Gulf of Mexico, though a number of cruise lines had to juggle itineraries, dates and time of departure, even the port of departure. Barring unforeseen storms, or greater than expected damage to ports, cruise lines said they expected to be operating on normal schedules by last week. But they recommend that passengers who have booked a cruise contact their travel agent, the cruise line or the line's Web site for any last-minute changes.
 Still, while widespread optimism about the economic outlook has been replaced by widespread caution, the industry is reasonably confident that several national trends and its own innovations will cushion any but the worst shocks.
For example, while vacations are undeniably susceptible to economic downturns, more Americans have come to regard them as a veritable birthright. Americans took 862 million pleasure trips last year, according to the Travel Industry Association, 43 percent more than in 1987. And cruises, at an average cost of about $175 per adult per day, including meals and entertainment -- with children free or at a reduced rate -- compare favorably with resort hotels, ski vacations or a week or two at the beach.
Furthermore, the popularity of two- to five-day cruises, the industry's fastest-growing segment, mirrors the national trend toward shorter, more frequent vacations, to accommodate working couples. As a result, younger people are increasingly choosing a cruise for one of those shorter vacations. According to the Cruise Lines International Association, the percentage of travelers over 60 has dropped to 28 percent this year from 44 percent in 1986 and the median age has fallen from 52 to 50 in that same period; Carnival said that for the last decade 35 percent of its 1.7 million passengers have been under 35.
Another sign of cruising's growing popularity among younger people is that weddings at sea are no longer an anomaly but an established phenomenon, offered on ships large and small. The Grand Princess says it has the first chapel at sea, the Hearts and Minds Wedding Chapel, which seats 36 and can be used for marriages and renewing vows. Chapels are all but certain on some of the 20 or more new ships expected to go into service through the year 2001.
Carnival alone said that it will have married 2,000 couples this year, during shipboard services on embarkation day in any of its year-round home ports, plus Vancouver during the summer season. Also available are on-island ceremonies during port calls in Catalina Island, San Juan and St. Thomas, as well as shipboard services while its vessels are docked or anchored at Grand Cayman and Barbados. To keep up with demand, two months ago Carnival added on-island ceremonies in Ocho Rios, Jamaica; Key West, Fla. (at a private beach), and Nassau, the Bahamas (in a flower-covered gazebo at the Radisson Beach Hotel or on an adjacent private beach).
Wedding packages average about $500 but can easily cost $1,500, depending on options. Most are likely to include an official civil ceremony, flowers, champagne, photographs, wedding cake and transportation to and from the island location. Most also include prerecorded wedding music, but American Hawaii's packages include live ukulele music, as well as flower leis and a floral headpiece for the bride.
"A lot of the people getting married on ships are getting married for the second time, and just don't want to spend a fortune on another wedding," said Shaunah Majcher, vice president of Royal Pacific Occasions, a Vancouver company that coordinates weddings throughout the world for Holland America. One of its more unusual wedding sites, Ms. Majcher said, is atop Herbert Glacier, a short helicopter flight from Juneau, Alaska.
Cruise weddings vary with cruise line, although the lines require that bride and bridegroom sail on the cruise. Also, according to Ms. Majcher, on most ships captains do not perform wedding ceremonies, couples cannot usually be married while at sea, and most wedding ceremonies are civil rather than religious services.
Children are another growing cruise sector. The industry puts their numbers at only 15 percent, but in the case of Carnival, the industry leader, that is expected to translate into about 200,000 children this year. And the percentage of children is obviously far higher during school vacations and on Disney Cruise Line, which was designed with families in mind.
Citing the fate of the all-family ship American Adventure, which folded in 1994 after nine months of operation, industry officials still question the wisdom of an all-family ship or cruise line, except for Disney, whose cruises are sold as part of a land-sea package with Disney World. But they consider family cruises with children an important untapped market.
That is why this year Princess lowered from 12 months to 6 months the age at which children can accompany their parents or guardians to the Caribbean and Alaska. That is also why, during holidays or in the summer, most ships have a range of programs for kids 2 to 17, as well as trained counselors, baby sitters, children's menus, toddler's play areas, teen clubs, wading pools, karaoke contests and pizza parties. Premier's Big Red Boat not only has Looney Tunes characters aboard but also serves Bugs Bunny-shaped waffles for breakfast.
All Carnival ships have a children's wading pool, while its Celebration and Ecstasy have water slides for children who can swim and are at least 3 feet 10 inches. The Grand Princess not only has two-level children's and teen centers, for teen-agers it also has a disco, Jacuzzi and a motion-based simulator that provides a variety of thrill rides.
One of the newest trends afloat is educational activities for children, including Hawaiian language and hula lessons on American Hawaii Cruises, Italian language lessons on Costa Cruise Lines and learning the art of clowning aboard Norwegian Cruise Line. Royal Caribbean has a video arcade as well as children's books in the ship library and movies for children on cabin televisions. On Celebrity Cruises, children can participate in summer stock theater, from operating lighting equipment to performing in shows.
Activities for adults are on the rise, too. Theme cruises, which Norwegian Cruise Line claims to have pioneered in the early 1980's, continue to grow in number and popularity. Norwegian is offering its 16th annual Floating Jazz Festival on two weeklong Caribbean cruises aboard the Norway departing Miami on Oct. 24 and Oct. 31; other sailings will feature country music (Nov. 14), big bands (Nov. 21) and blues (Dec. 12).
Holland America's Westerdam will operate 22 seven-day theme cruises this fall and next year from Fort Lauderdale to the eastern Caribbean. These include a tribute to Frank Sinatra departing Dec. 12 (Sinatra's birthday), and big bands Nov. 14 and 21, Jan. 9 and March 6. The Oct. 24 departure will celebrate Oktoberfest, with beer tastings and oompah and polka music. Bingo's the game on the Nov. 7, Jan. 2 and March 27 cruises, and the Super Bowl will be broadcast live on Jan. 31. That cruise will feature Pro Bowl and Hall of Fame football players.
American Hawaii Cruises' Independence will have marine naturalists aboard all 14 seven-day round-trip whale-watching cruises departing Honolulu every Saturday from Jan. 2 through April 3.
Crystal Cruises themes will range from the cerebral to the gustatory. Writers, artists and editors of The New Yorker magazine will appear on each segment of the Crystal Symphony's 99-day voyage from Los Angeles to Lisbon, beginning Jan. 18. And all eight 12-day San Francisco to Alaska cruises next summer will feature "great chefs of San Francisco." Royal Olympic's Stella Solaris will celebrate theater and cabaret on its 13-day cruise departing from Rio de Janeiro to Manaus, Brazil, and on its 13-day cruise departing from Manaus to Fort Lauderdale. The Royal Viking Sun will offer a murder mystery cruise during its 14-day crossing (May 21) from Miami to Barcelona in which passengers act the role of sleuth and try to collar a killer on the loose among them.
Radisson Seven Seas Cruises is offering six golf cruises through February, during which passengers can play on two to four golf courses per cruise. The first, 10 nights, departing Oct. 15, sails from Rome to Madeira. The Nov. 23 cruise is seven-nights round trip to and from San Juan, Puerto Rico; Nov. 30, seven nights from San Juan to Puerto Limon, Costa Rica; Dec. 7, eight nights from Puerto Limon to Fort Lauderdale; Jan. 17, nine nights from Puerto Caldera, Costa Rica, to Fort Lauderdale, and Feb. 2, 10 nights from Fort Lauderdale to Puerto Caldera.
The reason for the popularity of theme cruises, according to James G. Godsman, president of Cruise Lines International Association, is that they they can fit into busy schedules and "give vacationers the chance to try a new hobby or rekindle interest in an old one, against a backdrop of ever-changing destinations."
Meanwhile, the cruise industry is expanding to new ports of call -- adding variety to itineraries -- and to new home ports. Holland America will use San Diego as a home port for the first time in 1999, when the Statendam makes five 16-day round trips to Hawaii, the first two of which depart March 29 and April 14. Its Nieuw Amsterdam will return to Tampa, Fla., in December 1999 for a series of five 14-day cruises to the southern Caribbean, plus two seven-day holiday cruises. Carnival's Sensation will relocate to Tampa this December for weekly western Caribbean cruises, beginning Dec. 20.
 
CARNIVAL, with the biggest fleet in the industry (12 ships currently, with 2 more scheduled for delivery next year), will be busy on several new fronts in 1999. Its Fascination will operate from Newport News, Va., and Charleston, S.C., with a mix of one-night Cruises to Nowhere and Bahamas trips. Next fall, Carnival's Inspiration will sail a somewhat similar itinerary.
Significantly, the Fascination and Inspiration can each carry 2,040-passengers, suggesting that Carnival has high expectations for them in their new surroundings. When Carnival returns to New York next summer, for its first sailings from the city in five years, it will do so with the Triumph, set for delivery in mid-July. At 2,758 passengers and 102,000 tons, it will be the biggest cruise ship ever to operate from New York.
Cruise ships are vulnerable not only to economic swings but to safety failures as well, despite the industry's exemplary safety record. A survey last June by Wirthlin Worldwide, a research and consulting company in McLean, Va., found that 14 percent of Americans in a nationwide telephone poll of a thousand adults said they intended to spend at least one night on a cruise ship during the coming year. But that plummeted to 7 percent the next month, following the fire aboard the Carnival Ecstasy shortly after it left Miami.
Political change has affected the Wind Star, which will be repositioned in November from the Mediterranean to Costa Rica instead of Southeast Asia as planned. It had been scheduled to operate for five months in Indonesia, according to Richard D. Meadows, vice president of marketing and sales for Windstar Cruises, but unrest in the region -- prompting State Department travel advisories -- hampered the company's ability to market the cruises.
"Our Indonesian itineraries from Bali to Singapore were an integral part of our year-round Southeast Asia program," Mr. Meadows added. "Without these itineraries we think it will be difficult to operate profitably in Southeast Asia on a year-round basis and have decided to move the ship in a different direction."

 BODY:
Azerbaijan is a former soviet republic located in a disagreeable spot just south of Russia and just north of Iran. It is known for nothing except oil, and the smell of that oil is inescapable, even inside the cabin of an arthritic helicopter desperately trying to gain altitude for a trip across the Caspian Sea.
The helicopter, a rusting Soviet Mi-8, seems unable to move forward, which is problematic, because we are already hovering 25 feet above the ground. Our destination, an offshore pumping complex known as Oily Rocks, sits 15 miles away. Azerbaijan Airlines inherited the helicopter from Aeroflot but did not, apparently, inherit spare parts. 
 One of these helicopters recently crashed into an oil platform, initially prompting the president of Azerbaijan's state oil company to turn down my request for a lift. "It would be very embarrassing if foreigners were killed on the way to Oily Rocks," Natig Aliev told me. But I told Aliev I couldn't leave Azerbaijan without seeing Oily Rocks, one of the world's largest offshore oil complexes, a place that would certainly rank as Azerbaijan's greatest tourist attraction if Azerbaijan had tourists. And so the accommodating Aliev lifted the ban, for an afternoon.
After hanging in the air for two minutes, the pilot sets the helicopter back down. Big yellow rings of sweat stain his shirt. He tosses off the last man to climb aboard, and returns to his seat. This time we're off, a single 150-pound oil worker making all the difference.
As we gain altitude, the Apsheron Peninsula spreads out before us. The ground below is brown and cracked dry in the heat. Crippled oil pumps dot the landscape all the way back to the capital city, Baku, which is built on vast reservoirs of oil and gas and is crowded with ornate buildings that date back to the first great oil rush here, more than a century ago.
We fly out over the pale blue Caspian, which is spidered with mean black slicks of oil. Which makes me think of. . . caviar. Just how safe can Caspian beluga be, if the sturgeon swim in light crude?
And then, there it is: Oily Rocks, a Stalinist fabulation of broken-down oil platforms and causeways that stretch past the horizon. Crosshatched streets, 125 miles of them, rest on pylons sunk into the seabed. We touch down on a weedy landing pad and are met by a school bus that will carry us down the causeways that link one platform to another. The state oil company has sent a senior executive, Baba Musayev, to be my official minder. He is a man of about 50, rough-hewed, with rotting teeth and arms tanned the color of plums. There is no place like Oily Rocks in the entire world, he says, and this is true: in the West, oil platforms are built freestanding. "But in the Soviet Union," Musayev says, "steel was cheap and there was a lot of it, so the Soviet mentality said that everything should be linked by road."
Oily Rocks is crumbling; truck-size chunks of it are falling into the sea, and everything is orange with rust. One-third of the 600 wells are inoperative, and miles and miles of causeway have broken apart. The Caspian is rising, and water now laps the second stories of many buildings, even those that house oil workers. These eight-story apartment buildings are a remarkable sight: only the Soviet Union could build slum housing in the middle of the sea.
"We realized that we couldn't sustain this when the market economy came along," Musayev tells me, curling his lip when he says "market economy." We are eating lunch in the cafeteria, fresh greens, white cheese and boiled chicken, served by dour, henna-haired women. A photograph of Azerbaijan's president, Heydar Aliyev, watches us from the wall. It is impossible to avoid Aliyev's image -- or his influence -- anywhere in Azerbaijan.
"Capitalism is only interested in revenue, not in engineering," Musayev continues. And yet he wants to join the market economy he so distrusts. He has already applied for jobs with four Western oil companies. He earns $80 a month, and knows that even drivers for Amoco and Unocal make three or four times that amount.
The Americans are already aboard Oily Rocks, in a limited way. We drive past a yellow-painted facility that shines in the hammering sun. It is a gas-compression facility just built by Pennzoil. "No smoking around here," Musayev says, tossing his cigarette. "American rules."
American rules may soon apply to all of Oily Rocks. The complex, like everything in Azerbaijan, is for sale. The Government is looking for a partner, a Western oil company, that will modernize this mess. It will surely find one, because Baku is overflowing with oilmen. The city stands at the center of the first great oil rush of the 21st century, an oil rush of great consequence for Washington and Moscow, and for a dozen capitals in between.
Scholars who believe that history ended with the collapse of Communism should visit Baku, because in Baku, nothing is settled. Who could predict the future of a country that many in Moscow -- volatile, feverish Moscow -- believe shouldn't be a country at all, but instead a province of a reanimated Russian empire? In Teheran, Azerbaijan is seen as an unforgivable contradiction: a secular Shiite state, a country ripe for Islamization. In 10 years' time, Azerbaijan could be an Islamic state, or a neo-Communist state, or a capitalist democracy, or a capitalist autocracy, or even part of Russia.
Azerbaijan gained its freedom in 1991, but soon lost 15 percent of its territory to Armenia, which humiliated it in a vicious war. Azerbaijanis were killing each other too; the country seemed ungovernable, a failed-state-in-the-making of warlords and gangsters. But in 1993, Heydar Aliyev came back to Baku. He was the former Communist Party boss of Azerbaijan who had gone into self-imposed rural exile, but returned to Baku and exploited the chaos there. His bloodless coup brought a temporary stability.
He also brought with him an idea that insured his country's independence. There has always been oil in Azerbaijan. Centuries ago, the Zoroastrians built their fire temples in the hills of Baku, worshiping the flames that burst from the gas-filled earth. More than 100 years ago, the Nobel brothers and the Rothschilds built fortunes on Baku oil. Then the Soviets came, and closed off Azerbaijan's oil reserves to the West.
It took an ex-K.G.B. general and former Politburo member to open them up again. For Aliyev, oil wasn't only a commodity; it was freedom.
"Oil is our strategy, it is our defense, it is our independence," Aliyev's foreign-policy adviser, Vafa Gulizade, told me. "Iran is dreaming dreams of Azerbaijan, and if the Russians were strong, they would colonize Azerbaijan. But they can't because Aliyev invited the whole world in to watch."
By 1994, the world's major oil companies, with Aliyev's encouragement, were busy developing Azerbaijan's neglected oil wealth. Aliyev's theory was that flag follows trade, and the theory is proving correct: Aliyev has become Washington's man, and Azerbaijan's oil has become an issue of great strategic importance for the United States.
Azerbaijan sits atop as much as 20 billion barrels of oil, which makes its reserves smaller than Kuwait's but about the same size as Nigeria's, from which the United States imports nearly 5 percent of its oil. Azerbaijan may also become the conduit for even more oil and natural gas that will flow from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, on the east side of the Caspian. All told, the Caspian region could be the source of as much as 200 billion barrels of oil. For America, the stakes are enormous.
"The Caspian region will hopefully save us from total dependence
on Middle East oil," says Bill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy and the Administration's point man on the Caspian oil rush. For the oil com-
panies, the opening of the Caspian means access to tens of billions of dollars of oil. Already, Western companies have signed oil contracts totaling $40 billion in Azerbaijan; more than 1,000 American oilmen are making Baku their base, part of an expatriate community numbering at least 4,000. Profits at this early stage, though, are still theoretical, and some companies are having a lousy time of it; a consortium including Pennzoil, for instance, recently spent a great deal of money drilling in the Caspian and came up with no oil.
Aliyev has ladled out much of his oil already, entering his state company into 12 development projects with foreign oil companies, but there is still plenty of oil left to be found. In the race to capture it, the Americans hold the early lead, with the British close behind and the French, Germans, Norwegians, Japanese and Italians all trailing. Even the Russian oil company Lukoil has a presence. Baku is a United Nations of oil, and the jockeying for the most lucrative oil fields is intense. But no more intense than the jockeying between Russia and America, which find themselves in a subterranean and unacknowledged war for primacy in an especially dangerous corner of the earth.
"We have difficulty convincing the Russians that we're not trying to edge them out," Richardson says. "They see the area as their sovereign, virgin territory."
One reason the Americans might have difficulty convincing the Russians that they're not being edged out is because they are being edged out: President Aliyev has already cut favorable deals with American oil companies at the expense of Russian ones. Which is why the Russians don't like it when the Americans start talking about pipelines. The next best thing to controlling the source of the oil is controlling its flow. Some of Azerbaijan's oil already flows north to Russia through a small pipeline; another small pipeline is being built to Georgia. But an international consortium of oil companies is scheduled to recommend a route for a main export pipeline later this month that could eventually move one million barrels of oil daily. Russia wants the pipeline to run through its territory but the United States wants it to run west, through Georgia and into Turkey, a NATO ally. Iran, too, would like to have a pipeline, but that won't happen as long as the United States says it won't happen.
The competition for all this oil means that Baku is filled with intrigue and the fear of instability. Last month, Aliyev's police and opposition demonstrators fought street skirmishes in advance of the national election to be held next week. President Aliyev has been the object of three, or four, or five assassination attempts in the last several years (his intelligence chief counted six for me, though two sounded more like wishful thinking than executable plots), and his ally to the west, Georgia's Eduard Shevardnadze, is also a semiregular target of assassins. It is believed throughout the Caucasus that the assassins are dispatched by Russian nationalists who have not accepted the death of their empire. Russia's current meltdown has only heightened the fear in Baku and Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, that Russian hard-liners will be trying even more enthusiastically to pull Azerbaijan and Georgia back into Moscow's orbit.
Assassins are only occasional visitors to Baku, but the city is rampant with ham-handed Russian spies, as well as Turkish gangsters (known for their proud display of chest hair), black-eyed Chechen revolutionaries, paranoid American diplomats, fanatical Iranian terrorists and financial speculators of various nationalities, drawn to Baku because it is a frontier of global capitalism.
Before I left for Baku, I was inundated with propaganda from the oil companies and from Azerbaijan's lobbyists in Washington, assuring me that Azerbaijan is a lighthouse of stability, a pro-American redoubt and a place ready to do business in the community of Western nations. Most of all, they said, it is a place whose shining future, under the leadership of Heydar Aliyev, is assured.
Whether or not that's true, Baku is a fine place to watch the future of capitalism unfold. The Caspian oil rush is a reminder that not all commerce in the future will be carried out antiseptically over the Internet, that the ethereal talk of globalization means little to men who have to drill for oil and then physically move that oil across dangerous territory. Here, the old verities apply. At least in this corner of the globe, 21st-century capitalism looks very much like 19th-century capitalism. Baku is a city of the artfully delivered bribe and the brute shakedown, of florid corruption and baroque greed.
The helicopter manages to return us safely ashore, and a rickety van collects us for the return trip to town.
Baku today is a run-down city in need of a thorough dusting, but there are signs of new wealth: construction cranes fill the sky and satellite dishes sprout from apartment windows. Of course, the oil money is still just a trickle, and the people of Azerbaijan, two-thirds of whom live in poverty, are said to be unmoved by the Government's promises to lift living standards. Out in the countryside, far from the oil fields, almost a million refugees from the disastrous war with Armenia scratch by in abandoned rail cars and corrugated tin huts. But a paper-thin layer of Baku society is housing itself in limestone palaces built high above the sea.
I am let out at the Hyatt Regency, which is where the new rich come to play, and where the oilmen congregate. Downtown, by the sea, are the expatriate bars, filled with platform workers and marginal players. Poolside at the Hyatt, though, is where deals get done, and where, I was to learn, spies do their spying.
I return to my room to wash the sheen of oil off me, but I'm interrupted by a knock at the door. It is a man in uniform who announces, "The Minister of Defense would like to see you."
Things like this happen in Baku.
"When?" I ask.
"The car is waiting," he says.
We are driven to the defense headquarters, the onetime home of the Soviet Army's southern flank commander.
I am led up a marble staircase and into the Minister's suite. A relief map of the Caucasus, the Middle East and Central Asia stretches the entire length of the wall. The map is a graphic reminder of just how perilous his neighborhood is.
The Minister, Safar Abiyev, is in uniform and greets me coolly. "How did you enjoy Oily Rocks?" he asks, though I hadn't mentioned my visit to him.
He says he's heard I've been asking questions about Iranians and Armenians and he thinks there are some things I should know. This is hardly unusual -- every one in Baku seems to know what everyone else is asking about.
We talk for a moment at his desk, on which sit 12 telephones. Then he orders me to the map.
"Here," he says, using a pointer to locate the Armenian capital, Yerevan. "Here is the location of the Armenian nuclear power plant. They are shipping nuclear fuel from here" -- he traces a line across the map -- "to here." He points to Teheran. The Azerbaijanis believe the Armenians capable of nearly anything. They would blame
Armenia for the collapse of the Japanese economy if they thought the charge would stick. It is true that Armenia cooperates with Iran, but Abiyev would offer no particulars about nuclear cooperation, and American security officials couldn't shore up his accusation.
Standing at the map, I point Abiyev to another line, the one running from Baku to Tbilisi. It is the path where a small oil pipeline is under construction, the same path the main pipeline will most likely follow. The route runs close to Armenia, and to Azerbaijani territory occupied by the forces of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian stronghold in the middle of Azerbaijan. There is much concern among oilmen that Azerbaijan won't be able to protect the pipelines from the Armenians, who so far have derived no benefit from the oil boom.
It is important, of course, that the Government of Azerbaijan -- and the Governments of Georgia and Turkey, too -- assure the oil companies that the pipeline will be secure. "I don't think they will be capable of cutting the pipeline off," Abiyev says, referring to the Armenians. "We could stop them." And with that, the Defense Minister signals that the command interview is over. He rises, presents me with his best wishes and a lovely decorative rug.
i T is not the rug I would have chosen. The rug I really admire is hanging in a saunalike waiting room in the old K.G.B. headquarters. President Aliyev's image is woven into its center, but the weaver fattened Aliyev's face and darkened his eyebrows, making him look like Brezhnev.
I have time to admire the subtlety of the weave because the Minister of National Security, Namik Abbasov, keeps me in his sweltering, moldy waiting room for a half hour. It seems almost too obvious, but I think he likes to make his visitors sweat before he sees them.
The door opens, and I am invited inside. Abbasov is built like a block of ice: he is a man of serious poundage, and his hair is cropped short. A former K.G.B. colonel, he now directs Azerbaijan's intelligence apparatus.
Abbasov's office is decorated simply, and there only eight telephones on his desk, which makes him, by one method of calculation, four telephones less important than the Minister of Defense.
Before the interview can begin, Abbasov is interrupted by a telephone call from the President, who wants to know why the American Embassy here just warned its citizens to beware of "anti-U.S. elements" in Azerbaijan. This warning is a matter of some importance to Azerbaijan, because much here depends on the Americans and their money; the hundreds of American oilmen in Baku must be kept safe and unworried.
After he hangs up, Abbasov says he has no idea why such a warning would be issued. He asks me if I feel safe in Baku. I answer yes -- after all, authoritarian rulers like Aliyev certainly do know how to keep the streets quiet -- and this gives Abbasov an idea. "Maybe you'll go on Azerbaijan television and say this," he says. I panic at the thought of flacking for Aliyev, but we are interrupted by the ringing of yet another of Abbasov's phones, and the subject is dropped. As it turns out, Abbasov consults with Azerbaijani TV daily, to help shape its coverage.
A democracy Azerbaijan is not, but it is, reliably, a friend of America's, and this is the point Abbasov makes at length. His country is crawling with spies who do not have America's interests -- or Azerbaijan's interests -- at heart. What worries Abbasov right now is cooperation between Moscow and Teheran. Last March, he says, an Iranian truck carrying steel for use in the construction of ballistic missiles was stopped at Astara, a town on the Azerbaijan-Iran border. Abbasov tells the story:
"We got information from Russian territory that there was a cargo of radioactive material moving to Astara. I am not prepared to tell you whom we got the information from. With this information we stopped the truck and confiscated the material. The Russian Government is denying the existence of the cargo, but I know that the cargo was loaded in and around Moscow. We called our American counterparts, and samples of the seized material are now in America. The driver was arrested, but he didn't know anything. Would you like the license-plate number of the truck?"
He tells me the license-plate number. I'm not sure what I'll do with it, but I write it down in a serious manner. "This is the first time we captured such material," Abbasov says. "There was a previous incident in '96. There was a boat on the Caspian. Radiation was detected, but we reacted late and couldn't intercept before the boat entered Iranian waters."
I ask him if he felt the Americans were grateful for the interception of the truck. "Yes, of course," he answers, "but we are doing this for ourselves. Their missiles couldn't reach America, but they could reach Azerbaijan."
There is another sort of spy, Abbasov tells me later, that he doesn't worry about as much. These spies also want a piece of Azerbaijan, but these are the pieces that Azerbaijan is eager to sell. These are the industrial spies, who work on their countries' business interests, trying to learn which oil company is up and which is down.
"Every intelligence organization is attempting to get the upper hand for their oil interests," he says. "It is a natural process. We wouldn't apprehend these officers because it is a natural thing they are doing."
Where are they doing this spying?
"In Baku."
At the Hyatt?
"We see a lot of suspicious people around the Hyatt," he says.
I invite him for a drink by the pool.
"Oh, I never go to the Hyatt," he says, smiling.
Twilight one weekday by the pool at the Hyatt, and the tables are filling up. I am sitting with one of the owners of the hotel, an Iranian exile named Parviz Amir-Parviz -- "everyone calls me Parv" -- who is educating me on the subject of corruption. He is a voluble entrepreneur, the biggest taxpayer in Azerbaijan and President Aliyev's tutor on the subject of capitalism. He is also known to pay out the occasional bribe.
"I don't pay bribes to ministers," he explains to me. "When I send my guys to the various ministries, I tell them, bribe the low-level guys. Bribe this guy 10 bucks, bribe that guy 20 bucks. But not the ministers. Bribes were the basis of the Soviet system. You can't change the place overnight."
Parviz is lucky in that he is publicly associated with the President. He is generally avoided by the shakedown men drawn to foreign businessmen like flies to fruit. "The President never told anyone, 'Protect this hotel, protect Parviz.' But remember, he comes here once, twice, four times a month for receptions and parties. The officials see that, and so they don't come here for the shakedown."
What about Aliyev? Is he a shakedown artist, too?
"No way," he says. "The old man's not dirty himself -- when you're the Shah, why do you need money?"
Parviz has faith that Aliyev is clean enough -- and tough enough -- to fix Azerbaijan's problems.
"Yeah, he's a dictator, but so what? It's like with Pinochet. He fixed the economy, made the streets safe, made sure everyone had bread to eat. Now they say that Pinochet was dirty, that children are missing. Well, sometimes children have to go missing when you're cleaning up a country."
We are seated under an umbrella facing the pool. It is dinnertime, and the secret business of Baku is being conducted before our eyes. "See those guys," Parviz says, pointing to a group of severe-looking men talking softly among themselves. "They're from the I.M.F. They just came back from the President, telling him to kick all the corrupt guys out, shrink the work force. But the President knows he can't do that. I've talked to the old man, and he says if he does that, he'll have anarchy. Imagine 10,000 cops out of work. These guys will go out and form political parties and create chaos."
One table over, the Israeli Ambassador entertains a group of businessmen, an armed security agent sitting nearby -- it drives Iran mad to see an Israeli ambassador in this Shiite country. At other tables ringing the pool sit the men from Amoco and the men from the French oil company, Total. Though as many as two-thirds of Azerbaijan's oil fields have already been divvied up, there are still fields to be bought, and oil-company geologists are searching land and sea for hidden deposits. This is what the spies are after -- who's drilling where, who's finding what and who's striking the best deals with Aliyev's Government.
It is an exciting night at the Hyatt, because the man who created the most successful consortium for Aliyev, a man jokingly known as Terry of the Caucasus, is back in town, and poolside. Terry Adams is a legendary figure, a Welsh giant -- he stands a head and a half taller than most Azerbaijanis -- who once worked for British Petroleum. In this place where connections are everything, Adams's name seems to open every door.
Rob Sobhani, an American oil consultant, has joined us at our table. He is an American of Iranian descent who has unparalleled access to Baku's ruling elite. He's eyeing the men from Total, the French company that does a great deal of business in Teheran. Washington, of course, says that oilmen who are eager to do business with Iran -- including Terry Adams and the men from Total -- are not acting in the West's best interests.
"Watch the guys from Total," he whispers. "There they go." The Total executives line up to greet Adams, practically kissing his ring. Adams, like most oilmen, believes that America's unilateral ban on trade with Iran is illogical. If it wasn't for that ban, the main export pipeline from Baku could be built at cheap cost through Iran and to the Persian Gulf. "On a map, Iran looks like one of the easier ways to get it out," Adams tells me later, a half-smile on his face.
Just then, a strange-looking character with a cell phone and a handlebar mustache walks by.
I ask who he is, and am told he is from the Minaret Group, an international finance company owned by a man named Viktor Kozeny, a Czech who is not particularly welcome in his own country. Kozeny buys up privatization vouchers, the shares in state-owned companies distributed to the citizens in post-Communist states. There is a good deal of suspicion about Minaret's activities -- Abbasov, the Azerbaijani intelligence chief, told me that he has "serious doubts about what Minaret is doing here -- they're a real threat."
Parviz tells me he has no problem with men like Kozeny. "Everybody's a speculator here," he says. "Anything that is speculative is scary. Nothing is institutionalized, nothing is regulated. That's just the sort of place it is. But there's a lot of money to be made here."
Unless you're not connected. There is a terrible price to pay if you have no connections. It is preferably paid with a large number of $100 bills, several businessmen whispered to me.
In my search for someone who could explain just how things work, one diplomat in the capital told me to ask a simple question: Why is there no mafia in Azerbaijan?
It's a good question. In many of the countries of the former Soviet Union -- Russia chief among them -- the mafia presence is obvious. In Tbilisi, I went one night to a mafia hangout, a jazz club in the basement of a refugee hotel that seemed a Georgian version of a Chicago speakeasy: mobsters in black, guns bulging at their waistbands, and women who could only be described as mafia molls, lipsticked and haughty.
But in Baku, I couldn't find the equivalent. There's the Mozaic disco, by the waterfront, where I watched a Turkish gangster talking on his cell phone while pressing his hips up against his standoffish Russian girlfriend, but the Mozaic hardly resembles a Gambino family nightclub.
So where's the mob?
For the answer, I turned to an expert, a leader of the Chechen mafia. Chechnya, the breakaway Russian republic, sits north of Azerbaijan. The slight and frightening man I had arranged to meet, Khozh-Ahmed Noukhaev, is typical of the sort of person who washes up in Baku, someone entranced by the transformative power of oil money. Over tea in the darkened bar of the Europe Hotel, he tells me about his own transformation. Ten years ago, he was a shakedown artist in Moscow; today he is president of something called the Caucasus Common Market, which he claims will build a trading league to concentrate the power of the Caucasus states and make them independent of Moscow. Oh, and make money, too.
His deputy, a Polish Catholic-turned-Sufi Muslim, says Noukhaev is keen to sell his services to the oil companies. He can protect their oil like no else, he says. Noukhaev's past suggests why.
"The Chechen mafia is different from any other mafia," Noukhaev tells me. It is late and the bartender would like to go home, but he does not care to disrupt Noukhaev, who has two bodyguards. Noukhaev is dressed in black and carries a gold-tipped cane; he was wounded during the Russian siege of Grozny, the Chechen capital.
"My business was to protect Chechen businessmen from Russian businessmen," he says. "At first, I had to suggest this protection with rough actions. I would put it to Russian businessmen to take Chechen partners. This would help Chechen businesses to grow, but it also helped the Russian businessmen, because now they had an extra partner."
I asked him if he killed people in the course of business. "I don't know of any cases in which I killed people," he replied. For many years in prison I had to defend myself, but killing isn't killing if you're protecting yourself."
It seemed like an obvious question, so I asked him: Why doesn't he offer his services to Western companies struggling against corruption in Baku?
It could be a growth industry, the protection of Western businessmen. Azerbaijan is the intersection where Soviet efficiency and Ottoman integrity meet, and doing business here can try the soul, the bank account and the patience of the Western ambassadors who regularly intercede on behalf of their countrymen's business interests.
Not all businessmen, of course, feel their pockets being picked. Aliyev protects the most important foreign investors -- the oil companies -- from the sort of petty corruption that infects most of Azerbaijani society: the traffic stop that turns into a demand for cash, the customs official who needs money for his sick mother, and by the way, you didn't need us to release your shipment this year, did you?
"The President personally hears the oil companies' complaints," Vafa Gulizade, Aliyev's foreign-policy adviser, told me. But even the oil companies find themselves handing out "scholarships" and "consultancies" at a generous clip. And the sons of the country's leaders often end up in the employ of American oil companies.
But this is nothing compared with what those outside the oil industry feel. Those who sell financial services or consumer products operate without direct Presidential protection, and suffer for it. In my search for a Westerner who could explain the way business is really done, I kept stumbling across the name Glogowski. But Glogowski -- Antos Glogowski, a British financier -- had made himself scarce from Baku. The climate wasn't right for him just then. Only later did I track him down -- in Palm Beach.
Glogowski is the president of AJG Investments, a firm that, like Minaret, buys privatization vouchers. He was doing a good job of it, too, until the day in May when agents of the Azerbaijan Interior Ministry raided his offices, seizing $30 million worth of vouchers and threatening his employees with arrest.
"I'm not sure why this happened," he told me. "We are operating legally in Azerbaijan, so this came as a surprise."
I had heard in Baku that for a price of $500,000, Interior Ministry agents were willing to return Glogowski's vouchers, but he wouldn't comment on that. "AJG has taken the decision to resolve this by legal means only," he said carefully.
After months of pleading with Aliyev's privatization czars, Glogowski got back his vouchers, but says he's still got problems in Baku. "What you're seeing played out in Azerbaijan is the new school versus the old school," he says. "The new school wants to make it a friendly environment for foreign investment. The old school has other priorities. We're caught in the crossfire."
For problems like Glogowski's, Noukhaev suggests to me before we finally leave the bar, the methods of the Chechen mafia are no solution.
"What is happening to them is a kind of crime that I cannot stop using our methods," he says. "When corruption comes from the state, I can't protect foreign businesses from that. Not when the state is the mafia."
This does not necessarily mean that Heydar Aliyev is the Caucasus version of John Gotti. He is much smarter, for one thing. Those interested in seeing Aliyev remain in power -- the American Government included -- do not see Aliyev as a thief. His ally in Tbilisi, Eduard Shevardnadze, calls Aliyev "one of the pioneers in the fight against corruption in the Soviet Union," which is the opposite of the truth, but Shevardnadze's life depends in part on Aliyev also staying alive and in power.
Before reimagining himself as an Azerbaijani nationalist, Aliyev was the leading Azerbaijani Communist and the fourth-ranking leader in the Soviet Union during the Brezhnev era. Aliyev was an elaborate flatterer, showering Brezhnev with gifts. Brezhnev's demise -- and Gorbachev's rise -- meant Aliyev's end too. Aliyev, like many regional Communist bosses, had a reputation for ostentatious corruption -- and Gorbachev's men, eager to rid themselves of leaders whom David Remnick, in his book "Lenin's Tomb," calls "mafia sultans," capitalized on this reputation to good effect. Aliyev was a broken man in the last days of the empire.
But then came the second act. Aliyev managed to pull himself out of the dustbin of history, brush himself off and assume the Presidency of an independent and chaotic Azerbaijan. He promised to end his country's war with Armenia and he did; he promised to restore law and order to Baku's deadly streets and he did. He was able to do this because ex-K.G.B. generals understand how to seize and maintain control. "He's a real cool cat," says an admiring Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former Carter Administration national security adviser who now advises Amoco on Caspian issues.
Next week, Aliyev is up for re-election -- which is an inexact term, since he didn't wait for the people's approval before assuming power in 1993. The following year, he "legitimized" his rule in an election that saw him win 99 percent of the vote.
"I'm always telling him not to campaign too hard, because if he gets more than 65 or 70 percent of the vote, the Americans might think it's suspicious," Gulizade, the foreign-policy adviser, tells me over dinner one night in a Turkish restaurant. The restaurant is part of an "entertainment center" built for the idle children of the new rich. It includes an indoor swimming pool and a computerized bowling alley. As we walk in, we pass a woman dressed in a manner that would get her stoned in Teheran. "Call girls and bowling," Gulizade says whimsically. "All under one roof."
In Soviet times, Gulizade was a senior diplomat; he made his mark running the air bridge that resupplied the Egyptians during the Yom Kippur War. That, of course, was then. Now: "I've always admired the Jews," he says. As Aliyev's foreign-policy adviser, he is charged with maintaining good relations with the West, including Israel. Six months ago, in fact, he had bypass surgery in Israel, and tonight we are celebrating the half-year mark with vodka and caviar. "Vodka is the one good thing the Russians gave us," he says. Gulizade is a raconteur, and he tells me about President Aliyev: "President Aliyev is very much like President Clinton. When President Aliyev was younger, he had the same problem Clinton had, with women. But Aliyev was a K.G.B. general, so he knew how to run a conspiracy to keep things silent."
Late in the evening, we leave the entertainment center. Gulizade is at the wheel, unsteadily. Baku is quiet. Since President Aliyev's morality campaign began in February, many of the city's nightspots have been shuttered. "These casinos and bars weren't in keeping with traditional Azerbaijan culture, so the President closed them," he says. "You know, though, you can still get anything in Baku. It's just underground."
Later, I asked a diplomat if the casinos were really shut down to protect Azerbaijani honor. Of course not, he said. The story going around Baku is that they were shut down to keep the President's relatives from losing money to the Turkish mafia, which had a piece of the casinos. But that story was wrong, the diplomat said. The real reason is this: "If you're planning to overthrow a government in this region, you've got to spread money around to the plotters. The secret police are everywhere, and this money would be noticed. But if these plotters just happen to win the money in the casino, well, then, that's luck. Shut the casinos, and you shut off the revolution."
It is impossible to know if this is true, because, like most everything in Baku, only one man knows why Heydar Aliyev does what he does, and that's Heydar Aliyev.
For the man who is the maestro of the Caspian oil rush, Aliyev has a suspiciously modest office. It sits high up in the building that houses the Presidential Apparat, overlooking Baku harbor. The carpets are curling, and it is as dimly lighted as an Intourist hotel.
As I wait for my interview with Aliyev, which will be videotaped by the presidential videographer for possible showing on the evening news -- which is essentially All Aliyev, All the Time -- I scan the shelves in his outer office for reading material. Most of the books celebrate the perspicacity of Heydar Aliyev. One is a hardcover published by the Government to commemorate Aliyev's visit to America last year. Like the other oil chieftains of the post-Soviet states that ring the Caspian, Aliyev was treated to the high honor of an official Washington visit. The book is 415 pages long and contained, when I stopped counting, 143 photographs of Aliyev. It also featured a photograph of a rug woven in the image of Chelsea Clinton which was presented to her father.
I am finally escorted into the meeting room, where I am shown the best place to stand in order to greet the President properly. It is quietly suggested that I flatter the President at the outset of the interview, as he is fond of sycophancy.
He comes in, hits his mark and shakes my hand while looking into the camera. We settle in around an oversize table. He is 75 years old, a natty dresser, perfectly shaven and expertly manicured. He wears the satisfied look of a man who has outlasted many enemies. But some of his enemies are persistent, and I ask him why so many people want him dead.
"The people who want to see my demise are those who want to come to power by force," he says. "Of course, in many cases, these attempts grow from other countries."
Aliyev catalogues for me his frequent close calls: "I escaped death several times. They've even tried to shoot down my airplane with a rocket. In August of '93, a young Turkish student was going to assassinate me with a sniper rifle. In March of '95, the special forces of the Interior Ministry tried to take power by force. They also planned to kill me. Later they tried to blow up the bridge on the way to the airport in order to kill me, but we stopped this."
He is imperturbable, and this extends to his behavior during the interview. It is quite obvious that his staff lives in fear of him; his translator quakes when relaying unflattering questions, though Aliyev has surely heard them before. Such as: How can an ex-K.G.B. general lead his country to Western-style democracy?
"It is true that I was a general of the K.G.B., and I am proud that, as an Azerbaijani, I gained the post of K.G.B. general," he tells me. "But a person always gets better."
How do you respond to the accusation that Azerbaijan is brimming over with corruption that might threaten the future of your country?
Smoothly, of course: "Corruption is very characteristic of the countries of the former Soviet Union," he says. "But you have corruption in your country. In America, though, you have kind of legalized it. Maybe when we reach the same level as the United States, then we can officially make corruption legal."
What sort of corruption do you see in America?
"I ask Congressmen why they have such close relations with Armenia, and they say that the Armenian Diaspora gives them a lot of money. Is that corruption or not?"
The Azerbaijanis are bitter about Armenian power in Washington, and it is true that the Armenian lobby has pulled off a neat trick: Armenia occupies Azerbaijani territory, and yet it is Azerbaijan that, by Congressional fiat, cannot receive direct American aid. Aliyev perorates on the subject for a while, until we are a safe distance from my original question. He is unwilling to discuss corruption this close to the election.
I ask Aliyev if I can tag along as he campaigns. He gives me a surprised look, as if to suggest that a sultan need not campaign. He tells me he does not get out much these days, but when he does, "thousands of people gather to applaud me."
The conversation turns to the subject of democracy, and, like all autocrats, he pleads for time. "No one was born a democrat in this country, including myself," he says. "This is not your country. Maybe if we establish conditions of democracy, my grandson will have democracy."
Anyway, it is stability, not democracy, that interests the oil companies. I ask Aliyev whether the Armenians or the Russians might sabotage his pipeline. "The pipeline is not just Azerbaijan's pipeline," he says, smiling at his cleverness. "It will be built by Western companies, and their Governments will have an interest in keeping the pipeline safe."
Aliyev gives the impression of calm, which has assured the West that Azerbaijan is in capable hands. But a 75-year-old man who is the frequent target of assassins and has no obvious successor may not be the surest bet. His country is surrounded by enemies, his army is weak and there is no ironclad guarantee that the oil beneath his sea will ever make it to the West. A drive to Tbilisi that tracks the "early oil" pipeline proves that.
The front-line commander, an acne-scarred lieutenant, is wearing flip-flops where his boots should be. I've driven with my translator to a tiny village on the border with Armenia, 200 miles west of Baku, and this unimpressive officer has put an end to our trip. Drive 20 yards farther, he says, and you'll be shot -- by them, not us.
For several hours, we have been following the western pipeline route. The early-oil pipeline, now under construction, will run near here, just skirting Armenia as it makes its way out of Azerbaijan and into Georgia. Armenian extremists have made noises about interrupting the flow of oil out of Azerbaijan, and since the Armenians have a far more effective army than the Azerbaijanis, these threats are not taken as idle.
I ask the lieutenant where the Armenians are, and he points to an electrical tower about 100 yards away. "There," he says. "And there," pointing to a hill behind a half-destroyed house. I ask if we could walk up to the barbed-wire emplacement that marks the end of the road. "If they see you," he says, "they'll definitely shoot."
The forces of Armenia and Azerbaijan, technically in the fifth year of a cease-fire, manage to shoot across the line virtually every day. But it is very quiet on this road when we arrive. There are a few civilians about, and the braying of a donkey is the loudest noise we hear.
I ask the lieutenant if he believes the Armenians are capable of seizing the land through which the early-oil pipeline will run. He looks confused. "I don't know about a pipeline."
The pipeline, the one they're building a few kilometers from here.
"I don't know anything about it," he says. "How will this affect our conflict with the Armenians?"
The lieutenant watches me write down his answers in my notebook. "You write with your left hand," he says. "I've never seen that." Neither have any of his men.
Just then, shots are fired over the hill. We hustle behind a concrete wall. I ask the lieutenant if he's going to order his men to shoot back.
"No. If we do that, the Armenians will shoot until tomorrow morning," he says, defeated.
It is not a very heartening performance, particularly if you're an oilman whose career depends not only on finding crude beneath the Caspian Sea but also on moving it safely and cheaply across hundreds of miles of unstable territory. Even in an era of high-tech capitalism, there aren't many shortcuts in the oil business. But here, in a place America hopes will help solve its Persian Gulf problem, the fragility of the oil business is particularly apparent. Success depends on the cooperation, or at least the acquiescence, of Russians and Chechens, Iranians and Armenians, and the fortunes of an aging autocrat and a dispirited lieutenant who has no idea how important oil is to his country.
As we drive out of range of Armenian snipers, we pass a bus shelter that has painted on it a portrait of Heydar Aliyev. The slogan underneath reads, "Together to the Future," and I think that the future is not nearly as hopeful as Heydar Aliyev believes it will be, and not nearly as secure as the oil companies -- and Washington -- need it to be.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Dr. Zelle Andrews;
A Champion of Rights on Three Fronts

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
FEMINIST, gay rights advocate, elderly American -- are just three of many epitaphs that Dr. Zelle Andrews carries, just three of the groups on whose behalf she fights. Dr. Andrews, a resident of New Rochelle, former president of the New York State Chapter of the National Organization for Women, was recently named Woman of the Year by the Women's Equality Day Committee, a coalition of various county organizations that works on behalf of women.
Dr. Andrews, who has her doctorate in history, is the County Executive's liaison to the gay and lesbian community. 
 When Dr. Andrews travels to meetings around the United States, many of those she encounters find it incredible that it is a job, originally part time, that was created by a Republican-Conservative, former County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, in 1994. It is now a full-time job in the administration of the current County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Dr. Andrews:
Q. Is Westchester a tolerant place, relatively speaking, for gays and lesbians?
A. Clearly. We are so fortunate here, it's unbelievable. I go to national conferences and people ask what I do and I tell them and they're shocked; you are paid to do this? I think that Andy O'Rourke did a very courageous thing. He does, after all, have a very conservative constituency whose interests he needed to pay attention to. I also think in other parts of the country, particularly in the South and Southwest, he might not have been able to get away with it. Long before he did this he had taken an active role in AIDS issues. He has come around to being pro-choice, though it took him some time.
Having said all that, it's really a mixed bag for gays here in Westchester. We don't have a sexual orientation nondiscrimination bill. We don't have domestic partner health benefits, although provision for this is in a proposed contract with the county government's largest employees unions. These are things that really make a difference. Other counties have a sexual orientation nondiscrimination law.
Q. What are the duties of your office?
A. I have a responsibility to bring to the lesbian and gay community information about the services that are available through the county and ways in which they, as taxpaying citizens, can take advantage of them. I also have a responsibility to bring to county agencies the needs of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community to make sure that in the delivery of those services they are included.
Let me give you some idea of what we're dealing with. We have a population of almost 900,000 people in Westchester. Approximately 650,000 of those are older than 18. We really don't know how many gay people are out there, because you can't find these folks unless they're ready to tell. But let's use Dr. Kinsey's estimate of 10 percent -- some people believe this is an underestimate, some an overestimate -- that would mean there would be more than 60,000 gay and lesbian people in the county older than 18. And of those 650,000 who are older than 18, 170,000 are older than 65. This is a group of people I'm particularly interested in since I'm over 65. That means there are 17,000 gays and lesbians who are over 65. So you have a tremendous group of people who have reason to need county services, particularly from the County Office for the Aging, the Departments of Social Services and Health and others. All the hospitals need to know that they have gay and lesbian clients, and businesses need to know. We have a major center of international corporations here and national corporations, some of whom have active gay and lesbian caucuses. Many of them do not.
Q. You are a feminist; you are gay. Sometimes the women's movement has had trouble with the two causes being linked. What is you reaction?
A. That's not my primary concern. My major concern is that many women, mature and young, do not get feminism. There is such a horrendous backlash. There are still people my age and younger who say, I'm not a feminist, but. . . . And then they'll spiel off all the things that they do believe in which are precisely what feminism has been advocating since Day 1. There is a real lack of understanding about what feminism is and what it is not. It's going to take us a long time. Feminism is a very profound set of revolutionary notions that completely disrupts every established relationship from the economic to the political to the personal to the global.
The issue of feminism and gay rights got settled a long time ago as far as I'm concerned way back in the late 1960's -- for about five or six years, maybe longer -- when Betty Friedan and others were talking with NOW about the "lavender menace," and the Manhattan chapter made life very uncomfortable for certain openly gay feminists. Those women castigated NOW for being homophobic and unwelcoming of lesbians, and in those early days there was a lot of discomfort. I wasn't aware at the time I was gay, but we were booing Betty off the platform. And NOW has been at the forefront for decades about the connection between the control of women and using lesbianism to control us. If you deviate in any way from a very prescribed, very traditional feminine role, then you must be a lesbian. So we began to work out an understanding of how that kind of stereotyping was damaging all women. From that came an acceptance from the active feminist community.
Q. What made you a feminist?
A. No. 1 was a very strong mother, who was born before her time. She was right in between the end of the first wave of feminism and the second wave and valiantly carried on in her own life as best she could her own ideals of the importance of all kinds of social-justice issues. My father was also involved in political issues. He was the head of what was a hospital for the chronically ill, aged and infirm in the days when disability issues were totally hidden in the 1930's and 1940's. My mother was also an early conservationist. They were both very committed to their Christian faith as well, and as far as they were concerned this was part and parcel of the social justice message that they got through Christianity.
But that's not what turned me on to feminism. It just set me up to be receptive. What really turned me on was that when I got married I happened to marry my boss at Harvard Business School and was told by the dean in advance that this wasn't going to be a problem, that we had different kinds of jobs. But when we came home from our wedding trip, there was a letter it the mail saying, Sorry, she's out of here. I felt like we had been betrayed. I had no way of figuring out what to do with myself. It was horrible; it was absolutely horrible. I had lost my job because I was a woman and had gotten married.
Q. How long were you married?
A. I'm still married, and it's perfectly all right for you to say that. I left the relationship in 1977. But my husband and I have been on good terms: we're kind of like brother and sister. And he has always been very supportive of my efforts and activities.
Q. Was coming out hard?
A. Oh, terrible. It was prolonged; it was painful. We're talking somewhere in my mid-30's, which was fairly late.
It was a result of my exposure to this issue through my active work in NOW. I went from co-founding the Honolulu chapter back in 1968, to being on the Hawaii State Commission on the Status of Women. And then when I moved back to the mainland I got involved in the Southern Westchester Chapter and moved up through the ranks, became president of the Westchester chapter, then president of the state organization and then on the national board.
I was totally immersed.
Q. You did not realize you were gay?
A. I had no idea. And then little by little, little by little, I began to connect the dots about myself. I began to see the pattern and say, this was me. Coming out was very episodic. It took me about 10 years to be able to be out in certain venues. Fortunately, in that regard, my parents were dead, so I didn't have the excruciating issue of telling my parents. My parents would have been horrified. First, I began telling some people in private. I would say it wasn't until I became co-chairman of the Loft around 1992 that I was willing to go public as a gay person. And nowadays, the minute I say what I do I out myself. Sometimes I sort of gauge the situation. If I'm not sure, I just say I work for the County Executive.

HEADLINE: A New Battle Plan to Fight Pollution

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
WHO is at fault? It is a question often asked after an environmental spill or another type of accident. Should a faceless corporation be required to pay a fine that it can easily afford and then pass along the cost to its customers? Or should the blame be placed elsewhere -- say on a company vice president who turned a blind eye to violations or an employee who threw the wrong switch?
This summer, after 122 million gallons of unchlorinated sewage rushed into the Hudson River from the Yonkers Joint Treatment Works, fouling sections of the giant waterway and causing two beaches to close, the superintendent of the plant was charged by the District Attorney's Office with a criminal offense -- a knowing violation of a state pollutant discharge elimination system permit, which is a felony. 
 The superintendent, Kenneth Grauer, a 25-year employee of the county, faces up to four years in jail, if convicted. But his lawyer claims that his client has become the scapegoat of a system that must place the blame somewhere.
The arrest of Mr. Grauer, 49, in August by District Attorney Jeanine Pirro's Environmental Crimes Bureau marks a new trend in recent years: holding people criminally responsible for environmental violations. The complaint contends that even though Mr. Grauer was alerted to the failure of the plant's chlorination system on July 13, he did not take steps to limit the discharge until the next day. For now, he is suspended without pay until the charges are resolved.
His case is not unusual. Throughout the United States, not only are corporations paying heavy fines but company executives and employees who are found responsible for crimes against the environment are also facing time behind bars.
"Companies are just low-hanging fruit," said Earl E. Devaney, director of criminal enforcement in the forensics and training division of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. "It's time to pierce the corporate veil and go for the individual."
Mr. Devaney said that large companies can often absorb even heavy penalties but that when corporate executives, plant supervisors and other employees are arrested, the charges serve as a greater deterrent to future crimes. "It's one thing to have fines levied on your company," he said. "It's considered to be the cost of doing business, but it's another thing to have to tell your pals at the country club that you're going to the slammer for 15 years."
Take, for example, the case of George E. Betts, president of Lam Pine, a company in LaGrande, Ore., who was sentenced on May 18 in Federal District Court in Boise, Idaho, to pay $163,177 to the protection agency's superfund. The court also sentenced Mr. Betts to six months in prison. He was convicted of being involved in the illegal transportation of more than 230 55-gallon drums of paint and solvent wastes to another plant he owned in Payette, Idaho.
"I rejected the notion that these were just good people doing bad things," said Mr. Devaney, a former special agent in charge of fraud for the Secret Service. "They had the same motivations as other white-collar criminals -- lying, stealing and cheating. They knew the violations were crimes, and they went and did it anyway." Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the director of the Environmental Litigation Clinic at Pace University in White Plains, said Congress "has passed all these wonderful environmental laws since 1970" but the public will not benefit unless the Government continues to take a hard line with polluters. The Clean Water Act was adopted 26 years ago.
On May 21, 1997, in Federal District Court in Anchorage, Edward Hanousek, a supervisor for the White Pass & Yukon Railroad, was sentenced to serve six months in prison and six months in a halfway house and also to pay a $5,000 fine for his Clean Water Act conviction for the negligent discharge of oil from a company pipeline in Skagway, Alaska, in October 1994. He has since appealed the verdict. The discharge was the result of an accident that occurred during the illegal removal of rock from United States Forest Service land. The case was investigated by the protection agency's criminal investigation division.
In Westchester, the County Attorney, Alan D. Scheinkman, said he approved of such enforcement actions, saying that they "put employees on notice that they will be held responsible for their actions."
In the Westchester case, Mr. Grauer was one of three employees suspended in connection with the incident, which occurred on July 13 and 14. No charges have been filed against the other two employees. The County Executive's office has conducted an investigation into the actions of Mr. Grauer, who reportedly did not alert senior officials or use backup procedures to treat the water. For four hours, waste water that had not been disinfected flowed into the Hudson at the rate of nearly four million gallons an hour. The release of the waste water prompted county health officials to order the beach at Croton Point Park and another in Sleepy Hollow -- Philipse Manor Beach -- closed for two days.
Commissioner Howard N. Adel of the County Health Department, said he was heartened that the county was taking action against polluters. "It's very reassuring that our department's concerns are reflected in the county's policies," Dr. Adel said.
The chlorine-pumping system at the Yonkers plant broke down twice in two days, but even the second time, County Executive Andrew J. Spano said, no one notified top officials. "We have strict procedures in place for this," he said at the time. "It just baffles me why they didn't tell anybody."
Mr. Grauer's lawyer, David M. Rosoff, said last week that the county was brandishing its get-tough policy at his client's expense. "They're attempting to make an example of Mr. Grauer," the lawyer said. "Whatever environmental problems occurred, they weren't a result of criminal negligence on his part."
Mr. Rosoff described the District Attorney and the County Executive as overzealous. But Mr. Spano said his office and the District Attorney were not targeting workers in general but rather "an individual who did not carry out his responsibility and consequently jeopardized the people of Westchester."
Mrs. Pirro said the charges against Mr. Grauer did not represent a new policy but rather a continuation of a course set in motion in 1994, when her office established its Environmental Crimes Bureau. "From the onset," she said, "this office has held both individuals and corporations criminally liable for pollution."
For example, in 1996, Mrs. Pirro charged seven owners of dry cleaning establishments with criminal offenses in a 32-count indictment brought before Justice Kenneth H. Lange of State Supreme Court in White Plains. The top charge, first-degree, unlawful dealing in hazardous waste, carried a maximum penalty of four years in prison and a fine of $100,000. All of the defendants were found guilty of paying undercover agents (officials from the State Department of Environmental Conservation who were posing as illegal hazardous waste haulers) to transport their illegal waste. They were fined, sentenced to probation and required to perform community service.
The State Department of Environmental Conservation does not handle criminal offenses, referring cases like the Westchester dry cleaners to a district attorney, Gary F. Sheffer, a spokesman for the department, said.
That is why in the case of the July spill at the Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the state fined the county only for administrative violations of permits, and Mrs. Pirro proceeded with the criminal charges against Mr. Grauer. Answering the state charges, the county agreed in August to pay the Department of Environmental Conservation $600,000 in penalties for violations in Yonkers and other plants, Frank V. Bifera, general counsel for the department, said.
Mr. Bifera said that even though his department does not prosecute offenders, it nevertheless tries to hold individuals responsible when appropriate. In the case of two oil firms in the last year, the state successfully filed administrative, but not criminal, charges against the individual owners and levied heavy fines.
"Sometimes it's a matter of an individual trying to get ahead in a company," Mr. Bifera said. "Sometimes he or she is trying to cover up incompetence or just acting recklessly."
Judson W. Starr, a former chief of the Federal Justice Department's environmental crimes section and now a lawyer with Venable, a law firm in Washington, said the latest policies "imposed great powers" on some corporate executives like senior vice presidents in charge of the safety and health of the environment. "They were little heard from before," he said. "Now companies are becoming more sensitive to the fact that there are extreme risks in violating environmental laws."
But John Cronin, the Hudson Riverkeeper, said that while governments talked a good game about getting tough with environmental polluters, officials were often inconsistent. "Too often, politics gets in the way," he said. "When the economy is bad, they don't want to do anything to interfere and make it get worse. When times are good, they don't want to rock the boat.
"I'm glad to hear they're talking about taking a stronger stance, but I'm skeptical."

Could Glen Cove Be Replacing Nashville?

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 

 BODY:
IN the recording world, there's New York, Los Angeles and Nashville. And then there's Glen Cove. "It's the best kept secret in the world "' said Richie Cannata, co-owner of the Cove City Sound Studio, one of a trio of recording studios that works with major artists in the North Shore town.
"It's not a secret in the industry," he said. "Do we care about having kids outside the door looking for Celine Dion? We don't want that." Perhaps because, on this particular day, she isn't there. But her voice is. Cove City is tracking and mixing an album of Ms. Dion singing Christmas songs and making a soundtrack of featured songs from the television series "Touched by an Angel." 
 To record the vocals, the studio sent a producer and engineer to the chanteuse in Miami. Mr. Cannata, who grew up in Garden City South and lives in Glen Cove, now plays for the Beach Boys. The musician played saxophone and keyboards for Billy Joel for eight years, then worked with Elton John, Roseanne Cash and Rita Coolidge. He was performing with Styx 13 years ago when he purchased the building that became his Glen Cove headquarters. Intent on bringing the humanities into town, he created Long Island's largest recording studio.
His partner, Ric Wake, is Ms. Dion's producer. Hence, a room full of platinum and gold albums. And lots of musical notes. Three years ago, Mr. Cannata recalled, Billy Joel worked on "River of Dreams" at the studio. Other Long Island-bred artists, like Taylor Dayne, LL Cool J and Mariah Carey, have recorded there. Ms. Dion made two previous albums at the studio. Howard Stern used the facility to record the soundtrack for "Private Parts," the movie.
Diana Ross came by last year. John Sekada was in recently doing a mix. Natalie Cole, Whitney Houston, Donny Osmond, Barry Manilow, Darryl Hall and Phoebe Snow all sang incognito at the studio, which is tucked behind the Metropolitan catering hall.
Last month, the studio completed two tracks with a 1998 Grammy winner, Tricia Yearwood.
They are mixing a track for Mya, the rhythm and blues artist. And making a CD for a 15-year-old in the neighborhood who plays the flute. In a converted turn-of-the-century soda bottling plant around the corner, Sissel, a Norwegian vocalist who recorded the motion picture Titanic soundtrack with Ms. Dion, is recording her first American album.
"We call it studio row," said Perry Margouleff, 38, sometime songwriter and owner of Pie Studios, a five-year-old vintage analog recording hall. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones recorded part of the group's "Bridges to Babylon" album there last November, Mr. Margouleff said, then took a speedboat home to Westport, Conn., at 2 A.M. Joan Osborne, Cyndi Lauper, the Hooters, Cheap Trick and Jackson Browne were happy with limousines.
"There's Motown, the Detroit sound," said Fred Guarino, engineer and owner of Tiki Recording Studio, the first of the studios. Tiki moved from Mr. Guarino's garage to an abandoned local tavern in 1983.
"It's kind of funny to say the Glen Cove sound," he said. "Something sort of developed here accidentally. There was no cultural development or formalized method. It's a cottage industry, but real work has come from this area. It's not just home studios."
Mr. Guarino's digital sound machine combines corporate and rock recording and attracts more local bands than the two other studios. But Peter Allen, Debbie Gibson, Brian Setzer, Kenny Rogers and Al Jarreau have also used his recording rooms.
Initially, Mr. Margouleff said, stars balk at coming to Glen Cove. When they realize they can go across the street for ice cream without being bothered by fans, they like it.
"The city's too expensive and too dirty," Mr. Margouleff said. "Traditionally, the areas where you can have a commercial space suitable for making noise and having a recording studio are not the more pleasant areas in New York. People come here, they make barbecues and hang out outdoors. They can leave the front door open. Artists can come and really do their thing and not feel that someone else is eavesdropping or nosing in on what they are doing."
The goal, Mr. Margouleff said, is discovering the next hot star.
"That's the pot at the end of the rainbow," he said. "Most of the time when I'm scouting and looking for talent, I'm doing it in the city."
 
Indian Rhythms
Using the studio at Cove City recently were the legendary Thunder Bird Sisters from the Shinnecock Reservation near Southampton.
"We perform several times a year," said the Rev. Dr. Holly Haile Davis, 38, the group's lead guitarist.
She was crocheting as she listened to a playback of "In the Spirit of Crazy Horse." "We've been singing since 1973," she said. "It was about time for us to make a CD." And, along with a blue blanket, a music video. Organizing the group, which has performed nationally and internationally, was Eddie Brigati, co-producer of the CD and lead singer from the Rascals, known for such 60's hits as "Beautiful Morning," Groovin'," "People Gotta Be Free" and "Good Lovin'."
Music, explained Mr. Brigati, was a way for the group of Indian performers to tell the Shinnecock story and vent their community concerns.
"That's how it worked for the Rascals," he recalled. "A lot of it was inspired by the hostile environment of the time -- the Vietnam war, riots in the streets, the beginning of the atomic age. The power of music supercedes any obstacle. A guy like me could say something and it could be taken around the world."
The singing sisters -- and brother, mother and cousins -- came to Glen Cove, Mr. Brigati said, because there are no recording studios on the East End.
"All the celebrities just come out there to rest," he said. Instead, they want the celebrities -- who have built homes all around their territory -- to listen to their CD, which will be released this month.
"We haven't gotten past the house that went up in 1640," said Dr. Davis. "Three hundred and fifty years later you have an Indian community that is also entirely outside the loop of Hamptons society.
"The fact that the American Indian people still live today is a miracle in itself," she said. "Physical genocide, cultural genocide, spiritual genocide -- we are victims of many levels of violence including economic violence. The fact that we are alive in 1998 is not because our neighbors want us to be. It's a test of our endurance."
Inside the studio, Elizabeth Haile, daughter of Chief Thunderbird, matriarch of the clan and teacher at the Hayground School in Bridgehampton, was working on the video.
"Music is medicine," said Ms. Haile. "You get to express yourself, happy or sad, you get to wrap the issues that are important to you in music."
In between takes, the group, whose message to their children and grandchildren is to preserve their heritage and live in harmony with their neighbors, snacked on bagels and cream cheese.
 
Science Loses to Art
Hawking his handblown glass pieces in the second-floor gift shop at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn recently was Rodman Gilder Miller. A cell biologist specialized in neuroanatomy, Dr. Miller gave up science for art six years ago. Not surprising, considering his family tree. Dr. Miller's great-grandfather was Louis Comfort Tiffany.
"My interest in glass was tempered," said Dr. Miller, who flew in from Seattle for the opening of the "Louis Comfort Tiffany and Stanford White and Their Circle" exhibition at the museum, toting a suitcase filled with his own creations.
"My great-grandfather was the master of glass," he said. The one-of-a-kind sapphire and amethyst-shaded vases and wall pockets "remind one of a human body," Dr. Miller said, "but it's not too much in your face."
Pointing out a $160 white vase that looked like ladies' lingerie, Dr. Miller noted that although he was born 10 years after Tiffany died, his artwork -- and use of sensuous, even voluptuous organic forms -- is strikingly similar to that of his ancestor, one of the most influential arbiters of style of the Gilded Age.
"It's in my blood," he said. "I was exposed to it since I was knee high to a grasshopper. I'm sure it's had some effect. Nature, nurture. One way or another, it's in there."

HEADLINE: Global Warming Study of East End Sparks Debate on Sea Rise

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
THOSE living on the coast are in trouble," George Abar said after watching Southampton Beach being washed away in a hurricane.
It was only a computer-generated video, prepared by Mr. Abar's organization, the National Environmental Trust in Washington, to illustrate what could happen if global warming causes a three-foot rise in sea levels. When combined with a 10-foot storm surge from a Category Two hurricane, like the one that struck the Gulf Coast last week and others that have hit Long Island several times in this century, Southampton Beach would be all but destroyed. 
 Mr. Abar said his organization prepared the video to "try to take abstract notions and make them compelling. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words."
According to a scenario accepted by many (but by no means all) scientists, a three-foot sea-level rise would not occur for at least a century. But the National Environmental Trust, a Washington-based private group, argues that to avoid future catastrophe, action must be taken now to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, produced mostly by burning fossil fuels. Many climatologists fear that these gases will raise global temperatures, causing a partial melting of the polar icecaps and raising sea levels worldwide.
"Some sea-level rise is inevitable because of pollution now in our atmosphere," Mr. Abar said. "The question is, are we going to respond to these changes?"
Mr. Abar said he would like to see the United States adopt the agreement reached last year by 160 nations in Kyoto, Japan, in which the major industrialized nations are required by the years 2008 to 2012 to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels. Adoption of the treaty by the United States is stalled in Congress by critics who argue that the cost of compliance outweighs the uncertain benefits.
Mr. Abar said Southampton was chosen for this study because of its high profile and concentration of expensive beachfront real estate. But the 29-page report accompanying the video made clear that the impact of rising sea levels would be felt Island-wide.
In 100 years, it said, the South Fork could be split into at least three sections; Jones Beach, Fire Island, the Hamptons beaches and Pikes Beach could all be under water; the coastlines in Bayville, Asharoken, Huntington Bay and the Great South Bay could be littered with the ruins of docks, seawalls and homes, and countless inland backyards in places like Middle Island and Yaphank could be at greater risk of flooding because of a rising water table.
"Global warming," the report said, "threatens to spell the end of much of what we know Long Island has to offer, washing it away by rising seas and destroying for the future the Island's historic past."
The video was created using an overlay of detailed pictures from the National Aerial Photography Program and elevation data from the United States Geological Survey. Using the elevation data of Southampton Beach, the computer digitally replaced land with water.
Other factors, including changes in patterns of tidal scouring and other forms of erosion, were not taken into account, and Mr. Abar warned that the computer-generated images should not be used to predict the fate of any single piece of property. As presented by the report, however, the overall trend seemed ominous.
Others were skeptical of the report. Candace Crandall, a policy research associate with the Science and Environmental Policy Project of Fairfax, Va., assailed the study, describing the National Environmental Trust as "a propaganda mill, not a research organization."
"They are out to promote global warming as a scare across the country," she said. "That's what they are doing, so I take all of what they are saying with a grain of salt."
Ms. Crandall said that the estimate of a three-foot rise in sea level is based on the worst-case scenario presented in a 1996 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This was the panel's third report on the issue in this decade, she said, and each one forecast a smaller rise in temperature and sea level.
"The problem is shrinking into nothing," she said. "I'm seeing more and more scientists who are acknowledging that there is considerable dispute" about the impact of global warming.
Her group's research, Ms. Crandall said, appears to indicate that global warming is occurring, but that it will increase evaporation, which will fall as snow and ice on polar areas and thereby lower the sea level. "There seems to be an indication that the evaporation-precipitation factor may be the greater effect," she said.
But Vivien M. Gornitz, a climate expert who joined Mr. Abar at a briefing on the study, said there is no doubt that global warming will push the sea level higher by a "couple of inches in 30 years. In the worst-case scenario, it would increase by eight inches. Major floods that used to occur every 100 years could occur once every 30 years."
Dr. Gornitz asserted that what is needed is better coordination between agencies in developing coastal policy.
"What is going on on Long Island is absolute chaos in terms of coastal management," said Dr. Gornitz, a scientist at Columbia University's Center for Climate Systems Research and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. "There is no management whatsoever. Whoever has the most political and economic clout gets his way."
Such conflict was evident early this year when neighbors objected to the erection of a 175-foot steel bulkhead in front of the home of Ronald and Isobel Konecky in Bridgehampton. Southampton Town called the work illegal. When the town later held a public hearing on a proposed six-month moratorium against the erection of bulkheads, more than 100 people showed up to protest.
The Konecky case flared just a week after a reported $1 million erosion-control project failed to protect the oceanfront home of their neighbor, William Rudin. The project had consisted of oversized sandbags that were placed in a semicircle in front of the Rudin house.
One of the consultants on the project blamed vandalism -- a knife slash in one of the sandbags -- for leaving the system vulnerable to an Atlantic storm the night of Jan. 28.
But Robert S. DeLuca, president of the Group for the South Fork, scoffed at that assertion, saying: "If you can bring down a million-dollar structure with a pocket knife, you probably shouldn't have built it in the first place."
Mr. DeLuca, who also attended the National Environmental Trust's briefing last week, said there are $10 billion worth of second home investments on the East End. But even those who do not own beachfront property use the beach, he said, and "if the beach disappears from erosion, it will be a less attractive area to live."
The National Environmental Trust study said the "state's coastal economy is its lifeblood. Anti-environmental rhetoric is filled with assertions about how much it will cost to stop global warming. This report speculates on what it will cost to lose our natural resources."
The report said that in 1996, tourism on the Island, much of it shore-related, employed about 152,000 people, 14 percent of the Island's jobs. Chief among the lures of Southampton, it said, is the town's sandy, white beach, more than 20 miles long.
"Unfortunately," it said, "that beach is eroding at an average of 1.7 feet per year and is facing extinction from the very forces that created it, plus something else: the melting of polar glaciers and the hydrologic thermal expansion brought on by global warming."
Southampton Town and Southampton Village are now both developing coastal studies, and Mr. DeLuca said he will press to have global warming included as a factor in long-term planning on the South Fork.
Mr. DeLuca said his organization advocates the development of a post-storm recovery plan to determine how and what should be built along the beachfront. And he said there should be a buyout program for those who have lost 80 percent of their homes to soil erosion and the sea.
Mr. Abar offered one lesson to shorefront homebuyers: "Don't take a 30-year mortgage on a home that may be gone in 30 years."

HEADLINE: County Won't Take Part in a Sales Tax Waiver

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
CONVINCED that property taxes would have to be increased substantially if it did otherwise, Westchester County has decided not to take part in a state plan to waive all sales tax on some apparel for a fourth trial week in January.
The vote of the Board of Legislators suggests a high probability that the county will not permanently exempt certain clothing and footwear from the county's portion of the sales tax. The county portion ranges from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent, depending on whether local jurisdictions impose their own sales tax. Some of the county's sales tax revenues are redistributed to towns, villages and school districts, so the county government's action affects those entities, too. 
 "It is very obvious to us that opting in would cause us to increase the property tax in all municipalities in Westchester County," County Executive Andrew J. Spano said. "It would severely hurt our cities at a time we are trying to keep our taxes low for the people of Westchester County. It doesn't make sense."
The cities of Mount Vernon, Yonkers and New Rochelle each collect their own sales tax of 2.5 percent and the city of White Plains a 2 percent tax. These municipalities have also decided not to take part in the tax-free clothing week, from Jan. 17 through 24.
This means that during that week, the only reduction in sales tax that shoppers in Westchester will have is the elimination of the state's 4 percent sales tax and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 0.25 percent sales tax on clothing and footwear purchases of less than $500. The permanent exemption on the state and M.T.A. sales tax will apply on purchases of less than $110 beginning Dec. 1, 1999.
The county government and the cities have until late next year to make a definitive decision on whether to take part in the permanent exemption.
If Mr. Spano has his way, the answer will be no -- unless the state government agrees to reimburse the county for the lost revenue, projected to be $14.2 million to $18.7 million in its first full year, 2000, just on the county level. Under these projections -- made in a report prepared by the Westchester County Association, an influential business organization -- White Plains, Yonkers, New Rochelle and Mount Vernon would collectively lose a projected $10.2 million to $13.4 million in sales tax revenues, and Peekskill, Rye City, all towns, villages and school districts would lose $2.7 million to $3.6 million.
Likewise, the answer will be no from the four cities if their top officials, two Republicans, two Democrats, have their way. The mayors of these cities and other local government officials from around the county joined Mr. Spano at a news conference recently in which they, too, said that sales tax relief could only lead to higher property taxes.
"We live our life around this sales tax, and without it it would be disastrous to the city of White Plains and the county of Westchester," Mayor Joseph M. Delfino of White Plains, a Republican, said. Mayor John D. Spencer of Yonkers, also a Republican, said his city had made great strides in overcoming its past financial woes and now had its "own plan for tax cutting," a plan that did not involve sales tax changes.
Also voicing views against the long-term and short-term exemption of clothing from the sales tax were Mayor Timothy C. Idoni of New Rochelle and Mayor Ernest D. Davis of Mount Vernon, both Democrats.
Resolutions against joining the sales tax exemption have also been passed by the Westchester Municipal Officials Association and most of its member municipalities and various school districts.
Bolstering the position of Mr. Spano and the others was the report prepared by the Westchester County Association, which analyzed in detail the effects the sales tax exemption could have in Westchester. Property tax increases would be substantial and would more than offset any sales tax savings, according to the report.
For example, the report said, a property owner in White Plains with assessed property at $14,540 (considered about average in that city) would pay between $218 to $286 more a year in property taxes to make up for the lost sales tax revenue. That homeowner would have to spend $6,228 to $8,171 a year on clothing purchases of less than $110 to come out even, the report said. Likewise, in Yonkers, a home assessed at $12,900 (again, an average assessment) would have an increase in property taxes of $137 to $181. That person would have to spend $3,425 to $4,525 on clothing to offset the increase, the report said.
Speaking on behalf of the Westchester County Association and the report they helped prepare, Thomas J. Spitznas, an economic consultant, and Theodore Puluso, a certified public accountant, said it was not feasible to think that the local governments could make up for the lost revenue by cutting from their budgets. "Most of the fat has already been cut," Mr. Spitznas said. Nor, they said, was there any proof that the reduced sales tax would bring increased retail business to the county.
He added that if the clothing exemption were allowed and if it did, as predicted, lead to increased property taxes, there would be further consequences. Increased property taxes, he said, would lead to higher rents for retailers, who would have to raise prices on their goods, thus eliminating any consumer savings from sales tax relief.
The Westchester government did take part in three earlier trials of the sales tax exemption on clothing, most recently in September. It is estimated that the county government would lose up to $1 million if it joins in the fourth trial.
The vote on whether to take part in the fourth and final trial week was 11 to 6, almost along party lines. The Board's nine Democrats were joined by two Yonkers Republicans -- Katherine S. Carsky and Bernice Spreckman -- in voting not to take part. Those favoring continued participation generally argued that the county could find enough fat in its budget to make up for the lost sales tax revenue.

HEADLINE: Nassau Coliseum's Biggest Brawl Ever Is Off the Ice

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: UNIONDALE

 BODY:
DREAMS for the future of Long Island's only major sports franchise will be on the minds of fans when the New York Islanders return to the ice at the Nassau County Veterans Memorial Coliseum tonight.
But there may not be much to cheer about. The Islanders appear to have little chance at the Stanley Cup. Worse, the team's managers and their landlord, County Executive Thomas Gulotta, have called one another such nasty names in the last few weeks that any capacity for cooperation between the two sides may be lost forever. If not for a judge's order, the Islanders would not even be setting foot in the building. 
 It appears that Islander management got the worst of it in this hockey brawl with Nassau County, but future clashes seem inevitable. Over the long term, the greatest damage may be to the concept of the Nassau Hub, a retail and entertainment complex envisioned for central Nassau County.
The immediate issue, unfolding over the summer and now threatening to hang over the 1998-99 season, has been the safety of the Coliseum. The Islanders say the arena is a hazard; the county says it is not. But it is hard to avoid the suspicion that the Islanders' safety concerns are somehow related to their expressed desire for a renegotiation of their current lease and a new arena that could be built and ready for action in three years.
"All we want is to be able to compete on the same footing as the other teams around the country," said David Seldin, the president of New York Sports Ventures, which bought the Islanders in February for $195 million. "To survive we've got to attract more fans, and that means not only better players, but a state-of-the-art arena."
Mr. Seldin said the franchise was currently losing $11 million a year.
The team was prepared to play tonight's exhibition game against the Washington Capitals elsewhere had not State Supreme Court Judge Burton S. Joseph issued an order on Tuesday requiring that the Islanders adhere to their contract with the county and play all their scheduled home games at the Coliseum. To go elsewhere, the judge said, "would cause the county irreparable harm."
The judge also ruled that claims by the Islanders that the Coliseum was unsafe were unfounded. Justice Joseph said that engineers hired by Gary Bettman, commissioner of the National Hockey League, had conducted a thorough safety inspection of the 16,400-seat arena and reported to the court that there were was no structural threat to the fans or players.
Mr. Seldin said the team would obey the court's ruling and return to the Coliseum to play its scheduled games there. However, he said, the team would not return to its old offices in the Coliseum's basement; its headquarters are now in Jericho.
He said the Islanders also planned to continue to press a suit they filed in Federal district court in Brooklyn on Sept. 9 seeking $10 million in damages and charging that the county had permitted the 26-year-old Coliseum to fall into such a state of disrepair that it was no longer safe to play hockey. As a result, he said, the team, in effect, had been evicted.
The county and Spectacor Management Group, which was contracted by the the county to operate the Coliseum, fired back on Sept. 17 in State Supreme Court in Mineola, seeking a temporary restraining order barring the team from playing scheduled home and exhibition games any place but the Coliseum. The county decided to go to court after talks called by Mr. Gulotta failed to resolve the dispute.
Mr. Gulotta said the owners were using the safety issue as a ruse to gain a share of parking and concession fees at the Coliseum and to improve their position in negotiations to build a new Coliseum and to develop the 70 acres that surround the arena.
Mr. Gulotta has proposed building not only a new arena, but also converting the old Coliseum into a convention center and the construction of a new hotel and shops and office buildings. The sports complex would be linked by rail and jitney to Roosevelt Field and other shopping malls, office buildings, nearby colleges and universities and county, state and Federal office buildings.
The new Coliseum would be the jewel in the center of what Mr. Gulotta calls the Nassau Hub, which, if realized, would represent a monumental reminder of the Gulotta administration.
Mr. Gulotta said he was hopeful of attracting another big-sport franchise, perhaps a basketball team, and that the threat by the Islanders to leave not only damaged the county's image as a growing sports market but might also put upward pressure on interest rates on bonds and other financing instruments that would be issued to build the Hub.
As one official close to the talks put it, "It's all a matter of who controls slicing up the pie and gets the bigger piece, and no one is going to tell Tom Gulotta how to hold the knife."
While everyone involved, including the fans, want a new arena, the debate continues over how to pay for it and the rest of the Hub project. New York State has come up with $30 million toward the arena, which could cost between $200 million and $300 million. County taxpayers appear reluctant to make a contribution and Mr. Gulotta, mindful of voter abhorrence of higher taxes, says those interested, including the Islanders, should bring along their own capital.
The Coliseum, the oldest unrenovated arena in the National Hockey League, is not the only sporting arena that has been found wanting and in search of public and private capital. The new owners of the New Jersey Nets have made noises about leaving the Meadowlands Sports Complex to a proposed site in Newark. The Devils are also unhappy at the Meadowlands and have said they want to move to Hoboken.
In New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has proposed a $1.3 billion stadium for the team on the West Side of Manhattan to house the restless George Steinbrenner and his Yankees, while the Bronx is offering a new $500 million complex to keep them at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. In Queens, the Mets unveiled plans for a new domed stadium in April, and they hope to have the city pick up three-quarters of its $500 million price tag.
Mr. Seldin has noted that the U.S. Open tennis tournament was played at the one-year-old National Tennis Center in Queens, which cost $245 million to build. The city helped by issuing $150 million in tax-exempt bonds to build the center, but the United States Tennis Association makes the payments.
Similar creative financing will be required for a new Coliseum in Nassau. Sources close to the talks say the county has offered to put up a third of the money if the state and the Islanders also put up a third each. But Mr. Gulotta is said to want the Islanders to advance an additional one-third to cover the county's share, and then be repaid over a period of time.
But while everyone is dreaming about a new arena, the old concrete steel-reinforced structure that rocks when the Islanders score and the fans cheer and stamp their feet in unison, is showing its age. Many of the 64 columns that surround the arena and hold up the roof have small cracks, concrete is flaking away from six of the columns, and bulges are appearing at some locations around the midsection of the facade.
Engineers told Justice Joseph that such aging problems were considered commonplace in similar buildings, including most of the skyscrapers in New York City as well as the cement and marble State Supreme Court in Mineola, where the judge conducted his hearings over the last two weeks.
Lawyers for the New York Islanders argued heatedly before Justice Joseph with lawyers for Nassau County and Spectacor Management, which operates more than 30 arenas worldwide, over whether the arena was safe.
Kenneth L. Steinthal, the lawyer representing the Islanders, charged that the team suffered irreparable harm because the county refused to permit an independent safety evaluation of the Coliseum.
"There is no difference between this situation and the Iraqi arms inspection," he said. "The Iraqis don't want the U.N. to come in and investigate, and Nassau County won't permit an independent evaluation. We're not suggesting that the Coliseum be condemned and closed down, we just want to be assured that it is safe."
In response, Joseph J. Ortego, the lawyer for the county, argued that the Islanders had failed to tell the court why the arena was unsafe and accused the owners of being on "a fishing expedition" in an effort to find evidence for their Federal lawsuit.
"If the Coliseum is safe for the World Games, the Jehovah's Witnesses, Sesame Street and the circus, then give us at least a hint of why it is unsafe for the Islanders," Mr. Ortego said.
Mr. Ortego accused the Islanders of using the safety issue as a tactic to scare the public as a means to embarrass the county government into giving the Islanders a new contract.
Outside the courtroom, both sides pulled off their gloves and let loose with a barrage of ugly personal attacks in full-page ads in Newsday and on the Internet at www.coliseum-coverup.com. Mr. Seldin described the county and Spectacor Management as "criminal institutions" attempting to "conceal the truth from the public," while Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive, described the Islanders as "greedy" and "a pig at the trough."
Despite the vitriol, Mr. Gulotta, after Judge Joseph's ruling on Tuesday, urged Mr. Seldin and the owners of the Islanders, Howard Milstein and Steven Gluckstern, to return to the negotiating table to discuss the new arena and the Hub development. In a letter to the owners, he said he had directed the county's negotiator to resume "with all due haste, planning for a new multifaceted sports complex to meet the future needs of the Islanders and to develop the Hub in a manner consistent with the best interests of Nassau taxpayers."
Apparently responding to critics who charge the county has taken too long to act on plans for the new coliseum and the Hub, Mr. Gulotta said that the planning process would "resume immediately and adhere to a rigid timetable." He also wrote: "While I am hopeful that the Islanders' ownership will be a constructive part of this development plan, the county will not be deterred from formalizing a plan to present to the community."
In a tepid response to the Gulotta overture, Mr. Seldin said he hoped that it was "made in good faith" and that Mr. Gulotta himself would participate in the talks and "not let them get lost among subordinates." Meanwhile, Mr. Seldin continues to insist that the Islanders have no lease at the Coliseum and that "this will be established over the coming months in Federal court."
"The public and the press are now looking hard at the county and S.M.G.'s handling of the Coliseum," Mr. Seldin said. "It is sad that a judge had to force the county to have even a limited inspection."
He said the recent scrutiny forced by the Islanders had resulted in the correction of "numerous" safety problems and the identification of several other concerns.
"Crumbling concrete will be fixed and areas of potential danger around the outside of the Coliseum will be blockaded to protect visitors to the facility," he said. "With time, there will be more complete inspections and a more complete examination of all the evidence."
To entice fans to the arena, Mr. Seldin said the team was rolling back its ticket prices and had cut the service charge for tickets ordered by phone. For tonight's preseason game, he said, tickets would be free for season subscribers and $10 for everyone else, regardless of seating.
In addition, he said regular-season tickets for all October and November games would be available at a special discount in the 300-level seating areas of the Coliseum. All 300-level $19 tickets will be $ 10: $35 tickets will be $20 and $40 tickets will be $30.
Both sides claimed that Justice Joseph's ruling was a victory for the fans. But it was Justice Joseph who most strongly expressed concern for the fans in the courtroom. He went so far as to apologize to the fans, saying he was sorry he could not return their telephone calls to his law secretary asking the court what they should do with their tickets for the Islander's first scheduled exhibition game, on Sept. 25, which was canceled because of the continuing legal dispute.
"Their concern shows how this affects everyone, from the fans to the county's image across the country to interest rate," he said. "I always get very upset when a respected industry or any employer that is an integral part of the economy of Long Island, in effect, wants to pick up their marbles and leave."

HEADLINE: End to School Segregation, Voluntary Or Mandated?

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
WHETHER Connecticut should continue its plan of voluntary school desegregation or institute one with mandated timetables and goals and some kind of punishment for school districts that don't comply was debated in a court hearing last month.
The hearing, before Superior Court Judge Julia L. Aurigemma in Middletown, was a continuation of the Sheff v. O'Neill case, which has been responsible for school reform legislation since the state's Supreme Court ruled in July 1996 that the state's system of autonomous municipal school districts had resulted in unconstitutional de facto segregation for students in Hartford. 
 But lawyers for the plaintiffs, 17 Hartford schoolchildren when the lawsuit was filed in 1989, argued that the reforms enacted by the legislature and the Governor since the Supreme Court ruling have had little effect on the racial and ethnic isolation of the capitol city's schools.
In fact, they said, the racial make-up of Hartford's schools has even grown slightly more isolated since the Supreme Court decision. Black and Hispanic students made up 93 percent of Hartford's school enrollment in 1996, and now they are 94 percent, says Wesley W. Horton, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys.
The plaintiffs' lawyers and their expert witnesses claimed that the state's reliance on voluntary efforts had not met the court's order to remedy the problem, and could not be expected to in the future.
Witnesses for the state countered that tens of millions of extra dollars in state funding has been allocated for schools in districts with high proportions of minority students, preschool opportunities for low-income urban youngsters have been greatly expanded, and about a fifth of the state's public school students are now served by public school choice and inter-district educational programs, all in direct response to the Sheff decision.
They argued that historically, across the country, voluntary desegregation efforts have been more successful than mandated ones, and that given enough time the state's voluntary efforts will reduce Hartford's racial isolation.
The Supreme Court's decision left it up to the legislature and the governor to find a remedy, which lawyers from the State Attorney General's office, defending the state, said was exactly what was done. Judge Aurigemma asked the two sides to submit post-trial briefs by Dec. 4, and scheduled final oral arguments for Dec. 7. Her decision is not expected until early next year, but either way she rules is unlikely to settle the case.
If she rules in favor of the plaintiffs and decides to order a particular remedy, it would necessitate another hearing to determine exactly what remedy should be ordered, and the Attorney General's office would probably appeal such a decision.
If she rules in favor of the state, it gives the legislature and the governor more time to effect a remedy but doesn't preclude the plaintiffs from filing another show cause complaint in two or three years if they aren't satisfied with the state's progress.
Any ruling by Judge Aurigemma that contradicts the Supreme Court decision in the state's favor will likely bring an appeal by the plaintiffs to the Supreme Court.
The hearing was held during a curiously anemic political season in which education has been a frequent campaign theme for state candidates, for whom the Sheff decision has been a kind of invisible polar bear in the room, virtually unmentioned by Republicans or Democrats.
In December, the State Education Department will issue its first biennial report on progress toward reducing racial isolation in the cities. Then in January, the legislature will convene to consider new recommendations to respond to the Supreme Court's order.
The state's star witness in the hearing was the Education Commissioner, Theodore S. Sergi, who spent two days on the stand describing the state's response to the Sheff case.
In addition to Mr. Sergi, there were several expert witnesses who, armed with charts and graphs, analyzed the pros and cons of the state's voluntary approach and dueled over their research findings.
Mr. Sergi said he told how Gov. John G. Rowland appointed the Educational Improvement Panel -- a 22-member committee representing legislators, educators, civil rights leaders and others with an interest in the case -- to make recommendations on remedies to the legislature's 1997 session.
This school year, Mr. Sergi said, 100,000 of the state's 540,000 public school students will participate in inter-district educational programs with students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. The state also has 15 inter-district magnet schools and 16 charter schools serving 7,000 students, and an inter-district Open Choice program serving well over 800 students -- 540 from Hartford, 200 from New Haven and 100 from Bridgeport.
The e program, which some educators call Project Choice, is the continuation of Project Concern, a school choice program in Hartford that gave urban students the opportunity to attend schools in adjacent suburban towns. It was expanded to include New Haven and Bridgeport because the Sheff decision, though specifically about Hartford, has been interpreted as potentially applying to other cities as well.
Mr. Sergi also noted that the state appropriated more than $100 million for pre-school education, early reading programs, computers, school renovation and construction, and school library books for "priority districts," which is how the state terms those targeted for special economic aid due to income or racial and ethnic demographics.
"It's hard to say that that is not responsive," Mr. Sergi said. "It's a responsive beginning, but were not finished."
"The solution will not come in a courtroom, but in the classroom," said the Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal. "We hope the court will give the elected officials, the legislature and the governor the time to implement programs that are meaningful and effective."
As an expert witness, the state put on the stand a Boston University political science professor, Christine Rossell, who has analyzed hundreds of school district desegregation efforts across the country. She testified that her analysis shows that voluntary desegregation is more effective than court-mandated programs because it generates less "white flight."
Witnesses for the Sheff plaintiffs, Gary Orfield of Harvard University, Gary Nutriello of Columbia University Teachers College and Bill Gordon, a desegregation expert from North Carolina, presented evidence to support that side's claim that the state's remedies were ineffective.
Their argument was that only a few hundred of Hartford's 23,000 public school students were affected by the state's remedial efforts, and that without enforceable timetables and goals, no meaningful reduction in the racial isolation of the city's school pupils was possible.
They discounted the part-time inter-district educational programs, special programs open to both suburban and Hartford students, and all the state's response in the rest of the state as not applicable to the Sheff order of the Supreme Court. Part-time programs do not remedy full-time racial isolation, and programs in other cities do not affect Hartford students, they said.
"The whole thing the state's been doing the last three years is a drop in the bucket," said Mr. Horton.
Another Sheff lawyer, Philip Tegeler, of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, said the Hartford component of the Open Choice Program only serves 524 students (Mr. Sergi put the number at 540), fewer than its predecessor, Project Concern, served before the Supreme Court ruling and only about half its size 10 years ago.
The plaintiffs' legal team presented guidelines it wants to see implemented by the state that include goals and timetables for measuring compliance and ways the state can enforce them.
Their guidelines also suggested methods for reducing racial isolation that would require suburban districts and the Hartford district to share each others' schools and force the hiring of more minority teachers for all schools.
"Our case is pretty simple," Mr. Tegeler said. "It boils down to the numbers. What has the state done for the students in the Hartford area, not for the state?"
The state has done a great deal for the students in Hartford, said Mr. Sergi. When Hartford's Board of Education was unable to address the problem of its high school's losing accreditation and a plan to turn schools over to a private company failed, the state took over the system, replacing the local board with a state-controlled board of trustees. Hartford also has the largest school choice plan and several magnet and charter schools, with more under development. "Hartford's certainly has been my highest priority the last two years," Mr. Sergi said.
Probably the most important step was when the legislature made reducing racial isolation an "educational interest" of the state. Mr. Sergi said this means no local district can ignore it.
The plaintiffs may have misgivings about the pace and voluntary nature of the state's response, but Mr. Sergi said the state will eventually achieve what the plaintiffs want. "The goals of the state and the plaintiffs are very similar," he said. "It's a question of how you get there."

Cleanup of Tainted Industrial Sites Gains Momentum

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
VACANT for six years, the single-story building at 4 Henderson Drive within a corporate park in West Caldwell is an industrial wreck, a victim of time and environmental concerns.
But this spring, a new owner plans to clean the 10.2-acre site of contaminates and renovate the 49,000-square-foot structure that occupies it into an office building. 
 The site, where electronic circuit boards were once made, contains trichloroethylene, a chlorinated solvent, which has seeped into the ground water.
In doing the cleanup, the owner, Aqua Terra Realty Holdings of Manhattan, will take advantage of a state law passed last winter that provides financial incentives and protection from liability to buyers who clean polluted industrial sites, also known as brownfields, and return them to productive use.
"Pre this legislation," said John B. Mariano Jr., a lawyer for Aqua Terra in the purchase of the site,"there was an open-ended invitation for legal fights" as well as the prospects of new cleanup orders and more costs. Now, there is at least more certainty to the process, said Mr. Mariano, a partner at the Florham Park law firm of Schwartz Simon Edelstein Celso & Kessler.
The Brownfields and Contaminated Site Redemption Act amends earlier laws in an ongoing effort in New Jersey, and the nation, to make the regulatory climate more flexible and offer more incentives to reuse land left from the state's industrial past. In the last 13 years, the state has overseen the cleanup of some 9,594 such sites, according to the Site Remediation Program, which is a part of the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
Some 10,000 contaminated properties -- including brownfields but not sites on state or Federal Superfund lists -- still exist in the state.
When Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed the law on Jan. 6 she described it as "a powerful new tool" to bring economic activity to long-dormant brownfields.
Terri C. Smith, legislative analyst at the Site Remediation Program, stressed, however, that the law did not relieve original polluters from liability.
Although no sites have gone through a cleanup or redevelopment since the law was signed, one indication that the law has spurred additional interest, Ms. Smith said, is the increase in the number of agreements property owners have signed with her department to perform voluntary cleanups. From January to August, there were 1,342 such agreements signed, up from 1,122 agreements during the same time period last year. Some of last year's agreements are advancing to the next stage toward redevelopment.
The key provision of the law is that it protects buyers of tainted sites from private lawsuits related to past contamination problems if they agree to clean the properties according to state requirements. Essentially, the state requires different standards depending on the planned new use of the site, with a residential reuse requiring a higher level of remediation than commercial or industrial uses. The standards also permit alternative methods, including impermeable caps to stop wastes from seeping out, instead of requiring the removal of such industrial residue.
Once this site is remediated, the State Department of Environmental Protection will agree not to sue. The new law also exempts buyers from any new cleanup costs once state environmental officials approve the cleanup job.
THE financial sweeteners include matching state grants to small developers who utilize innovative technologies to remediate sites, as well as reimbursement for up to 75 percent of the cleanup cost. Projects must generate new tax revenue that exceeds the cost of the cleanup to qualify for the reimbursement incentive.
The law also liberalizes the exemption from property taxes that municipalities can grant to developers who reclaim industrial sites in environmental opportunity zones, designated by municipalities, to up to 15 years from 10 years -- the time permissible under state statutes.
The reuse of properties within zones was also expanded to include residential uses; previously, only commercial and industrial uses were permitted.
To highlight those points, Governor Whitman signed the law in front of the former Alcoa plant along River Road in Edgewater while wrecking crews worked to raze the building, where aluminum products were made from 1914 to 1965. Several attempts to redevelop the 10-acre site since then were unsuccessful and it sat vacant. Oils that contained PCB's, a toxic chemical, seeped into the walls and floors of the building, which was completely decontaminated and demolished a month and a half ago.
Next March, a two-building rental complex containing 408 apartments will begin rising on the site. The developer is Daibes Brothers of Edgewater.
Aqua Terra Realty is seeking a matching state grant for the technology it intends to use to clean the West Caldwell site. The company bought it last August from the Canada Life Assurance Company, which foreclosed on the property a few years earlier. Mark Javello, who along with Steven Ancona is a principal at Aqua Terra Realty, said the grant would cover the remediation costs, which preliminary estimates put at $300,000 to $500,000.
The company's affiliate, the Aqua Terra Environmental Corporation, is considering using a process called anaerobic biodegradation for the cleanup. It essentially uses the bacteria found in the soil to break down the trichloroethylene found on the site into benign substances.
"The technology grant will be a perk, but the bigger picture is that the state is saying that it is willing to work with us," Mr. Ancona said, adding that that could help speed the process, which is expected to take six to 18 months to complete.
No one, however, is calling the law a panacea. "It is more of an incremental step than a giant leap forward," said Keith E. Lynott, who heads the environmental law practice at McCarter & English, a Newark-based law firm. While the law provides safeguards from liability, Mr. Lynott said, it does not provide absolute immunity, so that cleanups still carry certain risks. For example, he said, the liability protection extends only to the purchased property but does not take into account contaminates migrating off-site to adjacent properties that may also be affected.
Mr. Javello, of Aqua Terra, said his company "will layer the protection from the state with additional insurance to avoid being blindsided."
STILL, many said, the law offers promise. "Its provisions are all factors that can help tip the scales in favor of remediating and redeveloping sites," said Ira Whitman, who heads an environmental consulting and engineering concern bearing his name in East Brunswick. "It makes the process less daunting and more feasible."
Agreeing with that assessment is Dean O. Lundahl, vice president of the Advance Group, a development company in Bedminster. "I'm not saying we will take on Superfund sites," he said, "but we are now looking at properties that earlier we may have walked away from."
Mr. Lundahl said his company would try to take advantage of the law for the redevelopment of a 15-acre site it owns along the waterfront in Trenton. The site, occupied by four office buildings totaling 400,000 square feet, had undergone a cleanup. But it is not known if the remaining undeveloped portion of the site needs further remediation, he said, noting that plans call for building two more office buildings, with 300,000 square feet, parking for 2,000 cars and 50,000 square feet of retail space.
Some private environmental groups, however, are worried that the law weakens cleanup controls and restricts public participation. "We have outstanding concerns about the inability of the law to allow community input into cleanup decisions," said Bill Wolf, policy director at the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. "And it will undermine the urban redevelopment goals of the state."
Ms. Smith countered that, "The new law doesn't change anything regarding the way we do business, nor does it change any of the technical requirements concerning cleanups."
Alan J. Steinberg, executive vice president of the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, added, "Our philosophy is that the needs of economic development and environmental protection are made to be complimentary under the law, not brought into conflict."
But Raymond A. Ferrara, president of the Omni Environmental Corporation, an environmental consulting concern in Princeton, said that, "above and beyond anything else, the recycling of brownfields is a development issue." For projects to work, he added, they still must have the right economics in place and a developer with the financial wherewithal.
Location is what drew Aqua Terra, which specializes in the recycling of environmentally distressed properties, to the West Caldwell site. Mr. Ancona said that it is within a corporate park, accessible to major roadways like Bloomfield and Passaic Avenues and has all the infrastructure in place to support a new use.
Mr. Javello added, "We also felt comfortable the site could be cleaned."
Once a tenant is identified, work on renovating the building will start. Completion of the project, estimated to cost $6 million, is expected by next summer.

Lowest Rates in 30 Years Fuel Higher Home Prices

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
AS both a seller and a buyer, Didi Farrell has an interesting perspective on house prices.
Feeling that their three-bedroom West Hempstead Cape Cod would be easy to sell in a strong housing market, she and her husband, Daniel, a New York City police officer, recently put it up for sale at $169,000. 
 They also say that low interest rates, which have dropped to a national average of 6.64 percent, a 30-year low, will help them take on a much higher mortgage.
The Farrells are moving forward with plans to buy a house with a dining room, den and four bedrooms so that they will have enough room for themselves and their two small sons, 3, and Christian, 21 months.
But because of the same strong housing market, the house they hope to buy, also in West Hempstead, is priced at $269,000 -- more than they had planned to spend.
It will mean stretching, Mrs. Farrell said. "We won't be able to put as much aside into our retirement account as we have been, there won't be as many dinners out and we'll be keeping things to a minimum for at least a year," she said. "But it puts us into the size house that we would like to be in."
Similar buying and selling decisions have been stoking the market despite the rise in house prices in the last year.
The median contract price in Nassau County in July 1997 was $180,000. A year later, it had risen to $195,300. In Suffolk, the price rose to $153,000 from $145,000.
Nevertheless, said Joseph E. Mottola, chief executive of the Long Island Board of Realtors, "I'm not getting any kind of sense that affordability is an issue -- people are not complaining about what they have to pay." He attributed that to "favorable interest rates, the availability of a variety of financing programs to fit everybody's needs and a general business optimism about being employed and doing well."
Andrew Thaw, a partner of Whitman Thaw and Associates, mortgage bankers in Melville, and the president of the New York Society of Mortgage Professionals, a trade group, noted that even if a house goes up $10,000, the monthly cost would be more than offset by a drop of one percentage point in interest rates, assuming a 10 percent down payment is made in both cases.
He explained that with a 10 percent down payment, a $150,000 house would require a $135,000 mortgage that at 8 percent interest over 30 years would cost $990.58 a month. A 10 percent down payment on a $160,000 house would require a $144,000 mortgage that at an interest rate of 7 percent would cost only $958.04 a month.
For first-time buyers, even the 10 percent down payment could be enough to knock them out of the market were it not for programs specifically aimed at them, said Lynn Law, a mortgage counselor with the Long Island Housing Partnership in Hauppauge, a nonprofit housing agency.
The State of New York Mortgage Agency has programs that allow first-time buyers to finance 100 percent of the cost of both a new and a resale house, said Joseph S. Rizzo, a mortgage representative for the Bank of New York Mortgage Company in Riverhead, which is a member of the housing partnership. Family income can be $90,000 or more, depending on the number of family members, Mr. Rizzo said.
As of Oct. 1, the Sonyma rate for a 30-year loan for up to $227,000, with 1 1/2 points, was 6.625 percent. A point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount.
Still, rising prices have forced many buyers to scale back on their dream house, compromising either on neighborhood or size.
An example of how prices have gone up in a year is a house she listed a year ago for $225,000 in Williston Park, said Evelyn Atanas, a Williston Park broker. The owners withdrew it from the market, recently put it back on and got $235,000, she said.
Neal and Anne Ressa, who are first-time buyers, started looking for a house a year ago before settling on one in Mineola, which they found through Atanas Realty.
LAST year, we couldn't find anything we particularly loved, but the same houses this year were $20,000 to $50,000 more," said Mr. Ressa, who is a salesman for a welding-supply company. Mrs. Ressa works for a department store as a personal shopper.
They wound up getting "a bargain," Mr. Ressa said -- a four-bedroom Cape Cod for $200,000. "We were the first people to see the house, and the owner was elderly and ready to sell," he said. Still, their dream had been to buy in Port Washington, where he grew up, he said. But in Port Washington, they would have had to pay at least $250,000 for a smaller house, he explained.
Brokers, especially those in Nassau, report there is very little left even in the $200,000 range. "I have buyers come in saying, 'I can spend up to $200,000,' which is an incredible amount of money especially if you're a young couple just starting out," said Renee Luft, a sales agent with the Century 21 Prevete real estate agency in Hicksville. "But for $200,000, you don't get very much anymore."
Even so, brokers say that buyers today are very knowledgeable and are not inclined to overpay. "Even in today's hot market, pricing is crucial," said Katy Anastasio, owner of Anastasio Associates, a Huntington real estate broker.
New-house prices are rising along with those of resale houses. Depending on the development, prices have risen $5,000 to $25,000 a house in the last year, said Marilyn Larsen of Great Neck, a marketing consultant to builders. "And there has been no resistance," she added, noting that she is able to lock in today's low interest rates for nine months until a house is delivered.
Builders say they are forced to raise prices because they face rising costs. "I don't raise prices frivolously," said Steven A. Klar, an East Meadow builder, "but when we project out for a longer period of time, I anticipate cost increases in insulation and other materials, and I have to consider the cost of holding land."
In his current development, Waterways at Moriches, he is building 274 units consisting of two-bedroom apartments and two-bedroom semiattached houses for people 55 or older. Prices for houses to be delivered in the spring have gone up $5,000 to $10,000 over those that went into contract in June for earlier delivery, Mr. Klar said. The new prices range from $175,000 for an apartment to $250,000 for a semiattached house.
At the Villages at Huntington, where McGovern-Barbash Associates of Babylon is building 248 houses, prices, which started at $295,000 to $340,000 two years ago, have risen to $330,000 to $425,000. The cost of materials and labor has also gone up, said Susan Barbash, one of the principals.
But buyers willing to move farther east into subdivisions just starting out can take advantage of preconstruction prices.
At a 72-house Yaphank development called Fairway Woods under construction by J. D. O. C. Construction of Yaphank, preconstruction prices range from $149,900 for a three-bedroom high ranch to $182,900 for a four-bedroom colonial.
But by Columbus Day, when models open, those prices will go up at least $5,000, said Mrs. Larsen of Great Neck, who is in charge of marketing. Since sales began six weeks ago, contracts have been signed on eight houses, she said.
Among her customers are John Jackson, a New York City police officer, and his wife, Nancy, an insurance claims representative. They have contracted to buy the $182,900 colonial, having just sold their three-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot Ronkonkoma ranch for $148,500.
Because they hope to lock in a 6.625 percent interest mortgage, their new house will cost them only $150 a month more, including taxes, Mrs. Jackson said. The reason is that on their Ronkonkoma house, their mortgage had an 8.5 percent interest rate, she said.
Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group, and director of the International Trade Research Institute at Long Island University-C. W. Post in Brookville, said that although the volatility in the stock market had not yet affected house prices, she anticipated a "leveling off" by winter or spring if the stock market kept falling.
Will that mean a sharp price drop? Dr. Kamer said she did not see that happening "because we haven't had the excesses of the 80's, when homes were really bought as an investment that was going to increase in value and not as a place to live."

HEADLINE: A Medical Center Works on Its Health

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
WHEN the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center opened in 1928, its towering promontories inspired comparison to Mount Shasta. Sixty years later, however, the mountain was turning into a molehill.
"Columbia, frankly, had gone through a 15-year period of trivial investment -- and it showed," said Dr. Herbert Pardes, dean of the faculty of medicine and vice president of the university for health sciences.
An architect familiar with some of the more antiquated areas of the old Presbyterian Hospital building was even more blunt. "It was frightening," he said, "to think that this was where people came to get well." 
 Since the late 1980's, however, $1.13 billion has been invested to construct or renovate 4.27 million square feet of space at the Washington Heights complex.
"What you see is an expression of the institution's taking the initiative to keep itself strong and to serve the community," Dr. Pardes said.
This year marks the opening of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, whose sleek curtain wall of bottle-green glass hugs the Henry Hudson Parkway; a new diabetes center and storefront clinic at St. Nicholas Avenue and 168th Street; a new pediatric intensive care unit at New York Presbyterian's Babies and Children's Hospital; an expansion of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center in the Atchley Pavilion; a new research center for the New York Orthopaedic Hospital, and a new eye clinic.
None of these projects looks as if it would belong in a hard-edged, squared-off, white-tiled, fluorescent-bathed labyrinth. Openness -- even softness -- are key. Spaces are defined by curves, not corners. Expanses of glass replace opaque walls. Carpeting substitutes for linoleum. Woods (or wood-grained vinyl) supplant tiles. Luscious colors burst through the monochromatic landscape. And there is room to sit, to eat, to reflect or relax.
Something else is striking about these projects. They breach urban boundaries that seemed inviolable a decade ago, extending the medical center to the east side of Broadway and -- across two bridges -- to the west side of Riverside Drive. The center may also cross to the south side of 165th Street to build a hotel.
Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr. believes the center has also grown more responsive to the district he represents. "They're doing things with the community," he said, "as opposed to for the community."
Nonetheless, there are daunting questions on the horizon. Will the merger nine months ago of the Presbyterian and New York Hospitals lead to a contraction uptown? Will managed care undermine the economics and logistics of such a large-scale enterprise?
Dr. David B. Skinner, vice chairman and chief executive of the New York Presbyterian Healthcare system, said contraction was "unlikely."
"Both campuses are full-service providers of care and they serve different constituencies," he said. He acknowledged the danger posed by managed-care programs to large, single, freestanding academic medical centers. "That is why we moved a long time ago to create a health-care system that has another 28 hospitals," he said.
Now part of that system, Presbyterian is itself the sum of once-independent units like the Babies and Orthopaedic hospitals. Presbyterian joined with Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1921 to build the medical center. The Psychiatric Institute, run by the New York State Office of Mental Health, is affiliated with the college.
The institute has produced what is surely the most striking recent addition to the center, a $79 million, six-story structure that is actually two buildings in one, divided by a soaring, prismatic atrium.
The south part is devoted to in-patient care, with 22 beds for upper Manhattan residents and 36 beds for research programs, and out-patient centers like an anxiety disorders clinic, a depression evaluation service and a children's day program. The north part is largely for laboratories.
The structure was designed to rise not much higher than the nearby cliffside so that it did not block views from the upland neighborhood. As a consequence, it is most familiar to highway motorists; not the usual case for a building in Manhattan.
"The facade facing the highway picks up on the speed of cars and the flow of the Hudson River," said Peter Pran, of the architectural firm N B B J in Seattle. While at the Ellerbe Becket firm in the early 1990's, Mr. Pran designed the institute, with Jill N. Lerner and Timothy Johnson.
The institute is still moving out of its 69-year-old, 20-story tower across Riverside Drive (where preserved brains can be found in glass jars on lab shelves).
But early reviews of the new building are encouraging. "The staff is thrilled," said Dr. John M. Oldham, the director of the institute, "because they now have a pleasant place for their patients."
The patients are even more thrilled, said Richard Herman, the administrator of the Washington Heights community service, which cares for 950 people from upper Manhattan, most of them impoverished, many of them immigrants. From the day rooms, patients enjoy unimpeded river views.
JUST the other day, Mr. Herman ran into Steven M. Papp, the deputy director for administration, shortly after Mr. Papp and Dr. Oldham were importuned by a patient who wanted to go home immediately. "That's a good sign," Mr. Herman said. "I thought when we first moved that no one would ever want to go home. Compared to where they live, this is like the Plaza."
Compared to the Plaza, of course, it's no Plaza. "We were cut and cut and cut," Mr. Pran said. "So much was cut on this building, that it survived at all is amazing."
Institute officials can point to features they fought to keep, as well as those that were sacrificed to a limited budget -- like the cafeteria, which was to occupy a notch in the building's facade overlooking the river. Until money can be found to complete it, the room will remain a raw shell.
Dr. Oldham held out for two bridges over Riverside Drive against considerable budgetary pressure to eliminate the one linking the institute to the Milstein Hospital Building. "This is our lifeline, our umbilical cord to our patients," he explained.
The new building is 330,000 square feet, compared to 240,000 square feet in the old tower. "Much of the increased space wasn't for expansion," Mr. Papp said. "It was to meet codes, mostly in patient care." This included the provision of day rooms, individual bedrooms and private bathrooms, as well as the elimination of dead-end corridors that required hourly fire watches.
Looking over a landscaped outdoor area south of the new building, Dr. Oldham said: "This is the first time we've ever had a yard for our patients. In our old building, we had rooftop cages, which were awful."
The choice of the site was not without controversy, however. Ms. Lerner, who is now at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, said the community did not want the Psychiatric Institute to repeat the fortress-like, windowless facade that the Milstein building presents to Riverside Drive. "Their concern was that we activate the street," she said.
But the real battle was over the turf itself, which looked like parkland and had been mapped as such in 1966, although it was in fact owned by the university.
In effect, Columbia exchanged its land between Riverside Drive and the Henry Hudson Parkway for the old Psychiatric Institute building, which it will convert over the next four years into a new home for the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public Health.
Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said he had opposed construction west of Riverside Drive since his earliest days in city government. But he was also responsible for naming the spot Dead Dog Park during his previous term as Parks Commissioner after he came across a dog that he said had been "executed Santeria-style."
Community opposition to the project was placated somewhat by the promise of a pedestrian bridge to Fort Washington Park along the river. Mr. Farrell, who heads the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said last week that construction of the long-awaited bridge might begin in 2000.
On the east side of the medical center another "park" -- this one of buildings -- is taking form. It is called the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park.
The first structure in the park was the $37 million Mary Woodard Lasker Biomedical Research Building of 1995, a speculative, multi-tenant, commercial laboratory at Broadway and 166th Street. Its 500-square-foot modules, meant to serve as "incubator" space for new companies, have lab benches and ventilating hoods. The average annual rent is $26 a square foot.
There are now 16 tenants, said William A. Polf, a deputy vice president of Columbia University, including V. I. Technologies, which specializes in blood cleansing.
From the public point of view, the building is best known for incorporating portions of the old Audubon Theater and Ballroom, where Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965.
Columbia once intended to raze the building. Under pressure from preservationists, however, the university agreed to retain the terra-cotta facade, which now functions as a decorative screen for the new building, and parts of the interior. In the entrance vestibule is a memorial to Malcolm X, bearing his Muslim name, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, the dates of his birth and death and the words "Knowledge" and "Courage."
A memorial to his widow, Dr. Betty Shabazz, who died after a fire last year, is to be established on the second floor, said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which controls the ballroom and adjacent space.
The architects were Davis Brody Bond, who also designed the second Audubon building, the $75 million Russ Berrie Medical Science Pavilion, a home for academic researchers constructed last year at St. Nicholas Avenue and 168th Street.
MR. BERRIE is the founder and chairman of Russ Berrie & Company of Oakland, N.J., makers of plush and beanbag animal figures, wind chimes, mugs, votive holders and picture frames.
As it happens, he is also diabetic. And he is a patient of Dr. Robin S. Goland, who had preached for years that diabetic patients needed a one-stop center where they could make rounds among all the medical specialists they needed to see.
"Nobody disagreed," she said, "but we didn't have the space or the resources." That is, until Mr. Berrie stepped forward last year with a $13.5 million gift to create the 14,000 square foot center. Dr. Goland is the director. It was designed by Architecture + Furniture and Davis Brody Bond.
The center, which is to open this month, will include what Dr. Goland calls an "interactive media wall," with information on the latest treatments and equipment. There are telephones and data ports in the waiting areas. Even more important, there is a pantry, so patients suffering from hypoglycemia can get something to eat.
The diabetes center also includes research laboratories. "Scientific investigators will ride the elevators with families that have just learned that their child is going to have to have shots for the rest of his life," Dr. Goland said. "That will lend a sense of immediacy to their work. And it will give patients a sense of hope."
Downstairs, on the ground floor of the Berrie Building, is a new clinic for a Columbia-Presbyterian group practice known as AIM, Associates in Internal Medicine, which serves northern Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood. Seventy percent of its clients are Hispanic, 20 percent are black.
"A storefront at 168th Street is the perfect space for making primary care physicians accessible to people in the community," said Dr. Steven Shea, director of the division of general medicine. "It's a real statement that we're here to stay."
Among the defining touches of the clinic, there are 35 chairs in the waiting area for 9 examining rooms -- a higher-than-usual ratio. "Hispanic patients don't go to the doctor alone," Dr. Shea said. "They bring their families to the clinic. So the number of chairs is a critical issue."
The clinic, which opened last month, was designed by Gran Sultan Associates. "We left in all the design extras in spite of the usual cash crunch," Dr. Shea said. These included wood veneer finishes in some areas, wall sconces and a curving cornice over the reception area. "Doing it nice was the single most important statement we could make to our patients," he said.
The third Audubon building, a $100 million project, will probably mix the research mission of the Berrie building to the north with the commercial mission of the Lasker building to the south. "We think we could have incubator facilities together with academic space very successfully," Mr. Polf said.
Audubon park surrounds a real park, Mitchel Square, a triangular patch cleaving Broadway from St. Nicholas Avenue.
Under a $4 million reconstruction, the once-ragged park is getting a new fence and paving, 21 trees and 1,500 flower bulbs. The project includes the conservation of the Washington Heights-Inwood War Memorial, a poignant sculptural grouping of three soldiers created in 1923 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who later founded the Whitney Museum of American Art.
"We wanted to show the city's participation with the biomedical center in the restoration of the area," Mr. Stern said.
Other city investments nearby include a $2.9 million renovation and expansion of the tuberculosis clinic at the Washington Heights District Health Center by the Department of Design and Construction, on behalf of the Health Department.
Though not formally part of the medical center, the district health center is attached to the core of original buildings where much renovation is taking place. (The core buildings replaced a ball park where the team that became the New York Yankees played from 1903 to 1912. A plaque in the courtyard marks the location of home plate.)
With the opening of the Milstein Hospital Building in 1989, many floors of the old Presbyterian Hospital tower emptied out.
In June, the Anne Youle Stein Center of New York Orthopaedic Hospital opened on the 11th floor. Paneled in expanses of blondish anigre wood, with mini-rotundas where corridors cross, the center might be mistaken for a law office -- at least until one came to the microsurgery and arthroscopy labs.
Integrated Design Group is the architect of the Stein Center and of renovations to the 14th floor of Presbyterian Hospital and the 13th floor of the Atchley Pavilion. "We're trying to remove all the things, like stainless-steel corner moldings, that scare you as a patient," said Barry Erenberg of Integrated. "It's an interesting project -- concealing a hospital within a hospital."
Pearwood walls and granite tiles greet visitors to the new medical oncology floor of the Herbert Irving cancer center, designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates. Flat-screen television monitors are mounted on the treatment cabinets in the day hospital, so patients can watch TV, with headphones, as they are getting infusions.
"We are always trying to make the facilities more comfortable and inviting," said Deborah J. Irving, director of the office of facilities development at New York Presbyterian's Columbia-Presbyterian campus (and no relation to Herbert Irving).
When the smallest patients awake after surgery, they literally see stars -- embossed in the ceiling tiles overhead. The visual theme of the new pediatric intensive care unit, on the ninth floor of Babies and Children's Hospital, is space travel.
FANCIFUL touches abound in the unit, which opened in June and was designed by Architecture + Furniture and the Spector Group. Color is splashed about with cheerful abandon. The floors, while vinyl, have a wood grain to look more like a bedroom at home. Desks and cabinets are made of oversized maple blocks.
One of the architects, Michael Spector, brought an intimate perspective to the project, since his grandson was once admitted to the old I.C.U. for open-heart surgery.
Unlike the cubicles of the old unit, the new rooms are open and airy, with glass walls and doors between them. "When children see other children who are almost in the same boat, and other children who are walking around, they support each other psychologically," Mr. Spector said.
As Dr. Howard Zucker, the pediatric director of the unit, walked through on a recent afternoon, he could see a 5-month-old girl recovering from heart surgery in the "Jupiter" room, a 6-month-old boy awaiting a liver transplant in "Orion" and a 16-year-old girl with leukemia in "Halley's Comet."
Family members are also accounted for in the design. Reclining chairs are provided in each child's room so that an adult can sleep only a few feet away. There are lockers and a shower. Small seating areas replace a large central space. "We created nooks so that you don't feel you're in a railroad station," Ms. Irving said.
"The feedback from parents has been very positive," Dr. Zucker said. "It's not the experience you want in life, but this is the best you can make it."
Looking to the future, Babies and Children's Hospital plans a $120 million, 11-story building to replace a parking lot at Broadway and 165th Street. The new structure will be connected to the existing hospital and contain 100 general medical-surgical beds, 40 neonatal intensive-care beds and 20 acute rehabilitation beds. Ground-breaking is expected next year. The architects are Ewing Cole Cherry Brott of Philadelphia and Davis Brody Bond. On completion of the new tower in 2001, the older hospital will be devoted mainly to out-patient departments.
"We really need to invest in out-patient services," said Cynthia N. Sparer, the executive director of the hospital. In cases involving cystic fibrosis and cancer, for example, she said, "Children still need to be admitted but hospitalizations are fewer and of shorter duration than in the past."
Farther west on 165th Street, a hotel may eventually be built, although planning is preliminary. "At any one time, we have hundreds of patients with relatives who want to stay near them," Dr. Pardes said.
There are other needs, too, as Mr. Polf found when he surveyed the staff on what the university could do to improve life at the medical center. One scientist answered simply: "Build a decent cafeteria."

Property-Tax Rebates

 BODY:
Governor Whitman has proposed giving property-tax rebates whenever the state has a surplus. What do you think of the idea?
 
Save for Lean Years
New Jersey's surplus is the result of the conjunction of a good economy, low unemployment and low interest rates. It is unlikely that these conditions will continue indefinitely. It would be better for all of us if the surplus were "saved" for the day when the expenses of running our state, county and municipal responsibilities go up faster than our tax revenues.
 
JERRY STEIN
West Orange
 
It's Our Money 
 The surplus is all our money and should have already come back. Having a surplus means their calculations were wrong and we got overcharged. Are they collecting interest on our money?
 
BETTY A. SCHROECK
Clark
 
Presidential Aspirations
First, the only reason the Governor is doing anything about property taxes is to appease the right people before 2000, when she might take the leap and run for President.
If she were interested in providing tax relief, why not give back the revenues she stole from municipalities in her 30 percent income tax reduction?

Education Fund
Let's put any budget surplus into a fund for education, since that's where most of our taxes go. I personally don't want a minuscule rebate. I'd rather have that money going into the schools.

Relief for Some
I think Mrs. Whitman should give property tax relief to homeowners who have no children in public school.

School Vouchers
The state income tax was supposed to help finance public education, and thus lower property taxes. Instead, the politicians and government bureaucrats discovered a new pot of money that they could spend. Education costs per pupil have tripled, adjusted for inflation, and test scores have fallen. A school voucher program would halt this crazy education inflation. This would bring down property taxes, by far the greatest factor in the high rates.

Federal Grants Help Gown to Aid Town

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
The gap between universities and their adjoining neighborhoods is often wide, especially in cities. But as urban problems have intensified over the years, intruding at times on campus life, more and more schools have been rethinking their relationship to the greater society.
Against this backdrop, Rutgers University and Kean University were among 18 colleges and universities recently awarded Federal grants totaling $7 million for new partnerships. The local grants will aid neighborhoods near Rutgers's Newark campus and Kean's Elizabeth branch. 
 The grants, awarded late last month by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, are aimed at helping the schools direct their resources toward revitalizing low-income neighborhoods near their campuses and offering new opportunities to residents by, among other things, creating jobs, fostering new business and expanding home ownership.
. Rutgers, which received $399,998, will center efforts on the West Side Park section in Newark's Central Ward; Kean, with $399,129, on the Elizabethport section of Elizabeth.
The grants have been offered since 1992 as part of H.U.D.'s Community Outreach Partners Centers Initiative, said Stan Vosper, a department spokesman.
Even before the incentive program, Rutgers (with campuses in Newark and New Brunswick) and Kean (Union, Hillside and Elizabeth) had been working with neighborhood groups.
But such involvement was unusual, said Norman J. Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers, which will be a key player in the Rutgers initiative.
"Most universities don't take the stance this is important," Dr. Glickman said. "Research in physics or ancient Greece is more important.
Both universities prepared their proposals with input from their respective communities, and often the proposals build on existing programs.
"During some of the focus groups we had, one of the concerns of some community leaders was that Rutgers wanted to come in with its own ideas," said SanDonna Bryant, coordinator of the Newark Community Development Network, one of seven community groups that Rutgers will work with in the project.
But, she said, "It's not a case of Rutgers coming in and usurping the community but rather working with existing groups on activities to help the community."
The West Side Park neighborhood of Newark has about 20,000 residents with a median family income of $17,364, 20 percent less than Newark's and 60 percent below New Jersey's, according to Kathe Callahan, director of the new Newark Center for Families and Communities. Her agency will provide the social services part of the plan, including health services and job training.
Dr. Glickman's Center for Public Policy Research will oversee the technical aspects of the Rutgers effort in Newark, including housing and economic development. The plan calls developing a nurse-managed neighborhood health clinic, an after-school program and a 6echnical skills development center to help people find work. It would also help residents create affordable housing.
"We're here as a resource," said Ms. Callahan. "We're saying to the neighborhood, 'What is it you want to do and how can the university help you in achieving those goals?' "
When Kean University received word of the federal grant, it already had been working with Elizabethport community officials, drafting a social services plan for low-income housing.
The 16,000 residents of Elizabethport have a per capita income that is half of Elizabeth's as a whole and a third of Union County's, said Susan Lederman, executive director of Kean's Gateway Institute for Regional Development, a year-old agency that will lead Kean's program in Elizabethport.
Her agency will help residents create a network of day care centers and create several hundred day-care jobs. It will also give technical support to residents starting up small businesses and work to cut red tape to help residents develop some 1,700 parcels of land.
Dr. Lederman sees many benefits from such partnerships.
"By working cooperatively, we will be cutting down the division between town and gown," Dr. Lederman said. "But more important, we're using many of the neighborhood's existing ideas by working with residents. And we're joining together for a joint future."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/1999 Lexus LX 470 and 1999 Toyota Land Cruiser;
One Ready for the Woods; The Other, the Country Club

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
DID conspicuous consumption disappear with the 1980's? Not where large, expensive sport utilities are concerned. It seems that the bigger and more expensive the luxury sport utility, the better it sells.
Consider the Toyota Land Cruiser and its virtually identical cousin, the Lexus LX 470. Both of these full-sized sport utilities, priced from almost $47,000 to almost $59,000, were redesigned for the 1998 model year and introduced in April. They are unchanged for the 1999 model year. 
 Sales of the pricier LX 470 have unexpectedly exceeded those of the Land Cruiser in some months this year, but the Land Cruiser is predicted to close the year ahead of its cousin. Lexus is constrained in the number of LX 470's it can build because of limited availability of suspension components.
This comes at a time of unprecedented choices for the seemingly limited pool of consumers who can afford these vehicles. Still leading the charge is the wildly successful Lincoln Navigator, introduced in 1997. The Ford Motor Company has an even bigger sport utility in the works. Cadillac will soon introduce the Escalade, based on the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon. Last spring GMC added an even more luxurious version of its Yukon, the Denali. The Suburban, sold by Chevrolet and GMC, remains a perennial favorite and the Range Rover -- the granddaddy of pricey utilities -- is holding its own.
Indeed, the phenomenal growth of the North American sport utility market shows no signs of slowing, and the sub-segment of the large, expensive, gas-guzzling types is demonstrating the most rapid rise in popularity.
Lexus introduced its first sport utility, the LX 450, in 1996 to keep its car buyers from moving into Range Rovers, Jeep Grand Cherokees and Suburbans. Based on the highly regarded Toyota Land Cruiser, the LX 450 added a formal grille and Lexus badging outside, butter-soft leather upholstery and rich wood trim inside, some additional equipment and $7,000 to the price tag. The formula remains largely the same this time around. The LX 470 -- the name change from the 450 connotes the more powerful 4.7-liter V8 engine -- and the new Land Cruiser still share the same basic architecture.
The two are by no means the biggest sport utilities available; those honors go to the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban. Even the gargantuan Lincoln Navigator is a foot longer than the LX 470 and Land Cruiser. The Toyota sport utilities also are shorter than the Cadillac Escalade, though Toyota has managed to add a third-row seat that Cadillac did not.
Compared with the Navigator and its bold, chrome-laden grille, the styling of the LX 470 and the Land Cruiser is understated. Their lines have been softened from those on the previous generation.
The most notable distinctions between the two are the LX 470's four-beam projector headlights, its side body cladding and running boards that match the body color.
Both have a high step into the cabin, but the LX 470 has an adjustable height control that the Land Cruiser does not. The system lowers the vehicle for easier entry, raises it for off-road driving or levels it for highway cruising.
Inside, both the LX 470 and the Land Cruiser are roomy and comfortable. The LX 470 comes standard with a third-row seat, providing reasonably comfortable accommodations for up to eight people. The third seat costs an extra $1,135 in the Land Cruiser.
The third seat is removable in both vehicles, though it is a two-person job. If you don't want to remove the seat but need extra room, the seat splits and the halves fold sideways out of the way. The second-row seats also fold and tilt forward for more cargo-carrying capability.
The difference in interior ambiance between the base Land Cruiser and the LX 470 is like that between the Toyota Camry and Lexus ES 300. Both have all the comfort and convenience you need but one provides more luxurious flair.
The LX 470 comes standard with creamy leather and elegant touches of genuine walnut wood trim; leather in the Land Cruiser is a $1,820 option. The Land Cruiser's instrument panel layout of rotary knobs and buttons is typical of a Toyota. Controls are logically placed, easy to operate and highly readable. The LX 470's instrument panel, equally functional, has the same holographic feel as that of the Lexus flagship, the LS 400 luxury sedan, and is stunning at night.
Both sport utilities are well-equipped with standard cruise control, three power outlets, power windows and locks and reclining second-row seats. The Land Cruiser is available with five major options -- rear air-conditioner, locking rear differential, leather, power moonroof and the third seat -- which, in total, add $5,000 to the nearly $47,000 price tag.
The LX 470, at $56,400, comes with virtually every standard feature imaginable, some of which are not available on the Land Cruiser. The only options are the power moonroof at $1,270 and the Nakamichi premium audio system at $1,200.
The most innovative feature in the LX 470 is the in-dash compact disk player that requires no CD changer. The player swallows up to six CD's, fed one at a time.
Other standard features in the LX 470 but not in the Land Cruiser include: power tilt and telescope memory steering column; memory for driver's seat and mirrors; rear-seat automatic climate control; Homelink garage and security gate opener, and self-dimming inside and outside mirrors.
As for safety features, both of the sport utilities come with standard dual front air bags, anti-lock brakes, daytime running lights and pretensioning seat belts. Neither vehicle is equipped with side air bags.
The biggest change in the LX 470 and Land Cruiser from the models they replace is under the hood. Their predecessors had been accused of being overpriced and underpowered with their V6 engines.
Both now are powered by a sophisticated and refined 4.7-liter dual overhead-cam V8 engine, a derivative of the LS 400's engine. It produces 230 horsepower and 320 foot-pounds of torque and is mated to an electronic four-speed automatic transmission. The utilities don't take top honors in horsepower -- the 1999 Navigator packs a whopping 300. Still, the Toyota utilities run strong, smooth and silent.
Similarly, the Land Cruiser and the LX 470, in particular, ride and handle like significantly smaller vehicles than their domestic competitors. But a test drive revealed a subtle difference in ride and handling between the two. The LX 470 is outfitted with its own suspension system, which is more sophisticated than that of the Land Cruiser and provides a ride more in the vein of a luxury sedan.
On a trip to northern Michigan, the tested LX 470 glided over the state's notoriously rough pavement without notice. The pleasant ride is reminiscent of the riding-on-a-cloud feeling of the LS 400 sedan. Even more impressive is the braking capability of the LX 470 and Land Cruiser. At more than 5,000 pounds, the two nearly match the braking of many 3,500-pound domestic sedans in testing by automotive enthusiast magazines.
The two also meet California's stringent low-emission standards, but both are gas hogs. Fuel economy -- an oxymoron in this instance -- is about 13 miles a gallon in the city and 16 on the highway.
Both the LX 470 and Land Cruiser, with its long history of traversing the African deserts, are extremely capable off-road. Each comes only with full-time four-wheel-drive; a low range is engaged by shifting a lever next to the transmission shifter. The Land Cruiser, with its more adventurous buyers, is more likely to explore off-road; still, the Lexus plowed through a foot of snow on an unpaved road without hesitation.
 The LX 470's extras come at a premium. While the Land Cruiser carries a base price of $46,898 (easily climbing to nearly $52,000 with all of the goodies), the Lexus starts at $56,400 and climbs to $58,870 fully loaded, making it the second-most-expensive sport utility, behind the Range Rover at about $65,000.
But the added features, the ultra-refined suspension, the exclusive Lexus nameplate and the pampering Lexus ownership experience are worth an extra $6,000 or so, aren't they? If one is consuming, why not do it conspicuously?
 
INSIDE TRACK: Very refined, very expensive.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
The Weight Of the World, On the U.S. And Europe

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
MORE than a year ago, when what is now looking very much like a global financial crisis was primarily an Asian phenomenon, the conventional wisdom was that Europe and the United States were strong enough economically to help the world ride out the problem.
Of course, that was before Russia's default eviscerated Latin America's ability to borrow. It was before Long-Term Capital cratered. And it was before companies started to acknowledge, as Northern Telecom did last week, that sales on the Continent would likely not meet expectations. 
 Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International who was an Assistant Secretary of State for economic and business affairs in the Reagan Administration, spent some time last week talking about Europe, and whether the twin-pillar theory of global stability was still operative.
 
Q. European markets got creamed last week. Are things starting to unravel, or was Europe due for a correction?
 
A. Europe is in fundamentally good shape, but growth is weakening and there are downside risks. But the risks for the Europeans are slightly less than they are for us, because they are less vulnerable to Asia, and much less vulnerable to Latin America than we are.
Europe's markets have performed extremely well over the last couple of years, and for a variety of reasons. First, European Monetary Union has cemented things together. Many countries have benefited from falling interest rates. And many are undergoing the kind of restructuring that took place here during the late 1980's and early 1990's.
 
Q. Many European economies were moribund in the early 1990's. The last few years have been better. What about 1999?
 
A. European economies will grow around 3 percent this year, following a 2.5 percent rate of increase in 1997. We think there will be some weakening next year, but the growth will be marginally higher than in the United States. A drop in net exports won't help, but domestic demand in Europe will be enough to offset much of that.

Q. Last week the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. The Germans have said they have no intention of following the Fed's lead. Is that likely to change when the European Central Bank swings into action next year?
 
A. With European inflation running at a little over 1 percent this year, and just a bit more in 1999, there probably is room to lower interest rates. But the new central bank probably won't cut rates. Over time, if the international situation worsens and if growth in this country falls, then it clearly will put more pressure on the European Central Bank to lower rates. But I don't think they will move quickly.
 
Q. In light of all the turmoil, is now a dangerous time to move to a common currency?
 
A. Not at all. If this crisis had occurred 10 years ago, there would have been a great deal of volatility among European currenices. E.M.U. has been a stabilizing force for their currencies, particularly the southern European countries'.
 
Q. Do you see any evidence of a credit crunch in Europe?
 
A. There are not many signs of a credit contraction yet, but it is an interesting dimension to consider. When the Asian crisis began, the general view was that it would have an effect by reducing exports. That has been true. But so many investors have lost money in general that it has created an enormous aversion to risk and pumped up premiums in the safest assets. That is where the concern about a slowdown in this country, and to a degree in Europe, is going to be focused for some time.
 
Q. The Clinton Administration is having an enormously hard time getting Congress to approve an $18 billion increase for the International Monetary Fund. Are Europeans worried about the consequences if that package doesn't pass?
 
A. The view I pick up is that few in Europe are happy with the I.M.F., either. But they are beginning to worry about America's leadership capability, and a vote against this would signal that the Administration and the Congress can't agree on much of anything, particularly on something as important to international financial markets. But the negative symbolism would be almost as important as the loss of the money.
 
Q. Do you still subscribe to the notion that Europe and the United States can carry the rest of the world through this?
 
A. The United States and Europe can grow at reasonable rates, but the risks are clearly on the downside. Therefore, there is more dependence on central banks than previously, because fiscal policy doesn't move quickly enough; they will be shouldering the bulk of the responsibility for sustaining growth over the next few quarters. If there is an expectation that Europe or the United States will slump into recession, that will add to the problems in the emerging markets.

HEADLINE: THE CULTURE OF MONEY;
When Business Gets Religion

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST 

 BODY:
IT'S no secret that a new breed of customer-oriented megachurch is using the tactics of business to win what might be called market share for Jesus.
Like conventional companies, these fast-growing churches are using technology and economies of scale to extend their reach. They focus on who their "customers" are, offering hip tunes and 12-step programs, and they try not to lose sight of their "core business," which happens to be the message of Christ. 
 Can it be coincidence, then, that as churches have succeeded by adopting the tools of mammon, businesses are beginning to focus on matters of the spirit?
Signs of this newfound concern for the corporate soul are cropping up everywhere. Judi Neal, a management professor at the University of New Haven, edits Spirit at Work, a newsletter on the topic that has grown from a dozen subscribers to 1,500 in five years, and will soon become a magazine published six times a year.
The gap between secular and sacred is thus looking more and more like a two-way street. Churches are turning to marketing consultants to learn that new members can be won by giving them spirituality in the context of ample parking and child care. And corporate spirituality consultants are catching on just as fast. Martin Rutte, a consultant whose practice in this area is called Spirituality in the Workplace, counts among his clients Lucent Technologies, the World Bank, and the Southern California Personnel Management Association.
With their traditional flair for euphemism, companies and consultants are steering clear of "spirituality" in favor of "empowerment" or "vitality." When asked about the events -- typically layoffs, divorce or illness -- that most often lead to what William James might have called a conversion experience, Dr. Neal hastens to correct. "In business we're using the phrase 'transformation experience,' " she said.
Why this sudden interest on the part of supposedly soulless corporations in matters of the spirit? Perhaps America's companies are feeling empty, even uneasy, in the midst of plenty. "What's it all for?" they may be muttering to themselves.
Downsizing, too, has made people feel insecure. And then there is the aging of the baby-boom generation: As the boomers awaken to their own mortality, many are turning to matters of the spirit in the only church that they have ever known -- the office.
Of course, the workplace hasn't always been free of religion's influence, or vice versa. Biblical moneylenders made themselves at home in the temple, and in an early example of creative securitizing, the medieval church sold indulgences.
Indeed, business as we know it may itself be the creature of religious zeal. Max Weber argued that the stage was set for modern capitalism by Calvinist doctrine, which emphasized predestination and regarded material success as a sign of salvation, of being among the elect. The British historian R. H. Tawney later stressed that individualism, thrift and a powerful work ethic -- characteristics implied even today by the term Calvinistic -- played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution.
IN a sense, the increasing willingness of business to embrace spirituality is just the closing of the circle. If Calvinism created modern capitalism, then capitalism would prove to be a jealous god whose relentless rationality left no room for any sign of its own religious upbringing.
Weber called this process "the disenchantment of the world," in which magic and deities were replaced by science and technology. In this view, the spread of Protestantism fostered secularization, resulting in a business culture that had no place for religion or spirituality.
But perhaps that rigidly secular culture, which prevails today by both custom and law, has created the hunger we now see for the very thing it has so thoroughly vanquished. Today church and business seem to share an ideology of pragmatism. And each, perhaps with an eye on the other, seems to agree with William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army, who asked, "Why should the devil have all the good tunes?"

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
When Economic Bombs Drop, Risk Models Fail

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
"When we examine banks, we expect them to have systems in place that take account of outsized market moves."
-- Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, in Congressional
testimony on Thursday
 
EVER play blackjack at your local casino? 
 Then the name Edward O. Thorp might be familiar. Mr. Thorp introduced blackjack fans to counting cards in his 1962 best seller "Beat the Dealer," which gave gamblers an invaluable tool for trying to beat the house.
Ever wonder where hedge funds come from?
An accomplished mathematician, Mr. Thorp started one of the first and most successful hedge funds, now called Edward O. Thorp & Associates, in 1969. And he has few kind words for the Wall Street professionals and Nobel laureates who helped bring Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., to its knees. Mr. Thorp said he was invited to invest in Long-Term Capital when it was started in 1994, but he declined.
"I didn't want to have anything to do with it because I knew these guys were just dice-rollers," he said. "I didn't really see where these guys had an advantage they could exploit."
Many people on Wall Street clearly thought otherwise. Over the last four years, Long-Term Capital attracted money from some of the world's savviest investors, and made a lot of money for them during most of that period -- the salad days of the 1990's bull market. But hedge funds are supposed to perform well even when markets hit rough patches, as they have lately. And it is not clear whether the firm's fans had ever scrutinized Long-Term Capital's investment strategy with hard times in mind.
"It was just a mutual admiration society at Long-Term," Mr. Thorp said, "and nobody was focusing clearly enough on the model."
Aha. The model.
Nowhere, except perhaps within the walls of the Pentagon, the White House's Situation Room or the National Weather Service, does "the model" hold as much sway as it does on Wall Street.
Some of the most profitable trading on Wall Street, especially within hedge funds, involves complex, innovative products known as derivatives. Derivatives are financial hybrids born in the guts of a computer and intended to protect users from disadvantageous economic shifts like currency devaluations or interest-rate increases. In short, each derivative, its value "derived" from an underlying asset like a stock, bond or currency, is a little model.
And financial models are only as good as their makers.
"The issue of relying on computer models to do risk analysis is something we need to look at seriously," said Charles Peabody, a banking analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. "They only model for whatever humans put into them. Are people putting in data that reflect the possibility of the financial equivalent of a nuclear meltdown? Usually not. And then they rely on computer models as if they're the word of God."
Wall Street's fascination with computer models began in the 1960's, when Mr. Thorp and others set up the first hedge funds. Such funds, open only to wealthy investors, used computer-aided research to uncover price discrepancies between related securities. Those discrepancies could be profitably exploited in such a way that investors had protection, or a hedge, against big losses.
In 1973, when three gifted researchers -- Fischer Black, Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton -- introduced the first formula for accurately pricing options, the heady quantitative world of finance took another big step forward. By correlating interest rates, prices, volatility and time, the Nobel Prize-winning Black-Scholes model tried, as would an insurance policy, to put a price tag on uncertainty. Models had arrived.
The advent of the personal computer in the 1980's gave rise to Wall Street's young "rocket scientists," schooled and confident in the predictive capacities of computer models. Next to investment banking, trading through computer models became the hippest and most lucrative thing to do on Wall Street.
Large commercial and investment banks like Bankers Trust, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Goldman, Sachs, J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney are among the world's most avid devotees of derivatives, and maintain in-house systems for modeling risk. But those models have often proven flawed. For example, Switzerland's UBS, Europe's largest bank, on Friday attributed its $696 million loss in Long-Term in part to "shortcomings in risk management processes."
INDEED, a series of unexpected financial shocks -- the interest rate increases of 1994, the devaluation of the Thai baht in 1997 and the Russian ruble this year and the odd movement of bond prices over the last month -- have shown that models endow their users with only a modicum of control over their financial destiny.
"We keep preaching how important stress-testing is," said Leslie Rahl, a principal with Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New York consulting firm that specializes in derivatives. "The kinds of financial problems we have had are in very subtle areas, and people aren't looking for these kinds of unusual events when they stress-test."
Long-Term Capital's reputation for savvy was considerably enhanced by the presence of Mr. Scholes and Mr. Merton, who are partners in the firm. But bankers who have belatedly examined its risk models said they were outmoded, compared with others now in vogue on Wall Street. Moreover, Long-Term Capital's model certainly did not take into account the unprecedented recent movements in the bond market.
With bond losses mounting, Long-Term Capital's partners apparently hoped to recover by speculating on takeover plays in the stock market. Of course, what Wall Street calls speculating, the rest of the world calls gambling, and most gamblers end up ruined. Still, Long-Term Capital was able to borrow mightily to make its wagers.
Analysts and some investors said the collapse of Long-Term Capital should focus attention on the shortcomings of computer forecasting -- and the quality of unregulated, privately negotiated contracts -- that lie at the heart of the brave new world of modern finance.
"The banking and regulatory authorities were not paying attention to the amount of leverage these guys were taking on, and they should have been," Mr. Thorp said.
In the end, Long-Term Capital's brush with ruin has provoked so much hand-wringing because the global financial system is built on a framework of mathematical models. As such, the system is fated to tremble from the strains of ever faster and more immense movements of money directed by the inexact intuitions of gamblers -- just the kinds of random stresses that the models cannot predict.
When, instead of just trembling, the financial system threatens to come unglued, model or no model, mere worries turn to migraines. And fast action is demanded: monetary policy shifts, I.M.F. bailouts, or in the latest case, the Federal Reserve's roping of Wall Street's biggest houses into engineering the rescue of Long-Term Capital. Then the models can settle down again, ripe for a blindsiding by the next bolt from the blue.

DeflationHas Two Faces, And One of Them Isn't Pretty

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
HOW can lower prices possibly be bad? Who, for example, is not pleased to buy a new car today for less than the same model cost a year ago? That isn't hypothetical. Prices really have dropped for some models. But beware: The cheerful experience of paying less today for a new car, or new shoes, or anything else may become a haunting experience tomorrow.
The phenomenon in question is deflation, which means a general decline in prices. The word had become an antique from the Great Depression. But the spreading Asian crisis, plunging stock prices and excess capacity (more goods are produced than people will buy) are bringing deflation back into the language. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, now uses the word, most recently declaring that "deflation from the Far East is heading our way." And gradually deflation is becoming a familiar idea. 
 Deflation is not yet happening in the United States. Prices are not falling across the board. But they are dropping for a growing number of goods. Cars are one example. So is some apparel, steel and fuel oil. The Consumer Price Index, covering both goods and services, continues to rise, at a very mild 1.6 percent a year. But the index for goods alone rose by only two-tenths of a percent in the 12 months ended in August, the smallest gain in nearly 40 years. Over the broad spectrum of goods and services, says Mark Blaug, an economic historian, "inflation is clearly converging toward zero."
Zero inflation has a happy side. A small wage increase adjusted for nonexistent inflation represents a real improvement in buying power. Deflation can also be a happy experience, when the next new suit claims a smaller share of a month's wages than the last one did.
But deflation, unfortunately, is not limited to falling prices. It can mean falling wages, too, and it becomes painful when incomes fall faster than prices. In fact, there is a good deflation and a bad deflation, and something in between.
Good deflation was the American experience from 1870 until 1896. Prices fell almost every year, but wages and profits, instead of being squeezed out, climbed. The reason was rapidly rising productivity. In an era of rapid expansion and much new technology, the revenue each worker earned for his company rose despite falling prices. More money was available for both wages and profits, and both rose.
Consider transportation. As railroads spread across the country, replacing horses, more freight and more passengers were moved longer distances, faster, through all seasons. Revenue per railroad worker rose while rates fell. The telephone brought a similar result in communications, and the Sears, Roebuck catalogue in retailing.
"The 19th-century deflation was productivity driven and the current deflation is not; it is driven by excess capacity around the world," said Jeffrey Madrick, who is writing a book on productivity.
Various economists agree. Official statistics show little, if any, enduring improvement in the weak rate of productivity growth that has prevailed for 25 years. A few experts maintain that a new era of rising productivity has dawned that is not yet captured in the statistics. But these days, as prices fall or cease to rise, corporate profits have grown more slowly or disappeared entirely. Job growth has also subsided, and layoff announcements appear more frequently. Rising productivity does not seem to be saving the day.
DOES that mean the United States is condemned to experience the bad kind of deflation again? Not necessarily. The Depression featured the classic bad deflation. A stock market crash, unexpected bankruptcies, defaults, bank runs and bank failures dried up the credit on which any economy depends. With prices and wages falling rapidly, people and companies found themselves without enough income to repay debts. That produced more defaults, and even harder times.
Something like that is happening in Asia today, and could spread to the United States. But having learned from the Depression, governments today have the policy tools and knowledge to prevent this. What's more, they know how to to get a stagnant economy moving again, by using big increases in government spending, if lower interest rates don't do the trick.
If good deflation seems unlikely and bad deflation preventable, the in-between scenario could well develop. Prices would fall slowly, not swiftly, and corporate revenue would contract gradually, leaving less money for wages and profits. Without faster productivity growth, as Mr. Blaug put it, "there will be increasing conflict between labor and management over who gets what share of the smaller pie."

So Far, 'Medicare Plus Choice' Is Minus Most of the Options

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
JOHN REGAN, a retired Bell Atlantic employee, wanted to join a health maintenance organization near his home in Centerville, Mass., on Cape Cod. But the H.M.O. said no -- he lived in the wrong zip code.
"The health care field today is a very confusing one," Mr. Regan said. 
 For people in Medicare, that is an understatement. Congress decided last year to make over the program, the Government insurance plan for 38 million elderly and disabled Americans. As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, private insurance companies, hospitals and groups of doctors were invited to offer an array of new types of taxpayer-financed health coverage.
The revised program, called Medicare Plus Choice, was to take shape this fall. But with only a handful of exceptions, Medicare options have not changed. And by Thursday, a day before H.M.O.'s had to say whether they would participate in Medicare, existing Medicare H.M.O.'s had announced their exit from more than 300 counties around the country, forcing more than 200,000 elderly people to seek new arrangements.
Scrambling to explain choices that barely exist, Government officials will mail bulletins or handbooks early next month to millions of people who, not surprisingly, often have little understanding of the thicket of rules that already govern Medicare.
The new law portends "mass confusion," said Geri Dallek, a health care researcher at George Washington University.
"Is this choice or is it chaos?" she asked.
Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, the agency that runs Medicare, said she "never expected that there would be a lot of new plans this year."
She added: "For the first time, we're going to educate beneficiaries about what is out there. We will make them aware of the choices they already have."
Standing pat may be best, many health care experts say. A Government mailing advises, "If you are happy with the way you receive your Medicare benefits now, you don't have to do anything."
But even consumers who stay on the sidelines are likely to be upset. In many parts of the country, Medicare H.M.O.'s are raising charges and paring benefits. The entire Medicare program is being squeezed between Government budget balancers and rising medical costs.
"Many of our clients already have fewer choices and much higher out-of-pocket health care costs," said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group based in New York City.
The cost pressures are pushing up premiums for 10 million people who supplement their traditional fee-for-service Medicare with private Medigap policies -- insurance that fills some gaps in Government payments for care. And they are clouding the future of extra benefits offered by Medicare H.M.O.'s, which until recently were adding about a million members a year.
The legislated changes were an attempt by Congress and the Clinton Administration to give Medicare consumers a variety of health care options like those available to the under-65 population. Policy makers were also hoping to help restore Medicare's fiscal health: in its latest warning, the Administration estimated in April that the program could run out of money by 2008.

A Five-Point Plan
But the new options will actually add $2.5 billion over five years to Medicare costs, the Congressional Budget Office said, because younger, healthier people are likely to congregate in the new Medicare-financed options, leaving traditional fee-for-service Medicare to bear the burden of sicker, older people who tend to dislike taking chances on losing access to familiar doctors. Most of the savings in the period will come from provisions in the 1997 law holding down annual increases in some fee-for-service Medicare payments. Additionally, premiums paid by beneficiaries for nonhospital Medicare coverage will rise, starting next year. The net savings through 2002 should total $112 billion, the budget office said.
The law also imposed new requirements on the 347 existing Medicare health maintenance organizations. Those not already doing so must start providing preventive services, like flu shots, and all will have to collect data to assess members' health.
Eventually, Medicare payments will be adjusted to reflect the balance of healthy and sickly members in each health plan. But for now, H.M.O.'s must provide the added services at their own expense.
In the new law, Congress established five new Medicare options:
* H.M.O.'s sponsored by medical groups or hospitals.
* Point-of-service H.M.O.'s, which typically let members visit doctors outside the H.M.O.'s network when preapproved and for an extra charge.
* Preferred provider organizations, which offer incentives to go to certain doctors and hospitals.
* Government-financed medical savings accounts for people who feel healthy and prosperous enough to gamble on a high-deductible policy.
* A private fee-for-service arrangement. Insurers, not Medicare, would set premiums and other charges to policyholders and fees to doctors, hospitals and laboratories. These providers could charge an additional 15 percent.
So far, however, the Health Care Financing Administration has received just two applications for any of the new plans: one from an H.M.O. sponsored by the nonprofit St. Joseph Health System in Albuquerque, N.M., and one from a preferred provider organization, which the agency declined to name. Three other providers of care told the agency that they had obtained state licenses to run Medicare H.M.O.'s. None have yet received Federal approval.
Many of the insurance companies, hospitals and doctors who had lobbied to get into Medicare apparently had second thoughts when they studied the new law and gauged the chill of rising medical costs that are outdistancing Medicare payments.
"Nobody came to the party," said David Helms, a senior health care consultant at DuPont, the diversified chemical company based in Wilmington, Del. Some 90,000 retired DuPont employees and their spouses are eligible for Medicare.
 
A Very Hard Sell
Certainly, no one has stepped forward to set up Medicare medical savings accounts, which had been promoted by some insurance companies as a potential cure-all for the anticipated crisis in Medicare finances.
Advocates argued that people who bought high-deductible insurance would be careful about demanding health care, because they would be paying with their own money.
But in a test that began before Congress authorized the accounts for Medicare participants, insurers had a difficult time selling the policies to healthy young people, let alone cautious elderly Americans. The Golden Rule Insurance Company, based in Lawrenceville, Ill., which lobbied hard for the idea, has sold only about 34,000.
Insurance executives complain that restrictions imposed by Congress when the accounts were introduced last year -- for example, they could be sold only to self-employed people or workers in small companies -- have made them difficult to market. Regulations implementing the Medicare option are even more onerous, they say, requiring expensive investments in systems to gather data about customers.
They also require companies to offer the high-deductible policies at the same rates to everyone in a county, from healthy 65-year-olds to ailing 90-year-olds, whose medical bills would quickly eat through a deductible.
"The way the regulations are being written is making demands that insurance companies would not normally be in a position to fulfill," said Jeff Burman, a vice president of the Guarantee Trust Life Insurance Company. The insurer, based in Glenview, Ill., decided to delay offering medical savings accounts in the hope that Congress will ease the requirements next year.
Similarly, most hospitals and medical groups are resisting the Government's invitation to sponsor their own H.M.O.'s. They worry that H.M.O. companies would boycott hospitals and doctors that did so, seeing them as competitors.
There may also be fundamental flaws in the economics of such H.M.O.'s. The best hospitals, for example, would be most likely to attract the sickest, most expensive Medicare patients, while drawing fewer healthy members who would help spread the costs.
And the provider groups would also have to make new investments in computer systems, marketing, claims administration and tracking the quality of care. "Congress required that provider-sponsored organizations would have to become insurance companies," said Mark Skubic, a vice president of Healthsystem Minnesota, a nonprofit network that includes a hospital, groups of doctors and the big Park Nicollet Clinic in Minneapolis. "That is not in our interest."
 
Losing Propositions
Indeed, Healthsystem Minnesota is seriously considering whether it should even continue its money-losing contract to treat patients who belong to Medicare H.M.O.'s, Mr. Skubic said.
Like other providers, Healthsystem Minnesota is reeling from a decision by Medicare officials to limit increases in managed-care payments to 2 percent this year.
Congress had asked the Health Care Financing Administration to adopt a system of payments that better reflects differences in costs -- raising reimbursements in cities like Minneapolis, where health costs have been held down, and making up the increases by cutting back on annual rises in payments in high-cost markets like New York and South Florida. But Congress also authorized the 2 percent increases for all Medicare H.M.O.'s as well as a special increase for rural areas, which used up all the available money.
The adjustments in payments that Congress has ordered have been put off until 2000, according to the Health Care Financing Administration. That was terrible news for Healthsystem Minnesota. Facing double-digit increases in costs, it will lose $1,000 on each of the 2,000 people in its H.M.O contract, Mr. Skubic said.
Numbers like those have dissuaded most providers from setting up the new managed-care programs envisioned by the 1997 law.
Crozer-Keystone Health System, a five-hospital, nonprofit group based in suburban Philadelphia, is one of a handful of providers operating an H.M.O. under a Medicare trial run. Officials there say the group views the plan as a link in a chain that already includes primary care doctors, a preventive care center, social programs for the elderly and special Alzheimer's care.
"It is not an immediate slam-dunk win in terms of profitability," said John C. McMeekin, president of Crozer-Keystone, who has a knack for understatement. He expects to lose $3 million on the project this year and next, but hopes it will turn a profit in 2001.
Nationally, about one in six Medicare beneficiaries has joined an H.M.O. In places where Government payment rates reflect the historically high costs of fee-for-service medicine, some H.M.O.'s have offered plans that cost enrollees no extra premium but provide generous coverage of prescription drugs, an item not covered by traditional Medicare.
Now, some plans are shutting down in states and rural areas where Federal payments to H.M.O.'s are low. For members of these plans, Medicare Plus Choice means fewer choices, as they will have to either switch to another health plan, if one is available, or return to traditional Medicare.
Those affected include 59,000 people in Medicare plans run by United Healthcare, 58,000 in those run by Aetna U.S. Healthcare, 33,500 in Humana plans in Florida and 26,500 in Oxford Health Plans H.M.O.'s.
The managed-care industry recently asked the Health Care Financing Administration to immediately permit H.M.O.'s to raise premiums and other costs they pass along to their members. But Ms. DeParle said she did not think that would be appreciated by Medicare beneficiaries.
Next year, the American Association of Health Plans, the managed-care industry's trade group, plans to request changes in Government Medicare payments. Karen M. Ignagni, president of the association, said that in some parts of the country, Government payments to Medicare H.M.O. plans were falling well below those for traditional fee-for-service Medicare. "Many plans may have to cut benefits, raise premiums or both," she said recently in a statement to a national commission created by Congress to consider the future of Medicare.
 
The Medigap Gap
For most elderly Americans who have stayed in traditional Medicare -- and who do not receive health benefits from former employers -- the struggle has been to pay rising monthly premiums for Medigap insurance. These policies offer 10 levels of coverage for Medicare deductibles and other charges, at varying monthly premiums. The premiums averaged $104 a month last year, according to the American Association of Retired Persons.
"We cannot afford a supplemental policy," said Christina Morgan of Okanogan, Wash., who retired with $10,000 in a lump sum from the bank where she had worked and whose Medicare H.M.O. is now withdrawing from her rural community. "A lot of people who are living on Social Security alone are in the same boat."
Insurance experts say Medigap costs are soaring partly because of the loss of healthier policyholders to H.M.O.'s. "Our enrollees are a little older, a little less healthy," said Robert Hussey, a vice president of United Healthcare, which provides Medigap coverage to 2.5 million members of the A.A.R.P.
United raised premiums 12.5 percent this year in the A.A.R.P. plan and is requesting 9 percent increases for 1999. Other insurers have imposed similar increases.
Marilyn Moon, a Medicare researcher at the Urban Institute, a Washington research center, said increases in Medigap premiums may drive more Medicare participants into H.M.O. plans. Another option is to buy a recently introduced type of Medigap policy that costs less if a person uses certain hospitals.
 
An Employer Headache
Besides retirees, probably no group has a bigger stake in Medicare changes than the companies that subsidize supplemental health care benefits for 13 million retired workers. And they are using the opening provided by Washington's overhaul to encourage retirees to consider Medicare H.M.O.'s, which can save the companies huge amounts of money.
But the closing of some Medicare H.M.O.'s has left employers scrambling. Allied Signal, for example, was "put in a bind" last month when Aetna announced shutdowns of Medicare H.M.O.'s in which Allied had 800 retirees.
The company rushed to seek replacement H.M.O.'s that would take its retirees and as many of their doctors as possible.
Though most employers are woefully unprepared for an avalanche of inquiries -- more than half the 498 companies in a recent survey by the William M. Mercer consulting firm said they had not considered how to respond -- Allied Signal is moving vigorously to help 100,000 retirees understand the new Medicare choices. The company has scheduled 110 retiree meetings this fall, drafted an explanatory booklet and hired a consultant to field questions on a telephone hot line.
General Motors, Bell Atlantic and DuPont are taking similar steps.
"This is not something we want to just step back from and let the buyer beware," said Bruce Bradley, director of managed care plans at G.M. "It's very easy for people to make a decision not in their interest by just responding to the marketing."

Chart: "What You Need to Know About 'Medicare Plus Choice"'
 
-- If you already have Medicare, you can keep your present coverage.
 
-- For now, you can switch Medicare plans whenever you want -- either from traditional Medicare to a Medicare H.M.O., if there is one near you, or from one H.M.O. to another, or from an H.M.O. back to traditional Medicare.
 
-- Starting Jan. 1, 2002, however, there will be restrictions on when you can make a switch.
 
-- If and when new Medicare options become available, the same rules will apply to switching among those plans.
 
-- If in switching to an H.MO. you give up an insurance policy that fills gaps in Medicare coverage, you may not be able to get that Medigap coverage back at the same price if you later decide to return to traditional Medicare.
 
-- If in switching to an H.M.O. you give up traditional Medicare coverage supplemented by extras from your former employer, the employer does not have to take you back if you change your mind later.
 
-- You can get more information and advice from your former employer or from your state's health insurance advisory or insurance counseling program. Telephone numbers are in Medicare handbooks that the Government will mail next month to everyone eligible for Medicare. Or call your United States senator or representative.

A First Rippleof Tighter Credit Reaches U.S. Shores

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE United States is starting to feel the effects of a lending pullback.
The pinch, still quite mild, is almost entirely on businesses for now, and not on consumers. Commercial banks, investment firms, Japanese banks that lend in America, and the millions of people who buy corporate bonds are all becoming a bit more tightfisted -- demanding slightly higher interest rates, and sometimes refusing to lend as much as before. 
 This caution was already taking hold before some of the world's biggest banks suddenly lost money in Russia over the summer. The Russian debacle appears to have strengthened the resolve to filter out potential deadbeats -- particularly abroad, but also in the United States. The near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the high-flying hedge fund, has only added to the nervousness. And the Federal Reserve's quarter-point rate cut on Tuesday has not relieved the concern.
"You have a bunch of lenders who suddenly have a lump of assets on their balance sheets" -- like loans to hedge funds and in emerging markets -- "whose value is not clear," said Albert Wojnilower, a senior economic adviser to the Clipper Group, a Wall Street investment firm. "So the order goes out, 'Make sure that everything is right, and don't take on anything more that might be questionable.' "
The incipient caution by itself has not noticeably slowed the national economy. But that could happen, economists say, if the rising cost of financing prompts companies to cut back their operations, or if lenders eventually restrict the credit that consumers still obtain so freely today -- credit that sustains the economy in the process.
The I.B.M.'s of America, as well as midsized companies with similarly solid credit ratings, seem unaffected. Chase Manhattan Bank says its middle-market borrowers, mainly family-owned companies with annual sales up to $500 million, are getting their loans as readily and at the same interest rates as last year. "The window for them is wide open," said Frank Lourenso, a Chase vice president in charge of this lending.
The Federal Reserve has a different impression. In a survey of bank loan officers released last week, the Fed reported "a fairly widespread tightening of standards and terms for commercial and industrial loans to larger" and midsized companies.
Separately, mortgage rates for commercial buildings are rising. Riskier companies -- new telecommunications operations, for example -- that have raised funds in the past by selling junk bonds at high interest rates find that the market for these bonds has all but vanished. And some small banksare tightening up on loans to clients affected by the spreading Asian crisis.
Southern Commercial Bank in St. Louis, for example, lends money to machine shops that repair Mississippi River barges that carry grain. The Asian crisis has cut into American grain exports, forcing down grain prices and endangering the profitability of the barges -- and the shops that repair them. "If these shops seem to be having any trouble, we cut off their credit more quickly than before," said Robert Hawkins, the president of the bank.
All this can hardly be characterized, though, as a reprise of the credit crunch of the early 1990's, when huge portfolios of bad debts -- arising from borrowers who defaulted -- left many banks without sufficient funds to lend freely. There is no such burden today. The new lending caution stems instead from growing concern that America's economy cannot escape the impact of the financial crisis that began in Asia.
Whatever its origins, a lending pullback in the United States eventually becomes a cause of slower economic growth, particularly if consumer loans are affected. For the moment, they are not. Quite the contrary, consumers are likely to benefit from the Fed's decision to cut short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point, a reduction that is likely to show up as lower rates for credit card debt and home equity loans, but for few commercial loans.
A CUT in the banking industry's prime rate last week, to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent, also benefits consumers more than companies. The American consumer, in fact, may be the last to be hurt by a slowing economy.
"The chain of events, already under way, started with trade," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. Exports have been falling. Corporate profits are rising more slowly. And capital spending -- investment in new machinery and buildings -- has begun to slow, in part because financing costs are being raised. "All of this eventually slows hiring," Mr. Lipsky said. "That means less income, less borrowing and less consumer spending."
Right now, credit flows freely to consumers but has begun to slow to some commercial ventures. Office buildings and warehouses, for example, remain profitable operations today, says Dennis Yeskey, a managing director of real estate services at Deloitte & Touche. But mortgage interest rates on commercial buildings have risen, and the amounts lent have been cut back -- in part because these loans are now harder to resell and in part, Mr. Yeskey said, because "the value of this real estate has fallen despite the good fundamentals."
"Until the last two months, you could get 15- to 20-year mortgages below 7 percent," he said. Now the loans are 10 percent smaller, and the rates "have moved back up a tad above 7 percent for an average property."
Something similar is happening to many corporate loans. For hundreds of thousands of small companies, those employing 500 or fewer people, the average rate on loans of a year's duration or less rose slightly, to 10.2 percent in August and perhaps a bit higher in September, from 10 percent or less earlier in the year, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.
Two other factors are also pushing up interest rates for corporate lending, said James Davis, president of the Loan Pricing Corporation, which tracks such trends. Because of Asia and Russia, many organizations and people who normally buy corporate bonds have shifted to Treasury securities, which they consider safer. The shift drives up interest rates on the corporate side while driving them down for Treasuries; the spread between the two is wider than at any time in this decade.
In addition, Japanese banks that lent in the United States have pulled back lately because of their troubles at home. That, too, has reduced the supply of money for American companies, helping to push up rates -- just as the Federal Reserve is trying to push them down.
"The Fed is pulling in one direction," Mr. Davis said, "and the lenders are saying, 'We want a better return because we are willing to make loans at a time when there are fewer lenders than in the recent past.' "

HEADLINE: PERSONAL BUSINESS;
Narrowing the Bankruptcy Escape Hatch

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
CONGRESS is about to make it a whole lot harder for many Americans to walk away from their debts. And, depending on whom you talk to, that will either throw untold numbers of people into lifelong economic bondage in the next recession or teach them a much-needed lesson in financial responsibility.
Under current law, people who get in over their heads can get a fresh start by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, wiping out all their debts except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support, alimony and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work. Such filings are made by hundreds of thousands of people each year. 
 But under legislation expected to be passed soon by Congress -- it is unclear if President Clinton will sign it -- debtors would have to pay back up to 30 percent of their credit card bills. Such a requirement would save the credit card industry an estimated $4 billion or more a year.
"People who can afford to pay should not be able to not pay," said Tom Layman, chief economist for Visa, the big credit card organization. He calls the current law "welfare on demand" for borrowers.
Many financial specialists agree that it has become too easy for debtors to just say no to their creditors. Dawn Sims-Munoz, a counselor for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service in Phoenix who herself filed for bankruptcy 12 years ago to wipe out nearly $4,000 in medical bills and other costs, urges her clients to go down the repayment path. And she is all for the proposed changes.
"They're going to teach many people responsibility, whether they want it or not," Ms. Sims-Munoz said.
But critics say the proposed overhaul would create a nightmare for some families when bankruptcies start mounting in the next recession from their already torrid pace. The House version of the legislation would require bankruptcy filers who earn more than the median income -- $17,900 for a single person, $51,000 for a family of four -- to pay back a portion of their credit card debts by going into Chapter 13 bankruptcy, under which debtors must try to repay their creditors. The Senate version leaves some discretion to bankruptcy judges.
Currently, most Chapter 13 cases fail and convert to Chapter 7, bankruptcy court statistics show. But that escape hatch would be closed in both versions of the proposed law. And Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor and personal-bankruptcy specialist, said both versions of the legislation would have dire consequences for people who are forced into Chapter 13 and then run into unexpected expenses like uninsured medical emergencies.
"When that happens, it is as if there was no bankruptcy filing and creditors can go back and charge penalty interest rates, say 27 percent, from the first day a payment was late plus a late fee for every month and legal fees," Professor Warren said. "These families will have no protections at all. People will be at their mercy until they die."
William P. Binzel, vice president for government affairs for Mastercard International, the other credit card giant, said that a fanciful imagination might conjure up such a case, but that it was unlikely in real life.
Senator Richard J. Durban, an Illinois Democrat and a leading advocate of the overhaul, said the House version would do just what Professor Warren says, but he said that under the Senate version judges "will be able to deal with these kinds of cases fairly."
But Professor Warren said the legislation was "so bad that if it becomes law, it will last through exactly one recession, and then the horror stories about what happened to people will force Congress to correct its mistake."
BOTH sides agree on one thing: The next recession will be the test of whether the proposed new rules are workable. "The industry wants additional ammunition to deal with the losses they will face," said David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a credit card industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. He said the changes in bankruptcy law were just one part of the card industry's broad strategy to prepare for the next recession.
Mr. Robertson and Spencer Nilson, the newsletter's publisher, said the industry was also devising new mathematical models to measure risk and to more carefully rate customers for it; some lenders are also selling off parts of their portfolios to reduce their exposure in the next recession -- developments that should improve the flow of credit. Both men said current bankruptcy law was far too lenient.
But Lawrence M. Ausubel, an economist at the University of Maryland, said he saw no reason to strengthen the hand of credit card lenders in bankruptcy proceedings. His research shows that the industry is already twice as profitable as banking over all, with returns on equity as high as 56 percent in recent years, though that is down from 75 percent in the late 1980's.
Visa's Mr. Layman said that only about 1 percent of credit card accounts ended up in bankruptcy proceedings, showing that "the industry is doing a very fine job" of measuring credit-worthiness. But he and Mr. Binzel of Mastercard said no refinement in lending could address the shortcoming in current law that allows individuals who can afford to repay some debts to walk away by filing Chapter 7.
Professor Ausubel said the changes Congress is about to adopt "will create a worse social outcome" than current law, by making it impossible for some people to start over. The changes, he said, would also "encourage even more lending to marginal customers because the credit card industry's calculation will be that their probability of collecting will go up."
"So they will lend even more to already overextended customers," he said.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB;
It Wasn't Like This At Good Old P.S. 28

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Ah, school days. In these fast-changing times, additional education often seems a necessity in business. And job-related instruction -- in-house or through extension courses -- is a rapidly growing field. But in many instances, the experience is a far cry from those halcyon days of crayons and show-and-tell.
Remember when the computers arrived? And everybody had to take instruction? 
 Dorothy C. VanLeuven of Cooperstown, N.Y., can't forget.
"This may seem an impossible story," she writes. "I assure you it is true."
At the time, she was working as a civil-service employee in local government for a politically connected boss.
Mrs. VanLeuven writes: "Several of us wondered about her capabilities, especially when she insisted that Penelope was pronounced PENN-a-loap and that the correct pronunciation of Iowa was eye-OH-wah. But that was nothing compared to the day the office 'went computer.'
"We were given instruction in pairs as to the procedure for entering information, correcting errors, retrieving information, etc. When the instructor asked the boss if she wanted to sit in on the session, she said she really didn't have to, because she had the same computer at home and used it frequently.
"But after some encouragement she sat down opposite the new computer and said, 'Yes, yes, I know all this.'
"Then she added, 'What is this key?' "
It was the enter key.
As Krista Ryan knows well, one important aspect of job-related education is communication.
After Ms. Ryan graduated last year from Brooklyn Law School, she moved to Boston to work in the legal department of a large mutual fund company. This semester, she decided to enroll in a course in accounting at the Harvard Extension School.
During the first class, the professor, a scholarly-looking Bostonian, kept repeating the mantra "Assets equal liabilities plus onus equity."
Onus equity?
Ms. Ryan's class in corporate law had familiarized her with equity, but onus equity was a mystery.
She wondered: Was it especially hard-earned money put into the company? A special obligation of sorts? She found the answer in the first chapter of her textbook.
"I am happy to report that my misunderstanding had more to do with a Bahston accent than the subject," she writes. "Ah, but of course, he meant 'owner's equity.' "
Tom Newman of Racine, Wis., who has been working in training and development since 1960, says he has witnessed his share of the unusual, including the time a woman arrived for a communications workshop at 10 A.M., halfway through the four-hour session.
When it finished at noon, Mr. Newman told her, "Even though you were two hours late, I hope you got something from the program."
The woman replied: "I wasn't late. I was on time."
After Mr. Newman begged to differ, the woman asked, "Wasn't this the inventory control meeting, from 10 to 12 noon?"
Mr. Newman said, "No, it was a communications workshop."
The woman had the last word.
"Well," she said, "it was pretty interesting anyhow."
When it comes to workplace instruction, learning takes place at both ends of the classroom.
A few years ago, Ruth Sherman, the president of a consulting and training company in Greenwich, Conn., received a call from a labor union interested in courses in communication and conflict-management skills for its members.
Going through her customary questions at an initial meeting with union representatives, Ms. Sherman asked what problem they hoped to see solved by training. The two officials said they had been getting negative feedback from the businesses they negotiated with. Ms. Sherman pressed for more specifics.
The men said that when a conflict arose, it inevitably deteriorated into name-calling. In fact, they said, they were invariably called gangsters.
"We ain't no gangsters," Ms. Sherman was assured.
Ms. Sherman told them that the negotiators would do better at keeping talks from degenerating if they developed more self-awareness.
The representatives seemed interested in further training and said that the next step would be to take up the matter with their boss. Ms. Sherman scheduled a follow-up call for two weeks later.
Just before Ms. Sherman picked up the telephone to make that call, she happened to glance at a newspaper. The Federal Government had begun an investigation of the union local. Not only was it suspected of having mob ties, but the two officials Ms. Sherman had counseled were identified as captains in a notorious criminal gang.
Ms. Sherman says she doesn't know how things worked out. "But looking back," she writes, "I guess that self-awareness would not have been at the top of their list."
Gordon Marshall of Milwaukee begins his reminiscence with a question: "What sounds duller than training for government accountants?
"As a division head in Milwaukee responsible for training our accountants from small-town field offices, I was in for a surprise."
On the second morning of class, one trainee who had come to town for the classes failed to show up. Concerned, Mr. Marshall set about tracking him down. Later in the day, the man called in to say he had been jailed overnight after an encounter with decoy prostitutes from the Milwaukee Police Department.
"I was astounded but relieved," Mr. Marshall writes.
The next year, at the outset of training, Mr. Marshall extended his instruction to include cautioning his trainees about the friendly police decoys. But the next day, one of the class was missing.
Mr. Marshall called the police.
Sure enough, they were holding one naive accountant on a charge of soliciting a prostitute.
Mr. Marshall has become philosophical about all this.
"After all," he writes, "we accountants do like figures."
 
The Dog Ate My Ticket
 Employees can come up with the darnedest excuses for returning to work a day or two late from vacations and long weekends: A car breakdown. An ill great-aunt. Believable? Maybe.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Tiptoeing Back to the Oilfields

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
IT has been just shy of a year since stocks in companies that serve the oil drilling industry began a long, grueling selloff that has left even bearish energy analysts surprised by its severity. Those who bought last fall, when these stocks peaked, have watched as the Standard & Poor's Oil and Gas Equipment Index has fallen 56 percentfrom its high on Nov. 5.
The culprits: last winter's mild weather; expanding oil production, which tends to drive these stocks down as oil prices drop, and, most of all, the financial crisis in Asia, which has slaked the once unquenchable thirst for oil there. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, which in October 1997 had hovered at $22 a barrel, fell to just more than $12 last June. 
 "It's been a brutal group," said Daniel R. Pickering, an analyst who follows the industry for Simmons & Company International in Houston.
Since June, however, crude has staged a modest rebound, rising to $15.64 on Friday; major oil-producing countries are making the production cuts they promised earlier this year, and inventories are dropping.
The trends, though still tenuous, have generated enough optimism to breathe a spark of life into the battered stocks of some oil service companies. For example, Schlumberger Ltd., which hit a 52-week low of $43.75 in August, closed on Friday at $48.5625.
So is it time for investors to jump back in? Are these still bargain-basement prices?
Some analysts think so, and are adding oil service companies to their "buy" lists. Money managers have been purchasing shares. And executives and directors in oil service companies including Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Global Marine, are buying their companies' shares.
"It's encouraging to see them buying their own stock," said Frank Ponticello, who follows insider buying trends for Prudential Securities.
STOCK prices in this industry are often tied closely to those of crude oil. Some stocks have begun to move up with oil prices, even while the companies post declining earnings and keep their charges low to drillers.
Among the buyers are Howard F. Ward, manager of the Gabelli Growth fund. He has increased his holdings of Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Halliburton.
"They have gone from being Wall Street's darlings to being put in the penalty box," Mr. Ward said. "That's generally when stocks of high-quality companies should be bought -- when they are way out of favor."
By jumping in now, investors risk short-term weakness in oil prices. But if they wait, they might miss the sudden jumps that such stocks often make when a preponderance of evidence begins pointing toward higher oil prices.
In the near term, earnings of these companies may well fail to meet expectations. Shares of Baker Hughes, for example, plummeted by almost 10 percent on Sept. 24, when it announced that it would earn about half of the 36 cents a share that analysts had predicted.
"We're kind of in the trough here," said Mr. Pickering, the analyst. "We just have to get past a period when it's going to be a rocky road."
Mr. Pickering says oil is in a long-term trend toward higher prices, giving investors and oil companies reason for optimism, yet it will take some time for that to translate into better earnings for the companies that provide the gear used in the oilfields.
Indeed, it may take as long as six months for higher prices to lead to increases in drilling activity, and rates charged for rigs will remain low in the interim.
The number of rigs operating last week was 754, compared with 1,001 in the corresponding week last year. The count dropped to a record low of 596 in 1993.
Arvind S. Sanger, oil service analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that if crude remained in its current price range, big oil service companies would likely continue buying smaller ones. And the offers often cause sharp price run-ups.
Already, Baker Hughes has acquired Western Atlas. When the offer was announced on May 11, shares of Western Atlas rose to $92.875, a 14 percent increase.
Halliburton announced on Feb. 26 that it would buy Dresser Industries, valuing its offer at $46.50 a share, which was 20 percent above Dresser's closing price the day before. EVI agreed on March 4 to buy Weatherford Enterra for $46.23 a share, 49 percent above the price the previous day.
OVER all, however, Mr. Sanger recommends big, lower-risk stocks like Halliburton, now trading at $28.25; he predicts that it will reach $48 a share by the end of next year. He also favors the new Weatherford International, now trading at $20.25 (1999 projection: $55) and J. Ray McDermott, now at $29.9375 (1999 projection: $53). Mr. Sanger said that both Halliburton and Weatherford should achieve big savings through their mergers and that J. Ray McDermott is rich in cash.
Sam Z. Albright, an oil service analyst at Jeffries & Company in Houston, recommends Noble Drilling, which closed at $14.1875 on Friday; Santa Fe International, $14.875; and Transocean Offshore, $30.3125. All have large backlogs of work for their rigs and have strong balance sheets. Generally, they are involved with deep-water drilling programs. These long-term projects require huge amounts of capital, and the oil companies that run them are reluctant to pull out. In a September report, Jeffries & Company, set 12-month target prices for Noble at $23, Santa Fe at $26 and Transocean at $47 a share.

The price of oil is off its lows and the number of rigs operating in the United States is well below its peak. Some analysts say these trends signal a turnaround for battered oil services stocks.

HEADLINE: Is Television's Future In This Man's Hands?

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
WHERE do you go to find a visionary in the television business? One place to look, according to Wall Street analysts, is a spare cubicle in a bunker-like building in a neighborhood of aging, weather-beaten, frame rowhouses in Baltimore.
From that unlikely nexus of power and prestige, David D. Smith, chief executive of the Sinclair Broadcast Group, runs a collection of TV stations that has grown so fast he is unsure exactly how many he now controls. 
 "I think it's either 61 or 63," Mr. Smith said.
It's actually 64, enough to put Mr. Smith in the same league as Babe Ruth and Roger Maris, if not quite Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. It also gives Sinclair control of more stations than any of the major broadcast networks -- by one measure, greater reach into the nation's households than the stations owned by one of the giants, ABC.
More important, the spending power represented by those stations is giving Mr. Smith and his ideas influence in an industry that has long seen local broadcasting as the seedy but rich uncle of the television business -- a salesman in garish clothes and diamond pinkie rings. Now, however, station group owners like Mr. Smith may have more say about what American television viewers will be watching than the media elite on Broadcast Row in Manhattan.
Already, local stations control so much of the revenue generated by the television business -- more than $20 billion a year, versus the $14 billion produced by the networks -- that network programming decisions increasingly are being made on the basis of what works best for local stations, not national networks. CBS, for instance, has shifted its programming priorities to attract more urban than rural viewers, specifically to try to benefit the stations it owns, most of which are in the nation's biggest cities. One example: This season, CBS canceled "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," a Western, in favor of "Martial Law," a series about a martial-arts expert in Los Angeles.
Indeed, almost all the new programming in recent years on every network -- including the two would-be networks, UPN and the WB -- has been aimed at young urban viewers. At one point, the entire NBC lineup of Thursday-night comedies was set in Manhattan.
The Fox network is so committed to maintaining profits at the stations it owns that it has resisted expanding beyond 15 hours in prime time; the other networks fill 22 hours. "You have to consider the network as wholesale and the local stations as retail," said Larry Jacobson, the president of Fox Television. "The growth is really in retail sales. That's why we're staying at 15 hours, to allow the stations to be more profitable."
So what's the vision in all this? In Mr. Smith's view, it is leading to a television world ruled by 10 to 15 enormous station groups like Sinclair that will hold sway over what programs get on the air. And when the day comes that digital technology takes hold, Mr. Smith envisions his company dividing each of his local broadcast signals into five or six different channels -- including some that viewers would have to pay for -- rather than transmitting high-definition pictures on a single frequency. For good measure, he also intends to dominate the business of providing local Internet content in each of his markets.
The first step in this process would be to make Sinclair even bigger, if the Government allows companies' reach to extend beyond the current limits: 35 percent of the nation's households for VHF stations, and up to 70 percent if UHF stations -- those above Channel 13 -- are involved.
In the last two weeks, many of the big station group owners have been calling for relaxation of the 35 percent rule. Mel Karmazin, the CBS station group chairman, told a Federal Communications Commission panel on Thursday that "the 35 percent cap has to move, and it's got to move quickly."
UNDER the present limitations, the big TV networks are struggling to reach single-digit profit margins. Mr. Smith, meanwhile, is upbeat about Sinclair's prospects -- even under the current restrictions. "This is absolutely a great business," he said. "I don't think there are many other businesses where you can do a 50 percent profit margin without manufacturing anything. And I know. I tried manufacturing high-powered antennas, and I had to fight and die for a couple of percent profit."
Even underperforming TV stations often manage to hit 30 to 35 percent profit margins. Stations also continue to be sold at extravagant prices. Just last August, the Hearst-Argyle station group bought an NBC affiliate in Sacramento, Calif., for $520 million. That price is about 15 times the station's annual profit, one of the highest multiples ever paid for a television station.
(Indeed, the cost of acquisitions means that the profits Mr. Smith brags about are on an operating basis only. Over all, Sinclair has lost money three of the last five years, and its stock has badly lagged behind the bull market; the shares are up about 30 percent since the company went public in June 1995, versus an 80 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But revenues have increased sixfold from 1993 to 1997.)
Most network executives share Mr. Smith's bullishness about the local station business. CBS has such high hopes for economic gains at its stations that executives have taken to shrugging off likely losses at the network level. After all, the company is now being run by Mr. Karmazin, who gained fame in the last decade at Infinity Broadcasting for assembling an enormous number of radio stations and then bolstering their sales and profitability with his tough approach to management.
Some experts say local stations are bound to be hurt by a range of competitive incursions -- foremost, perhaps, the sale of local advertising by cable companies. But Jonathan Klein, the president of CBS's stations, dismisses the threat. "No cable station is going to have 40 years invested in Pittsburgh, the way our station, KDKA, has," he said.
But with the media industry roiled by change in the last decade, some executives believe that local television will prove vulnerable -- to what some see as an inevitable conflict over the issue of payments that the stations receive for carrying network programs, or to the same pressures of increasing viewer choice that have squeezed the economics of network television, or to a downturn in the national economy that will affect advertising sales, still the only real source of revenues for local broadcasters beyond those annual checks from the networks.
"Local television is still a great business, but I think there are concerns about the age-old issue of audience erosion," said Paul Sweeney, a media analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. "That sets up the classic squeeze on profits. Costs are rising faster than revenues, even though the squeeze is still less apparent at the local stations at this point."
Others see the future for local stations as truly cloudy. "The smart people I see are selling out," said a senior executive from one of the big broadcast networks, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The people who say that stations are where the money is don't know what they are talking about. It's true today, but if you look out five years, you can start to hear people say, 'What's the reason for this station's existence?' Do you need seven local newscasts in New York? Can the seventh station in a market compete with a cable channel like TNT or USA?"
Looking ahead, this executive said local television might someday look more like the newspaper business. "There used to be 10 viable newspapers in New York," the executive said. "Now there are two and a half. That doesn't mean the newspaper business is over. It means for those that can't compete it's over."
The newspaper analogy certainly fits with what is already happening in the local television business: a move toward consolidation of ownership among media companies and away from local ownership by everything from mom-and-pop family companies to local newspapers.
"Ownership is where it's at," said Lowell Paxson, who has aggressively assembled a group of small stations with frequencies like Channel 67 in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and Channel 61 in Fresno, Calif., into what he hopes will be a viable new family-oriented broadcast network, PaxTV.
Making all this possible have been changes in Federal regulations that allowed station owners to expand from what was once a limit of seven stations nationally. Besides Paxson Communications and Sinclair, other big group owners include the networks themselves and companies like Hearst-Argyle Television, A. H. Belo, Young Broadcasting and Granite Broadcasting.
Among the people who run these companies, Mr. Sweeney says, Sinclair's Mr. Smith is the "only true visionary in an industry not noted for producing visionaries." Salomon Smith Barney has a buy recommendation on Sinclair but considers it a "high risk" pick.
Yet Sinclair is an unlikely center of entrepreneurship, a company whose headquarters -- along with its flagship station WBFF, a Fox affiliate -- are housed in the former Baltimore Power and Light building just off Interstate 83.
Mr. Smith said he planned to move the corporate offices next year to a complex in suburban Hunt Valley. But until a few months ago, he didn't even have his own office, sitting instead in a large room that included desks for his three brothers, who are his partners, and all their secretaries. More recently he gave in and moved into his own 12-by-13 cubicle.
"It just got a bit too noisy when we were in the same room," he said.
Mr. Sweeney, who has visited the Sinclair headquarters, describes it as "a bit of a dump." But that does not mean Sinclair should be underestimated. "Dave Smith is years ahead of everybody else in the business," Mr. Sweeney said.
How so? First, Mr. Smith pioneered a technique known as the local management agreement, which allows one station to run another without owning it. By combining sales and administration functions, and creating additional newscasts, the arrangements can cut costs and improve profitability. More than 20 of the 64 stations Sinclair controls are in such agreements.
Lately, too, Mr. Smith has been the most vocal advocate of dividing the signals at his stations into multiple services for narrowly defined audiences once digital television becomes possible, instead of using them to transmit high-definition pictures. If that begins to make television's future sound like radio's present, that is O.K. with Mr. Smith, who owns about 60 radio stations, too, as many as six in a single market.
More than anything, Mr. Smith's vision is bigness -- the aggressive acquisition of stations, which has put him in the position to manage rapidly rising program costs. It isn't just networks, with their huge bills for professional football or series like "E.R.," that have seen programming inflation. Local stations spend most of their budgets on newscasts and syndicated programming, both first-run shows like "Jeopardy" and "Xena: The Warrior Princess" and repeats of "Seinfeld" and "Frasier."
Mr. Smith negotiates with syndicators to buy programs for his entire group -- and if that contributes to the homogenization of local television, it makes the transaction more efficient for both the content provider and the station owner. "There are big advantages in scale," he said.
Like almost all the big group owners, Mr. Smith has also tried to spread his network associations around. Sinclair has stations affiliated with all six networks, to insulate against the cyclical nature of networks' success and failure, he said. But Sinclair has consistently preferred to affiliate with up-and-coming networks like Fox, and more recently the WB and UPN.
On one hand, Mr. Smith said, he simply likes to be "associated with gamblers like Rupert Murdoch," the chairman of the News Corporation, which owns Fox. But he also likes not having to share so much of his broadcast day -- and so many of his commercial slots -- with a network. (Local stations get to sell only a couple of minutes of commercials an hour during network programs.) Moreover, the economic relationship that has bound local stations to the established networks is beginning to fray.
Since the days of radio, ABC, CBS and NBC have paid stations an annual fee, known as compensation, for carrying network programs. Today, each pays its affiliates $175 million to $200 million a year. But network executives increasingly attack compensation as a crippling anachronism in an era when NBC must pay $286 million a year for "E.R."
This year, ABC and CBS engaged in fractious negotiations with affiliates about sharing the $500 million annual cost for new National Football League broadcast deals. CBS won some concessions; ABC mainly ran into a brick wall of resistance.
Network executives agree that more confrontations are coming -- probably by 2004, when many stations' contracts with their networks will expire.
Will there be war at that point? "I don't want to say war," said Mr. Klein of CBS. "But I'd be surprised if there weren't some serious disagreements."
Mr. Smith sees no reason for a fight. The problem, he said, is that at the moment, too many parties are sitting at the table for fruitful negotiations to take place. But if the Government were to raise the limit on market coverage -- to, say, 50 percent of all households -- Sinclair and other big groups would kick off a new round of consolidation.
Then, Mr. Smith said, he might go to NBC to suggest that he become a partner on a show like "E.R." "If I deliver 7 percent of the country for them, I'd want 7 percent of the show," he said, "And I'd pay for that. I would have done that if they came to me four years ago when the show went on the air. Why not? We all gamble everyday. You just have to be more astute in gambling."
No network, of course, has ever been willing to cede any percentage of its advertising profits to a local affiliate.
For the long term, Mr. Smith is looking to the Internet as a place where local station ownership will find its ultimate advantage. "What's going to be on the Internet is all sorts of new information," he said. "My stations will have more information than anyone in the cities we operate in."
But he sees the Internet developing as a powerful revenue base only at some indefinable point "in my lifetime." In the much shorter term, he said, Sinclair and other broadcasters will be able to open up an additional revenue stream from the division of signals under digitalization.
Last year, Mr. Smith endured some tough questioning by Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and others on the Senate Commerce Committee for his reluctance to explore the possibility of broadcasting high-definition TV on new digital frequencies rather than splitting the signals of his stations into as many new program services as possible -- some of them carrying subscription fees. "It makes no sense to want to be a single channel," Mr. Smith says. "Why should I continue to allow the cable guys to pick me apart?"
Other broadcasters question how stations can hope to fill five or six additional signals with worthwhile programs. "There's no way to fill even the shelf space we have today," said Jamie C. Kellner, the WB network's chief executive. "How many of the 70 channels that most people receive can you sit and spend even a half-hour a week with?"
Mr. Kellner argues that the far better pictures and sound promised by high-definition television will be so impressive that consumers will eventually demand it. "It will add a dimension to the viewing experience," he said. "Our industry needs another jolt in technology."
Each of the big networks is obligated by the F.C.C. to establish a digital capability in three of its markets by November. So far, that looks like a lot of cost without much hope of return, said Mitchell Stern, chairman of Fox Television.
"It costs a minimum of $1 million to convert a broadcast tower to digital," he said. "If you have to bring in all new equipment, it's a $7 million to $10 million investment. You may have to buy land; it can be nightmarish. And how many sets will be able to receive this technology in November? Two? The answer is essentially none. You have to go in the hole big time before you see any return."
Going in the hole is not how Mr. Smith foresees moving Sinclair forward. "The guys who are spending money to get a better-looking single channel," he said, "are just creating a better chance for me to go whack them."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
No Room ToBreathe For Banks

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
During a rough patch for stocks in general last week, financial shares in particular took a beating. Though bank and brokerage stocks rallied Friday with the overall market, most of these shares remain near their lows for the year.
Investors may be tempted to think that recent market turmoil makes bargains out of the financials. After all, Bankers Trust is trading at 1.1 times its book value, down from the 2.4 multiple it fetched just five months ago. Merrill Lynch trades at 1.73 times its book value, down from a multiple of 4 in July. 
 Does Friday's rally mean that the rout in these shares is over? Bank stocks may have jumped on hopes that Brazil's financial woes would be stanched by an international bailout. Investors also seem to think that another interest-rate cut is in the offing.
But optimism on both of these matters is not enough to argue for a stampede into international financial services shares. There are solid reasons to hold off from bottom-fishing in the group right now.
One is the not-unreasonable fear that other bombs from the hedge fund world might soon drop on the big international banks and brokerage firms that do business with these risk-takers. UBS, the world's second-largest bank, said on Friday that its chairman, Mathis Cabiallavetta, and three top executives had resigned in the wake of the bank's taking a $696 million charge as a result of its investment in Long-Term Capital Management. The bank said the resignations came after internal auditors found "shortcomings in risk-management processes."
Even if Long-Term Capital's near-collapse is the last fund disaster, the heavy exposure that banks and brokers have to the fund does not give investors confidence that effective risk controls are in place at financial firms. The announcement from UBS confirms that.
Douglas R. Cliggott, head of United States equity market strategy at J. P. Morgan Securities in New York, is wary of financial services stocks for other reasons. "To have confidence to move back into the group, we'd want to see actual stability -- as opposed to the hope of stability -- in emerging economies, a movement toward a more positive yield curve and some cost-reductions at banks and brokers," he said.
The yield curve is a big factor here. Even though the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by one-quarter of a point last week, longer-term rates are still well below the Federal funds rate of 5 percent. The 2-year Treasury note closed at a yield of 4.16 percent on Friday and the 10-year at 4.28 percent.
When long-term interest rates fall below the short-term variety, profit margins at banks get squeezed. That's because banks are unable to make as much money in their long-term loans as they can when shorter rates are lower. So as long as the yield curve remains flat, as it is today, banks' profitability will be pinched.
Bank earnings may also be hurt by the contraction in credit that began with the collapse in emerging markets this summer and was exacerbated by the crash of Long-Term Capital. Banks seem increasingly unwilling to lend; if this goes on for long, the loss of fees will harm financial institutions' results. It will also hurt the overall economy.
How financial stocks fare is significant because, as Mr. Cliggott points out, the fortunes of these companies are inextricably linked to the performance of the entire stock market. Financial companies account for almost 17 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, one of its larger components. Indeed, financial stocks have led the overall market up and down in each of the last eight years. Recent weakness in these shares has contributed to stock market malaise.
"Financial stocks are a wonderful microcosm of the economy," Mr. Cliggott said. As a result, until they recover, the overall market might not. For this reason, Mr. Cliggott sees the market remaining in a trading range of 950 to 1,050 on the S.& P. 500. For how long? "Until we get some confidence about earnings," he said.

You CallThat An Interest-Rate Cut?

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee finally delivered a long-clamored-for reduction in short-term interest rates, financial markets were underwhelmed. The Fed lopped a quarter-point from the Federal funds target rate and left the discount rate unchanged, the smallest move available to it, and said the action was born of a desire to "cushion the effects of weakness in foreign economies and less accommodating financial conditions domestically." Many analysts called it insufficient to relieve pressure on embattled countries like Brazil and Japan or to deter the flood of money into United States Treasuries, and predicted further cuts this year; others hailed the move as confirmation that the Fed now regards faltering growth as a more imminent threat than inflation.

A Rude Awakening For a Goldilocks Economy

 BODY:
It's long been fashionable to compare the state of the United States economy to the blonde in the bedtime story enjoying porridge that is "just right," neither too hot nor too cold. But last week's headlines brought to mind the tale's rarely mentioned denouement, wherein Miss G. is caught napping by some mightily peeved bears. The week's crop of economic reports found exports slumping, manufacturing activity deteriorating and construction spending flattening. The economy surprised analysts by creating far fewer jobs in September -- 69,000, the weakest month in years -- and the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Why Airlines Sputter

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Flying Through Tumult of Less-Friendly Skies" (Aug. 30), Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, looked at reasons for the sharp decline in airline stocks over the summer, despite the industry's strong fundamentals: 
 Not discussed was this explanation: Investors were reacting to an ill-considered proposal from the Department of Transportation that would subject the airline industry to the type of economic regulation that existed prior to 1978. The proposal would sometimes prevent airlines from cutting prices and adding capacity, even when permissible under the nation's antitrust laws.
In the bad old days of regulation, airlines chronically landed at the bottom of the performance ladder for American industry, while price regulation denied travelers the widespread access to cheap fares that they enjoy today. Investors don't want to return to those days.

HEADLINE: Europe Dominates Survey's Top 10 Least-Corrupt-Countries List

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Transparency International, a small independent organization that has been tracking for four years how the public and international businesses view corruption worldwide, has published its largest survey to date, looking at 85 countries and ranking only one completely clean: Denmark.
The 1998 Corruption Perception Index, like its predecessors, is a "survey of surveys," using a combination of studies by risk analysts, opinion polls and research institutions to rank countries by how they are perceived. "No surveying approach is perfect," Frank Vogl, vice president of Transparency International and a former World Bank official, said of the report released last week. "At best we get a good set of impressions." 
 The impressions this year are that all but 3 of the top 10 countries in the least-corrupt category are European -- Denmark, followed by Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, Iceland, Canada, Singapore, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.
At the other end of the scale, from the bottom up, are Cameroon, Paraguay, Honduras, Tanzania, Nigeria, Indonesia, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Russia and Vietnam and Kenya in a tie.
The United States falls behind most European countries and Hong Kong, tying with Austria at 17th place.
The annual index has provoked criticisms from countries that rank low on the trust scale, among them Cameroon.
"The Cameroon Government condemns strongly the arrogance of certain bodies that are in the pay of neo-colonial clusters of people at work to impede the progress of our countries instead of supporting efforts and sacrifices made by our people," the Government said in an official radio announcement.
But Transparency International is not alone in drawing attention to corruption through its branches in all parts of the world. Last month, the United Nations Development Program and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development joined forces to publish a study of anticorruption initiatives in 25 countries that serve as models in the battle against bribery, money laundering and other impediments to economic growth.
"The international community's concern with corruption issues is not a passing phenomenon," top officials in the two organizations wrote in a preface to the report, "Corruption and Integrity Improvement Initiatives in Developing Countries." It called for "concrete measures -- preventive as well as punitive -- that address issues of accountability, transparency and inequity at various levels of social and economic systems."
Djibril Diallo, public affairs director of the United Nations Development Program, said at a news conference that corruption is thought to siphon billions of dollars out of development each year.
The O.E.C.D. has been working toward making the payment of bribes illegal in Europe, where some countries still permit tax deductions for such payments by businesses. The United States, with its 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, has been a leader in trying to stem the tide of bribery in international business.
Officials at Transparency International say that they are now working on a Bribery Propensity Index to balance its Corruption Perceptions Index in the future.
The 1998 corruption index can be found through the Internet at www.transparency.de.

HEADLINE: In the Caribbean, Support Growing for the Death Penalty

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago

 BODY:
Like other former British colonies in the Caribbean, this is a country that has always venerated the rule of law. But the Government here is now facing widespread international condemnation following its withdrawal from both United Nations and Inter-American human rights conventions because of its dissatisfaction with restrictions they impose on use of the death penalty.
The decision to defy foreign critics in order to speed up hanging condemned criminals has been greeted with broad popular support in this twin-island nation of 1.3 million people and with calls to execute those waiting on death row swiftly. What underlies the move and the nationalist sentiment it has sparked are frustration with a judicial system still obeisant to Britain and with international organizations that are seen as indifferent to local problems. 
 The issue of crime and capital punishment has roiled the entire English-speaking Caribbean since 1994. That was when the Privy Council in London, the final court of appeal for Trinidad and a dozen other countries in the region, ruled that prisoners who had been held for more than five years on death row had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment and that their sentences should be commuted to life imprisonment.
Trinidadian officials maintain that as a result of the ruling, lawyers for inmates sentenced to death here have filed appeals with the principal purpose of keeping their clients alive past the five-year deadline. Both the United Nations and the Organization of American States offer appeal mechanisms for capital cases, and local defense lawyers have used them once all possibilities in Trinidad have been exhausted.
With so many avenues of appeal, and a growing prison population, "we cannot fit within the time frame of five years," Trinidad's Attorney General, Ramesh L. Maharaj, said in an interview. "We have pleaded with these international bodies to set up structures that hear these cases promptly and allow us to comply with our national law," he said, "but there are too many delays that are obstructing the Government from implementing the death penalty."
The Government's inability to hang prisoners convicted by juries on murder charges in trials in which fairness is not at issue "is undermining the public's confidence in the criminal justice system," Mr. Maharaj continued. "And when society becomes unsure that justice can punish people who commit crimes, then democracy is threatened and society is put at risk."
Citing the same concerns about crime and punishment, other Caribbean nations have taken or are contemplating similar actions. Earlier this year, Jamaica also withdrew from the United Nations accord, while Guyana said in August that it may soon follow suit; Barbados, on the other hand, has been studying the possibility of removing Queen Elizabeth as head of state and becoming a republic in order not to have to submit to the Privy Council ruling.
More than 250 prisoners are currently on death row across the English-speaking Caribbean, according to figures provided by governments and human rights groups. Trinidad tops the list, with 107 prisoners convicted of capital crimes and awaiting execution, followed by Jamaica, with 47, and the Bahamas, with an estimated 40.
In July, the twin-island federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, whose population of 46,000 makes it the smallest country in the Western Hemisphere, executed its first prisoner since becoming independent in 1983. Jamaica has ordered its first execution in a decade, that of a 29-year-old hitchhiker who strangled a business executive who gave him a ride. Though his hanging was postponed in order that one last appeal of the death writ be heard, the Government remains committed to the principle of capital punishment.
"If hanging is the penalty, as it is in Jamaica, then those who ought to hang, ought to hang," said the Minister of Public Security Keith D. Knight, whose office faces a murder rate three times that of New York City. "Otherwise," he said, "the law will become a laughingstock."
Trinidad's stance is the most assertive, however, and has been especially criticized by human rights groups. "History shows that governments which try to isolate their citizens by removing themselves from international scrutiny usually do so because they have something to hide," the British-based human rights group Caribbean Lifelines said, while Amnesty International urged the Government of Prime Minister Basdeo Panday to "reconsider the retrograde step it has taken."
Trinidad's decision "restricts the rights of all victims of human rights abuse to access the protections offered by the Inter-American human rights system," Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, complained to Mr. Panday in a letter in June. "With this dramatic step, your Government has rescinded all of the convention's broad civil and political rights protections."
In the interview, Mr. Maharaj rejected that argument, saying neither due process nor civil rights have been affected by the Government's withdrawal from the Organization of American States human rights convention, which will formally take effect next year. He said Trinidad intends to reaccede to the United Nations convention "with reservations on capital punishment" and suggested that Trinidad's critics should direct their energies elsewhere.
"The death penalty is not a human rights issue," he said. "It has been made an issue by certain institutions and European countries that believe the death penalty should not be carried out under any circumstances and have made opposition to it a part of their legal culture."
Many of the same groups and countries have made similar complaints about the United States. But the United States has ratified neither the Inter-American convention nor the United Nations' "optional protocol" on capital punishment, and so American prisoners cannot appeal death sentences to the international bodies.
The Trinidadian Government's position appears to have won the support not only of the populace, which is alarmed at a rising crime rate and has long been demanding tougher policies, but also of opposition parties. "We say hang them high!" said the former Prime Minister Patrick Manning, now leader of the opposition, in Parliament recently.
Widespread publicity given to apparently frivolous allegations of cruel and unusual punishment on which several court appeals are based has also galvanized public opinion. One prisoner cited a lack of shampoo as grounds for commutation, Mr. Maharaj said, while others have cited noisy fans or bright lights outside their cells.
"Once you kill and are found guilty, you should be hung," Victoria Joseph, a housekeeper and mother of two children who says she worries about the crime rate, asserted in an interview here. "We keep them in jail too long now as it is," she said, "and now they have come to believe they are not getting enough. No, if they are going to hang, then let's do it quick time without all this foolishness."
But some legal experts have suggested that there are ways of addressing the issue short of withdrawing from the international protocols. Since the death penalty is mandatory in murder cases here, one solution, they say, might be to grant more discretion to judges, prosecutors and juries.
"Our criminal law in many cases is underdeveloped, based on statutes in English law that England itself has revised," said Anselm Francis, a lecturer in international law at the Institute of International Relations at the University of the West Indies campus here.
"If we had the concept of first and second degree murder and plea bargaining, as in the United States," Mr. Francis said, "then some people might be prepared to say alright" to something short of capital punishment.
It appears far more likely, however, that Trinidad and its neighbors will simply move to junk the Privy Council altogether. Here, as elsewhere in the Caribbean, there is a groundswell of public impatience with an institution that is seen as antiquated, the last unnecessary remnant of colonialism.
"The law lords don't have a clue to the reality of the situation here," Lyndon Nebat, a deliveryman for a local supermarket chain, said of the judges in London who have the power to rule on capital cases. "They just don't understand our needs," he said, "and so they should simply refrain from judging our cases and let us do it ourselves."
At a summit meeting this summer of the Caribbean Community, a political and economic body to which all English-speaking Caribbean states belong, leaders agreed to replace the Privy Council as the region's final court of appeal with a new Caribbean Court of Justice. The new body is to have its headquarters here, and Mr. Maharaj said he expects it to begin operating "within the year."
In the meantime, the Inter-American court began a hearing on capital cases from Trinidad on Aug. 28. The Government here refused to participate, citing infringement of its sovereignty, and reiterated that it plans to follow its own course and ignore the tribunal's order not to proceed with any executions.
"International law recognizes and authorizes the death penalty," Mr. Maharaj said. "It is wrong for any country or group of countries to transplant their legal culture into the Caribbean. We respect their laws of punishment, and they must respect ours."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVE: HOME RUNS MAKE HISTORY IN 1998 -- NOTEBOOK;
Expansion Teams Mean Increased Offense? A Myth That Didn't Happen

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Tex.

 BODY:
The 1998 performances of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa just got even better.
No, they did not hit any more home runs; aren't 70 and 66 enough for one season? But a study of baseball's offense this year reveals how much better they really were than just about anyone else. McGwire and Sosa shattered the previous home run barrier in a season in which offense was stagnant, no matter how it is viewed, no matter how it is dissected. 
 "It shows how fantastic a season they had," said Dave Dombrowski, the Florida Marlins' general manager.
Previous expansion seasons had been marked by a significant increase in offense. In 1969, for example, when the leagues each added two teams, National League teams averaged 100 more runs than the previous season, American League teams 110. Scoring rose by 1.25 runs a game in the N.L., 1.37 in the A.L.
In 1993, when the N.L. added Florida and Colorado, the league's 14 teams scored an average of 100 more runs than they had the previous season. But this year the league's 16 teams averaged 746 runs, the same average its 14 teams had compiled in 1997. A.L. teams averaged an additional 1.5 home runs over last year.
The expansion multiple, in fact, did not hold for any offensive category. Increases were negligible, if not non-existent. The major leagues averaged 2.08 home runs a game compared with 2.05 a year ago (a 1.5 percent increase), scored an average of 9.58 runs compared with 9.53 (half of 1 percent) and saw the batting average slip half a point, from .2668 to .2662.
Because home runs commanded everyone's attention this year, look at what happened to them. The league that benefited most directly from the McGwire-Sosa onslaught and had a third player, Greg Vaughn, reach 50 home runs, had its home run ratio rise slightly, 1.91 a game to 1.98, but its runs per game dropped from 9.21 to 9.19.
Last year, 31 players in the majors hit 30 or more home runs; this year that number rose by a mere two.
Jack McKeon, who has been in baseball long enough to remember even the earliest expansion, was among the many baseball people who believed offense would rise with the growth to 30 teams. "You'll see offense go up because you won't have the talented pitching," the Cincinnati manager said in spring training.
Six months later, apprised of the statistics, McKeon was puzzled and said: "I have no idea why. I have no reason for it."
He was not alone. Other managers and general managers were equally at a loss to explain the static offense.
Lou Piniella said he believed that expansion had something to do with the performances of McGwire and Sosa but acknowledged that the numbers do not "bear out for the rest of the league and I don't have an explanation for that."
As he struggled to come up with an explanation, it was clear that Piniella was stumped.
"I really don't have an answer," he said. "I wish I did. The ball was lively. But it was just as lively for everybody else. The two expansion teams basically didn't help the offense much. They didn't hit very well. I do know that the good got better and the average didn't get better."
Piniella might have hit on something there. John Schuerholz, the Atlanta general manager, and Dombrowski of the Marlins echoed his thought about good and average players, and the general idea received support from another club executive who is an expert on statistics and their interpretation.
"Perhaps the diminishment in pitching over all was more beneficial to the very elite of offensive talent," said Schuerholz, who had mistakenly thought that offense had improved generally. "I consider McGwire and Sosa in that category."
When the major league population rises, Dombrowski said, the superior players "have a chance to rise further above the rest." He added: "A lot of the other people are equal so they don't show significant difference. The top guys do more. If Tony Gwynn had been Tony Gwynn and not hurt, he would have put up numbers that would have been career highs."
Eddie Epstein, director of baseball operations for the San Diego Padres, said he had not studied this year's statistics, but he had intimate knowledge of previous expansion experiences.
"Usually what happens in expansion years," Epstein said, "is the standard deviation of performance gets bigger, between players and between clubs. Even if the mean doesn't get bigger, the deviation is bigger and the dispersion is greater. There is a wider dispersion from the mean. This year expansion may have created more extreme performances."
Performances at the high end, Epstein noted, are more readily seen than those at the other end. "You don't get to see the other extreme," he said. "If a player is that bad, he doesn't get to play all year."
Basing an expected increase in offense on expansion, Epstein noted, is a mistake. The increases in previous expansion years, he said, could be attributed to other factors.
In 1961, he said, the Los Angeles Angels played in hitting-friendly Wrigley Field. In 1969, the mound had been lowered and the strike zone shrunk. In 1993, a team played in mile-high Denver for the first time.
"That stuff is going to affect hitting," he said.
 
More Record Power
 Perhaps they are the poor man's McGwire and Sosa, but Alex Rodriguez of Seattle and Nomar Garciaparra of Boston achieved their own remarkable height of home runs. They are shortstops who slammed a combined 77 home runs this season. Allow that total to register: 77 home runs for a pair of shortstops.
Compare their total with those of the top two home run-hitting shortstops when Ernie Banks was, like they, an unusually powerful shortstop. In 1955, when Banks hit 44 home runs, Johnny Logan was second among shortstops with 13 for a total of 57. In 1958, Banks hit 47 and the next highest was 17 by Darryl Spencer and Don Zimmer for a top-two total of 64. The next year it was Banks with 45 and Woodie Held with 29 for 74, and in 1960 Banks had 41 and Ron Hansen 22 for 63.
 
Shame in South Florida
 With all of the positive elements of the season, baseball nevertheless suffered a large black eye with the unprecedented dismantling and deterioration of the World Series champion Florida Marlins. It was an act officials should realize they should never have allowed to happen.
The Marlins wound up with a worse record than the two expansion teams, neither of which lost 100 games, as did the Marlins, whose 108 losses were the most ever for a team that won the World Series the year before. Their total exceeded the previous low-water mark for a defending champion (Cincinnati Reds, 1991) by a whopping 20 losses.
Nearly as many members of the championship team wound up back in the playoffs as finished the season with the Marlins.
Seven players remained with the emasculated Marlins while five were on teams that reached the post-season.
Moises Alou and Jay Powell are with Houston, Kevin Brown is with San Diego and Felix Heredia is with the Chicago Cubs. Ed Vosberg is with the Padres but has been on the disabled list all year.
Others who came close to the playoffs were Robb Nen with San Francisco and Al Leiter and Dennis Cook with the Mets.
 
Leyland to Denver, Unless . . .
 The Colorado Rockies hope to wrap up Jim Leyland as their new manager this week as well as hire a vice president for player personnel who eventually would replace Bob Gebhard as general manager.
Leyland, who left the Marlins last week, presumably would accept the Rockies' job, at a salary of $1.5 million or more a season, unless a more appealing vacancy develops first. That vacancy almost certainly would have to be in Cleveland, an ideal location for Leyland, who grew up in Ohio and lives in Pittsburgh.
But for Leyland to get that job, Mike Hargrove would have to be fired, and the only way he most likely would be fired is if the impatient Indians do not reach, or win, the World Series. Even then the Indians might find it difficult to jettison a manager who led them to the post-season for four consecutive years.
In Baltimore, the Orioles continue to search for a general manager but will retain Manager Ray Miller because he was the choice of the owner, Peter Angelos, who was not satisfied with two successive post-season appearances under Davey Johnson, who remains unemployed.
The Orioles will try to figure out what to do with the team that had a record payroll and finished so far out of first its people couldn't see the pinstripes on the Yankees' backs.

HEADLINE: Catholic School Is Accused Of Shortchanging Athletes

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex.

 BODY:
After graduating from O'Connell High School here last May, Billy Russell planned to go to a community college and play football this fall. Instead, he is sitting at home with a diploma that is little more than a piece of paper in a nice red folder.
Billy, 17, who was a special education student, said in a recent interview that he had been recruited to play football at O'Connell, a Roman Catholic school, with the promise of tutoring and financial assistance. "The coach said if there would be less kids, it would be better for me and I can learn," Billy said in an interview recently. 
 But the help never came, he said, and he failed most of his classes. Still, he and six other students who were athletes were allowed to graduate even though they lacked the necessary credits.
It was only when Billy's mother, Catherine Russell, asked for her son's transcript last summer that she and her son learned that Billy should never have graduated. By that time, the school had released its principal, Thomas Ducote, and the football coach, Sam Zimmerle, and the diocese said it had taken steps to insure that such a situation did not happen again.
The Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools has penalized O'Connell High School for several violations, including breaking recruiting rules, and Billy and his parents have retained a lawyer.
"This school cheated him for a year," said Charles J. Argento, the family lawyer. "As far as I'm concerned, they have to get him the tutors, and I think they need to pay for it. They're using these kids. When football is done, they drop them."
But others connected to the school say its problems go beyond an overemphasis on sports.
"High school football in Texas is out of hand," said Alan Slay, a retired telephone employee who taught computer science at the school last year. "That is the top layer of the story. But move down a notch. O'Connell is a Catholic school not really equipped to handle a variety of students."
In the past 10 years, the enrollment at O'Connell High School, grades 9 through 12, has dropped to 133 students from about 300, and parents have been concerned that the diocese might close its doors. Teachers said academic standards had declined.
And there was another problem. The school's bookkeeper, Cheryl Zimmerle, the wife of the football coach, committed suicide after the school's financial records were subpoenaed in connection with a fraud.
"Last year was the crowning of the bad times, we had so many tragedies," said Pat Teltschik, who has taught at the school for 25 years.
It was the only year that Mr. Ducote and Billy would be at O'Connell.
Mr. Ducote, who had been a principal at a Roman Catholic school in Boca Raton, Fla., said he had taken the job at O'Connell to be closer to relatives. He is now unemployed.
Billy said he had been recruited by Mr. Zimmerle while working out at a local college after returning from Rialto, Calif., in the summer of 1997. Billy, who played on the school's offensive and defensive lines, said he had been drawn to the school because of the promised academic help. "I told them I wasn't no A-B student," Billy said.
Mrs. Russell said that when she asked whether her son would be able to keep up at the school, she was assured by Mr. Zimmerle that Billy would be tutored. Mrs. Russell said the coach said he would take care of Billy's annual tuition of $4,250.
Mr. Zimmerle, who is teaching and coaching football at Needville (Tex.) High School, declined to comment.
Mr. Ducote said in a recent interview that by the end of Billy's first month in school, September 1997, teachers said of him: "He can't read. He can't write. He can't spell. He can't do anything."
Last October, Mrs. Zimmerle committed suicide after the school's financial records were sought in connection with a $1.3 million theft at Mrs. Zimmerle's previous place of employment. An audit after her death found about $300,000 in school money unaccounted for, diocese officials said.
District Attorney Michael Gaurino said he had traced the missing $300,000 to Mrs. Zimmerle. He said his office had been unable "to substantiate any evidence to charge anyone else."
In January, after football season had ended, Mrs. Russell was called into the principal's office and told Billy was failing, she said.
Mr. Ducote said he told her, "We're not meeting your child's need, and I think he needs to leave." He said Mrs. Russell became angry and threatened to sue the school if her son did not graduate. "We couldn't afford a suit," Mr. Ducote said.
So teachers continued to work with Billy as they had been.
Patrick Danesi, a teacher and a football coach at O'Connell last year, was promoted to principal this year. Mr. Danesi said teachers modified work to help Billy understand, read test questions to him and gave him longer to complete work.
Melissa Musick, a counselor, said she had tried to get Billy into special education at a nearby public high school (O'Connell has none), but that could not be arranged because he did not live in Galveston but in nearby Texas City.
In May, with graduation at hand, Mr. Ducote said he had been confronted with what to do about 12 students who did not qualify to graduate out of a senior class of 48. In four cases, he said, students with failing grades, including two athletes, were given blank diplomas. Three other students, including one athlete, made arrangements to make up work to complete their credits. In four other cases, three of them involving athletes, Mr. Ducote said, he had gone against school policy and averaged first and second semester scores and allowed the students to graduate although they had failed the second semester. The 12th student, Billy, was given a diploma.
"I tried to make the best decision possible with the information I had at hand," Mr. Ducote said. He said of the athletes, "These children had been used and just cast aside."
Mr. Danesi disputes Mr. Ducote, saying that all 12 students were given signed diplomas when none were eligible to graduate.
O'Connell officials have appealed the sanctions by the Association of Private and Parochial Schools, which put the school on a one-year probation and barred its teams from going to district playoffs this year.
"It's unfair to the kids," Mr. Danesi said. "If you looked at all the schools in Galveston and Houston, you would find a lot of cases like it. We've been brought to light, and we're doing something about it."

HEADLINE: West Celebrates Mining's Past, but Not Its Future

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: GOLDEN, Colo., Oct. 3

 BODY:
A massive, illuminated "M" burns nightly on a hillside here, a reminder that this town was founded by gold miners and is home to the Colorado School of Mines. For tourists, Golden celebrates its mining heritage with a geology museum and welcoming banners featuring a broad-hatted miner panning for gold.
But this spring, Jeff Keller, president of a Golden paving company, committed the ultimate faux pas in the faux West. He asked to open a mine. 
 No matter that an 8,789-foot mountain would block virtually all views of the isolated rock quarry, or that there would be no need for trucks because the Union Pacific railroad already sends 20 freight trains a day through his property. In the kind of battle waged routinely in the West today, neighbors from a subdivision two miles away are mobilizing to oppose the mine.
Mr. Keller ignored an emerging truism of the new West: the only good miner is a dead miner, preferably a quaint one of the 19th century.
Throughout the Colorado Rockies, mining tourism is a booming business, fueled by 12 mining museums, 13 tourist mines and about 400 mining-related sites on the state's Register of Historic Properties. Resort towns feature restaurants with folksy mining themes: The Gold Pan in Breckenridge, the Ore House in Steamboat Springs and the Motherlode in Aspen.
But visitors should not confuse Western sentimentality over mining history with a love for modern mining.
In Aspen, historically a mining town, Stefan Albouy, the last man who tried to mine silver, encountered continual local opposition until one day four years ago he climbed up to his mining property and killed himself with a shot to the head.
In Utah, protests and a lawsuit erupted this summer when the Mormon Church asked Salt Lake County officials for permission to cut rock slabs from the same church-owned quarry that supplied granite a century ago for the Salt Lake Temple. The granite is for an enormous church assembly hall across the street from the temple. A Federal District Court judge recently upheld the church's right to take rock from its quarry.
In November, Montanans are to vote on a referendum to ban in future gold and silver mines the use of cyanide, which is commonly used in refining the metals.
Battle after battle, the war on mining is taking its toll in the West, the nation's largest source of metals.
Tired of mine permit applications that drag on for years without resolution, American mining companies spend 76 percent of their exploration budgets overseas, up from 40 percent in 1960.
In 15 years, the number of American metal miners fell in half, hitting 51,000 in 1995. With more and more jobs going offshore, enrollments at the nation's mining schools have plummeted, to 1,040 today, from 3,070 two decades ago. At the mining school here, Theodore A. Bickart, the new president, announced last month a goal of overseas study for all mining students.
Five years ago, the United States became a net importer of nonfuel minerals for the first time in modern memory. In the 1990's imports have jumped by one third, to $53 billion in 1996, from $40 billion in 1990. The United States is the most mineral-dependent society in the world, with the Government reporting that each inhabitant uses 20 tons of new metals a year, factoring in things from cars to bridges. .
The impact is clearly seen in Montana, which has as its state motto "oro y plata," Spanish for "gold and silver," and which in 1995 produced $2.2 billion in minerals. But mining exploration investment has dropped to less than $300,000 a year today, from $17 million a year in 1989.
"I can tell you the mines that have closed, but I can't remember any that have opened," said Jill Andrews, executive director of the Montana Mining Association. Noting that Montana mining salaries average $43,000 a year, double the state industrial average, she added, "Everybody I know is going to a third world country, to Russia, Chile, South Africa, mostly places where they don't get to take their families."
The major obstacle, mining companies say, is a state and Federal regulatory process that can easily drag on for a decade. David Rovig, a Billings-based miner who is looking for gold in Colombia, said, "Exploration used to be the riskiest part of the business -- now it is a distant second to permitting."
"These obstructionist groups want to shut down each and every mine," Mr. Rovig said, referring to environmental groups in Montana. Speaking on a day when he was negotiating the release of a Canadian employee taken hostage by Colombian guerrillas, he added: "At least down there, you can negotiate with the terrorists. Here you can't."
Philip Burgess, president of the Center for the New West, said, "We have got a culture where kids are brought up to think that only worms move dirt." This Denver-based study group reports that per-capita income growth in much of the West had not kept pace with the rest of the nation. Mr. Burgess added: "We have replaced a lot of high paying jobs, many in mining, with low paying jobs in the tourism industry."
Environmentalists counter their critics by saying that mechanization is the primary cause for the drop in employment and by noting that American nonfuel mineral production has increased during the 1990's, rising by 13 percent through 1996. In the West, they say, a legacy of polluting, abandoned mines has turned public opinion against new mines.
"The industry will say that this is yesterday's problem, but for many communities in the West it is today's problem," said Stephen D'Esposito, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a Washington-based environmental group. He cited cases of mines abandoned this year because of low gold prices.
Some Westerners argue that the modern value of the Rockies is in their surface scenery, not in their subterranean mineral wealth. Cities like Boise and Denver attract highly skilled workers and executives who are looking for scenery, not smelters. Thomas M. Power, a Montana economist, wrote recently, "The open pit mine or clear-cut mountain top that once provided economic security for a community now threatens the influx of future jobs."
As the Rockies have become the most highly urbanized part of the nation, much of the countryside has become a gentrified playground for city dwellers and suburbanites.
"Colorado has a love-hate relationship with mining," said Loretta E. Pineda, a state employee who recently held a seminar on mining tourism. "Everybody is in love with the historical aspect of mining. But to get a new mining operation going, we run into a lot of opposition."
Agreement came from Mr. Keller, who recently inspected his potential quarry site. After an empty freight train rumbled past, he said: "The resource is there. The reason settlers came to Golden in the first place was for mining."
But on the opposite side of Scar Top Mountain from the proposed quarry, historical arguments did not move David Waddington, whose family roots in Colorado go back 140 years. Speaking from the Crescent Park subdivision, this retired solar engineer worried about dust, noise, fractured wells and disruption of bear and cougar habitats.
"There is a major rock climbing area below -- a blast could go off, a rock could hit a climber on the head," Mr. Waddington said. "The sounds of the machinery running are going to be distressing to people who are there for recreation."

HEADLINE: Force in Bosnia Fails at One Task: A Pullout

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: CAMP DOBOL, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The American troops patrolling Bosnia still run into a roadblock or an angry crowd every now and then. And even now they uncover illegal caches of weapons, as Company D, Second Battalion, Fifth Regiment, did last week when it searched an aging Serb munitions plant in Bratunac.
"This is a .50-caliber -- Russian," said Second Lieut. Jason D. Lange, a lanky, tobacco-chewing weapons expert from the First Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Tex., pointing out one rifle in a menacing row of them. "The way it's fitted makes it an anti-aircraft weapon. That makes it a concern to us." 
 By and large, though, patrols have become routine. Almost three years after the Dayton peace accords ended Bosnia's war in 1995, the American and other NATO-led troops here have done what they were sent to do. They have separated the warring armies, stockpiled their arms, opened roads and rebuilt bridges, made it safer for the people of Bosnia to get on with their lives.
What they have not yet done is to figure out how to leave.
NATO's mission in Bosnia, originally supposed to last only a year, has no end in sight. No one in the Clinton Administration will say so flatly, for fear of angering an already irritated Congress, but the evidence is clear.
NATO has broken ground on a new headquarters near Sarajevo. The United States is spending $34 million to buff up its camps, extending and resurfacing the runway at the air base that is American headquarters in Tuzla and replacing sprawling tent cities with wood and tin buildings -- using a Vietnam-era design that can last 10 years. NATO has made no final decisions on the future size or shape of the force in Bosnia, known as the Stabilization Force, or SFOR. But the Army has already identified the division that is to take over the mission next fall: the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum, N.Y. And the unofficial word already circulating among troops here is that the Texas National Guard and units from Fort Carson, Colo., are supposed to replace them.
As NATO contemplates air and missile strikes to stop President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the experience here underscores this fact: If the United States and NATO are going to intervene in the Balkans, they should expect to be there for a very long time.
Even though Bosnia's war ended nearly three years ago, many central promises of the Dayton accords remain unfulfilled. Sarajevo's streets bustle with reconstruction and night life, but most of the country is economically listless.
The unified government institutions envisioned at Dayton barely function -- and only then under the pressure of foreign envoys. Only a few refugees driven during the war from areas now dominated by ethnic rivals have been able, or willing, to return.
The Clinton Administration took heart in national elections three weeks ago that came and went without significant violence and in which several moderates won office. But the Bosnian Serbs chose an ardent nationalist, Nikola Poplasen, as their president, rejecting the candidate with Western backing.
"They do not want us here," said Sgt. Robert V. Jones, as he patrolled Zvornik, a Bosnian Serb city hard on the Drina River, where posters of the Bosnian Serbs' wartime leader, Radovan Karadzic, a suspected war criminal, still hang in shop windows. "You can tell by the look in their eyes."
Yet very few here -- from soldiers to Bosnians themselves -- believe that the American and NATO troops can leave any time soon.
NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said that the NATO forces had completed "99 percent of the military tasks" given to them. Yet he warned that there was "a very high risk of eventual outbreak of conflict" if they dared go home.
Echoing Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who visited Sarajevo last weekend, General Clark said the international organizations that saturate this country with an alphabet stew of acronyms now had to do more to carry out what he insisted are solely civilian or police matters.
"NATO cannot do the civil implementation tasks for these international civilian authorities," he said in an interview. "And they can't do them without our presence. That's the dilemma."
He and others at the Pentagon have steadfastly resisted calls by the international organizations and some Clinton Administration officials to broaden NATO's mandate, using its resources and power to do more, like chase suspected war criminals or escort refugees back to their former homes.
In effect, NATO troops have become Bosnia's protectors, at once removed from the population and the only bulwark against renewed fighting. More than 60,000 heavily armed NATO troops poured into Bosnia just after the Dayton accords were signed in December 1995. Tensions have subsided since, and the force has dropped by half, to about 33,000, including 7,500 Americans -- a strong presence throughout Bosnia.
In the northern sector controlled by the United States, American troops roam every day in slow-moving convoys of armored Humvees. The United States still has tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles here, but they rarely leave base and only then to keep from getting rusty.
At Camp Dobol, along the line of separation between the Serb and Muslim-Croat areas of Bosnia, as many as two dozen patrols rumble past the heavily fortified gates every day.
The patrols have become so routine that the camp's commander, Lieut. Col. Robert R. Brown of the First Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, said the biggest enemy facing the American troops is complacency. "You have to stay ready," he said. Even though the war is long over, every soldier leaves the base armed and dressed in full combat gear, including a helmet and flak vest, underscoring the Pentagon's overarching concern about casualties.
Since the bombings of the American Embassies in East Africa and the American retaliation against those believed to be behind them, soldiers have had to wear the gear even on base.
Capt. Scott B. Roberts, who led a recent patrol of Humvees from Company B, Second Battalion, Eighth Regiment, said his particular missions usually had one objective: letting the Serbs know that NATO was around.
Often the patrols amount to little more than a drive around, but Captain Roberts's company clambered out of their Humvees in Zvornik and wandered into the city, which was ethnically mixed before the Serbs drove out Muslims at the start of the war in 1992. Under leery, if not hostile, gazes, he stopped at an empty lot, all that remains of Zvornik's mosque.
From Zvornik, the patrol wound through the Lukovina Valley, passing ghostly villages where every house was reduced to charred ruins. At Sutanovici, a formerly Muslim town now utterly deserted, Captain Roberts stopped to question Serbs collecting wood for the coming winter. His lieutenant, David P. Nelson, jotted down their license-plate numbers. The point, Captain Roberts said, was to learn if they knew of anyone trying to return to the village, something that could easily inflame tensions. But the exchange underscored the limits of NATO's military mission.
One of the Serbs, Milos Jerkic, said he used to live in a suburb of Sarajevo, but had to leave after Dayton awarded that territory to the Muslim-Croat Federation. What he wants most is to go home.
"I used to have a store there," he said. "Now I am chopping wood."
The captain told him that resettlement is not NATO's job. Others say NATO can and should do more.
Maj. James L. Morgan, a marine assigned to the civil-affairs unit at the American headquarters in Tuzla, said the Americans should shed combat gear -- the troops, he said, are "all turtled up" -- and, like the most of the other NATO troops here, have more contact with the Bosnians themselves, Serb, Croat or Muslim. He said they should act more like community police officers back home, walking instead of patrolling from Humvees. "We've got too many combat soldiers out here," Major Morgan said as he drove a Humvee to Olovo, where he met with local officials. "If we're ever going to implement the Dayton accords, we need to get SFOR more involved."
Whatever NATO's exact role, few doubt its necessity. An entire company from Camp Demi, which the troops like to say was named for the actress Demi Moore, was dispatched the other day to guard investigators from the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague as they began excavating a mass grave in mountains south of Srebrenica, where as many as 7,000 Muslim men and boys are believed to have been massacred in July 1995.
"The people who did this are still running around," said Steve Gardner, head of the tribunal's forensics team in Bosnia. When his team finished its work, a convoy escorted them back through Serb-held territory, a three-hour journey. Another platoon of 30 soldiers set up camp near the grave site, where they will stay until the work is done.

HEADLINE: Fast-Selling Thrillers Depict Prophetic View of Final Days

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

 BODY:
In an instant, millions of people disappear from the face of the earth, shedding their clothing, shoes, eyeglasses and jewelry. While terrified relatives grieve, the speculation begins. Were they snatched by aliens? Vaporized by a spontaneous chemical reaction? Kidnapped by terrorists?
No, what has occurred is the Rapture. Jesus Christ has returned to take the genuine Christians to heaven, fulfilling the prophecy in the Biblical Book of Revelation. The rest of humankind is left behind to suffer seven years of social chaos, wars, a killer earthquake and the wrath of the Antichrist, who achieves global omnipotence as Secretary General of the United Nations. 
 So goes the plot of "Left Behind," a series of four books of apocalyptic fiction that have sold nearly three million copies, about as many as the typical John Grisham novel. The series made publishing history in September when all four of the books ascended to the top four slots on Publishers Weekly magazine's lists of religion best sellers in hardcover and paperback.
The "Left Behind" phenomenon, scholars say, is one indication of the public's fixation on the approaching millennium and the widespread anticipation that the year 2000 portends some earth-shattering event. While the "Left Behind" series, co-written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, relies on a controversial interpretation of the Bible embraced by many evangelical and fundamentalist Christians, publishing analysts say that the books have crossed over into a broader audience, attracting even secular readers with prose that reads like a paperback thriller.
"They're cashing in on the public preoccupation with the year 2000," said Paul Boyer, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin and author of "When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern American Culture" (Harvard University Press, 1992). "The message is that you can't do anything about what's happening in the world. The larger pattern of prophecy is unfolding, but you can save yourself, so accept Christ today, and you will be among those who are Raptured. You will be saved."
The "Left Behind" books are among a proliferation of books on the final days that are best sellers at Christian bookstores. Among them are "Prosperity and the Coming Apocalypse" by Jim Bakker, the television evangelist once tainted by scandal, with Ken Abraham, and "Final Dawn Over Jerusalem" by John Hagee, a religious broadcaster. Both books were published this year by Thomas Nelson Publishers.
But the "Left Behind" series has crossed over from Christian to secular audience by selling well in commercial outlets like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, said Phyllis Tickle, contributing editor in religion at Publishers Weekly. "This says that indeed they have pervaded our culture," she said.
The most recent book in the series, all published by Tyndale House Publishers, is "Soul Harvest." It was released in June and occupies the top spot on the religion hardcover list, while the top three religion paperback spots are occupied by the series' first three books: "Left Behind" (1995), "Tribulation Force" (1996) and "Nicolae" (1997).
The books have appeared on the expanded version of the New York Times list of best sellers, visible only on the newspaper's Web site, with "Soul Harvest" in 18th place on Sept. 6. The books have not appeared in the top 10 of the list, probably because the newspaper does not track sales at speciality bookstores, such as Christian bookstores, those who compile the list said.
Readers are writing the publisher's Web site, which receives about 80,000 electronic visits every day, to say that the books have prompted them, their friends or family members to become born-again Christians. The books have also generated a companion children's series, a music CD and hats and T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan "Don't Be Left Behind." The authors plan to write at least four more books for the adult series and a movie is in the works.
Mr. LaHaye is an evangelical Christian minister, a conservative political commentator and the author of 35 books on family life, creationism and Biblical prophecy. Mr. Jenkins is a former journalist who has written more than 100 books, including marriage and family advice, biographies of sports figures, and who writes a syndicated comic strip, "Gil Thorp."
Both authors say they believe that the Rapture could take place at any moment because, they say, every major prophecy that the Bible says will precede the Rapture has already been fulfilled.
Even though the books make no explicit reference to the year 2000, they are set in the present or the very near future and make reference to popular fears of social, economic and political turbulence.
Mr. LaHaye even interprets the year 2000 computer problem, in which computers that use two digits to indicate the year may interpret 2000 as 1900, as a sign of the coming apocalypse.
"It very well could trigger a financial meltdown," he told readers on the Web site, "leading to an international depression, which would make it possible for the Antichrist or his emissaries to establish a one-world currency or a one-world economic system, which will dominate the world commercially until it is destroyed."
The "Left Behind" books are intended to appeal not only to committed Christians, but also to half-hearted churchgoers and skeptical seculars, Mr. Jenkins said. The formula combines Tom Clancy-like suspense with touches of romance, high-tech flash and Biblical references.
"The way to make prophecy clear to people," Mr. Jenkins said, "is to put it in fiction, to say, 'If this was you, here's what would happen, here's how a normal person would react if they were left behind.' "
Carol Robison, a day-care worker in Ozark, Mo., said in an interview: "The book puts it in focus for you -- this is what is going to happen."
The books are being used as a tool for evangelism, drawing in non-Christians or those who have left the church. Aaron Williamson, 33, who said he had become "disillusioned with religion" and left the church as a teen-ager, was given a copy of "Left Behind" by his supervisor at a warehouse company in Richmond, Va. Mr. Williamson said he finally read one page and was hooked.
"It impacted me more than any book I've ever read before," he said.
In their collaboration, Mr. LaHaye wrote chronological charts explaining his interpretation of the sequence of events in the Book of Revelation, and Mr. Jennings used those as a framework for creating the characters and plot twists. Revelation is the New Testament's final book, which has been interpreted through the ages in myriad ways. Some consider it a historical allegory about the Roman Empire's oppression of Jesus's followers, while those who read the Bible literally tend to regard Revelation as prediction.
The heroes in "Left Behind" are Rayford Steele, a 747 airline pilot whose devout Christian wife and young son have disappeared in the Rapture, and Buck Williams, a cynical journalist for a magazine whose assignment is to find the truth behind the disappearances. After realizing what happened to his wife and son, Steele turns to Christ and gradually convinces his skeptical daughter, Chloe, and Williams to believe the Rapture has occurred, confess their sins and accept Christ.
The three of them join the "Tribulation Force," a crew of committed Christians secretly fighting the evil Antichrist. The Antichrist appears disguised as a charismatic Romanian politician named Nicolae Carpathia, who takes over the United Nations and quickly establishes one-world government, one religion and one currency.
The plot's suspense relies on the assumption that the people "left behind" after the Rapture still have a chance to declare for Christ and save their souls. But this is an interpretation of the Book of Revelation that, while defended by Mr. LaHaye with citations from Scripture, many Christians and scholars of the New Testament find highly unorthodox.
John J. Collins, a professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School and an editor of the "Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism" (Continuum, 1998), said in an interview: "What I've not heard of is an interval for repenters after the first Rapture. That's news to me. It's an interpretation that is far from standard."

Jenkins, is among best-selling religious books. (Mark Graham for The New York Times)(pg. 30)

HEADLINE: Feud Eclipses Time of Glory For Leader Of Malaysia

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was notable as a man with a bold vision: a physical and social transformation that would push this nation into the forefront of world affairs.
It almost came true. 
 In 17 years as Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir, 72, who is a medical doctor, fostered an economic liberalization that led to some of the world's fastest rates of growth.
He drove Malaysians to be more productive, to embrace high technology and to begin major investments around the world. He created a national affirmative-action program that allowed the country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians to share in improved living standards and a new sense of Malaysian identity and pride.
Nineteen ninety-eight was to have been Dr. Mahathir's year of triumph, perhaps paving the way for his retirement, with the inauguration of huge public works projects and impressive gatherings of foreign leaders and sportsmen.
But today, in a dizzying turnaround, Malaysia is on Asia's critical list, its economy teetering and its stability shaken by what seems to have been an entirely avoidable political cat fight.
Last month, Dr. Mahathir dismissed and arrested his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him of corruption and illegal sex acts. The move set off street demonstrations and aroused international condemnation, particularly from Mr. Anwar's many friends in foreign governments.
One of the region's most stable and prosperous nations is suddenly in an uproar.
It appears that, as in Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the pressures of economic collapse have spawned a political crisis. In all those nations, the result was a change in leadership. The question now is: Is Dr. Mahathir next?
The answer is far from clear. Unlike Indonesia, Malaysia has shown few signs of simmering discontent. The ouster of former President Suharto in Indonesia had been predicted by many people. Almost no one seems to have foreseen the eruption here.
Malaysia is not familiar with political demonstrations. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. Many people here were puzzled and disturbed when they encountered water cannon and the riot police on the streets in recent weeks.
"What we're seeing is unprecedented," said Ambassador John R. Malott of the United States. "This has never happened in Malaysia, and nobody knows where it's going to go. You can write a lot of scenarios, but we are in totally uncharted waters."
Dr. Mahathir, the confident nation-builder, seems to be flailing as he watches his legacy crumble. An economy that had been growing at more than 8 percent a year for the last decade is now headed for a contraction of perhaps 6 percent.
Angry and frustrated, he closed Malaysia off to international financial markets one month ago, turning his back on the foreign investors whom he once embraced and who had fueled the rapid growth.
The move had the intended effect of bringing home the Malaysian currency, insulating it from the speculators whom Dr. Mahathir blames for the crisis and giving an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained economy.
It is a move that seems in tune with a recent round of questioning of the economic orthodoxy of the International Monetary Fund. But few foreign economists expect it to work for long.
"Mahathir is attacking the fundamental beliefs of the free market, of capitalism, of Wall Street," a foreign diplomat said. "We are either watching economic theory being rewritten or reconfirmed -- and I don't think it's being rewritten."
The day after making his economic gamble, Dr. Mahathir set off the most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismissing Mr. Anwar, the man he had been grooming to be his successor.
Two weeks later, Mr. Anwar was arrested at his home and held incommunicado for 10 days, during which he says he was beaten by his jailers. Last week he was charged with 10 counts of corruption and sexual misconduct that could result in a prison term of up to 34 years.
The harshness of those moves unleashed a surge of largely unsuspected discontent that mobilized Mr. Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals and politically assertive Muslims.
For the first time in decades, Malaysians by the thousands demonstrated in the streets and in mosques and were met with tear gas and water cannon. Many people were beaten and hundreds were detained, although most were later released.

HEADLINE: Tottering Into the Spandex Era;
Bankrupt, Downtown Athletic Club Tries to Hold On

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Kevin C. Murphy counts himself as one of the Downtown Athletic Club's biggest fans, so he seemed a little embarrassed that he was the only person shooting hoops in the cavernous indoor basketball court before lunch one recent weekday.
It is hard to believe, he said, "but when I first joined the club, there was a waiting list and 4,000 members." 
 That was back in 1976, and since then the place itself has not changed much. An odd combination of gentlemen's club and gymnasium, it remains to this day one of the few spots in the city where a member can play a fierce game of squash, simmer in the steam room, take a cold plunge, shoot a round of billiards, eat a chicken pot pie and cap it all off with a Scotch and cigar at what may be New York's longest bar. (It is more than 70 feet long.)
But fewer and fewer people seem interested in doing all these things, at least under one roof. That helps explain how the Downtown Athletic Club, home of college football's Heisman Trophy, finds itself in dire straits.
Membership is dwindling, to under 1,300. The building, at 19 West Street near the tip of lower Manhattan, is crumbling. And the club's financial affairs are in utter disarray. (It is in bankruptcy and owes the city more than $3 million in back taxes.)
To pay off its back taxes without hocking the Heisman, the club is trying to find a way to use its other asset, its building, which dates from 1930.
But a series of nasty disputes has broken out, pitting members against one another, against a group of real estate developers who sought to buy and renovate the building, and, most recently, against the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, which wants to preserve the Art Deco exterior of the club's 35-story structure. That desire may stymie another developer's effort to upgrade the building and rescue the club.
Like so many New York battles, this one is over real estate. But it is also a fight for the soul of an old-fashioned institution that some people believe has outlived its time.
"We tried to work with them to allow the club and its heritage to go forward, to bring the facility into the 21st century so it could be enjoyed by a lot more people," said M. James Spitzer, the lawyer for the real estate developers who tried to buy the club's building and now hold the mortgage on it. But the members "all know each other -- the few that use it -- and don't want anyone else in there," Mr. Spitzer said.
The members don't see it quite that way. "Why shouldn't we keep something that has made important contributions to the city for 50 years?" asked William J. Dockery, who, as the club's new president, is quarterbacking its latest effort to stave off oblivion. The developers, Mr. Dockery contended, "want to change the entire fabric of the place, and make it like the Equinox or the Vertical, a froufrou club with several thousand members."
"Froufrou" is not a word anyone would use to describe the Downtown Athletic Club. Masculine, yes. Impressive, perhaps. Empty, often.
True, there is a jazzy floor full of stationary bikes and Stairmasters, where televisions are tuned to CNBC, music blares and mirrors glare, just as at most health clubs.
But that floor seems almost jarringly out of place in a building where time seems to have stopped decades ago. On the 18th floor is a big boxing ring, where the former heavyweight boxer Gerry Cooney gives lessons some afternoons -- and where some of the plaster has fallen from the high ceiling.
The 12th floor is given over to an Olympic-size swimming pool, with a balcony from which viewers can watch the slow strokes of the half-dozen swimmers below.
The top floors of the building, full of small rooms that members and outsiders can rent by the day, week or month, are generous with their harbor views but stingy with their bathrooms, which have stall showers, just like in college.
On the sixth floor, "The locker rooms are kind of grubby, but frankly, I don't care," said Byron Klapper, a bond-insurance executive who has been a club member for almost 20 years. He boasts that Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most famous felons in the 1980's, once had the locker a few doors down.
On the fifth floor is the women's locker room, which can best be described as pink. The club was one of the first of Manhattan's men's clubs to admit women, which it did in the late 1970's. About 10 percent of the members are women.
This early effort to increase membership had mixed results, Mr. Murphy recalled. "One hundred women joined -- but 75 old-timers, the guys who like to smoke cigars and play dominoes, resigned," he said.
In general, change has come hard for the club. Luigi D'Angelo, who has worked there for 36 years, and now oversees the food service, said that the members who eat there would be disappointed if they could not get their corned beef and cabbage every Wednesday, followed by corned beef hash every Thursday.
Where else would the dining room include three billiard tables at one end? What other place has anything like the Heisman Room, a wood-paneled retreat covered with portraits of famous football players? What other place has the fabled trophy, a bronze statue of a football player stiff-arming his way to victory, a replica of which has been awarded to the best college player in the country every year since 1935? And if the carpet in the lobby where the Heisman Trophy stands is a little threadbare, so what?
Still, almost all private clubs in cities across the country ran into trouble in the early 1990's. "When Congress took away the club-dues tax deduction, that particularly hurt city clubs," said Elizabeth Hart, a vice president of the National Club Association in Washington. "Instead of sending six executives to join a club, companies might only send two."
The Downtown Athletic Club also faced special problems. Many of its members worked at stock brokerage firms and investment banks that merged out of existence or moved uptown. Shipping concerns started leaving lower Manhattan in favor of New Jersey, and law firms dispersed all over the city.
Oddly, perhaps, New Yorkers' increasing interest in healthy living also hurt the club. For one thing, a member who consumes a three-martini lunch is far more profitable for the club than a member who spends an hour playing pickup basketball.
For another, spandex-clad single people have increasingly preferred to go to clubs where they could meet other spandex-clad single people, places like health clubs. These usually cost far less that the athletic club's $1,800 annual membership.
In the early 1990's, the club's financial situation became increasingly desperate. First the club fell behind on its real estate taxes, then it had to pledge some of the revenues it gets from the Heisman Trophy to satisfy the bank that held its mortgage. By the end of 1996, things were so dire that the club's accountants expressed concern about whether it could stay in business.
Last year, the club's directors devised a plan to sell the club's building to developers led by Richard Born, a well-known hotelier who owns the Stanhope, and Steven Caspi, a Westchester developer. The developers planned to renovate the building, operate a hotel on the top floors, and lease space back to the club.
But the club's members voted against the plan. The club's lawyers said the deal was not good enough, financially. The developers' lawyers said a new board of directors at the club tried to scotch the deal because they feared losing control of their private preserve.
In any event, the developers did not give up. They sued the club to try to get it to go ahead with the deal. And last February, they bought the club's mortgage from the Bank of New York, after the club itself was unable to come up with the $5 million that the bank wanted.
That is when the club filed for bankruptcy protection, in part over worries that the developers might foreclose on the mortgage.
Throughout all this, many club members have remained blissfully unaware of the institution's peril. But others, like Mr. Dockery, were galvanized. He organized a slate of candidates for the board of directors who ran on a platform opposing any sale of the building and promising to fix the club's finances. The slate won. "I didn't want to get involved -- I was happy working on my hook shot," he said. "But I saw the club headed down the drain."
Elected in May, Mr. Dockery and his fellow directors began trying to clean up the club's rather chaotic accounting and operating practices in the hope of finding a new deal that would provide enough cash to pay off the city's $3 million tax lien.
By August, they thought they had found it. Centaur Properties tentatively agreed to lease the top floors of the building for close to $1 million a year, and spend more than $12 million to turn the dormlike rooms into suites that corporations could rent for long-term stays. Centaur would also pay the club $7 million in cash up front so that renters could use the club's athletic equipment; that money would let the club pay the city and spruce up its building.
Almost immediately, however, a snag arose. The city government had been warning the club for some time that it planned to consider designating the club's exterior as a landmark; now, it proposed holding a hearing on the matter.
This did not go over well with Centaur, which complained that such a designation would add at least $1 million to its costs and untold time to its development plans. In particular, the developer intends to punch holes in the exterior walls to put in air conditioners; much of the building's Art Deco detailing occurs under the windows, just where such holes would be likely to go.
Even if the Centaur plan goes forward, it is unclear whether the developers who hold the mortgage would be satisfied. They could declare the club in default if it does not meet certain financial targets -- even if it makes all its payments on time.
This plan "has zero chance of being successful," said the developers' lawyer, Mr. Spitzer. "Ultimately it isn't going to furnish them with the money they need to make it work."
Mr. Dockery disagrees, of course, and spent last week holding meetings with members to discuss the plan to save their club. All seemed receptive, he said, adding that he hopes to present a plan to the bankruptcy court early next month.
He has a lot of members rooting for him, including Robin Segal, who comes down from Greenwich Village to exercise at the club. "My family has been members here for years," she said, adding that this is a place her teen-age children learned to love sports.
"I hope they pull it off," she said of the plan. "It's a shame -- there's so much tradition here."
 
To Survive, Private Clubs Shed Old Ways
The decline of the Downtown Athletic Club has been mirrored at private clubs across New York City, many of which have been forced to close in recent years by changing fashions, economics and their own inefficiency.
"About four or five years ago, we drew up a list of 25 clubs that had gone out of business," said Dan Condon of Condon, O'Meara, McGinty and Donnelly, an accounting firm that specializes in clubs. "And there were only about 60 private clubs in New York in 1970."
Mr. Dutton and others said that the hardest hit have been clubs in lower Manhattan, an area that lost many businesses in the late 1980's, and smaller clubs that lack gyms or private rooms where members can stay overnight.
There are signs that things have bottomed out, Mr. Condon said: club membership is inching up again, by 2 percent to 3 percent in each of the last two years.
But that is too late for the City Midday, Drug and Chemical Club at 140 Broadway, which ceased operations in December 1997. The original City Midday Club was founded in 1901. "There was a decline in membership," said Leonard S. Dome, a lawyer who is overseeing the club's demise. "Life styles changed."
The clubs that have survived, Mr. Condon said, have done so by updating their menus, renovating their buildings and easing up on dress codes and old attitudes.
In the late 1980's, for example, the situation began to look rather grim at the Down Town Association, a club on Pine Street in lower Manhattan that dates from 1860. Membership had fallen from around 1,100 in the mid-1980's to below 500 in 1989.
But the current president, Mark R. Altherr, said the club had rebounded somewhat from those dark days. Today, membership has inched up to about 580. "We renovated the building," he said. "We brought in new management and upgraded the food."
 Alan K. Dutton, the president of the local chapter of the Club Managers Association of America and the general manager of the Yale Club, on Vanderbilt Avenue in midtown Manhattan, said that other clubs, too, were getting the message.
"They have been improving the rooms, adding fitness equipment and bringing in creative cuisine," he said. "The stuffy old club doesn't make it anymore."

HEADLINE: For the Good Book, A Good Sales Pitch

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
It was not a standard airplane banner that caught the eyes of sunbathers from Jones Beach to the Hamptons on the Labor Day weekend. Instead of hawking suntan lotion or happy hour drinks, the sign read: "Make a Friend in a Very High Place. Marble church.org."
That was the abbreviated version of a print and poster advertisement for the Marble Collegiate Church that also says: "Everyone knows it helps having friends in high places, and no one's higher than God. So stop by Marble this Sunday and make a powerful new friend. Or just strengthen your friendship with an old one." 
 God's messenger these days is as likely to be a Madison Avenue account executive as a missionary. Religious advertisements have become savvier, slicker and certainly wittier than the staid church announcements found on the religion pages of newspapers.
And they have turned up in the strangest places. In the past, church ads were generally found in magazines and newspapers and on radio broadcasts. Now, with the ascendance of a generation of clergy raised on television and video, the ads might also appear on the airborne streamer, the telephone kiosk, the construction site and the Web page.
"Folks are saying, 'If we want to reach out to people and we are not out pounding on doors, we must do something we haven't done before,' " said Roy Lloyd, the broadcast news director for the National Council of Churches, who also works in print media.
He continued: "People no longer join a church because that's where their family belonged, and denominational loyalty is a thing of the past. Today, people are looking for places that coincide with their values or challenge them in ways that are appealing. An impression built over time that mainline religion is dull and boring, and you have to give them a different perspective."
Marble Collegiate's current advertisements, which were introduced in summer resort publications like Hamptons magazine and Dan's Paper in the Hamptons and The Fire Island Tide, are now running in New York magazine, Time Out New York and The Village Voice, and are attached to boarded-up construction sites around the city. They will also go up on more than 30 telephone kiosks in December. And the airplane trailer is scheduled to make another overhead appearance on Oct. 18 at Giants Stadium, during a New York Giants-Arizona Cardinals game.
Among the five other messages in the campaign is one proclaiming: "You Don't Have to Be a Sinner To Attend Our Church. But It Helps."
That ad and others were meant to counteract the image of church as judge. "There is an enormous amount of bad feeling because of the sense that you are a sinner, you are wrong," said Dr. Arthur Caliandro, the senior minister of the church, which is at Fifth Avenue and 29th Street. "That is not what Marble is all about, nor, in fact, what true religion is about."
John Follis, president and creative director of Follis/N.Y., the church's ad agency, said: "In my 20 years in the business, I have worked on everything from Coca-Cola to infant thermometers, but never have I worked on a product that does absolutely everything and is free. Advertising Marble Church is essentially selling God."
If so, God is being sold elsewhere as well. Last fall, the Church of the Heavenly Rest, the majestic Episcopal house of worship at Fifth Avenue and 90th Street, began using similarly amusing ads and is now running two campaigns a year geared to subway poster display. A typical message: "Sex Doesn't Mean a Thing." In smaller type, it continues: "Neither does race, age, economic status, political affiliation. Or whether you believe in God. If you need help, you won't be turned down. You've got to start somewhere. Start now."
Paula Paluszek, a senior copywriter for Grey Advertising and a member of the Church of the Heavenly Rest, wrote the copy. "I didn't want them to even remotely look like church ads but to be constructively provocative," she said. "I wanted to combine a New York in-your-face challenge with a warm welcome and a promise of Christian hope." Actually, she said, she was inspired by Christ himself. "When he was working among the people, he spoke the vernacular of the time and there were compelling bold images in his parables," she said. "Some of his images were very graphic, and I took a cue from his style in a way."
New York is not alone in the phenomenon, which is being taken to an extreme in London, where Charles and Maurice Saatchi, the advertising tycoons, will open the Saatchi (named for their parents, not themselves) Synagogue this month. An ad has already appeared showing a piece of gefilte fish with the catch line, "At our new synagogue, this is the only thing which gets rammed down someone's throat."
Most religious institutions are not so brash. The Rev. James L. Burns, rector of the Church of the Heavenly Rest, had a simple goal when he broached the idea of the advertising campaign shortly after becoming its spiritual leader two years ago. "I was after two groups of people," he said, "people not affiliated with any particular church, who slog up the subway stairs each day and wonder, 'Is this all there is?' and parish members who might want to rethink what their church and their participation in it is about. When people come in who are new to the church, we ask, 'Did you see the ad?' and about 50 percent say, 'Oh, yeah.' Then we have a job delivering something worth staying for."
Still the church's goal was not primarily to bolster membership. "We are a fairly large church with 1,600 members and are in good financial shape," said the associate rector, the Rev. Steven E. Woolley. "We are not trying to bring in members for the sake of growth or to raise money. We are trying to feed the spiritual hunger, doing what God told us to do: proclaiming the good news."
Dr. Caliandro said he was disturbed by the waning assumption that church is a normal part of Sunday.
"Religious worship is no longer an expected part of what we do on Sunday," he said. Citing the lures of "staying home and washing the car, playing golf or reading the Sunday newspaper," he said, "30 years ago there would have been a fourth option. You might want to go and worship, but that is no longer in the thinking of people. In New York City, there is such intense competition for attention that religious institutions need to let people know they are there and have something to offer."

HEADLINE: New Postal Trucks Can Run on Ethanol, but Probably Won't

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Six years ago, with smoke from the burning oil wells of Kuwait barely cleared, Congress ordered the Federal Government to help wean America from gasoline, and decided that by 1998, half of all new Government vehicles should be able to run on an alternative fuel.
The Postal Service announced last month that to comply, it would buy 10,000 new delivery trucks that can run on ethanol or gasoline, and that the first would be delivered for use in the New York City region. 
 But while the vehicles can use ethanol, Postal Service officials say, they probably will not. That is because the nearest public ethanol station is in Indianapolis. In fact, there are only about 40 stations in the whole country that sell ethanol, according to vehicle manufacturers.
"The ethanol-capable vehicles will be all over," said a Postal Service spokeswoman, Sandra Harding. She said the vehicles would be sent wherever new trucks were needed, regardless of what fuels were available. "If they don't have ethanol available in certain areas, then the automobile will just run on gasoline," she said.
The first of the new postal vehicles, modified Ford Explorers with their steering wheels on the right so that letter carriers can easily reach mailboxes, will begin arriving in May. In New Jersey, Newark will get 100; Paterson, 53; Lakewood, 73, and Bellmawr, 50. Hicksville, on Long Island, will get 84.
State officials in New Jersey and New York said they knew of no public fueling site within their borders that sold ethanol.
Environmentalists, who have been urging the use of alternative fuels for years as a way to reduce dependence on oil and to lower auto emissions, are not happy about the outcome.
"There's an absurdity, an irrationality, having these vehicles and not having fuel for them," said Nevin Cohen, the director of research at Inform, a nonprofit environmental research group based in New York. The Federal Government, he said, had tried to be "fuel neutral," meaning that it backed a variety of alternatives to gasoline without choosing one over the others. But, he said, "This isn't fuel neutral; it's fuel nutty."
"Natural gas would have made more sense," said Mr. Cohen, who pointed out that United Parcel Service and other operators of large fleets use natural gas vehicles in the New York region. The Postal Service should send the new trucks to the Midwest, he said.
In fact, the Postal Service says that it runs 7,300 vehicles nationwide that use alternative fuels, some of them natural gas, but that some of those have to operate on gasoline because natural gas is not available. And buying a truck that can use natural gas (even if it does not) costs about $4,000 extra; buying one that can use ethanol (even if it does not) costs only about $200 extra.
Some Postal Service vehicles get their fuel from public gas pumps, but major post offices often have their own pumps. The Postal Service is resisting the idea that it should have ethanol or natural gas pumps for its own vehicles.
"We can't be a part-time utility company or a part-time oil company," said Wayne Corey, a vehicle maintenance manager with the Postal Service. "That's what those people are in business for."
Faced with the problem of meeting the 50 percent quota for vehicles that run on alternative fuels -- the quota rose to 75 percent in fiscal year 1999, which began on Oct. 1 -- the Postal Service had acted reasonably, Mr. Corey said.
The problem, he and others say, is that the continuing drop in the price of gasoline, combined with corporate streamlining by oil companies and others involved in the manufacture of vehicle fuels, has hindered the development of the alternative fuel market.
Natural gas, while cheaper than gasoline, has been handicapped by the need for expensive compressor stations and by the problem of squeezing the tanks into cars.
Ethanol, which is widely used in ordinary gasoline at blends of up to 10 percent, presents other problems. In places where it is publicly available, it is commonly sold as E-85, a blend that is 15 percent unleaded gasoline, but it costs 10 cents to 15 cents a gallon more than regular unleaded gasoline, even with various tax advantages.
Ford and Chrysler have adapted some of their vehicles for ethanol, because they get credits for doing so under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy law, as if their vehicles got better gas mileage. But it is likely that many of those vehicles will never see a drop of ethanol, either.
Ethanol's environmental and energy benefits are harder to demonstrate than those of natural gas, although the fuel is popular in Congress as a way to subsidize farmers, who grow the corn that is one of its main ingredients.
Mr. Corey pointed out that bringing in the ethanol-capable vehicles would improve air quality even if they never used ethanol, because they are new and meet the latest emission standards. They are replacing vehicles that are at least 10 years old, many of them ancient Jeeps.
David E. Rodgers, director of the Energy Department's office of technology utilization, said he was working with officials at the Postal Service to ship the new trucks to places where ethanol is available, even though the purchase contract with Ford specified where they would be delivered.
"The groups that procure vehicles are using systems they have had in place for 50 years," he said. "The groups that are promoting alternative fuels are usually in another part of the organization, and getting those groups to work together is a problem."
Dennis M. Baca, manager of environmental policy at the Postal Service, said that he was meeting with corn growers and ethanol manufacturers to try to increase the supply of fuel, and that the new vehicles, which will begin arriving in May, would be kept together to make it easier to supply ethanol to them.
When introducing a new fuel, Mr. Baca said, there has always been a question about which would come first, the fuel or the vehicles that use it. But he said he hoped the Government's commitment to the new trucks would encourage suppliers and other companies to try alternative fuels, too. "We are taking some risks," he said, "in hopes the rest of the country recognizes we all are better served by clean air."

HEADLINE: Brio Is Gone, but Brazil's Leader May Be Back

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 3

 BODY:
With their vast country struggling against economic collapse that could usher high inflation back in, and with a $30 billion rescue package in the balance, Brazilians are expected to re-elect President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Sunday, rejecting the three-time candidate of the left, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
But the euphoria of four years ago, when Mr. Cardoso rode to victory on a plan for ending inflation and modernizing the role of the state, has disappeared. The Real Plan, named for the new currency, the real, has been crippled by the Government's failure to rein in spending. This time Brazilians are bracing for a morning after marked by austerity, recession, joblessness and tax increases. 
 Jolted by the economic breakdowns in Asia and Russia, the Brazilian stock market has been stumbling through the year like a battered giant, crashing and resurging time and again, losing 41 percent of its value since January. About $30 billion in foreign reserves have fled Brazil for safer havens since Russia's market collapse in late August.
Until recently a prized market for direct foreign investment, Brazil is now feared as the country most likely to draw the storms of Asia to American shores. Foreign investors are watching Brazil closely, in the expectation that a triumphant President Cardoso will tackle reforms immediately. A $30 billion International Monetary Fund plan to salvage Brazil's faltering economy also depends on a Cardoso victory.
Though congressional seats and state houses in this nation of 160 million people are also at stake, attention is focusing almost entirely on the presidential race.
"This last year has brought a new uncertainty," said Antonio Carlos Alkimin, director of population studies at the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics. "People are voting more against inflation and against a leftist government than with a sense of optimism over what will happen when Fernando Henrique wins."
So far the crisis is like a dark cloud hovering offshore. A Central Bank doubling of interest rates to stanch the outflow of dollars braked industrial expansion, and unemployment is the highest in 15 years. But deeper cuts in Government services, public sector layoffs, tax increases and other drastic measures are on hold until after the President's presumed re-election, as are the terms Brazil will have to meet for the I.M.F. bailout.
Polls predict that Mr. Cardoso, who won a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to run for re-election, will become the first Brazilian President to succeed himself. He is expected to take 47 percent of Sunday's vote, a large enough amount to avoid run-off elections on Oct. 25. His nearest rival, Mr. da Silva of the Workers Party, was projected to win 24 percent. Ciro Gomes, a former Finance Minister, is expected to take 9 percent of the vote. And an excitable surgeon known simply as Eneas, who calls for Brazil to build an atomic bomb, is expected to get 2 percent.
As the election approaches, the images and slogans of candidates across the political spectrum have been multiplying, their banners fluttering from trees and lampposts. In the twice-daily free television time that has become the centerpiece of political campaigns, the two leading candidates present visions of themselves and Brazil that could hardly be more at odds.
President Cardoso's television programs feature a determinedly upbeat country, with a chorus of smiling teen-agers singing the President's praises and exhorting voters to turn out for him. Though Mr. Cardoso used part of his air time to rebroadcast a speech he made warning of postelection fiscal adjustments, his message has been one of stability and prosperity.
"All of our efforts, all of our achievements, cannot end when we're only halfway there," the President said in his final broadcast on Thursday night. "In the middle of a world crisis, a country with so many resources and possibilities, a country with so much international support, which gains more respect abroad each day, whose people are serious and hard-working, has no reason to change direction."
The program for Mr. da Silva, who is universally known as Lula, features black-and-white footage of him marching against the military dictatorship that ended in 1985 and commiserating with the poor. A former president of the Metalworkers Union, Mr. da Silva left school to begin working at 15, and lost a finger operating a lathe.
This election, Mr. da Silva traded the berets and polo shirts of the past for suits and measured speech, but his ideas remain far to the left of Mr. Cardoso's. He opposes a deal with the I.M.F. and says Brazil's priority should be Brazilians' social needs.
"I've never accepted that a country as rich as ours should have so much inequality, so much misery," said Mr. da Silva. "The banks and the international speculators can wait."
Mr. Cardoso has also committed gaffes that have fed into the Workers Party's image of him as a leader removed from the problems of the masses.
During his administration's so-far-unsuccessful push to restructure social security benefits, Mr. Cardoso said people who wanted to retire early were "bums." Although the President later explained that he meant to attack professionals who retire after 20 or 25 years, millions of Brazilian pensioners who had begun their working lives as children felt themselves maligned.
Worse yet, word leaked that the 67-year-old President has himself been collecting a pension, currently at $4,300 a month, ever since Brazil's military dictatorship forced him to stop teaching at the University of Sao Paulo in 1969. Although the President could have returned to teaching 10 years later, he chose to keep the pension instead.
Sergio Amaral, the President's spokesman, said Mr. Cardoso saw no reason to give up the pension, since he had been "retired by an arbitrary act of the military Government, and he continued working for the country as politician and then President." He said Mr. Cardoso gave up a second pension he could have collected for having been a Senator.
And in an August speech at the Parque Royale slum outside Rio, the President stunned residents when he said: "There's no way to make everybody rich. I don't even know if it's worth the trouble, because the life of a rich person, in general, is very boring."
He later explained that as a working man he did not count himself wealthy, but that only made his misstep worse. President Cardoso's $6,000-a-month base salary, along with his pension, puts him in the top 2 percent of Brazilians who make more than $2,100 a month, according to Government statistics.
"I'm one of the bums," announced Milton Peixoto, 64, a retired bus driver, adding that there was no way he would vote for President Cardoso. "Last time I voted for him, but this time, he can go to hell. My life's only gotten worse."
The Real Plan tamed inflation but has done little to redress Brazil's startling inequalities. According to the Brazilian Institute of Applied Economic Research, the country's income distribution is the most unequal in the world, with the richest 10 percent of the population collecting 50 percent of it. Nearly 70 percent of Brazil's voters have less than a primary school education, and half of them are considered barely literate.
But many Brazilians see Mr. Cardoso as the only candidate capable of taking the country forward. For example Licinio Franco, a representative for a check protection service here, confessed pride at the figure that his President cuts overseas. A consummate charmer, Mr. Cardoso speaks languages including French, English and Spanish, and sometimes greets foreign visitors by offering their choice of language.
And Mr. Franco said he stood a bit taller upon hearing that a German counterfeit gang was caught making 10- and 50-real bills.
"Now they don't want to counterfeit the dollar, it's the real," he said. "Our money is worth something."
Rosely de Faria Lemos, 50, who runs an advertising agency, said she considered Mr. da Silva "full of good intentions" but ill-prepared to run Brazil.
"He's a guy who's kind of from another era and space," she said, "who has no experience managing anything. He wasn't even mayor. How can we give him the country to run? In one way or another, Fernando Henrique can ease this crisis."

White House Described As Place of Intrigue
Secret Service testimony shows the White House as a place not just of grandeur and high purpose, but also of intrigue, sometimes juvenile, and of mordant humor about the President's private life. One overwhelming impression from the newly released documents is how little privacy the President actually has, his movements traced almost by the step from his bedroom to his office. 33
 
Former President Gerald R. Ford suggested that the most fitting punishment for President Clinton would be a rebuke in the well of the House, a recommendation that could prove beneficial in Mr. Clinton's effort to short-circuit the impeachment process. 33

"Left Behind," a series of four books of apocalyptic fiction describing the return of Jesus Christ to take the genuine Christians to heaven, made publishing history in September when all four of the books ascended to the top four slots on Publishers Weekly magazine's lists of religion best-sellers in hardcover and paperback. The "Left Behind" phenomenon, scholars say, is one indication of the public's fixation on the millennium and the widespread anticipation that the year 2000 portends some earth-shattering event. 1

HEADLINE: FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE TO EXPLORE CLINTON I.M.F. PLAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Finance ministers of the world's largest industrial nations said tonight that they would explore President Clinton's proposal to alter the strategy of the International Monetary Fund, so that it can intervene earlier in propping up economies at risk of being swept into the global financial turmoil.
The lukewarm endorsement of the White House initiative came in a vaguely worded communique tonight, following an all-day meeting here that appeared to break little new ground on how to quell the financial turmoil circling the globe. The session opened five days of scheduled talks among leaders of the major economies, as well as many from smaller, shell-shocked countries trying to keep their economies from being carried away in the storm. 
 As the sessions opened, the Administration was facing unusual challenges from Europe, Japan and emerging-market nations, each of which is arriving with different and even contradictory strategies for stabilizing the global economy.
The clash of approaches began to play out this morning, as Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin sat down with Japan's Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. And it carried through the meeting this afternoon of finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- and it reflects the extraordinary tension and the behind-the-scenes power struggles under way as the I.M.F. and the World Bank open their annual meeting here.
After months of market plunges, currency devaluations, bank failures and bankruptcies across the globe, governments are searching desperately for some kind of coordinated approach that can halt some of the most virulent economic turmoil in half a century.
But it will not be easy, officials concede. As the meetings opened, Mr. Miyazawa announced a $30 billion Japanese program to aid stricken countries throughout Asia, a scaled down version of a program the United States sunk last year. The Japanese aid program includes government loans, the purchase of bonds issued by Asian countries and guarantees that private bank loans will be repaid. While Southeast Asian countries hailed the move, the Administration's response was lukewarm. Mr. Rubin said on Friday, even before the announcement, that Japan's action was "constructive," but that getting its own banks in order and its huge economy restarted was "by vast multiples more important."
Mr. Miyazawa, a former Prime Minister who has 40 years of experience dealing with the United States, shot back today that Mr. Clinton's proposals for new strategies for how the I.M.F. could choke off crises before they start "would not be very convincing unless the United States' commitments to the I.M.F. are lived up to." He was referring to the refusal by Congress to approve $18 billion in new money for the fund, an issue that Senate and House conferees will debate next week.
At a news conference tonight, Mr. Rubin said that at today's meeting "there was a strong expression from a number of members about the importance of the United States fulfilling its commitments." He appeared to be attempting to use the condemnations to push passage of the I.M.F. funding, and to suggest that if Congress refuses it will imperil American global financial leadership.
Mr. Clinton, attempting to bolster that leadership at a moment when his ability to lead is under intense scrutiny, will take the unusual step of taking part directly on Monday in a crucial meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from 22 countries. And on Tuesday, he will speak to the entire I.M.F., which represents 182 countries, in his second major speech on the world economy in three weeks.
The President set the urgent tone of the meetings on Friday, when he declared that the world was on a "financial precipice." But Mr. Clinton, who last spring was resisting advice that he become far more publicly involved in dealing with the world's financial chaos, insisted that it was not too late to act.
A dramatic initiative to stop the financial contagion may come within days as the fund, the Treasury Department and Brazil's Finance Minister, Pedro Malan, complete a package of $30 billion or more to stabilize the Brazilian economy.
Mr. Rubin met with Mr. Malan at the Treasury late Friday, and there was considerable speculation that the package could be announced as soon as voting is completed on Sunday in Brazil's presidential election. The vote is expected to result in the re-election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Administration officials say they fear that a financial meltdown in Brazil would take the rest of Latin America and Mexico with it, and bring the crisis to the United States' borders.
Nonetheless, the cacophony of competing ideas suggests that it will be very difficult to get agreement on a common agenda from countries facing a varied array of problems -- deep recession and mass unemployment in Southeast Asia, political paralysis in Russia and Indonesia, huge bank failures in Japan, an incipient currency crisis in Brazil, but continued prosperity in Western Europe and the United States.
The United States, for instance, is insisting that there be no backing away from a decade-long move toward freer and more open financial markets around the world.
But the Japanese and Southeast Asians are talking about "capital controls" that would re-impose government regulation to prevent investors from moving billions in short-term investments from one country to another with a few taps on the computer keyboard.
The French, meanwhile, want to increase the power of the committee that oversees the monetary fund, a proposal that seemed to leave Mr. Rubin distinctly unenthusiastic tonight. But, like President Clinton's ideas for the I.M.F., it was included in the vague communique, which touched on almost every major proposal to address the crisis without expressing particular enthusiasm for any.
The communique did include an unusually critical assessment of Japan, saying that its "challenges have intensified significantly in recent months." It specifically waded in to the hottest issue in Japanese domestic politics, calling on Japan to find a way to pour taxpayer money into viable Japanese banks "in sufficient amounts."
Meanwhile, Russia is threatening to default on its loans unless it is quickly given billions that the fund suspended when President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed his team of economic reformers and violated the terms of his accord for Western aid.
A senior fund official said last week that Russia's threats were "a form of blackmail," but that the enormous turbulence set off by the Russian financial debacle last month gives real teeth to Russia's threats. Two Russian representatives joined part of today's talks.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Rubin met again this morning to formulate their own strategies to calm the financial markets and keep the worst effects of the recession from hitting American shores, where exports and corporate profits are already badly affected.
The most immediate of those strategies, described by the President on Friday, would permit the fund to use its finances to help fundamentally healthy economies ward off global economic contagion.
Currently the fund intervenes with billions in emergency aid only after disaster strikes and investors are fleeing. But by that time, the country's currency is under attack, and a bailout can cost far more and often involves austerity measures -- from budget cuts to high interest rates -- that lead to soaring unemployment and political backlash.
So Mr. Rubin and Mr. Greenspan proposed a newer, faster-moving mechanism for pumping money into countries that Mr. Rubin said today were "being hit primarily by contagion," rather than punished for bad policy. The White House indicated earlier in the day that Mr. Clinton's proposal had already been agreed to by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Jacques Chirac of France, but diplomats said there were still reservations from Germany and Japan.
The Group of Seven sounded less enthusiastic. But Mr. Rubin said "there was a shared view that while this crisis began in countries that had substantial problems, now the contagion is affecting countries that had strong reform programs." Investors do not seem to care: Many are withdrawing money from all emerging markets in a flight to low-risk investments.

HEADLINE: It's Time to Regulate Hedge Funds

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Only by giving hedge-fund transactions the necessary oversight will we reduce the possibility of systemic risk to our economy (front page, Oct. 2). The crux of the problem is the lack of disclosure required from counterparties to trades and the clearing members who ultimately process these transactions. 
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is rightly concerned that too much regulation would send these transactions overseas to countries with looser regulations. But at what price do we give traders the luxury of making bets without oversight?
That oversight exists on the floor of our major stock and commodities exchanges, and this gives investors and traders the comfort of knowing that an exchange is insuring that positions are being properly margined for risk even after losses start piling up.

To the Editor:
One thing that cannot be allowed to happen is the support of players who fail. Long-Term Capital Management should have been allowed to collapse (Op-Ed, Sept. 30). The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's involvement in the bailout greatly increases "moral hazard" -- the risk that other institutions will continue behaving in the same profligate manner. This idea that, whatever happens, someone will help out is what brought the Asian tigers to their knees. 
 Investors realized the tigers were paper and fled; economic collapse followed. Nothing is more "paper" than the derivatives that Long-Term played with. Losers in this game should not be allowed to continue playing.

Fed Cuts Interest Rate

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
For nearly a month, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, had hinted that the global financial crisis might force the central bank to put aside its concern about inflation and cut interest rates. On Tuesday he acted, leading the Fed to cut its key interest rate by a quarter point, to 5.25 percent. 
 The move should give a small boost to the domestic economy by reducing borrowing costs a bit for consumers and businesses. But with concern growing that the global crisis could spread and endanger the long American expansion, Mr. Greenspan mainly wanted to send a message that he was on the case. RICHARD W. STEVENSON

A Cup Of Charm

BYLINE: By Dulcie Leimbach; Dulcie Leimbach's last article for the Home Design magazine was on the resurgence of wallpaper.

 BODY:
You'd have to be an ogre to deny the charms of children's china. even a hard-biled chief financial officer with zero time for frivolity wouldn't be able to resist eating from a plate that depicts boys jousting and says: "Thump away Jack -- Take care of his head./Tis all in good fun. Now hit him hard, Ned."
Not all children's china captures childlike sentiments with such humor and resonance. But most of the china that has been produced for children since the 1790's, when the industry was born, has remained universally endearing. Children's china speaks to everyone; it's one of the few objects that can make you believe for a moment that you're still an innocent, no matter what business you're in. 
 As Sharon Gater, a research assistant for the Wedgwood Museum, in Stoke-on-Trent, England, says emphatically, "Children's china is very much wanted by everybody."
Luckily, its sweet-natured quality has made it impervious to fashion and trends. Highly collectible, children's china brings prices that aren't staggering, though they do make you blink. A 19th-century Staffordshire cup with a popular name like Joseph can cost $300 at James II Galleries in Manhattan, while a plate with a cute saying, circa 1840, can be as much as $625 at Bardith, an antiques emporium on the Upper East Side. At the Country Dining Room Antiques, in Great Barrington, Mass., alphabet plates, always in demand, are $150 to $275 apiece.
"The rarest things are fetching $1,000," says Richard Dennis, the pre-eminent British expert on children's china and the publisher of "Gifts for Good Children," the definitive book on the subject, written by Noel Riley and Maureen Batkin.
The two-volume book, distributed in this country by the Antique Collectors' Club in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., aids both novice and experienced collectors by documenting in detail the advent of children's china in Britain and, by export, in America.
Most children's china is earthenware, also known as pottery; consisting of plates and cups (or mugs), it was meant to be functional. Porcelain pieces, which are rare, were mostly bought by the wealthy as baptismal gifts. Yet some experts wonder whether plates with elaborate borders were actually meant for children or for decoration, and whether plates with prints that might appeal to grown-ups were intended for both generations.
What is certain, though, is that most children's china over the centuries has been produced in Britain, thanks to its robust ceramics industry and, some have argued, its attitude toward children. Although Japan and France only dabbled in this type of china, and Germany produced it mostly for export, Britain was apparently more sympathetic toward children and saw the economic value of catering to citizens eager to buy gifts for their little ones.
Production may have begun in Britain in 1790, but very few pieces were made that early, and even fewer have survived. But as the economy prospered, and the culture became more benevolent toward, and fascinated by, the very young, the use of transfer printing for ceramics coincided with a marked increase in the publication of children's books. Soon, many prints from these books, particularly nursery rhymes and the alphabet, were appearing on plates and cups. Supper in the British household would never be the same.
"This was the first obvious evidence of sentimental prints involving children being used on cheap pottery," says Robin Hildyard, an assistant curator in the ceramics and glass department of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. "I think these things were used in cottages and farmhouses, not bought by people with a lot of money." Small mugs adults used to drink strong beer may have been used by children as well, he adds, noting that fancy tableware for the young was unusual.
In "Gifts for Good Children," however, Riley writes that when decorated pottery started, it was "a luxury available only to the wealthy and ends when developments in mass production enabled cheap ceramics to find a place in the homes of the working classes." Early wares, she observes, tend to depict elegantly dressed children, while mid-19th-century china scenes have more universal appeal, with not as many children riding ponies.
Letitia Roberts, senior international specialist in European ceramics at Sotheby's in New York, agrees with Riley. "You would have to have had a certain level of wherewithal to have such china for your children," she says.
No one factory dominated the children's china industry. Minton, Staffordshire and Wedgwood were only three of dozens in the business. The early wares, issued before the 1850's, are generally considered superior. Everyone concurs that by the mid-19th century, the prints on the plates and mugs became sloppier, reflecting a more rapid, higher-volume production. Overall, the 19th century yielded a huge array of designs heavily focused on the family. These plates and cups became icons of sociability, conveyors of morality and tools for educating.
"All the humanitarian things that went on -- reforms and acts that banned small children from working in factories," Hildyard says, created feelings toward children that had not been evident in earlier centuries.
In the 20th century, the world wars slowed the production of children's china, and in the 50's, plastic began to overtake earthenware as the primary material, eroding the ware's overall value. Yet some of this century's china is as collectible as the previous century's. Early Mickey Mouse and Beatrix Potter designs are feverishly sought after, as is the work of Eric Ravilious, who was a designer for Wedgwood before he served as an official war artist and was killed in 1942. Nursery ware by Susie Cooper, a British ceramic artist and modernist known for her flamboyant colors, is also prized.
Whatever their provenance, ABC plates and mugs with names on them are mostly available in the United States and in Britain, although the Japanese are very avid buyers. In Britain, the source of most material, the market is particularly active.
Richard Dennis says there is plenty of children's china about. "You just have to spend time looking for it, being inquisitive," he observes. "An awful lot was made; an awful lot was damaged. But a lot is still surviving." On the other side of the Atlantic, however, you hear different views. Stuart Slavid, the director of fine ceramics for Skinner, the Boston auction house, feels that such china is no longer as plentiful. "There were good deals 15 years ago," he says. "It's not a secret anymore."
At Sotheby's in New York, children's china has not been auctioned since the 70's, probably because prices are still not high enough to warrant business. "We haven't seen a big group of mugs in years," says Letitia Roberts. Yet she says that children's tableware is "collectible at an affordable level." It can be found, she adds, "in antiques shops and out-of-the-way places."
For the collector, a Benjamin Franklin maxim on a 19th-century plate may offer the best advice: "Plow deep while sluggards sleep; and you shall have corn to sell and to keep."
Robin Hildyard suggests that collectors interested in an investment find pieces that haven't been "bashed and broken and chewed." Dennis, on the other hand, says collectors shouldn't be completely put off by damage, since these pieces were subjected to heavy use.
"Buy what you like; that's always my advice," says Edith Wolf, the owner of Bardith.
"Gifts for Good Children" is a solid source of information on the almost endless categories that make up children's china. They include flora and fauna, mottoes, religious morals, school lessons, country life, animals, children's stories and nursery rhymes, caricatures and cartoons, occupations and trades, games and pastimes. Then there are secondary design considerations, like borders, swags, raised daisy images and florets. Color is another asset: the more colorful the piece, the more expensive it is. Yellow ware, also known as canary ware, is highly valued.
Other enhancements -- raised decorations, enamels, hand-painting and the quality of the transfer printing -- are more clues to a ware's importance, says Slavid. "All the little things change the interest level or sophistication," he notes.
A manufacturer's name has little bearing, most specialists say. "There's nothing wrong with being unmarked," Slavid says. "You can get a marked one that's poor quality and a superior one that's unmarked."
What ultimately leads buyers to children's china is a purely visceral reaction. On a plate, the scene or the saying is what captivates a buyer. For a cup, the name it bears may be the big attraction. "Everyone wants Mary or Sarah or Elizabeth," says Barbara Munves, who owns James II Galleries. "Hannah or Martha are easier to find." For boys, George and Henry are easy to come by, but Robert, she adds, is rarer.
Still, as Sheila Chefetz, the proprietor of the Country Dining Room Antiques, puts it, "The English made something for everyone." Including Ruby Davis, an interior designer in Providence, R.I., who has been sifting through flea markets and antiques stores seeking that special fragile cup or plate for 40 years. "I have collected by color, by sentiment, by what it says," she notes. "Price means nothing."

HEADLINE: Getting the Big Picture;
The Film Industry Started Here and Left. Now It's Back, and the State Says the Sequel Is Huge.

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
MERYL STREEP came to Maplewood for "One True Thing." Scott Rudin brought Kevin Kline to Montclair for "In and Out." Harrison Ford stalked through Newark City Hall in "Presumed Innocent." Nicolas Cage and Matt Damon stormed Atlantic City for "Snake Eyes" and "Rounders," respectively. Jim Jarmusch is in Jersey City now, for "Ghost Day." Woody Allen worked at the Jersey City Armory for "Deconstructing Harry" and in Atlantic City for "Celebrity"; he is planning to cross the George Washington Bridge again this month for his next project. Norman Jewison will be here, too, to recreate the story of the boxer Hurricane Carter.
They're all filming. 
 In gracious, leafy suburbs and glitzy casinos, in gritty urban streets and cavernous armories, the bustle of movie making is back in the state where it all started. In a West Orange laboratory a century ago, Thomas Alva Edison created the technology that put moving images on screen. His inventions spawned an industry that did much of its early filming in Fort Lee. Even the word cliffhanger has its roots in New Jersey: early action movies took advantage of the dramatic crags of the Palisades.
By 1920, for several reasons, the action here had virtually ceased. But over the last two decades, New Jersey's share of the vast flow of filmmaking dollars has grown from almost nothing to more than $53 million annually, money spent on everything from lumber for building sets to rentals of hotel rooms and office space to salaries for local crews. The projects embrace big-budget Hollywood productions, television projects, music videos, documentaries, commercials and independent films shot on a shoestring. A Production Services Directory for the state, published this year for the first time, lists 120 pages of services for filmmakers, from animal training to antique-car rentals to entertainment law offices. About 80 percent of the state's 566 municipalities have designated film liaisons. The New Jersey chapter of the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers is just over a year old, and vibrant at its monthly meetings. Several small film festivals keep alternatives to mainstream Hollywood fare alive.
"It's worked out better than I hoped," said former Gov. Brendan Byrne, who has a law practice in Roseland. It was under his administration, with his backing, that the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television Commission was created in 1978.
"Filmmaking isn't getting big in New Jersey," said its longtime executive director, Joseph Friedman. "It is big."
In fact, New Jersey has come so far that the questions facing it now are of a high order. Can the state establish itself within the film world as a center in itself, something more than a place that can absorb Manhattan's overflow -- something it never was, even in its filming heyday? Even now, few of the scores of pictures made here are actually set in New Jersey. And can filmmakers do what Bruce Springsteen did in music: create an acme and epitome of homegrown character?
Perhaps. One much-rumored development -- the creation of an international film festival -- is under way, with a tentative agreement between its organizers and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark to schedule the festival for next Aug. 5 to 8. David Marciano, a Newark-born actor, and Bernard Gluckstern, a West Coast businessman, said they were choosing a board and raising a $10,000 deposit to rent the arts center. Such an event could provide a needed springboard for the state's filmmakers. Kevin Smith of Red Bank, for example, had to take his 1994 hit "Clerks" out of state to the Independent Feature Film Festival at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan, then to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, before Miramax picked it up.
Another crucial step remains to be taken. Plans have stalled this year for two huge production centers: a 30,000-square-foot complex in Paterson and an even larger studio in Harrison.
"We have a very successful transient business," Mr. Friedman said. "And we've always envisioned an industry here. But you need a studio."
 
In the Beginning, There Was Edison
Even if New Jersey gets neither studio nor festival, it is still benefiting more from the industry than it has in about 80 years. And surprisingly, some of the responsibility for first leading the industry out here, then driving it out, falls to the same man who created it in the first place: Edison.
Although Edison created his inventions in New Jersey, the first flowering of film companies occurred in Manhattan. There, the companies could find booking agents, actors, vaudeville performers, and costume and set designers. Edison opened a permanent studio on West 21st Street in 1901, said Richard Koszarski, a professor of film at Rutgers University and the former curator at American Museum of the Moving Image, who has been working on a history of East Coast filming for 20 years.
Around 1908, film companies started doing more location work to satisfy an audience that had rapidly become too sophisticated to accept painted backdrops, and Fort Lee was the location most accessible to New York. Business offices remained in New York while the studios -- big glass constructions similar to greenhouses, since artificial light was not yet reliable -- began clustering on the Palisades. D. W. Griffith, Mack Sennett, Edwin S. Porter and many other major filmmakers worked there.
Edison, who aggressively defended his patents, formed a consortium of film companies that agreed to use only his machinery, Mr. Koszarski said. Those that couldn't afford the patent fees were the first independents, including Centaur Film Company in Bayonne business, which made some of the first westerns. Violent enforcement of the patents was not uncommon, Mr. Koszarski said.
Eventually, Edison's Patent Company was broken up, Mr. Koszarski said, and the competition took over. By the early 1910's, he said, some film companies were already building the studio equivalent of summer houses in California. Then they realized the western studios worked better, thanks to California's year-round sunshine, cheap real estate, few unions and lack of patent disputes.
The most serious blow to the East Coast industry came just after World War I, when studios couldn't get the coal to feed the generators to make the electricity to run the machinery. "Three-quarters of the film companies just shut down and said, 'We're going to the summer house,' " Mr. Koszarski said. "Most of them never came back."
The flu epidemic of the era also hurt the industry, said another historian, Paul C. Spehr, who created an exhibition and a book about New Jersey's film history for the Newark Museum in 1977. "Thousands of movie theaters had to be shut down," since they were exactly the sort of places where the highly contagious disease could spread, he said. "And if you read Variety of the era, you see that people in the industry were dying of the flu -- sometimes 10 a week."
The Marx Brothers added an interesting coda to Fort Lee's swan song, said Robert Farhi, a Fort Lee writer who checked out a local legend with several Marx scholars. In the fall of 1920, while performing at a vaudeville club in Fort Lee, the brothers made their first feature film, "Humor Risk." Reportedly an abysmal failure, it was either turned into guitar picks, lost in a taxi or burned.
 
Slights, Camera And Finally Action
More than three decades passed before the next real attempt at New Jersey filmmaking, with "On the Waterfront" in Hoboken in 1954. But the widely acclaimed film created no momentum. The turning point came in the late 1970's, as New Jersey headed into its worst recession since the Depression. Governor Byrne was looking for ways to attract business that would not add to the state's pollution problems, as well as ways to improve the state's image.
He had lunch with Sidney Kinglsey, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, who had been to Mr. Spehr's film exhibition at the Newark Museum and happened to be married to Madge Evans, a former child movie star who had worked in Fort Lee.
"We were discussing the potential of New Jersey, the fact that the industry really started here, that it was a natural," Mr. Byrne recalled. "We discussed how the ambiance would be better in New Jersey than in New York. It would be easier to mobilize things. Labor problems weren't as difficult."
Kinglsey, who died in 1995, became the first chairman of the motion picture commission. Since 1978, film-related spending in the state has totaled about $500 million, estimates the commission, whose own annual budget is less than $300,000. With a staff of four, it helps filmmakers with everything from location scouting to negotiating with neighborhood groups.
Neil Machliss, a producer who filmed "I.Q." with Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins and Walter Matthau in Princeton in 1994, said the commission had been extremely helpful.
"We needed to do some filming in the town of Princeton, and we had to appear before the City Council," he recalled. "They came up with a strategy of how to approach them. And if we wanted to shoot somewhere that was owned by the government, they were very helpful. If I could do a movie in New Jersey, I'd do it in a second."
Even small-scale filmmakers receive help. Marylou Tibaldo-Bongiorno studied under Spike Lee at New York University's film school and made "1967," her thesis film, in her native Newark. Set against the riots that tore the city apart, the film, which she hopes to expand to feature length, is the story of an Italian-American draft dodger from the Ninth Ward.
She said the motion picture commission was very helpful, especially in dealing with the city government. "For one scene, which is a big vigilante response to the riots, we needed to have people with rifles on the streets of Newark," she said. "It went from 'You couldn't do it' to 'Well, we did it.' "
New Jersey, historically known as the "barrel tapped at two ends" by New York and Philadelphia, is now a creative market tapped at two ends, by New York and California. But the work of a few widely known Jersey filmmakers points to something like a state character. They include John Sayles, who put Hoboken on the independents' map in 1982 with "Baby, It's You"; Mr. Smith, who followed "Clerks" with "Mallrats" (1995) and "Chasing Amy" (1997), and Todd Solondz, who directed the 1995 "Welcome to the Dollhouse" as well as "Happiness," now playing at the New York Film Festival.
And many more artists are making films in and about the state. April Allridge, who lives in Highland Park, is making a digital video documentary about women who served in World War II. John Schnall, an animator, started a new film on Wednesday in his home in Belleville. Emily Hubley, another animator whose films has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, works from her home in Maplewood. And Ken Rodgers, who studied film theory in Rutgers Cinema Studies Program and earned a degree in film production at the University of Southern California, said he was hoping to return.
"So many people think of New Jersey as the turnpike," he said. "I want to tell the stories that reside off the exits."
These filmmakers are nurtured by the New Jersey Film Festival and the Super 8 Film and Video Festival, sponsored by the Rutgers Film Coop; several programs put together by Projected Images of Hudson County in Hoboken; the Newark Black Film Festival; the Black Maria Film and Video Festival (named after Edison's first film lab), which travels the nation; the New Jersey Film Series in Secaucus, and a few private theaters.
But will it add up to a New Jersey school of film? Mr. Smith, for one, said even the idea confused him. "I've heard people say 'Clerks' and 'Chasing Amy' were very New Jersey films," he said. "I was never quite sure what they meant."

HEADLINE: Disappearing Rubles, Omnipresent Rust Belt

BYLINE: By Stephen Kotkin; Stephen Kotkin is director of Russian studies at Princeton University.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's new Prime Minister, would seem to have little choice but to pony up back wages owed to millions of Russian workers, some of whom haven't been paid in more than two years. But Mr. Primakov's solution -- printing a mass of new rubles -- has an air of unreality about it.
Money can be printed, but how much of it will reach the unpaid? Rubles transferred by Moscow to the country's 89 regions continue to disappear without a trace, as local officials siphon them off for themselves. Russia has an inordinate number of state functionaries but no functioning state. This paralyzing circumstance constitutes the essence of the political crisis. 
 No less confounding is the economic crisis, which derives from Communism's most enduring legacy, the world's largest-ever Rust Belt. Heavy industry and mining, spread out in hundreds of factory towns, still employ a majority of the population.
Russia more than any other former Communist economy needed not just a decisive break from full state ownership and management, but a strategy for dealing with its Rust Belt -- a transition that capitalist economies, with far less heavy industry, made with great pain several decades ago. Yet accelerated mass privatization and an effort to encourage investment by taming inflation and making it easy to convert rubles to other currencies did not bring about significant industrial restructuring.
Vastly more money than the International Monetary Fund lent to the Russian Government was shifted abroad (where it remains). Most of the capital that circulated within Russia, including that of foreigners, went not into productive investment -- even the money-generating oil and gas sectors have been allowed to deteriorate -- but into short-term treasury notes that paid substantial interest. While the ruble became exchangeable and stable, raw materials were exported, and finished goods and foods were imported. The Rust Belt rusted.
Instead of finger pointing, Russia needs industrial triage. The model for addressing Russia's predicament is neither the post-industrial United States of the 1990's nor the centrally planned Soviet Union of the 1980's. Rather, it is postwar France and Germany, where unavoidably activist governments directed reconstruction of war-ravaged market economies.
Almost everyone in Russia, even most Gorbachev-era retreads, understands that a return to central planning is not feasible and that Russia needs a vibrant private sector. But almost everyone also recognizes the need for an interventionist state to choose among industrial sectors and individual factories, to help salvage some and bankrupt the others. In some ways, it would be less daunting if the thousands of obsolete factories were literally bombed out.
Less well understood in Moscow, unfortunately, is that a state-sponsored industrial triage must be accompanied by the introduction of private property in land and housing. Currently, relocation from one city to the next is nearly impossible because most apartments are still owned by factories and institutions. Without a private housing market there can be no labor market. Such measures have been blocked by the Duma, but they have much more of a chance to pass if included with a concrete program to rebuild industry selectively. The population would be willing to undergo further sacrifices for clear aims.
The lack of capital is a huge stumbling block. The valuable oil and gas industries were sold on the cheap to insiders, who have taken much of their revenue abroad, while reformers deliberately undermined many of the country's world-class military industries. With no hope for a Marshall Plan, the Russians have to create their own investment funds, by conducting privatizations more effectively, controlling revenue from the export of natural resources more tightly, renewing sales of military equipment and attracting private foreign capital.
Easier said than done. The Primakov Government is not yet a government and is overwhelmed with crises of the moment, like how to pay salaries and rescue bank deposits, and what to do about obligations to big creditors. But even if such short-term financial crises could be overcome, the Government's ability to put a long-term strategy into effect is in doubt.
Russian officials have admitted that none of the vast sums sent to rebuild Chechnya reached their intended destination -- no surprise, given the existence of an unaccountable regime in the Caucasus. Money sent during the summer to the Siberian region of Kemerovo to pay the back wages of agitating miners ended up enriching the 15 local criminal organizations. Large swaths of the country are de facto controlled by gangsters.
Yet who needs gangsters when you have elected politicians? Provincial officials form private businesses to which they award the most lucrative Government contracts and then have those businesses charge greatly inflated prices. Others simply instruct bookkeepers to invent fictitious contracts and transfer money directly to personal bank accounts.
By whatever method local officials appropriate public money, they make sure to blame George Soros, the I.M.F., the C.I.A. and Moscow for unpaid wages and budget shortfalls.
Federal prosecutors have made numerous arrests, accompanied by extensive media coverage. But the ranks of the national bureaucracy are no more scrupulous than those of the localities while the country's most successful protection racket is run right under the Kremlin's nose by the Moscow city government. The old disciplinary mechanisms of the hierarchical party-state were never fully effective, but their replacement by the ballot box has given officials a freer hand. Russia labors under the platitude that honest and efficient regulatory bureaucracies are the sine qua non of civil society and the market.
Even relatively less venal local officials do not take much heed of the central Government. More and more, governors and presidents of the ethnic republics rule as they see fit, flouting federal law. Until the rulers of Russia's 89 regions are given or are forced to take a stake in the federal center, "anti-crisis" programs announced in Moscow will remain inconsequential. Mr. Primakov is a captive not of the Communists in the Parliament but of the Rust Belt and the regions.

Ad Revenues Decline at Some Newspapers

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Advertising revenue has fallen off sharply at Dow Jones & Company's two major newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and Barron's, a sign of newspapers' vulnerability to industry-by-industry and region-by-region economic storms.
But to date, according to several newspaper business executives and two economists at the Newspaper Association of America, an industry trade group, most newspaper companies have gained at least as much as they have lost despite the gyrations of the world's financial markets. 
 The Journal's third-quarter advertising volume was down about 6.7 percent over the corresponding quarter in 1997, Dow Jones said. The September comparisons were off more sharply, reflecting an increasingly steep drop in advertising from banks and other major financial concerns, according to a Dow Jones executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Late last week, Dow Jones also announced a buyout plan for 340 eligible employees who turn 55 by the end of the year and have worked for Dow Jones for at least 10 years. That development, said Richard Tofel, a spokesman for the company, had been planned for nearly two months and was unrelated to the bad news about advertising revenues.
The company's stock rose $1 Friday to close at $44.6875.
Miles Groves, the chief economist for the Newspaper Association of America, an industry trade group, said the Journal's revenue decline was an anomaly because it is a traditional vehicle for financial services advertising.
"It's in the most vulnerable sector," Mr. Groves said. "For most newspapers, it's a different situation."
For instance, he and James Conaghan, the association's director for market and business analysis, said the trend of deregulation in utility industries had been a boon for newspapers, which are prime vehicles for the newly competitive industry's advertising.
Over all, Mr. Groves said, he would not alter his standing forecast that spending by companies and individuals advertising in newspapers would increase by more than 6 percent this year.
But there are setbacks in some regions. The Boston Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Company; The San Jose Mercury-News, one of the biggest papers in Knight Ridder's newspaper chain, and The Los Angeles Times, the flagship of the Times Mirror Company, have all seen classified advertising revenues, particularly those from help-wanted ads, scaled back since the high-technology business started losing customers in Asia, because of economic turmoil there.
Local housing market trends had a negative impact in Miami and San Francisco. The Miami Herald, another Knight Ridder paper, has had difficulties with classified advertising for a different reason. A building boom, fueled in part by demand from Latin American buyers seeking a place of their own in Miami, went through a lull in the last year, according to The Herald's publisher, Alberto Ibarguen. The result has been a softening in revenue from real estate advertising.
The decline, Mr. Ibarguen added, began long before the summer shocks in the world's financial markets. "Our issues have been classified all year long," he said.
Lee J. Guittar, the publisher and editor of The San Francisco Examiner, which is owned by the Hearst Corporation, said a robust housing market had meant few vacancies and therefore fewer real estate ads: while ad revenues were running about 6.5 percent ahead of 1997 in the first two quarters, the increase was closer to 2 percent in the third quarter, he said.
In Dallas, the opening of a city airport is expected to bring new airline competition to challenge the dominant Southwest Airlines -- an industry battle that could mean new advertising for The Dallas Morning News, according to Burl Osborne, the newspaper's publisher. But the newspaper, which had record-high revenues in telecommunications advertising in 1997, has not been able to improve on those figures significantly, he added. The Morning News is owned by the A. H. Belo Company.
The New York Times also saw a slight falloff in classified advertising revenues, largely in the help-wanted category, said Nancy Nielsen, spokeswoman for The New York Times Company. But, she added, national advertising revenues have far outpaced the 1997 figures.

Swiss Telephone Company Prices Its Initial Offering
Swisscom, Switzerland's dominant, state-owned telephone company, said it would sell its shares at 340 Swiss francs each, raising 7.5 billion francs, or $5.5 billion, in the eighth-biggest initial offering of all time and the biggest in Europe this year. 
 Shares of Swisscom will start trading in Zurich today. On the New York Stock Exchange, its American depository receipts, which represent one-tenth of a share, will begin trading at $25.30 each. The price is at the low end of the company's range announced in September as the offering came under pressure from the recent slump in world markets. Page C9.

HEADLINE: Analysts Say Long Slump May Be Nearing End in Chip Industry

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
American semiconductor companies, still in the midst of one of the longest industry slumps, are expected to report a lackluster third quarter, but analysts say that the worst may be over.
Buoyed by a rebound in sales of personal computer -- as retailers have reduced bloated inventories from earlier in the year -- chip makers that provide components to PC makers are expected to report third-quarter earnings that are flat to slightly higher, compared with the dismal second quarter. 
 "I think the industry has seen a bottom here," Mark Edelstone, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst, said. "Everything that touches the PC is doing pretty well. Everything else is pretty mixed."
The second quarter saw several chip makers give early warning of disappointing earnings, as the economic malaise in Asia, a glut of PC's and memory chips, and too much manufacturing capacity contributed to an industry downturn.
While analysts still forecast a sharp decline in worldwide chip sales this year -- the third year of the industry downturn -- Wall Street has been heartened this quarter by fewer warnings of negative earnings.
"We believe that most of the industry has hit bottom and expect flat sales or sequential improvements in the third quarter," John Lazlo, a Paine Webber Inc. analyst, said. "Unlike the prior three quarters, we do not expect much unfavorable news."
Last month, the world's largest chip maker, the Intel Corporation, which develops microprocessors -- used in almost 90 percent of the world's PC's -- forecast a third quarter that would be better than previously expected, based on strong demand in North America and Europe. Its third-quarter revenues will be 8 to 10 percent above second-quarter revenues of $5.9 billion, the company said.

HEADLINE: Report Says Poor Areas Lack Information

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The World Bank warned today that the global information explosion could divert attention from the suffering of impoverished communities that lack the basic necessities of life.
"In our enthusiasm for the information superhighway, we must not forget the villages and slums without telephones, electricity or safe water, the primary schools without pencils, paper or books," wrote James Wolfensohn, the president of the bank, in an introduction to the 1998-1999 World Bank Development Report released here. "For the poor, the promise of the new information age -- knowledge for all -- can seem as remote as a distant star." 
 The report, titled "Knowledge for Development," stressed that access to financial, technical and medical knowledge was crucial to improving health and living standards.
It cited the example of Costa Rica, where life expectancy and infant mortality statistics compare favorably with many industrialized countries -- even though incomes are one-tenth those of the United States.
What has made a difference, according to the bank, has been a decades-long government campaign to provide the Costa Rican people with information about sanitation and health.
The report noted that information gaps had contributed to the Asian financial crisis. It found that the capital outflows and currency collapse experienced in Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia "reflected the pervasive lack of information throughout the world about finance in the region."
The bank recommended that developing countries invest in education and technical training and maintain a trading regime that is open to outside ideas. It said governments and multilateral institutions should work together to promote product standards, disclosure requirements and accounting regulations.

HEADLINE: Viacom's Weak Link Grows a Bit Stronger;
Blockbuster Shows Gains as Parent Proceeds With a Strategy to Shed It

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
After years of trying to turn around the company's Blockbuster video-rental unit, the chairman of Viacom Inc., Sumner M. Redstone, seemed finally to be on the right track. Viacom's shares had been weathering the recent stock market turbulence, largely on word that Blockbuster was bringing customers back into its stores in record numbers.
Then last Tuesday, in a matter of hours, it looked as if Mr. Redstone's well-laid Blockbuster plan was about to go bust. 
 Early that morning, two Wall Street analysts reduced their third-quarter earnings forecast for Viacom. Blockbuster was spending so much to keep customers happy by keeping shelves stocked with the biggest hit films, the analysts warned, that Viacom's profits were bound to suffer. Within hours after Tuesday's opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, Viacom shares were down 16.6 percent on the American Stock Exchange.
So Mr. Redstone, who was in Los Angeles and planning to head to Boston, directed the pilot of his Gulfstream III jet to streak back to New York, where Viacom has its headquarters. Throughout the five-hour flight, he worked the air phone at 20,000 feet, assuring institutional investors and heads of the major funds that hold Viacom shares that "all of our businesses are meeting or exceeding expectations," as he repeatedly put it.
By the time the market closed, Mr. Redstone was back at his Manhattan office. And his damage control had helped the stock recover part of its loss, closing at $56.75, down 10.8 percent on the day. But despite Mr. Redstone's high-altitude salesmanship, the crisis is hardly over. The stock closed Friday at $56.5625.
Early next year, Viacom hopes to spin off 20 percent of Blockbuster to the public, the first part of a two-part strategy in which Mr. Redstone intends to separate the rest of Blockbuster from Viacom through a spinoff, sale or stock swap. The whole process is intended to let investors track Blockbuster separately from the rest of Viacom, whose stock market value is being held down by the video operation, analysts say.
An initial offering would raise money for Viacom and determine a de facto market value for the other 80 percent of Blockbuster. That could set the stage for the second step -- either a tax-free spinoff to shareholders or perhaps even a sale of the rest of the video unit. But last Tuesday's battering of Viacom's stock indicated that analysts and investors are leery of any move that could affect the share price.
"Marketing and promotion costs are hurting near-term earnings more than expected," said Jessica Reif Cohen, a Merrill Lynch analyst, one of the analysts whose revised third-quarter cash-flow estimates forced the Viacom chairman to change his flight plan. "Hopefully," Ms. Cohen said in an interview, "this is a one-time investment."
But, Harold Vogel, a media analyst at SG Cowen Securities, says if marketing costs continue to reduce profit margins in the future, he questions whether "slower growth at Blockbuster will depress the valuation received for an I.P.O."
But Mr. Redstone dismisses such critics, just as he has long scorned soothsayers who have contended that interactive television and digital cable would render the video-rental business obsolete. "We are intent on increasing our market share," he said of the Blockbuster marketing blitz. "Last year 17 million VCR's were sold," Mr. Redstone pointed out. "The year before they sold 18 million, and people are not using them to wash clothes."
Certainly Viacom remains strong in its core businesses: the MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1 cable networks, and the Paramount film and television studios. The film business, in particular, has had a standout year at the box office with "The Truman Story"; "Titanic," a co-production with the 20th Century Fox unit of the News Corporation, and "Saving Private Ryan" and "Deep Impact," both co-productions with Dreamworks SKG.
But Blockbuster has long been seen as an albatross, almost from the moment Viacom paid $5.5 billion for it in 1994 as a way to generate the large cash flow to help finance its $10 billion purchase of Paramount Communications. It was widely considered a quick fix for Viacom, but one that would not last long as the advent of interactive digital cable television systems sent rental videos the way of the Victrola.
Digital cable remains somewhere in the future, though, and Blockbuster's problem turned out to be less one of demand and more one of supply. Under a time-honored operating strategy, Blockbuster would buy tapes from the studios for $65 each and recover the cost and make any profits from the rental fees. The company kept all the proceeds, but the high purchase price for each tape meant a limited rental inventory -- and dissatisfied customers.
So earlier this year, Mr. Redstone and Blockbuster's new chief executive, John F. Antioco, came up with a plan in which the home video chain would buy tapes from film companies for $7 a cassette or less and then split the rental revenues with the studios. "What drives the plan," Mr. Antioco said in a telephone interview, "is that the customer is doing better. You can pretty much go into a store and get anything you want."
The results from this "Satisfaction Guaranteed" campaign are already evident. In the second quarter of 1998, which ended on June 30, same-store sales improved more than 12.8 percent from those in the quarter a year earlier.
And for 1998, Blockbuster could account for $550 million, or more than 25 percent, of the company's $2 billion in cash flow -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- on revenue of $12 billion, according to estimates by Ms. Cohen of Merrill Lynch. Last year, Blockbuster generated only about $425 million, Ms. Cohen estimates.
But the reduced earnings forecast last Tuesday by Ms. Cohen and Alan Kassan of Deutsche Bank Securities took note that Blockbuster was spending aggressively to advertise and promote its customer satisfaction campaign.
"Investors have seen Blockbuster's rebound through rose-colored glasses," said Mr. Vogel, SG Cowen Securities analyst, "not realizing there is a cost attached to gaining market share." But "in the long run, it is the right thing to do," he said, particularly if Viacom is dressing up Blockbuster for a spinoff or sale.
It is no secret that Viacom has wanted to spin off or sell Blockbuster. But tax rules dictate that an acquirer must retain ownership of an acquired company for at least five years before shedding it in any type of tax-free transaction. So it has been to the advantage of Mr. Redstone, the largest Viacom shareholder, with 67 percent of the voting stock, to wait until September 1999 to make such a move with Blockbuster. But the initial offering for 20 percent could come at any time, and Mr. Redstone is hoping for early next year.
So the question for Mr. Redstone's critics is not so much "When?" but "At what cost?"
Blockbuster's promotional costs will presumably drop, but no one can yet say by how much. And though the new strategy lets Blockbuster stores carry a larger inventory of hits, one film company executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that making it easier for customers to rent the most popular mass-market movies could reduce the demand for niche films -- and make it harder for studios to recover the costs of making those pictures, which are often still in the red before being released on video.
To that criticism, Mr. Antioco offers a counterargument: On an independent or art film, where he used to worry about taking the risk of spending $65 for a tape that might not cover its costs in rentals, he can now afford to take a chance.
Mr. Redstone, for his part, says that nothing so far in the stock market -- not last Tuesday's selloff of Viacom, not the general paralysis in the initial-offering market that last week claimed Goldman, Sachs as its latest victim -- need deter him from a Blockbuster stock offering. "We are doing very well," Mr. Redstone said. "And we have very little exposure in Asia," he added, referring to that region's economic woes.
The best measure of his confidence may be that, as Viacom has told analysts, the company is buying back a series of stock warrants, trading at $4 a share, that will expire worthless unless the stock price exceeds $70 a share next July. "If Viacom thought the stock would be down next July," Ms. Cohen said, "then they wouldn't need to buy them in." To some analysts, Mr. Redstone's optimism is worrisome because it has prompted overly bullish expectations on the part of Wall Street before.
Some of that optimism may be justified. The pending $4.3 billion sale of the Simon & Schuster book publishing unit to Pearson P.L.C. will help the company cut debt to $4 billion next year from $10 billion in 1996. "Their balance sheet is very strong," said David Londoner, an analyst who follows the company for Schroder Inc.
Meanwhile, under the Viacom Entertainment unit's chairman, Jonathan Dolgin, and Sherry Lansing, who reports to him as chairman of the motion picture group, the movie business has curtailed its release schedule from more than 20 films a year to an annual rate of about 16, below the industry average. Mr. Dolgin noted that the competition among releases of big-budget films had grown so heated that he thought a more limited release schedule would help the company focus on the movies that count most.
Elsewhere in Mr. Dolgin's entertainment division, the biggest challenge is getting the fledgling UPN broadcast network on track. In an era when the major television networks increasingly want to own the series they produce, Viacom needs a viable network of its own to showcase some of its Paramount television series, like "The Watcher." After a rocky debut for UPN in 1995, featuring ill-fated experiments that failed to attract many advertisers to the network, its new head, Dean Valentine, is using shows like "Legacy," a multigenerational period drama, to seek a broader middle-class audience for UPN and to differentiate it from the increasingly narrow-aimed broadcast networks like Time Warner's WB, which focuses on a younger audience.
Viacom's mainstay, meanwhile, is its cable networks. MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1 continue to drive the company, providing roughly half its operating cash flow.
Yet, future growth for MTV and Nickelodeon will be hard to maintain as those networks reach saturation among cable households with teen-agers and younger children. Ms. Cohen estimates that cash-flow growth at the cable networks will drop to about 14 percent in 1999 from 18 percent this year. That makes the outlook for Viacom's other divisions more crucial than it might be otherwise.
Investors might not care quite as much about Blockbuster's future if they thought that Mr. Redstone, who is 74, would sell all of Viacom in the near future so that shareholders could realize a premium on the stock.
But such a sale is unlikely. The stock is held in trust, Mr. Redstone said, "first for my wife during her lifetime, and then it goes to the kids and the grandchildren." And as long as he is around, Mr. Redstone apparently has no intention of passing the baton. "While I would listen to offers," he said, "my strong inclinations would be against selling."
Which means that the only Viacom asset likely to be in play any time soon is part, or perhaps all, of Blockbuster. And as Mr. Redstone learned last Tuesday at 20,000 feet, investors will be watching his every move.

Charts: "Starting to Pull Its Weight"
Since it was bought by Viacom in 1994, Blockbuster has been a drag on earnings because of its high overhead costs and inability to satisfy customers'demand for the latest hit films. Now, a new business plan may have Blockbuster headed in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Docket Mixes Old and New

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The Supreme Court term that opens Monday has the potential to produce significant rulings in such areas as civil rights and Federal regulation, with a mix of constitutional and statutory cases on a docket that is still very much a work in progress.
The Court's calendar is also a mix of old and new: The Justices will revisit the familiar issues of sexual harassment and redistricting, while also undertaking their first review of the 1996 law that was intended to increase competition in the telecommunications industry. 
 In a case of immediate practical importance, the Court has scheduled an expedited argument next month on whether the Census Bureau can proceed with its plan to adjust for the expected undercount in the year 2000 census by using statistical sampling. A special three-judge Federal District Court here ruled on Aug. 24 that sampling was barred by Federal law, leaving plans for the census in doubt until the Supreme Court resolves the issue.
The Court has 45 cases on its docket for decision, roughly half the number it will decide by the time the term ends late next June. A few of the cases waiting in the Court's pipeline could, if granted during the next few months, convert an already interesting term to one of extremely high visibility. Among these is the Clinton Administration's appeal of a ruling in July that the attorney-client privilege does not shield communications between the President and White House lawyers (Office of the President v. Office of Independent Counsel, No. 98-316).
Also awaiting the Court's review, but not yet granted, is a constitutional challenge to a school voucher program in Wisconsin, upheld by that state's Supreme Court, that permits the use of vouchers for parochial school tuition (Jackson v. Benson, No. 98-376). Another of the pending appeals, a campaign finance case from Cincinnati, could provide the Justices with a vehicle for re-examining the Court's precedents equating campaign spending with free speech.
In this case, City of Cincinnati v. Kruse, No. 98-454, the city is defending limits on expenditures for City Council elections. A Federal appeals court invalidated the $140,000 spending limit on the basis of the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Buckley v. Valeo. Cincinnati is arguing that unlimited campaign spending has been so damaging to the country that the Justices should revisit their 1976 precedent that found spending limits to violate the First Amendment.
Of the cases the Court has already accepted, the census sampling case could have the most immediate impact -- but then again, it may not. One question is whether the House of Representatives, where the Republican majority opposes the use of sampling techniques, had standing to bring the lawsuit in the absence of any concrete, institutional injury to itself. The Administration is arguing in its appeal, Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives, No. 98-404, that the suit should have been dismissed, noting that no matter how the census is conducted, the House of Representatives will still consist of 435 members and will still exercise the same constitutional powers.
The stated aim of the sampling effort is to adjust for the several million people the census will predictably miss, as the last one did, if it counts heads in the traditional manner. The heated politics around the issue reflects the fact that the undercount is not neutral; members of minority groups and poor people living in cities are missed most often and, consequently, the predominantly Democratic areas where these people live would benefit the most if they were accounted for.
Beyond the census issue, another of the Court's cases could affect the next round of reapportionment. For the third time in five years, the Court will review a Congressional districting case from North Carolina. The Justices invalidated, as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, the state's earlier effort to comply with the Voting Rights Act by creating an irregularly shaped, majority-black district.
Now, the 12th Congressional District has another new shape, somewhat more compact and with a slight majority of white voters. The question in Hunt v. Cromartie, No. 98-85, is whether the district is still invalid, as a special panel of three Federal judges ruled last spring. The Court's answer could determine the extent to which legislators can take race into account in drawing new district lines after the next census.
In its last term, the Court ruled in four sexual harassment cases, one of which, Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, concerned harassment by teachers of students. The Court ruled that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in school programs that receive Federal money, made school districts liable for harassment by teachers if it could be shown that school officials knew of the problem and refused to intervene.
The new case, Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, No. 97-843, presents the question of a school district's liability for harassment of a student by another student. The Federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled last year that Title IX did not apply to the situation. The Supreme Court appeal was filed by a woman whose daughter was harassed for months by a boy in her fifth-grade classroom in Macon, Ga., where school officials refused to take action despite repeated complaints.
In another civil rights case, the Court will decide whether collective bargaining agreements that provide for arbitration of disputes bar individual lawsuits against an employer for discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age or disability. Most labor agreements these days contain arbitration clauses, and there has been widespread dispute in the lower courts over whether these apply only to workplace issues arising under the contract, or whether the clauses also bar access to Federal court by employees seeking to vindicate their rights under Federal civil rights law. This closely watched case is Wright v. Universal Maritime Services Corp., No. 97-889.
While the sexual harassment and arbitration cases present statutory questions, the Court also has some important constitutional cases that raise civil rights issues. The Justices will review a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance under which the police can arrest people they suspect of being gang members, and who refuse an order to move along after being seen lingering with another person "with no apparent purpose" in a public place.
The Illinois Supreme Court last year struck down the law, under which the police had made some 43,000 arrests in three years, on the ground that it was impermissibly vague and imposed arbitrary restrictions on individual liberty. Anti-loitering laws were common before the Court struck down several of them in the 1970's, and this case, Chicago v. Morales, No. 97-1121, is being watched closely to see whether the Court adheres to those precedents.
A welfare case from California also implicates the Court's precedents, raising the question of whether states can discriminate against newcomers in the distribution of benefits. In 1996, Congress authorized states to reduce welfare benefits for new residents. The Federal appeals court in San Francisco blocked California from putting into effect its two-tiered welfare policy, under which new residents are held for the first 12 months to the benefits they would have received in their home states.
In a 1969 decision, Shapiro v. Thompson, the Supreme Court ruled that it violated the constitutional right to travel for states to deny all welfare benefits to newcomers. A question in the new case, Anderson v. Roe, No. 98-97, is how that precedent applies to a reduction rather than elimination of benefits.
Finally, the case with the highest economic stakes may be the Court's review of an appeals court decision last year that sharply limited the Federal Government's role in opening up the $100 billion market for local telephone service under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. There are a number of separate questions in A.T.&T. v. Iowa Utilities Board, No. 97-826, which is actually a group of eight cases with so many parties and such complex regulatory issues that the Court has scheduled an unusual two hours, instead of one, for argument on Oct. 13.
A basic issue is the allocation of regulatory authority, in making important pricing decisions under the 1996 law, between the Federal Communications Commission and state regulators. Would-be entrants into the market for local service are on the Government's side, while the incumbent local carriers are on the side of the states.

HEADLINE: Amnesty Finds 'Widespread Pattern' of U.S. Rights Violations

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Amnesty International, in its first campaign directed at any Western nation, intends to publish a harsh report on the United States on Tuesday, saying American police forces and criminal and legal systems have "a persistent and widespread pattern of human rights violations."
Amnesty, the 37-year-old human rights organization based in London, plans to make its report the focus of a yearlong effort in more than 100 countries and in international bodies like the United Nations to protest what it calls an American failure "to deliver the fundamental promise of rights for all." 
 The report is part of a growing effort among human rights organizations to seek "balance" in reporting by looking at industrialized as well as developing nations. The Clinton Administration has encouraged that trend more than its predecessors, welcoming monitors from the United Nations Human Rights Commission in the face of sharp criticism from some members of Congress.
But American officials and American human rights groups that are also often critical have had mixed reactions to some international reports, describing some as selective or lacking in nuance and context and often deliberately excluding background information on civil rights protections in the United States.
The new Amnesty report is bound to be among the most controversial of the recent surveys. Officials in New York, which figures prominently, and in Washington declined to comment because they had not seen the report.
The 150-page report pulls together widely reported cases of abuses around the United States and incorporates the work of American advocacy groups and Amnesty investigations. Without responses from American officials, it concludes with this statement:
"Across the country thousands of people are subjected to sustained and deliberate brutality at the hands of police officers. Cruel, degrading and sometimes life-threatening methods of constraint continue to be a feature of the U.S. criminal justice system."
The report also condemns what is sees as a general failure to punish offending officials. It criticizes the treatment of people who seek asylum by American immigration authorities and calls, as Amnesty has done in the past, for the abolition of the death penalty, which the report says is "often enacted in vengeance, applied in an arbitrary manner, subject to bias because of the defendant's race or economic status, or driven by the political ambitions of those who oppose it."
Pierre Sane, a development expert from Senegal who has been Secretary General of Amnesty International for six years, said in an interview that the United States was chosen as the first Western target because human rights conditions were deteriorating.
"We felt it was ironic that the most powerful country in the world uses international human rights laws to criticize others," Mr. Sane said, "but does not apply the same standards at home."
Mr. Sane does not deny that the report, some of in strong, often polemical language, seems to hold Government officials more responsible for violations than the individuals who exceed their authority in committing abuses.
"Responsibility to uphold human rights lays with the Federal Government, lays with the Congress, lays with authorities in the different states," he said. "I think that what our research has found is a generalized failure of the systems of monitoring, of accountability for the police, for the prison guards, for immigration officials."
The report criticizes the United States for failing to sign international rights conventions, among them the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Mr. Sane said it was not relevant that some countries that had signed the convention did not act against abuses of children, as in southern Asia, where more than 50 million children are thought to be forced to work, many of them in bonded labor.
"The covenant is extremely important, because the covenant represents a consensus of all nations," he said. "That a country does not respect its laws once it becomes part of the covenant is another problem."
Mr. Sane said the purpose of the Amnesty campaign against the United States was "to raise awareness of the need to take action.".
"I think in terms of the severity of what is happening in the U.S., more or less people are aware," Mr. Sane said. "They are aware that in the States police can be brutal. They're aware that prisons are not the best place to be in. But what we are concerned with is the lack of action and the complacency.
"It seems to me that the international community, in terms of standards, is moving really ahead of the standards obtaining in the United States today."

HEADLINE: Politics Again Leaves U.S. Financial Overhaul in Limbo

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
World financial markets are in turmoil. Hedge funds are bleeding billions. But with consumers confused and investors scared, a measure that supporters say would modernize the nation's financial system and make it more globally competitive is stuck in Congress, caught in the crosscurrents of several political fights.
In the tension between policy and politics, politics is winning out as the measure approaches the finish line. The bill, which Congress has debated for two decades, would eliminate barriers separating banks, insurance companies and brokers and allow them to merge into new financial conglomerates. 
 The first fight that could derail it pits Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who has been arm-twisting for the bill, against Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary, who opposes it. This battle has nothing to do with financial policy but is a bitter turf fight over who will be the top regulator in the financial world of the future.
Then there is the tight Senate race in New York. The incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has been tirelessly pushing for the bill. It could give him a major legislative victory, especially for his hometown financial industry and longtime financial backers, as the race moves into the final stretch. A victory would portray Mr. D'Amato as someone who can deliver a big bill, the most important piece of financial legislation in decades.
In a squeeze is his Democratic opponent, Representative Charles E. Schumer, who voted for the bill in May but has done little since. He risks upsetting his Wall Street supporters if he does not prevail on fellow Democrats in Congress and in the Administration to enact this bill. But while its passage could polish his image, too, as someone who can get things done in Washington, it would also hand a public relations victory to Mr. D'Amato.
Finally, there is President Clinton, who has threatened to veto the measure even as he lectures Japan and other Asian nations on modernizing their financial systems. His motivation? Those close to the process suggest that it is to "look Presidential" amid his own political problems by waving the veto pen, to deny Republicans a legislative victory on a bill that Democrats have never been able to get out of Congress and to deny glory to Mr. D'Amato, who harshly criticized the Clintons during the Senate Whitewater hearings. Besides, Mr. Rubin opposes it, and Mr. Clinton trusts Mr. Rubin.
"There are big political currents on this bill," said Martin Farmer, a lobbyist for the Independent Bankers of America, a trade group. "There are fist fights going on, and it's all getting pretty intense."
But Mr. D'Amato said simply: "Financial modernization is long overdue. It's good for the country, good for the state, but it's not a political issue."
Oddly enough, it appears there are enough votes in the Senate to pass the bill if these political battles do not scuttle it. In May, the House passed the measure by a single vote. But since then, various industry groups that had been fighting one another have settled their differences and now back the bill. Moreover, support is largely bipartisan, with enough Democratic and Republican agreement to eliminate party-line fights.
"In the middle, there is overwhelming consensus to get this bill passed," said an aide to a Democratic Senate leader. "The question is whether this bill will be pulled apart at the edges, or is there enough heft in the middle to roll it through. As a political matter, it's gotten weird."
Robert Russbuldt, executive vice president of the Independent Insurance Agents of America, added: "You have a bill before the Senate that now has no substantial private-sector opposition. You have historic agreements between many industries once antagonistic. The issues on the table now are not substantive, they are political."
Perhaps the weirdest fight of all is between Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin. Technically, it is over how financial institutions of the future would be structured, as bank holding companies with numerous affiliates or as banks with numerous subsidiaries. Most banks, brokers and insurance companies don't care which structure is chosen; they just want the bill to pass. The difference is that if the bank holding company structure is chosen, the Federal Reserve becomes the nation's top financial regulator; if the affiliate structure is selected, the Treasury Department keeps its hold.
So far, Mr. Greenspan is winning. The bill has the Federal Reserve as the top regulator, and efforts by Mr. Rubin and the Treasury to shift it were defeated by a 3-to-1 ratio in the House and resoundingly in the Senate Banking Committee. Even Democrats did not support Mr. Rubin, a Democrat, on this issue. The reason? Congress loves Mr. Greenspan.
"Every time Greenspan has come to pitch Congress, they've sided with him," said Dan Zielenski, a lobbyist for the American Insurance Association. "He's got the stature as the Lord High Protector of the economy, and if Greenspan is saying it is not safe to vote the other way, what member of Congress wants to take the risk of voting against Alan Greenspan?"
But Mr. Rubin has something in his back pocket: the threat of a Presidential veto. So far, the Treasury has refused to negotiate with lawmakers or lobbyists, preferring a "just say no" attitude in the belief that this veto threat will cause Congress, ultimately, to change the bill.
There are two theories to explain this strategy. One is that Mr. Rubin, formerly a Wall Street trader, is engaged in a game of political "liar's poker" and, to gain maximum leverage, will not give an inch until the last minute. The other theory is simpler -- that he means what he says.
A top Administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the latter theory was correct. "Unless the concerns we have expressed are fully satisfied -- and we have not seen any movement at all in that direction -- as far as I'm concerned, the bill is on a veto track."
So, what happens if the bill, with Mr. Greenspan as the top regulator, is passed by the Senate next week and lands on the President's desk? Here again, theories abound. One is that, given the financial turmoil everywhere, the President would have a hard time not signing a measure that the entire financial services industry says is needed.
Another theory holds that the President would also have a hard time saying no to Congressional Democrats, especially close allies, who have been trying to pass the bill for two decades, or to a Congress that has worked, with bipartisan cooperation, on this measure for two years. That said, he would also be loath to hand a victory to a Republican Congress or do anything that could help return a Republican to the Senate.
Based on some of the President's statements, some say Mr. Clinton may use the argument that the bill is anti-consumer because it does not expand provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to provide low-cost services to low- and moderate-income consumers. But that could prove to be a flimsy reason because the bill maintains the status quo on that issue and actually expands it a bit.
In late September, a delegation of Wall Street executives, including Sanford I. Weill, chief executive of Travelers Group, and John S. Reed, chief executive of Citicorp, called on Mr. Rubin. But their efforts were to no avail. "We told the Wall Street C.E.O.'s that our veto is still in place," one White House official said.
And there is another potent obstacle in the Senate. Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, has vowed to kill the bill with a filibuster and deft parliamentary maneuvers because it does not eliminate any and all Community Reinvestment Act obligations on banks, something Mr. Gramm has compared to slavery. On this point, to the dismay of the Republican leadership, Mr. Gramm is acting on his own convictions. No one in the financial services industry supports his view.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Breaking Barriers"
After two decades, the Financial Services Competition Act has been passed by the House and is to be considered by the Senate this week. The legislation, if passed, will lift barriers on American financial institutions and help them compete globally.
 
The bill would allow:
Banks, securities firms and insurance companies to be jointly owned by a new financial services holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve.
Banking institutions to engage in securities business, including underwriting and sale of equities.
The creation of wholesale financial institutions that would act as a bank and broker.
Bank holding companies to underwrite and sell insurance and, in some cases, underwrite municipal bonds.
Bank affiliated companies to hold stakes in commercial corporations as long as they are not the majority shareholders.
 
The bill would prohibit:
Commercial companies from buying or chartering savings and loan institutions.
Commercial corporations and banks from merging.

HEADLINE: World Bank Worried by Pressure for Quick-Fix Fiscal Action

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
As the global economic crisis spreads, the World Bank fears that it will be made to transform itself from a slow-moving development agency into a financial fire truck, programmed to squirt streams of cash at countries under speculative attack as part of a plan to head off such crises.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund, which was expressly created to perform the job of emergency financial rescue, is in danger of becoming sidelined in the present emergency. After advancing huge loans to Asia and Russia, it has only enough cash left for one more big rescue operation unless the United States Congress overcomes its hostility to giving it new funds. 
 "What I've been trying to do recently is to convince my shareholders that they shouldn't think of the Bank as a second-level I.M.F.," the World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, said last week at a news conference, stressing that his duty is to promote sound long-term development. "We are not that; we are not a lender of last resort or a liquidity funder."
As finance ministers from all over the world gathered here this weekend in preparation for next week's annual joint meeting of the World Bank and the I.M.F., many warned that without a radical strengthening of the international financial system the crisis will spread far beyond Asia and Russia to affect the whole developing world.
"Recession will be at the door of all countries unless we react quickly," Algeria's Finance Minister, Abdelkrim Harchaoui, said on Saturday after serving as chairman of a meeting of the Group of 24, which represents the developing world.
India's Finance Minister, Yashwant Sinha, said, "We're witnessing an unprecedented crisis, with whole regions engulfed, not just countries. It's a global challenge."
The I.M.F. has sharply lowered its economic growth forecasts for the developing world as a whole, predicting now that its economies will expand by 2.3 percent this year and 3.6 percent next. That compares with last year's 5.8 percent rate.
The four most seriously affected Asian countries -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea and the Philippines -- are much the worst hit. Together they face a 10.4 percent decline in economic output this year and another smaller contraction next year.
Hopes of economic growth in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union have also been dashed, with the I.M.F. now expecting a decline overall and a sharp 6 percent fall in Russian output this year and next combined.
Under difficult international conditions, what the World Bank now fears is that the United States and other members of the Group of Seven will push it into contributing to the plan they endorsed on Saturday for creating a big new pool of money to combat the global crisis.
This would involve asking the World Bank to relax its usual lending standards and to join the I.M.F. in making new quick-dispersing loans to countries in trouble that would be little more than cash injections rather than a serious contribution to their long-term development.
At a news conference today, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, was ambiguous about the World Bank's role in the present crisis, saying the Group of Seven wanted "to stress the World Bank's long-term role in promoting structural reforms" but adding that it must still "take a role in crisis management."
In the back of everyone's mind is Brazil, which has been in danger of speculative attack for some time and is informally discussing a possible big new loan of about $30 billion with international aid agencies and Western governments once this weekend's elections are out of the way.
The World Bank is vulnerable to pressure to become more of a short-term financing agency for countries in distress because, unlike the I.M.F., it is relatively flush with cash at the moment. With a lending capacity of some $160 billion and about $104 billion in outstanding loans and pledges, it could in theory lend an additional $50 billion or so.
"When Larry sees those figures," a senior World Bank official said, referring to Lawrence H. Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, "he says to himself, 'Here's another $50 billion to throw at the crisis.' "
World Bank officials say they are ready to play some financial fire-fighting role. But they do not want to endanger their reputation as a first-class borrower on international financial markets by raising annual net lending above $11 billion, from about $8 billion last year.
And they insist that any extra loans should meet their traditional lending conditions and be destined for sound long-term projects intended to fight poverty and to promote development goals like education, health and environmental protection.
The I.M.F., meanwhile, has the potential to play an enhanced role, as the Group of Seven called on it to do on Saturday, since member governments have agreed to give it $90 billion more of their national currencies, of which about $60 billion would be paid in desirable currencies that crisis-stricken countries would want to borrow.
In addition, they want to expand a special overdraft fund known as the General Arrangements to Borrow by a further $22 billion, thus giving the I.M.F. a total of nearly $90 billion in extra money to lend.
But the actual provision of this cash remains stalled by the refusal of Congress to approve the United States' contribution.
Until Congress gives its assent, the I.M.F. has only about $26 billion of usable currencies left in its coffers and $16.5 billion more in the special overdraft fund.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE TELL U.S. THAT THEIR BANKS ARE IN BIG TROUBLE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Japan's top financial officials told their American counterparts this weekend that their country's banking system was acutely short of capital, with the top 19 banks in deeper trouble than Tokyo has ever before admitted, according to officials familiar with the discussions.
At a private meeting on Saturday, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaru Hayami, told Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the capital supporting those 19 major banks has dwindled to dangerously low levels in recent months. 
 The capital reserve levels are now so low that these banks of the world's second largest economy might be banned from operating internationally "if the rules were vigorously pursued," said a senior Japanese official, relating the conversation.
But today, in a reflection of the enormous confusion surrounding Japan's financial crisis, other senior Japanese officials disputed Mr. Hayami's presentation and insisted that the reserve levels have not declined to dangerous levels.
Banks that want to operate globally are required to keep on hand capital amounting to at least 8 percent of their outstanding loans. Fewer and fewer of Japan's banks can meet that standard today. Mr. Hayami's remarks suggest that some may fall below the 4 percent minimum for operating within Japan.
Japan's conflicting explanations came as leaders of the world's major economies met here for a second day at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to grapple with an economic crisis that many fear has spun out of control. Today, Mr. Rubin again pressed for changes at the fund and the bank that would improve their ability to head off crises.
"Strengthening the response to the current crisis and creating a modern framework for the global markets of the 21st century will not be easy or quick," Mr. Rubin said before the committee that oversees the I.M.F.'s operations.
But many officials here, including James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, argued today that countries should focus their energies on the immediate crisis and postpone a broader discussion of remaking the global financial system.
Mr. Rubin's meeting with Japanese officials on Saturday took place in the ornate private conference room adjacent to his office at the Treasury. The session also included Japan's Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, a 78-year-old former Prime Minister who has negotiated with the United States since the American occupation ended nearly a half-century ago.
Later, Mr. Hayami discussed the problem publicly, though in less detail, telling reporters that Japan's major banks were "undercapitalized." He called on Japan's Parliament to inject taxpayer money into the banks to restore them to health. How to do this is a hugely controversial question in the country. Japanese officials said they hoped for more than $200 billion in new funds.
Bolstering Japan's ravaged banking system is considered by many experts the single most crucial factor in quelling the global financial turmoil that has rocked markets around the world.
But there are still disputes, inside Japan and beyond its borders, over just how much trouble the banks are in. Much depends on how the figures are calculated, and there are many ways to manipulate the numbers.
Mr. Hayami, who runs Japan's independent central bank, appeared to be painting a bleak picture in the meeting at the Treasury, describing how banks have been forced to eat into their capital to write off enormous bad loans in real estate. He used, Japanese officials said later, a narrow definition of the banks' capital that put their condition in the most perilous light.
Tonight, officials of Japan's Ministry of Finance, which has been accused of greatly mismanaging its regulatory responsibility over the banks, insisted that Mr. Hayami's presentation to Mr. Rubin and Mr. Greenspan was deeply flawed. In response to queries today, they offered an alternative calculation, based on accounting standards set out by the Bank of International Settlements, that they said demonstrated that the biggest Japanese banks largely exceeded the 8 percent standard.
The disagreement seemed to underscore the enormous disarray in the Tokyo Government at a time that Japan is being portrayed, by American and European officials, as a major cause of the turmoil. But it is also possible that some Japanese officials are hoping that the disclosures will prompt even more "gaiatsu," or foreign pressure, on Japan, and thus increase the pressure on the Parliament to pump money into the banking system.
American officials said that at the meetings today they were building support for a proposal by President Clinton to change the strategy of the I.M.F., so it can offer pre-emptive aid to countries that are fundamentally healthy but in danger of runs on their currency or their banking systems because of "contagion" from other striken nations. They said it would probably be a number of weeks or a few months before the plan was adopted, however.
Mr. Clinton is expected to press for changes in the I.M.F. and an increase in social spending in a presentation to finance ministers from 22 nations on Monday evening.
At the same time, Britain, which has supported Mr. Clinton's plan, offered a pointed reminder today that the American proposal to restructure the I.M.F. would be sharply undercut if Congress failed to approve $18 billion in money the United States has committed to it. "The starting point of this is the American Government voting the resources the I.M.F. requires," the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, said at a news conference today.

HEADLINE: To Buy Some Time, Russia to Sell U.S. Some Time in Space

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
In a concession born of crisis, Russia has agreed to sell the United States up to all its allotted research time aboard the first phase of the International Space Station for $60 million, NASA officials say.
In theory, the deal reduces Russia's role to that of a builder but not a user of the biggest space project, at least during its many years of orbital assembly. But the sale would help keep Russia's faltering space program alive and its scientists engaged in the project, and presumably not searching for foreign work -- a major goal of arms controllers in the Clinton Administration. 
 The deal was worked out last week in Moscow by officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Russian Space Agency, which is increasingly desperate for money to fulfill its commitments. The meetings concluded on Friday.
The accord is the first time Russia has agreed to scale back its use of the planned international outpost since it joined the venture five years ago. The deal focuses on the assembly phase, which is to start in two months and take five or six years.
Up to three astronauts are to occupy the station while it is being built and seven at completion.
Daniel S. Goldin, NASA's administrator, told Congress in a letter last week that the agency proposed to buy for $60 million "up to 100 percent of the research time previously allocated to Russia" in the assembly phase.
The purchase, he said, includes crew time and "readily accessible stowage space" aboard the outpost. Some American research projects would replace Russian efforts on the station, but the work might end up being done by Russian astronauts.
In his letter, dated Sept. 29, Mr. Goldin called the purchase "urgent" and said the money had to be delivered to Moscow "no later than" this Friday if the huge project, already a year behind schedule, was to avoid further delays. Even with this bailout, assembly plans beyond the first two flights are in tatters because the financially squeezed Russians have been unable to finish a major unit.
If and when it is finished, the outpost of laboratories and living areas is to be nearly the size of two football fields, orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth, powered by huge arrays of solar-energy cells.
NASA officials said details of the new accord would be described on Wednesday at a hearing of the House Science Committee. But there is growing animosity in Congress over NASA's handling of the Russian crisis. Already, some members are complaining of deception.
"It's smoke and mirrors," said Representative Tim Roemer, Democrat of Indiana, a longtime opponent of the space station project. "What NASA has done is to propose a leveraged buyout of the Russian Space Agency," Mr. Roemer said. "All you have left is Russian participation as a subsidiary of NASA."
But other committee members worry that the Russians are getting too much and giving up too little. At best, they say, Russia's research area in the unfinished outpost is small and unsubstantial.
"It's not clear that they have all that much to give us, and maybe it's not worth the money," said a Congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "They're giving up something they don't really have."
His skepticism focused mainly on the station's third element, known as the service module, which the Russians are building. It is crucial, but it remains unfinished. Its troubles have precipitated the frantic maneuvering to save the Russians and keep the station project on track.
It is also the place where Russia had planned to do its research in the station's long assembly. In theory, aside from astronaut time, the alcoves of the service module are among the few concrete goods on orbit that Moscow has to offer.
Because of Russia's economic problems, completion and launching of the unit have been pushed back from next April to July at the earliest, throwing next year's station assembly sequence into turmoil.
The new deal focusing on the sale of Russian research time represents an abrupt shift in NASA's strategy to save its troubled Russian partner. Early in September, the agency proposed buying two rescue craft for the station from Russia at a cost of roughly $100 million.
But that plan has been dropped for the moment for reasons that have not been spelled out.
In the new plan, NASA would divert $60 million to Moscow from its accounts for station development and operations. Congressional experts say NASA can do that on its own authority, but they add that taking that step without Congress's blessing would only sour relations further.
Publicly, the agency has offered few other details of the goods and services it would buy to bail out its Russian partners in building the sprawling outpost. In September, it said it wanted to send Moscow as much as $660 million over five years.
In a statement issued on Friday, NASA said the officials meeting in Moscow had agreed to press ahead to launch the first station element in November, speeding the countdown for the start of project.
As currently cast with Russian participation, the International Space Station began in 1993 and is expected to cost about $50 billion.

HEADLINE: A Changed World for the I.M.F.

 BODY:
The world has changed greatly in the past year, since the last annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Then, although policy makers were slow to realize it, the world was seeing the first clear problems caused by excessive investments in emerging markets. Now the investment world has turned on its head. Banks and investors that once acted as if there were no risks see nothing but risks. An international credit crunch, in which many will not be able to borrow, is looming.
The Clinton Administration is right to look for ways to deal with that problem. Its idea of setting up an I.M.F. procedure to provide capitalto countries threatened by rapid withdrawals of funds deserves careful consideration, as does a Japanese initiative to aid Asian countries, during the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank this week in Washington. The greatest risk is that major countries will be unable to reach agreement on effective action. 
 The meetings come with the I.M.F. having been humbled. Over the past year, its prescriptions for troubled Asian countries did not produce the desired cures, and unwanted side effects forced it to dilute the medication. When first Thailand and then South Korea and Indonesia got into trouble in 1997, the I.M.F. prescribed a blend of fiscal and monetary belt-tightening that is best suited to countries whose governments have been running big budget deficits. But the problems in Asia were more in the private sector, stemming in part from crony capitalism but largely from the willingness of investors to shovel capital at banks and companies that were ill equipped to use it wisely. Severe recessions have resulted, forcing the I.M.F. to be less stringent.
With investors now excessively risk averse, and with many companies and banks in emerging markets burdened with unpayable debts, the biggest risk confronting the world is of deflation and global recession. That means ways must be found to restructure debts -- with penalties for those who lent money imprudently as well as for those who borrowed the money. Economies must be kept functioning while needed reforms are made.
The I.M.F. must play a role in that process, and in ways that make it more likely its aid will benefit the people of the affected countries rather than bail out investors, as has happened too often in the past. The Clinton proposal would have the I.M.F. lend money to countries that have made reforms but still face capital flight in the current risk-averse investing environment. In some cases, those countries will probably have to move to floating exchange rates, something the I.M.F. has resisted in the past but will sometimes need to encourage.
It is clear that the I.M.F. must adjust to changed conditions. But that should not obscure the fact that in a world with hesitant investors, countries that deserve support may have to turn to the I.M.F. Approving the $18 billion the Administration is seeking will probably be only the first step required, but some members of the House Republican leadership continue to balk with time running out in the current session. They owe it to the world to approve the money immediately.

HEADLINE: Reality of the H.M.O. System Doesn't Live Up to the Dream

SERIES: AFTER THE REVOLUTION: Lowered Expectations

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
At the start of the 90's, when employers' health insurance costs were surging 15 percent a year, the giant Sprint Corporation was quick to shift to health maintenance organizations and their businesslike management of medical care.
Sprint's costs promptly stabilized. Today, its comprehensive benefit program stands as a model of what Congress and industry envisioned four years ago when they rejected President Clinton's health plan and left the health care system to the tides of the marketplace. 
 Yet along the hallways at Sprint headquarters here, the great expectations for managed care have dimmed. In a score of interviews with workers and managers, no one recounted the kind of H.M.O. horror story that makes headlines: the wrong leg amputated, a child denied a transplant. Instead, they said they had found managed care to be exasperating, callous and sometimes just senseless.
Kevin Leroy, a Sprint sales compensation manager, says his H.M.O., Cigna, saved his 10-year-old daughter's life with months of hospitalization to help her conquer a mysterious immune system disorder. But it also required him to interrupt three days of work to get a third doctor's opinion before authorizing hernia surgery for him.
The toddler son of Elsa Wong, a project manager, suffered an ear infection for a year before her H.M.O. primary-care physician sent him to a specialist. When Phyllis Van Kamp, a secretary, had the fever and deep cough of bronchitis, a clinician told her over the phone to try aspirin for a few days.
Today managed care plans are entrenched in the economy, enrolling 61 percent of the population, according to the American Association of Health Plans. But managed care has lost its luster as an industry and as the answer to the nation's health care needs.
Managed care has so far served as a different way to pay for medical care, not a better way to provide it. Its savings to large employers have been real, contributing significantly to the current economic boom, but they are likely to prove temporary, while coverage has become more expensive for small businesses and the self-employed. Perhaps most important, managed care has shifted many consumers' concern from cost to quality.
In a New York Times poll in July, 85 percent of respondents said the health care system needs fundamental change, barely below the 90 percent who said the same thing in a Times/CBS News poll in 1994 before the Clinton health plan died. Although 68 percent said they were satisfied with the quality of their family's health care, 30 percent said they were not, up from 19 percent in 1994. And the percentage dissatisfied with the cost of health care was practically unchanged, 46 percent now compared with 47 percent then.
When asked about health maintenance organizations, 58 percent of respondents said the H.M.O.'s had impeded doctors' ability to control treatment, compared with 17 percent who said they had improved it. And though a 1995 Harris Poll found more people saying managed care would improve the quality of care rather than harm it, the Times poll found a sharp reversal, 50 percent saying care would be harmed and only 32 percent saying it would be improved.
"Four and a half years ago, the country was at a watershed and didn't know it," said Dr. Leo M. Henikoff, chief executive of the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's hospital system in Chicago.
"One option," he said, "was a highly government-regulated system. That was the Clinton plan, and the country abhorred it. They took the other option, to throw health care to the marketplace, and four years later, people don't like what they're getting."
The discontent at one time had put health care back at the center of the political debate, with Democrats especially seizing on the issue. But more recently it has been eclipsed in Congress by the scandal involving President Clinton, and although both the White House and Congress had been considering "patient protection" laws, nothing is likely to emerge this year.
At the state level, more than 40 states have chipped away at the marketplace model with new regulations. But no two states have adopted the same restraints and there is no agreement on a comprehensive system that might work better. Within the health profession itself, experts are predicting a far more wrenching debate focusing on ways to improve health care, not the system that pays for it.
 
Coverage Is Dictated By Big Businesses
Managed care was promoted as a means of reducing costs by emphasizing preventive care and purging redundant and unnecessary care. But now the practice of managed care is seen as little more than a short-sighted way to manage costs.
"Managed care so far is largely an insurance phenomenon," said David M. Lawrence, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente of Oakland, Calif., the nation's largest nonprofit health maintenance organization.
"So far, we've had not much impact on the quality of care," he said. "Ironically, the way to do that is by improving care, not by withholding it."
But for all the populist vilification of managed care companies like Aetna and United Health Care, Cigna and Kaiser, the companies work within constraints set by other, often mightier, businesses. These are the nation's largest employers, its Sprints.
A study published in the April issue of The New England Journal of Medicine said, "Large portions of the health care system have undergone revolutionary change, and not for the purpose of improving health care, but in order to reduce the cost of doing business for large corporations."
Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, a retired pediatric neurologist in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and an early proponent of managed care, said there is "a misconception about who's in charge. It's not the H.M.O.'s. It's the large corporate buyers of medical care."
Corporations with tens of thousands of employees know they can break an H.M.O. by terminating its contract, so they can draw the line on what they will pay. That, more than the much-scorned H.M.O. "utilization manager" who must approve doctors' procedures, defines the services that employees get and those they are denied.
Prescription plans, for example, often limit the medications that are covered, because employers object to the cost of covering all medications, said Donald C. Brain Jr., a consultant in Kansas City who negotiates plans for small businesses.
Such a plan, Mr. Brain said, might include one antidepressant, Prozac, but not another, Zoloft. So if a physician decides Zoloft is more suitable for a patient, the patient will have to pay for it himself if he wants it.
The patient blames the H.M.O., Mr. Brain said, "but it's the employer who makes the decision."
Large corporations can also use their leverage to obtain a good mix of care and prices. "We're trying to provide a healthy work force to the best of our ability, provide choice to the best of our ability and attract good people and keep them," said J. Robert Dinneen Jr., assistant vice president for corporate benefits at Sprint.
Not all employees, however, are benefiting. While workers for big companies like Sprint get a break on the cost of their health insurance, tens of millions of others, the employees of small businesses that lack Sprint's negotiating clout, have seen their costs continue to rise at the 1980's rate.
In a survey last year of companies with fewer than 200 workers, the journal Health Affairs found that the average monthly payroll deduction for family health insurance had leaped to $175 in 1996, from $34 in 1988.
Harold Thornton, the owner of National Consulting Services near Kansas City, a firm with eight full-time employees, ended his contract with Humana last year after it told him his premium would go up nearly 50 percent in 1998.
After considering six other health plans, his employees chose United Healthcare, which offered more benefits and more choice than Humana but still raised their premiums 25 percent.
Because Mr. Thornton says he can afford to pay just 50 percent of the premiums for his employees, they pay $75 to $600 a month for health insurance, depending on their age and coverage. That is 5 to 10 times more than workers pay at Sprint, which covers 90 percent of premiums.
"If you think that you're going to get anywhere near the benefits or costs and resulting value that a large business such as Sprint is going to receive," Mr. Thornton said of small businesses, "you will be woefully disappointed."
Still, there are limits to how much large employers can squeeze managed care companies, and corporations like Sprint are starting to accept larger increases in premiums in return for improved services and more options.
This year Sprint accepted a 3.8 percent increase, after three years when increases totaled 3.2 percent. An increase of 5 percent to 6 percent is likely for next year, Mr. Dinneen said.
"We're giving up some clout for choice," he said. "We're assuming it will be much tougher this year to keep rates at as modest an increase as they have been in the past."
Increases are likely in any case, however, because in their race to enroll the work force, 49 percent of the nation's 650 H.M.O.'s lost money through September last year, said Interstudy Publications in Minneapolis, which tracks the industry. Four years ago, Interstudy said, 90 percent were profitable.
Ominously for the economy, employers and subscribers, H.M.O.'s are trying to rebuild their profits with higher premiums.
 
Patients Take Reins Of Own Health Care
 As the Kansas City area's largest private employer, Sprint has immense leverage over H.M.O.'s that want its business, but there is still tension between its goals: keeping costs down, and keeping employees not only healthy and productive but also happy with their benefits.
The formula Sprint has settled on works, to a point. Employees say they usually get the care they need. But they say that under managed care, routine events like having blood drawn or having a baby can become exasperating and, if they drop their guard, something worse.
Susan Ott would seem to have an edge on the system as human resources director for the Local Telecommunications Division. But halfway through her second pregnancy, her H.M.O, Cigna, switched her from St. Joseph's Hospital near her home in Overland Park, Kan., to Baptist Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., 45 minutes away.
Ms. Ott had gestational diabetes and had to have blood drawn once and sometimes twice a week, and Cigna required that she use Baptist. Finally she complained to her obstetrician, so he did it in his office.
Ms. Ott still had to go to Baptist to deliver, however. She was in for another surprise. "I was checked in and out in 23 hours," she said. "I was John Wayne, walking down the hall with my newborn."
Congress later mandated that hospitals allow two days for births, but Ms. Ott had already had enough of Cigna. She switched to another H.M.O. with a Sprint contract.
Sprint offers an unusually large range of choices: five managed care plans and H.M.O.'s, plus two traditional fee-for-service plans, which permit employees to seek whatever care they want wherever they want. That option can be expensive, however, costing a family needing a lot of care as much as $6,000 a year, so less than 20 percent of the work force chooses it.
In managed care plans, each subscriber typically has a primary care "gatekeeper," the physician who provides all routine care, keeps his charts and refers him to specialists. Sprint employees, though, have stumbled upon a peculiar feature of many H.M.O.'s: the phantom gatekeeper.
The gatekeeper function survives: charts are kept, medicines are prescribed and referrals are made. But when a patient visits the clinic, he sees whoever is available. It is rarely the same doctor, and sometimes it is a nurse.
Having little confidence that anyone really knows them or their conditions, some Sprint workers have devised a strategy to make the plans work for them. They trust their own instincts. They do their own research. They do not accept no for an answer. They persist. In effect, they manage their managed care.
Phyllis Tasby and her family have been covered by Kaiser for 11 years. "I love my primary care physician," said Ms. Tasby, a Sprint human resources manager. Kaiser was instrumental in helping her stop smoking and lose weight, she said.
Then last year, she brought in her 13-year-old son because his left leg was bowing. A doctor correctly diagnosed it as Blount's disease, a condition in which the upper shin bone stops producing bone tissue.
"But they didn't tell me anything about it," Ms. Tasby said. "I went on the Internet and found information myself." When she went back to Kaiser and asked about corrective surgery, "They told me I shouldn't do anything until he was 16."
"So I went outside Kaiser," she said. "I paid $350 to a specialist. He told me I should do the surgery now." Again she returned to Kaiser, and this time she was referred to a Kaiser orthopedist, who also recommended surgery. The boy had the operation in January and Kaiser covered it.
"I won't quit Kaiser," Ms. Tasby said. But she has learned something about life with an H.M.O. "They think: 'What the customer doesn't know won't hurt. If they ask, we'll give it to them.' "
 
Cost of Sloppy Care Is High in Long Run
Critics of managed care say that so far the marketplace has been a ham-handed manager of medicine. In cutting premiums to attract employers and patients, in chipping away at excess and in wringing discounts from its physicians, hospitals and drug companies, H.M.O.'s have produced scant evidence that care itself is actually managed, or that the health plans' customers are any healthier.
There is plenty of evidence that some hospitals and their doctors are providing erroneous, excessive and inappropriate care, while others do much better.
Dr. Lawrence of Kaiser, for example, said some hospitals deliver five times as many babies by Caesarean section as others, with most of the procedures unnecessary. The New England Journal of Medicine has found that 34.5 percent of all women who get mammograms in their 40's receive false positive results and then often are treated unnecessarily. Estimates of preventable deaths in hospitals, those arising from mistakes and mistreatment, range from 120,000 a year to 180,000.
"Sloppy care is not cheap care," said Bruce M. Fried, a former assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services.
Analysts say that true management of care can curb the cost of errors and excess. They look to the developing discipline of evidence-based medicine to enable doctors to make better decisions on treatment.
Already, Kaiser has begun recording patients' charts, treatments and treatment results in computers across its entire network with the goal of learning what practices and treatments work best.
Shifting to evidence-based medicine, however, will require immense investments in computers and great changes in how H.M.O.'s and doctors do business. And so its proponents are not making the kinds of sweeping promises that H.M.O.'s made in the 80's, when managed care was still a movement, before the nation's giant insurance companies stepped in.
The benefits of evidence-based medicine will be awhile coming, cautioned Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton. Its best hope? "That after two or three years of premium increases, business and government will say, 'This doesn't work,' and that will wake us up."
 
After the Revolution
This is the final article in a series that looked at changes in the nation's health care system. The other articles described the effects of the changes on doctors and the problems of the uninsured.

Committee Chairman Says Inquiry Won't Drag
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee pledged to try to complete the investigation of President Clinton by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Cardoso Seems to Be Re-elected in Brazil, Averting Runoff

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Brazilian voters gave President Fernando Henrique Cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round of balloting today, apparently maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
With 27 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Cardoso appeared to have won 51.3 percent of the vote, compared with 33.9 percent for his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential candidate of the leftist Workers Party. 
 If he still has a majority when returns are complete, Mr. Cardoso will be declared re-elected without facing a runoff.
Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia tonight called the vote a mandate for the economic measures that the President is under national and international pressure to carry out.
With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since Russia's economic collapse in late August, and with the stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Government has been close to paralyzed by the approach of the election.
It has been negotiating a bailout with the International Monetary Fund but has been unable to show progress on structural changes that would cut Government expenses over the long term.
The waiting is probably not over yet. Though a first round victory may strengthen Mr. Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead, Mr. da Silva appeared to win substantially more votes than the 24 percent predicted, signaling considerable opposition ahead.
Today's congressional and senatorial races did not appear to substantially alter the overall power balance between the President's governing coalition and the opposition. But with run-offs slated for Oct. 25 for several unresolved governorships, legislators will probably be too busy campaigning for their parties' candidates to support painful economic measures in the coming weeks.
Nevertheless, with policy makers at meetings of the Group of Seven industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund in Washington seeking permanent solutions to ward off the kind of volatility that is threatening Brazil, after devastating Asia and Russia, Mr. Cardoso is under considerable pressure to put Brazil's accounts in order. Each day, $300 million to $500 million in dollar reserves is leaving Brazil for safer countries.
But Gregg A. Smith, the chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities in New York, said the international financial markets were not necessarily expecting big changes from Brazil in the next few weeks.
"The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether there is an I.M.F. and World Bank package to support Brazil, and whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the budget deficit," he said. "If those two things look like they're moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial markets."
Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor at Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro and chief of population studies at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, said he did not expect that Mr. Cardoso could make progress on restructuring the Government before Oct. 25, because such measures would require legislative approval.
"What he can do is take measures on the administrative level to cut costs or to play with controls on currency," Mr. Alkimin said.
Today's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half of the country voting on small shoebox-sized computers that elderly voters had trouble mastering. Though electioneering was required to end before polls opened today, most candidates appeared to ignore the prohibition.
At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slum in South America with about 300,000 residents, palm-size photos of candidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air and carpeted the streets. People waited more than an hour to vote, with many supporting Mr. Cardoso.
Luiz Claudio Silveira, 34, a horse trainer who voted in Rocinha, said he planned to vote for Mr. Cardoso, largely because the President had ended inflation. "If you go to the supermarket, you can buy whatever you need now," Mr. Silveira said. "Four years is not enough to change a country as big as ours. I really believe in him."
Rute Vicente Oliveira, 48, a manicurist, also planned to vote for Mr. Cardoso. For most of her life, she said, her family lived in a lean-to, too poor to build a proper home. Her father dreamed of giving his family solid, sturdy shelter, Ms. Oliveira said, but he died before concrete blocks replaced the family's plywood slats. "Now the house is almost done," she said. "It's almost completely in order."
Many voters appeared to be unaware of the fiscal adjustments ahead, though the President announced less than two weeks before the election that Government belt-tightening measures would be inevitable. Of the 106 million Brazilians eligible to vote today, nearly 70 percent have less than an elementary school education, and 35 percent are barely literate.
Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said that he expected the economic adjustments to hurt him personally but that he was prepared to sacrifice to stabilize Brazil's economy. The President said he would cut Government costs, crack down on tax evaders and, if necessary, raise taxes to increase revenues.
"I'm thinking more about the situation of the country than of myself," Mr. da Silva said. "With a stable money, our situation will get better."

HEADLINE: Poughkeepsie, in a Long Tailspin, Now Copes With a Clouded Image

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Although they may laugh along when outsiders poke fun at their hometown, people here feel a deep affection for this neighborly, unpretentious Hudson River city, once home to companies as prosaically American as Smith Brothers cough drops.
That's why John Chickery, whose family has operated an office furniture store on the city's ragtag Main Street for 22 years, was annoyed on a trip in September to Las Vegas to hear a stranger say: "You made the big time. You've got a mass murderer." 
 News had evidently traveled across the continent that eight prostitutes who had vanished over the last two years were found in September inside a ramshackle house less than two blocks from this area's premier institution, Vassar College. And that discovery came little more than a month after a verdict wrapped up another national story that clouded Poughkeepsie's image: the racially loaded defamation trial stemming from accusations in 1988 by a black girl, Tawana Brawley, that she had been kidnapped and raped by a gang of white men, charges that a grand jury had found to be completely fictitious.
"First we're a racist town; now we're a town of mass murder," is the way Mr. Chickery's capsulized this city's frustration.
Still, people here are sensitive to the fact that the back-to-back episodes have exposed some of Poughkeepsie's less flattering sides, the effects of the tailspin that Poughkeepsie has been in since it began losing jobs and taxpaying residents in the 1950's. This once-storied place to raise a family -- the New York City Schools Chancellor, Rudy Crew, the son of an I.B.M. security guard, grew up here -- has grown accustomed to violent crime, drugs, prostitution and the kind of suspiciousness that sometimes manifests as racial friction.
Even the Mayor of this city of 29,000, Colette Lafuente, acknowledges that Poughkeepsie can be seen as a poster child for all the government and commercial schemes of the 1960's and 1970's that produced unintended and often damaging consequences.
Travel through the city was made easier by the building of crisscrossing highways, but the roads chopped the city into quarters and wounded some vibrant neighborhoods. The highways also made it easier for manufacturers to locate outside town, where land was cheaper. And they made it possible to shop in massive malls rising along Route 9, killing off thriving downtown department and apparel stores like Luckey Platt, Up to Date and M. Schwartz and Company.
With powerful patrons like United States Representative Hamilton Fish Jr., the city became one of the nation's largest per-capita recipients of Federal aid. But the aid was a mixed blessing. Swaths of charming 19th century houses and commercial buildings were leveled by urban renewal, replaced in some cases by ugly parking lots and bland public housing, according to a study by Harvey K. Flad, a Vassar professor of geography.
Meanwhile, the state was releasing thousands of patients from psychiatric hospitals, like the Hudson River Psychiatric Center here. Scores wound up homeless in downtown, where they scared off many remaining shoppers. The carving out of the suburban Spackenkill school district in the 1950's so that I.B.M. workers could have their own school system put an important dent in the city's base of middle class students, Mr. Flad said.
As a result of this cascade of policy debacles, Poughkeepsie has a threadbare statistical profile that is best crystallized by one fact: this city midway between Manhattan and Albany does not have a single supermarket.
The population here has declined by almost a third from a 1950 high of 41,023. Of those remaining, 3 of every 10 never graduated high school. The average family makes $34,706 a year and in all Poughkeepsie, only 111 families earn more than $150,000 annually. Unemployment is about 6 percent in a city that once had giant plants for printing, farm equipment and machine parts. Over the years, the city's jobless rate has hovered close to twice that of surrounding Dutchess County, said Dr. Ann E. Davis, an economics professor at Poughkeepsie's Marist College.
The final blow came in the early 1990's when I.B.M., which had practically turned Dutchess County into a company town, furloughed 7,700 workers in its three Hudson Valley plants, leaving 13,800 workers still employed. Now, Poughkeepsie's largest employer is the Dutchess County government.
Few people here blame Poughkeepsie for this year's unwelcome events. When Tawana Brawley told her story 10 years ago, she was living in Wappingers Falls, south of Poughkeepsie. Yet Stephen A. Pagones, the former prosecutor who accused Ms. Brawley and three of her advisers of defaming him, brought his suit at the Dutchess County Courthouse in the city's heart. And news conferences here by the Rev. Al Sharpton and Miss Brawley's two other advisers who were defendants in the case drew attention to regional race relations.
The eight slain prostitutes were found in a house just across the city border in a township that is also called Poughkeepsie. Yet, because most of the prostitutes worked a seedy stretch of the city's Main Street, the incident highlighted the city's attraction for poor urban and rural women looking for fast money or drugs. For those who distrusted the police force, the killings also raised questions about its diligence in investigating a crime with victims who lived on society's margins.
But even Patricia Barone, the mother of Gina Barone, one of the victims, does not blame the Poughkeepsie Police Department or the city's drug and prostitution problems for her daughter's death.
"It's unfortunate that Kendall Francois had to pick Poughkeepsie to live in," said Mrs. Barone, referring to the linebacker-sized suspect in whose house the victims were found. "Poughkeepsie is a lovely little city really trying to pull itself up," Mrs. Barone, a factory secretary, said. "You'll never find better views of the Hudson River. How can you blame the city when his own parents didn't know what was going on?"
Still, less boosterish residents feel Poughkeepsie has lost some of the amiability that gave it its chief edge over more throbbing cities. To Ceal Summer, 84, who moved here from New York City in 1939, "Poughkeepsie has always been a dead end to no place," with little cultural stimulation. But she appreciated the small-town culture of quilting bees and canning parties.
"All that's gone now," she said. "Everything has become so unfriendly, so unaware of neighborliness."
Poughkeepsie has never taken offense when outsiders ridiculed its small-town, inelegant name in the manner that W.C. Fields would take aim at California's Lompoc and Cucamonga. The city, whose name derives from a Wappinger Indian mouthful that means "reed-covered lodge by the little water place," was settled in 1687 by two Dutchmen attracted by the river harbor and a tributary, the Fallkill Creek, whose water power would drive mills for making grain and sawing wood.
By the late 19th century Poughkeepsie, with new railroad connections, was a bustling manufacturing city. Proud city fathers like Matthew Vassar, who made his fortune as a brewer here, enhanced the city with their generosity. Mr. Vassar founded a women's college intended to rival Harvard in 1861.
The prosperity lingered until mid-century, with employers like the Smith Brothers' plant, Schatz Federal Bearings, which made the ball bearings used in military gun turrets, and Western Printing and Lithography, which printed Golden Books for children. Marco Caviglia, the lawyer for Mr. Francois' parents, remembers shopping on Thursday nights and before Christmas along an animated, friendly Main Street, with sumptuous soda fountains and department stores that sold everything from refrigerators to lingerie.
"The city has radically changed since I was a kid," Mr. Caviglia said. "I know it sounds like I'm romanticizing, but did you see 'It's a Wonderful Life'? That was Poughkeepsie."
But the decline of American manufacturing transformed Poughkeepsie just as it transformed other river cities like Beacon, Newburgh, and Kingston. Many white working class people left the city, said Norman Fainstein, Vassar's dean of faculty and an urban sociologist. The long-rooted black community and the newer black migrants from the South generally stayed put. Today almost a third of the city's residents are black with a small but growing number of Mexican immigrants.
Though some Poughkeepsians believe the small scale of the city makes for cordial contacts across racial lines, Barbara Jeter Jackson, one of two blacks on the eight-member legislative Common Council, is disturbed that there are so few black workers on the city's work force.
Poughkeepsie today is practically a tale of three cities -- a ragged, partly industrial south side, a still genteel north side and a patchwork downtown that is graced with isolated jewels like the Roosevelt-era post office and the Bardovan Theater.
A visitor to a three-block pedestrian mall on Main Street can find an anachronistic gem like Mary H. Abdoo's bridal shop, where for 47 years customers from all over the Northeast have tried on wedding dresses amid rose plush drapery and wrought-iron seats. But the Main Street pedestrian mall, where traffic was blocked off in the misguided notion that it would make shopping more convenient, is now marked by empty storefronts.
Mayor Lafuente has made a revival of Poughkeepsie's largely abandoned waterfront, with parks, shops and restaurants, the centerpiece of her restoration plans. That will require a mix of government and private funds. She also wants to reopen the Main Street pedestrian mall to traffic. Giving a reporter a city tour, she pointed out dozens of tumbledown buildings slated for renovation, including a downtown row of 20 Queen Anne-style houses and nearby storefronts that will be restored, with government financing, by developer Mario Procida, who helped rejuvenate the South Bronx.
Mayor Lafuente, however, is aware of a painful Catch 22. Because of Poughkeepsie's social and economic problems, it does not have the tax base to spend very much on eliminating its social and economic problems.
Like Mayor Lafuente and other Poughkeepsians, Police Chief Ronald J. Knapp is somewhat defensive about the city's recent image problems. The discovery of the slain prostitutes, he said, came after his department reduced the number of murders from six in 1996 to one this year, with officers beginning to focus to such matters as rowdy college parties.
"In 1996, people were screaming about homicides and shootings," he said. "Now they're screaming about parking violations and college parties. Doesn't that say something?"

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 5 on the mood in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., after the Tawana Brawley trial and the arrest of a man charged with killing eight women, reversed geographic descriptions of the city. It is the north side that is ragged and partly industrial and the south side that is genteel, not the other way around.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Poland's Consumer-Credit Industry Grows Quickly

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: WROCLAW, Poland, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Given the mess Communism left in Eastern Europe, Lenin's motto might have been, "Buy now, pay later." Yet consumer credit hardly existed in the old Communist bloc, and so Mariusz Lukasiewicz faced virgin territory when he set out to introduce the idea to post-Communist Poland.
"The model of retail trade in Poland is changing," said Mr. Lukasiewicz, whose consumer-credit business, Lukas S.A., is Poland's largest. Indeed, by the end of this year, its lending volume should increase to 1.8 billion zlotys, or $500 million, from 1 billion zlotys last year. Growth has been so fast that Mr. Lukasiewicz recently started a retail bank to diversify into new products, like credit cards. He has struck deals with foreign retailers, like France's Auchan and Carrefour supermarket chains; he is testing loans made over the Internet, and he is considering expanding abroad, in Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
 His headquarters here in southwest Poland are bustling. The company more than tripled its work force in two years, to 1,300 employees, and in five years it has opened 104 branches across Poland.
Lukas is interesting because of the way a local company seized the initiative, despite rapidly mounting international competition, in a business that has been crucial in bolstering internal demand, which has in turn helped give Poland the highest growth rates in Eastern Europe. With 38 million people, Poland is the region's largest market outside the old Soviet Union, and tough competitors from Poland and abroad are breathing down Mr. Lukasiewicz's neck. He remains unfazed. "We have Poland's largest client base, with every fourth family on our list," he said in an interview. "We're winning."
Mr. Lukasiewicz, 38, started out in business in 1991, not long after the fall of Communism, when Poland's newly liberalized trade policies enabled him, with two friends, to import television sets and videocassette recorders from Singapore for a market hungry after decades of shortages. In 1993, he joined with Goldstar, the Korean electronics giant, to make and sell TV sets in Poland.
But the biggest brake on business was low Polish buying power, so to spur sales the company began offering installment plans, then dropped the television business to focus on consumer credit. The most recent product, car loans, is aimed at the growing used-car market. To finance growth, Lukas sold its stake in Goldstar; then, last year, it convinced the Polish-American Enterprise Fund, which invests in Poland's private sector, to take a stake worth $15 million.
And despite the turmoil on global financial markets, and fears of slowing economic growth, Polish demand for consumer credit remains vigorous. "Poles have personal debt equivalent to one month's wages; in the United States it's one year," said Dariusz Pronczuk, who follows Lukas for the Enterprise Fund. "So there is definitely huge growth potential."
Such prospects have not escaped the banking industry, in Poland and abroad. In recent months, foreign credit companies, including GE Capital, Citibank, and the Dutch bank ABN-Amro, have entered the consumer-credit business. Big auto makers, like the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and Fiat S.p.A., offer loans. Now, 65 percent of the cars sold in Poland are bought on credit, as are 38 percent of home appliances and a similar percentage of entertainment products like televisions.
Fueling the business is the emergence of a fledgling Polish middle class -- salaried employees with earnings of $400 to $420 a month, said Tomasz Kazmierowski, the marketing director at Citibank Poland, which is the leading credit card distributor and plans a full range of consumer products.
Yet, in part, the success of Mr. Lukasiewicz is built on his skill in attracting a broader client circle. More than 80 percent of his clients, for instance, earn less than $265 a month. While competitors prefer young, upwardly mobile customers between 25 and 40, almost 60 percent of Lukas clients are 40 to 60. Yet its failure rate remains below the industry average, thanks to careful screening.
But the road ahead will be increasingly steep. High Polish interest rates, which translate into consumer loan rates of 24 percent, are designed at least in part to keep imports down, but they hamper lending; real wage growth, while still vigorous, is slowing. Moreover, the financial crises in Russia, Asia and Latin America, reports of which fill Polish newspapers, could dampen consumer confidence.

HEADLINE: How Green Can Germany Get?

BYLINE: By Gregg Easterbrook; Gregg Easterbrook is a senior editor at The New Republic and author of the forthcoming "Beside Still Waters."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Imagine it is January 2001, and President-elect Al Gore is about to be sworn in along with his running mate: an antitechnology crusader from Earth First! Such a pairing is roughly analogous to what the next German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, is expected to make in aligning his Social Democrats with the country's Greens.
Of course, a Gore-Earth First! administration might unravel from day one, as the new Vice President boycotts the inauguration because trees were felled to build the reviewing stand. Likewise, Mr. Schroder could well see his partners cause a theatrical crack-up of the "Red-Green" coalition's ability to govern. 
 Mainstream American environmentalism has become button-down, incremental in approach, and is open to market-based solutions. The Greens, by contrast, remain psychologically rooted in the 60's dream of instantaneous social transformation.
In the past they have pushed for total bans on logging, land development and the use of chemicals. Today they advocate shutting down civilian nuclear power, raising taxes on gasoline so that it would cost $12 a gallon, and starting a goofy antitourism policy under which each person would be allowed to take an airline trip for personal reasons only once every five years.
Environmentalism would have become a force in German politics even if the Greens didn't exist: all major German candidates of the last quarter-century have advocated ecological protection, in part because nature has a mythic standing in Teutonic culture. As a party, the Greens had their origin not so much in ecological awareness but in opposition to the placement of Pershing II missiles by NATO, an issue that convulsed German politics in the early 1980's. By 1987, the Greens had gone from a standing start to controlling about 8 percent of the Bundestag and were taking hard-left stands on a range of social issues.
Then everything unraveled. Public skepticism of the Greens' Marxist tilt was inflamed in the late 80's when an East German agent was exposed in the party hierarchy. Then the Greens came out against German reunification, declaring ozone-layer protection a higher priority. It is hard to imagine a worse reading of public sentiment. In the 1990 elections, the entire Green delegation was tossed out of the Bundestag. Commentators pronounced the party a woolly mammoth.
But the Greens did not fall extinct. Rather, they split into two factions: the "realos," pragmatists who accept compromise with consumer culture and constituent politics, and the "fundis" or fundamentalists, who insist on banning nearly all products and commerce. The leader of the realos, Joschka Fischer, has pushed his group to present a responsible face and demonstrate as much concern for public opinion as for dogma.
If there is a Red-Green coalition, Mr. Fischer may become foreign minister. As recently as 1995, when the Greens were calling for the disbanding of the German army and of NATO, the notion of a Green foreign minister in Bonn, scanning the classified traffic and chatting on the phone with Pentagon officials, would have seemed hallucinogenic.
If seated at the table of power, will the Greens cleave mainly to the realo or fundi aspect of their split personality? Here another analogy to Al Gore may be useful. The Vice President's environmental rhetoric occasionally employs off-the-charts doomsday exaggeration, but as a national leader, Mr. Gore has taken actions that have been temperate and sensible. The Greens may undergo similar moderation.
Party officials will realize, for example, that shutting down Germany's nuclear plants, an action they call vital, would render impossible a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, which the Greens also call vital. Party leaders will also have to confront the fact that, however desirable energy efficiency may be, tripling gas prices would harm the working classes far more than the wealthy.
And the Greens will have to rethink their campaign against resource consumption. The rising gap between rich and poor is a powerful problem in all Western economies. By contrast, automobile pollution, shopping malls and airplane noise are mere technical issues, amenable to regulatory and technical solutions.
The Greens will serve Germany well if they work to make their nation more just. They'll be wasting their breath, and quickly be out on the street again, if they crusade against vacations.

HEADLINE: Latin Americans Say Russian Bailout Leaves Too Little for Them

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Increasingly angry at what they consider the lenient treatment that Russia received in its $4.5 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund, Latin American officials and economists warned today that the programs being offered to protect their own countries were too paltry.
Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's central bank governor and former Finance Minister, said that faced with the mounting financial pressures on Latin America and the rest of the developing world, the $90 billion the United States wants to give the monetary fund in extra lending money would be adequate "if things go well, but not enough for a bad scenario." 
 By some calculations, he said, the developing world might need $200 billion in new loans by 1999.
Mr. Ortiz's warnings came at a seminar here during this year's annual meeting of the World Bank and the I.M.F. When Russia defaulted in August on its huge foreign debts and the United States and other major powers allowed it to happen, he said, South America's ability to withstand the global financial crisis was seriously undermined.
"Until then we were doing fine," he said. "But everything changed after Russia."
What clearly angered Mr. Ortiz and other officials at the seminar was the strong political and financial backing that the United States and other major powers gave Russia right up to the moment it defaulted.
"Russia was treated like a member of the Group of Seven," Mr. Ortiz said, referring to the world's most powerful nations, at whose behest the monetary fund lent Russia $17 billion. "It was unthinkable it could fail," he said.
He added that while Mexico could survive "a period of market instability, it must be temporary or the situation will be out of contol."
Mr. Ortiz said Russia's default made international investors wary of all emerging market countries, including those in Latin America.
Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat of Chile said: "It's the packaging effect. Analysts don't differentiate between regions, countries or sectors anymore."
Alluding to the Mexican peso's collapse in 1995 and the financial turmoil that it provoked, E. Gerald Corrigan of Goldman, Sachs, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said: "Latin America is being buffeted by external shocks this time. It is not the source of the shocks."
All of the officials speaking at the seminar promised that their countries would continue the market-oriented economic programs they have introduced in recent years, selling off state-owned companies and encouraging private business.
But they also insisted that the United States, other important countries and institutions like the World Bank and the I.M.F. must be ready to help.
Finance Minister Pedro Malan of Brazil, who was greeted with cheers when he announced the apparent re-election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, pledged that his Government would impose painful new austerity measures to reduce its budget deficit. "We interpret the election as a mandate to do what we said we would do," he added.
He recalled that early in September, the finance ministers and central bank governors of nine Latin American countries had met with World Bank and monetary fund officials in Washington and vowed "to deepen our reform efforts."
In Brazil, consequently, there will be no changes in the Government's exchange rate policy and no resort to controls on outflows of money, he said, even though the country has seen about $30 billion of its reserves drain away since July.
But he said nothing about the big financial aid package he is rumored to be negotiating with Washington, the World Bank and the monetary fund, which some officials say could total as much as $60 billion. He did evoke the possibility of a breakdown in Brazil's economy -- which is Latin America's largest, bigger than those of South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand combined -- by saying the world now had "a historic opportunity to show how by acting together we could have a successful experience at crisis prevention."
So far, Latin American economies have weathered the international crisis relatively well. The I.M.F. expects them to grow at a rate of 2.8 percent this year and 2.7 percent next year. But international confidence in the region's currencies is vulnerable to the balance-of-payments deficits that all major Latin American countries now have.

HEADLINE: New Leader for a New Germany

 BODY:
Although only a week has gone by since Germany's voters ended Helmut Kohl's 16-year tenure as Germany's leader, some things are already apparent. The voting reflected Germany's metamorphosis into a more self-confident, tolerant and liberal state. The government of the next Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, will have a new tone, one fitting a country that seems increasingly comfortable with the new political and cultural diversity brought by unification and immigration.
Mr. Schroder, 54, and the leaders of the Green Party, his likely coalition partner, bring the first truly postwar generation into the German leadership. He came of age when Germany was already an economic wonder, no longer dependent on American care packages. His generation is also more distant from the shame of the Nazi past, freer to focus on the future. 
 The Social Democratic victory also reflects a geographic shift, away from Mr. Kohl's base in the conservative Rhineland surrounding Bonn to the new Eastern states. Fittingly, the new government will leave Bonn next year and re-establish the capital in Berlin.
The election showed that the great majority of Germans accept that theirs is not a homogeneous nation. Anti-foreigner, right-wing parties did extremely poorly, and the Schroder government promises to display more good will toward foreign residents than did Mr. Kohl, who was slow to condemn racist violence. This may be one of the few clear policy shifts under Mr. Schroder, who has promised to ease access to citizenship for foreigners. Citizenship is now granted to those with German blood and is very difficult for non-ethnic Germans, even those born in Germany, to obtain.
Mr. Schroder's campaign left many skeptical that he could reduce Germany's 10 percent unemployment rate. He had promised to restore the few cuts Mr. Kohl made in workers' generous benefits, and his finance minister is likely to be his party's leader, Oskar Lafontaine, who is close to Germany's unions. But there are signs that Mr. Schroder may induce the unions to moderate their demands. He has also announced a huge job-training program.
Mr. Schroder's foreign-policy team is expected to include leaders of the Greens, a party that once called for the abolition of Germany's army. But the Greens, known for their pacifist and environmental stands, have moderated. Joschka Fischer, the Green leader mentioned for foreign minister, is a respected pragmatist who recently blocked the party from calling for Germany to leave NATO.
While both Mr. Schroder and Mr. Fischer are pro-American, they are likely to be less deferential to Washington and closer to Britain and France than was the older Mr. Kohl. Mr. Schroder visited France three days after his election. Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Schroder is not suspected of dreaming about the euro at night. But he has emphasized that he will continue Mr. Kohl's policies of European integration.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Agree to Clarify the Law on Leniency for Refugees Seeking Asylum

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Adding an immigration case and five other new cases to the term that opened today, the Supreme Court agreed to clarify the law on leniency for refugees who seek to remain in the United States despite having committed crimes in their home countries.
The Justices accepted the Clinton Administration's appeal of a ruling in favor of a Guatemalan who, as a student leader in Guatemala, had burned 10 buses and vandalized stores while demonstrating against the government. He had entered the United States illegally in 1993 and, when faced with deportation the next year, requested asylum and the "withholding of deportation," a form of administrative relief granted by immigration officials in the name of the Attorney General. 
 Although an immigration judge granted his request, finding that he had established a "well-founded fear" of political reprisal in Guatemala, the Immigration and Naturalization Service appealed. The service argued that the man, Juan Anibal Aguirre-Aguirre, was ineligible for leniency, citing a provision of the immigration law that denies relief to an alien who has "committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United States."
An immigration appeals board agreed with the agency, but its ruling was overturned last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. That court ruled that the Board of Immigration Appeals should not have simply applied the law automatically, but should have weighed a number of factors, including the seriousness of the offenses when balanced against the seriousness of the reprisals Mr. Aguirre faced, and the nature of the crime in proportion to the political situation and objectives.
In its Supreme Court appeal, Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Aguirre-Aguirre, No. 97-1754, the Administration essentially takes the view that decisions of immigration officials on whether to proceed with deportation or grant administrative relief is not subject to second-guessing by the courts. The Court of Appeals "failed to give due deference" to the Board of Immigration Appeals and "improperly substituted its judgment" for that of the board, the Administration told the Justices.
The Court's reaction to these arguments could indicate how the Justices will respond to other immigration cases now making their way through the courts in the wake of Congress's sharp curtailment two years ago of aliens' ability to challenge adverse administrative decisions. Several Federal appeals courts have ruled in the past few months that immigration decisions cannot be completely insulated from judicial review and that, at least in certain circumstances, aliens must be given access to Federal courts.
Most recently, in a major ruling late last month, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, rejected the Administration's view and ruled that Congress lacked authority to deprive Federal courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions from immigrants who are in custody and who are challenging deportation orders.
The six new cases the Justices accepted today brought to 51 the number now available for decision during the new term. The Court denied review today in some 1,700 cases that had accumulated since the last term ended in June.
One unusual feature today was the extent to which the Justices undertook to reformulate the legal questions posed by the cases they agreed to take on. Typically, the Court simply announces that review has been granted, presumably on the terms presented by the lawyer who brings the case. In the immigration case today, for example, the Court simply said "granted." But in the five other cases, the Justices actually rewrote the questions, sharpening the focus and limiting their review to those questions that were logically interrelated. In one case, in which the lawyer offered a full page of what he described to the Court as "a cascading series of sub-issues," the Justices boiled the matter down to two questions and six lines of type.
Although it is too early in the term to tell whether the Justices are taking a new and more aggressive approach to managing their docket, the action today may reflect their frustration with cases in recent terms in which the underlying issue was important but the presentation was too unfocused to let the Court make much headway.
Here are some of the highlights of the opening day.
 
Disability Policy
The Court agreed to resolve a dispute among the lower Federal courts over the relationship between the Americans With Disabilities Act and receipt of Social Security disability benefits.
The disabilities act, a 1990 Federal law, prohibits employers from discriminating against "a qualified individual with a disability," meaning someone who is able to work, although perhaps with reasonable accommodations to the disability. The question in this case, Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems, No. 97-1008, is whether receipt of disability benefits under Social Security creates a presumption that the employee is not able to work and is therefore not covered by the disabilities act.
The extent of disability necessary to qualify for Social Security benefits is considerable: a person must be unable "to engage in any substantial gainful activity" in the economy. Some Federal courts have ruled that a person who qualifies as disabled for Social Security purposes is, by virtue of that fact, outside the disabilities act's protection.
In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, established a presumption to that effect, and dismissed a disabilities act suit brought against an employer by a woman who had collected Social Security benefits following a stroke. The woman argued that her subsequent dismissal from her job violated the disabilities act.
 
Reporters' Access
Without comment, the Court turned down an appeal from a coalition of news organizations, including The New York Times, challenging denial of public access this year to court hearings and legal motions connected to the Whitewater independent counsel's investigation into the Lewinsky matter and to assertions of privileges raised by grand jury witnesses. Hearings on claims of executive privilege and lawyer-client privilege by White House officials were not announced in advance and took place behind closed doors.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on May 5 that the First Amendment did not provide a right of access to proceedings that were "ancillary" to a grand jury investigation. In their appeal, Dow Jones v. Clinton, No. 97-1959, the news organizations said the ruling "effectively bars the public from meaningful and timely access to information of overwhelming public interest."
 
Drug Testing
Also without comment, the Court refused to hear a challenge to an Indiana school district's drug testing policy, under which any student who wants to participate in any extracurricular activity must agree to be subject to random testing for alcohol, illegal drugs and cigarettes.
The policy, upheld earlier this year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, goes considerably beyond a student drug-testing policy the Supreme Court upheld three years ago in an Oregon case that applied only to student athletes. In that case, the Court found that an existing drug problem and the role of athletes as student leaders justified the policy.
In Rush County, Ind., a rural area with no evidence of a drug problem, the policy applies to members of the French club, the Future Homemakers of America, the library club and many others.
The Indiana Civil Liberties Union challenged the policy on behalf of a student who had volunteered to videotape football games but was barred from doing so because he refused to submit to random drug testing.
The case was Todd v. Rush County Schools, No. 97-2021.
 
Lawyer Search
The Court agreed to decide whether two Los Angeles prosecutors violated a defense lawyer's due process rights by having him held and searched in a separate room of the courthouse while his client was required to testify before a grand jury. The prosecutors are appealing a ruling by the Ninth Circuit that in its timing and motivation -- to prevent the lawyer from consulting with his client -- the search amounted to an unreasonable interference with the right of the lawyer, Paul L. Gabbert, to practice his profession.
Mr. Gabbert was representing Traci Baker, a defense witness in the trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez for murdering their parents. The prosecutors had obtained a warrant to search Mr. Gabbert to see if he was carrying a letter to Ms. Baker from Lyle Menendez, her former boyfriend. No letter was discovered. The case is Conn v. Gabbert, No. 97-1802.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Tilting but Standing As a Big Domino Falls;
Ex-Communist Poland Holds Up Well Next to Russia's Staggering Economy

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Scott R. Mackie doesn't envy his old boss.
Before he took over recently as head of General Motors Poland, Mr. Mackie worked at G.M.'s big German unit, Opel, under David J. Herman. In June, G.M. dispatched Mr. Herman to Moscow, where he is now puzzling out a strategy in the wake of Russia's troubled collision with capitalism. 
 Mr. Mackie, 37, has no such headaches. In August, right on schedule, a new $535 million General Motors factory in southern Poland came on line, and work is proceeding on a $300 million upgrading of a plant in Warsaw. To supply parts, G.M.'s Delphi subsidiary has built or acquired six plants in Poland. A finance company set up last year feverishly plies Poles with credit to pay for the cars the plants churn out.
Poland, in short, is not Russia. For some time now, Eastern European nations have been uncoupling themselves from their giant neighbor to the east and refocusing westward. And the breathtaking collapse of the Russian economy, which left Eastern Europe standing, served to banish all doubts that this trend is genuine.
"Today, Central and Eastern Europe's trade ties to Western Europe are far stronger than those to Russia," said Albrecht Schmidt, chairman of Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank of Germany. "They have completely reoriented their economies to the West."
True, stock markets in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest have taken a whipping because of the Russian debacle. Credit is harder to come by now. But by and large the region sidestepped Russian-style woes, with Poland providing perhaps the most vivid example of the power to survive -- and even thrive.
Not that all the pieces are in place. Mr. Mackie's Polish headquarters, in a corporate park erected hastily south of Warsaw after the fall of Communism nearly a decade ago, exudes impermanence. But he stresses that G.M. is in Poland for the long haul. "Our ambition is to get not just a toe in the door, but a significant stake in the market," he said recently. "We don't build plants with a 5-year horizon, but with a 30- to 40-year horizon."
And that horizon clearly is to the west. The formation of a new Government in Germany is now scrutinized more closely here than the assembling of a Cabinet in Moscow.
"They are all battered a little, and obviously they will face difficult access to international capital markets for some time," said Hans Peter Lankes, director of transition strategy at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. "Yet you can see markets discriminating already."
Polish companies have deftly exploited the opportunities that came with the collapse in 1989 of the old trading regime, Comecon, quickly establishing ties with Western Europe. The Government took steps, at times haltingly and with mixed results, to overhaul creaking financial and industrial systems. And since Poland, unlike Russia, did not have vast sums lavished on it by the International Monetary Fund, it had to scramble for private cash, but the foreign money came.
Partly, Poland made a virtue of necessity. Without Russia's natural resources like gold, oil and gas, Polish executives were largely unable to create the types of leveraged fortunes that have collapsed in Russia, accelerating the failure of that economy, experts say. In addition, Government regulatory scrutiny of a kind unknown in Russia helped avoid excesses.
"Poland got off to a very good start" by not succumbing to the fatal combination of bloated finances and real economic desolation that toppled Russia, said Jadwiga Staniszkis, a leading Polish sociologist. "The temptations were similar, and the connections were there," she said, "but the degree to which it happened was far less."
As the largest Eastern European market, with 38 million people, and the region's principal motor of economic growth, Poland has many eyes on it, and it is not home free yet. With roughly 70 percent of its trade now conducted with Western Europe, a slowdown there would have ripple effects farther east. Fragile Polish industries now compete with hardened industrial old-timers from Europe, Japan and the United States, and the Poles must often use weapons still blunt from decades of mismanagement.
Still, Poland, though besieged, continues to command international attention. The Government is preparing big chunks of the nationalized economy, like the national telephone company and several large banks, to go public. The results will provide a gauge of global interest in investing here. Hugely unprofitable industries like coal and steel, with immense debts that are a drag on growth, are set for reorganization. Next year, the pension system will get an overhaul to avoid bankruptcy.
While hedge funds and short-term speculators liquidated holdings in this summer's crisis, many investors, like General Motors, are committed for the duration.
After years of managing funds in New York and Tokyo, Alicja Malecka returned to her native Poland in 1991 to build a fund business for the Pioneer Group, the Boston-based asset managers. In 1994, Pioneer, which has $400 million of assets under management in Poland, and less in Hungary and the Czech Republic, plunged farther east, establishing asset management and brokerage businesses in Russia as well.
But Ms. Malecka's business epitomizes the region's contrasts. While she is bullish on Poland, she traveled recently to Moscow to sort out Pioneer's activities there. That operation, as she put it, was "extremely successful until six months ago," but is now "in a kind of survival mode."
Not that Poland is all wine and roses. When Warsaw's stock exchange took a hit in 1994, she said, two-thirds of Pioneer's business melted away; this summer, when the market plummeted again, Pioneer's business shrank 20 percent as investors turned skittish. "It's a very volatile market," Ms. Malecka said, seated in her office in a Communist-era tower that like Poland itself is undergoing a renewal. "About 85 percent of our customers are individual investors."
But change is coming. To rescue Poland's pay-as-you-go pension system, established under the Communist regime, a new law takes effect in April that will require about 3.5 million Poles under the age of 30 to begin paying part of their earnings into private pension funds, and Pioneer expects to be among the dozen or so fund groups licensed for this business. Ms. Malecka is talking to about 400 companies, including big nationalized industries, about forming corporate pension plans to supplement the Government's social security payments.
"Five years down the road, most of our assets will come from pension funds," she said.
Mr. Mackie has seen similar changes help his business.
Three years ago, he said, G.M.'s forecasters were predicting a market in Poland of about 400,000 automobiles by 2004. Yet they had not reckoned with changes in Polish laws enabling car makers to open consumer finance companies. Now, the market leader, Fiat, does 60 percent of its Polish sales through credit. By last year, total car sales had reached 477,000, and promise to be even higher this year. In fact, 280,000 cars were sold in the first six months, making Poland Europe's sixth-largest automobile market, after Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain.
Doing business in Poland may not be easy, Mr. Mackie said, but it gets done.
As do many Western executives, Mr. Mackie laments the Byzantine twists of Polish bureaucracy. In Gliwice, in southern Poland, site of G.M.'s new plant, workers can use only one of several factory cafeterias, he said, since local officials have yet to issue sanitation permits for the others; the general contractor, a Polish construction group called Mostostal, performed technical miracles, he said, but was poor at efficiently organizing hundreds of subcontractors. Still, construction was fully on schedule, and on Aug. 31, the first cars rolled off Gliwice's assembly lines.
Exactly when Poles' appetite for consumer goods like cars will be sated is hotly disputed. Consumer debt, despite offers like those by the auto companies, remains at less than 10 percent of disposable income, minuscule compared with levels in the United States and Western Europe. Yet growth in real wages is declining, to about 4 percent this year from 6 percent in 1997, and figures suggest that growth of the automobile market will slow to 7 percent this year, from more than 25 percent in 1997.
Thus, as attractive as Poland's domestic market may be, car makers like Mr. Mackie will use factories here to ship abroad, further cementing links with Western Europe. Though General Motors expects to sell about 45,000 cars a year in Poland, the assembly lines in Gliwice will churn out more than 150,000. All of Fiat's two smallest models sold in Western Europe come from factories in Poland. Polish auto workers earn 20 percent of the salaries of their Western European counterparts, and cars made in Poland enter Western Europe duty free, thanks to agreements to ease Poland into the European Union by early in the next century.
To be sure, Poland is not isolating itself economically from the east, where millions of consumers in the former Soviet Union offer a potentially huge and hungry market. Radoslaw Sikorski, the Deputy Foreign Minister, pointed out how Poland had in recent months abolished visa requirements for Ukrainians and reduced visa fees for Russians, to $15 from $60, in part to stimulate barter-based cross-border trade that aids businesses in eastern Poland that supply consumer goods, like food, to Ukraine and Russia. As Russia heads toward a catastrophic harvest this year, he said, "we think most of that will remain."
But Poland's trade with Russia accounts for only about 7 percent of the total, he said, adding, "We are closer to Brussels than to Moscow, and not only geographically."
As economic reorganization produces increasingly close ties to Western Europe, it is there, economists say, that Poland's economic fortunes will eventually be decided.
"As long as there are clear signals that accession to the European Union is on track," said Mr. Lankes of the Reconstruction Bank, "then Central European countries are going to be decoupled from emerging-market risks."
Now, he said, the biggest question facing countries like Poland is "what will happen to Western European economies, and there is increasing uncertainty about that."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Bond Prices Surge as Investors Push Yields to 31-Year Low

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Another big loss in stocks and fears of a further deterioration in nearly all types of financial assets drove investors worldwide into the relative safety of Treasury securities yesterday for the fifth consecutive day. Bond prices surged for the biggest one-day gain in more than a year, pushing yields to another in a series of 31-year lows.
By the close of trading, yields on the Treasury's 30-year bond had plummeted to 4.72 percent, from 4.84 percent Friday, the lowest for long-term Government debt since April 1967. Prices rose 2 2/32 point, or more than $20 per $1,000 in face amount, the biggest gain since Sept. 16, 1997. 
 "We are seeing a continued flight to quality," David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said. "I don't know where the end of this process lies."
Further deterioration in world stock markets yesterday only reinforced the demand for Treasury securities. Although the Dow Jones industrial average recovered from steep losses to end only 58.45 points lower, at 7,726.24, the Nasdaq stock market tumbled 78.29 points, or 4.85 percent, to 1,536.69. Most stock markets overseas also slumped.
Analysts said there was disappointment that finance ministers and central bankers attending the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund had apparently failed to agree on a plan to shore up the faltering international economy.
"Many went into the weekend thinking a credit package for Brazil would be in the works and announced just after the elections, which were held on Sunday," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president and chief money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Inc.
Mr. Sullivan said the recent steep slides in interest rates "are divorced from underlying economic and credit market fundamentals" in the United States. Instead, he said, "they are based upon a whole different attribute: a heightened preference for quality, safety and liquidity."
The severity of the challenge facing policy makers and market participants alike was underscored yesterday by William McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Answering questions at a meeting of the Institute of International Bankers in Washington, Mr. McDonough said the current crisis was the most serious since World War II, adding that the declines in world markets and economies could "get worse because there is a significant possibility of a credit crunch."
"But the people in this room have the capacity to make sure this doesn't happen," Mr. McDonough said. "It makes sense to control the risk aversion of 'let's batten down the hatches and protect our institution.' If every institution does that, I can assure you we will have a very large credit crunch."
The collapse in the price of riskier fixed-income assets relative to Treasury securities claimed another victim yesterday, as Criimi Mae Inc., a real estate investment trust with a big portfolio of commercial mortgage securities, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following big losses on its investments.
"As all of these markets have blown up, the value of Criimi Mae's assets plummeted," said Jim Callahan, executive director of the Pentalpha Group, an investment advisory firm based in Greenwich, Conn.
Still, Mr. Callahan said: "a lot of people are breathing a sigh of relief at what Criimi has done. Filing for reorganization is a better outcome than a fire sale liquidation, like Long-Term Capital."
Traders said Long-Term Capital Management, the formerly high-flying hedge fund that was salvaged from near-collapse late last month by a consortium of investment banking firms, was in the market yesterday selling mortgage-backed securities and older Treasury securities, and buying freshly issued Government notes and bonds.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was not the only maturity that registered big price gains yesterday.
Near the close of trading in New York, the 4.5 percent two-year notes were quoted at a price of 100 29/32 , up one-quarter of a point, to yield 4.02 percent. The price of the 5.25 percent five-year notes rose by 17/32 , to 105 5/8, to yield 3.96 percent. And the 5 5/8 percent 10-year notes rose a full point in price, to 111 17/32 , to yield 4.16 percent.
At one point during the day, yields on the Government's two-year, three-year and five-year notes were all trading below 4 percent, Mr. Sullivan from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.950	97.884	Discounted Rate	4.15%	4.18%	Coupon Yield	4.25%	4.33%	High Price	98.954	97.892	Discounted Rate	4.14%	4.17%	Coupon Yield	4.24%	4.31%	Low Price	98.948	97.877	Discounted Rate	4.16%	4.20%	Coupon Yield	4.24%	4.35%	Accepted at low price	78%	20%	Total applied for	$31,556,861	$23,136,353	Accepted	$10,928,661	$11,647,353	Noncompetitive	$1,311,666	$1,165,228

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Honors Legacy of Tom Bradley

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore arrived here today for the funeral of the former five-term Mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley, in a long motorcade, helicopters hovering overhead. Mr. Gore told the mourners that he had come to celebrate the life of a great American, "in many ways the Jackie Robinson of public service."
Leon Cheatham, who is 51 years old and unemployed, arrived on foot. Mr. Cheatham left his house at 7 A.M. today and walked more than two miles, but he could not get into the church. It was already packed with the high and mighty as well as the ordinary, who stood in line as early as 6 A.M. to attend the funeral, which started at 10 A.M. Mr. Cheatham and dozens of others had to listen to the service over loudspeakers from across the street. 
 "I don't have the money to spare to catch buses and stuff," Mr. Cheatham said. "So, I walked. I just had to come to pay my respects. Mayor Bradley didn't have no color barrier or nothing. He just loved people and brought them together."
For more than three hours today, Los Angeles said farewell to Mr. Bradley, who died last week at the age of 80 after spending much of his life breaking one color barrier after another in his adopted hometown.
He was the first black police lieutenant in Los Angeles, the first black member of the City Council and the first, and so far only, black Mayor of this sprawling and diverse city.
He was also the only Los Angeles Mayor to serve for 20 years.
"He was an impossible act to follow," said the current Mayor, Richard J. Riordan, who did follow Mr. Bradley into office when he decided not to run for a sixth term in 1993.
"He was a giant of a man," Mr. Riordan added, "physically, spiritually and mentally. He led Los Angeles with finesse, with grace and with class."
Speaker after speaker, inside the First A.M.E. Church and outside on the curb, described Mr. Bradley's long life as the American Dream come true. He was the grandson of slaves, Gov. Pete Wilson of California told the mourners. "Divine nature gave us Tom Bradley," Mr. Wilson said. "It was more our good fortune than Tom's that God put this man, this grandson of a slave, on a path to this great city that he would one day lead."
Mr. Bradley was the son of Texas sharecroppers, the Vice President said, "making history with his quiet dignity."
He was a role model, said the Los Angeles Police Chief, Bernard Parks, who is also black. "I can honestly say," Mr. Parks said, "there would not be a Chief Bernard Parks today if there had not been a Tom Bradley."
He was an ordinary man with the courage to dream impossible dreams and then make them come true, said Yvonne B. Burke, a Los Angeles County Supervisor.
He was a loyal man who cared about the poor, said Alice Harris, a longtime neighborhood advocate in the Watts section of Los Angeles.
"He didn't bring us fishes down there," she said. "He taught us how to fish and he didn't leave us if the fish didn't bite."
In life, Mr. Bradley was known as a coalition builder, a man with a golden gift: the ability to bring people together across color and class lines. In death, he was still doing so. Gathered in the church were Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco , the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the musician Stevie Wonder, Senator Barbara Boxer and George Deukmejian, the former Republican California Governor, who narrowly defeated Mr. Bradley in 1982 when he tried to become the state's first black governor.
On the hilly streets outside of the church, black, white, Asian and Hispanic mourners huddled in the shade as the voices from a 100-member choir singing "Grace of God" poured out of a loudspeaker.
Marie Arvealo and her daughter, Connie, each stood with a copy of the L.A. Watts Times newspaper over their hearts. On the front page was a photograph of Mr. Bradley. "I remember him with love," Mrs. Arvealo said.
Across the street, Kate Wilkerson, 75, sat in the sun on one of the white folding chairs set up outside by the church for the overflow crowd. She came to the service today by bus. "I didn't leave home meaning to come here," she said. "I was planning on paying some bills, but I just got drawn here. As far as I'm concerned, he was the best Mayor we ever had. My bills may not get paid today."
Melvin Hill, 34, was just a boy when Mr. Bradley was first elected Mayor in 1973. To pay his respects and to make a few dollars, Mr. Hill and his friends made up some T-shirts with a series of photographs, depicting stages of Mr. Bradley's life, from his days as a track star at the University of California at Los Angeles to his time on the police force to his years as Mayor.
"A lot of older black people are buying the shirt," Mr. Hill said. "They can relate best to his struggle from sharecropper to Mayor of L.A. But if you think about it, what he did was incredible."
The front of the shirt says, "Mr. Mayor, thanks for the memories."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Exiting Medicare is not a sure solution for H.M.O. woes.

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim 

 BODY:
THE managed care companies that unloaded 250,000 elderly Medicare customers last week will have healthier financial statements to show for it, starting in the first half of 1999. But many Wall Street analysts said that dropping Medicare units in dozens of unprofitable markets would not be enough to pull the health maintenance organizations out of a three-year earnings slump.
Health care costs are rising, and the H.M.O.'s cannot be sure that big employers will fully accept the large premium increases for next year that the companies need to turn around their earnings. 
 Many of the biggest H.M.O.'s announced that they would close their units in areas where the Government payments were too low to cover rising costs, including suburbs north of New York City, the Washington area and rural Northern California. Some H.M.O.'s are also leaving places where they had a relatively small presence; the United Healthcare Corporation, for example, is closing its Medicare unit in Dallas.
But Roberta Walter, a health care analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that those H.M.O.'s that kept a big Medicare operation would continue to suffer, even though earnings were rising on nongovernment business. "It is conceivable that improvement on the commercial side could be offset by deterioration on the Medicare side," she said.
The remaining Medicare units will not lose money, she said, but they will not grow robustly. And if the H.M.O.'s raise rates and reduce benefits, they will not sign up thousands of new members as they did in past years, when Government payments were rising 6 percent to 10 percent a year and the companies could offer generous benefits and still turn a handsome profit.
Congress has placed a 2-percent-a-year ceiling on increases in the rates the Government pays, and Federal officials have so far rebuffed requests to let the industry postpone compliance with new regulations and cut back some benefits offered to H.M.O. members.
H.M.O. executives are "livid" with anger, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. The Federal Health Care Financing Administration required them to set their benefit package for 1999 last May and then announced regulations in June that will add to the cost of doing business. The agency rejected a request last week from the industry to reopen the benefits issues. "It was a double cross," Mr. Abramowitz said.
Federal officials insist that they are promoting both Medicare H.M.O.'s and traditional fee-for-service H.M.O.'s. But Mr. Abramowitz said he thought that the Federal financing agency "regards H.M.O.'s as competitors; it's like asking the Post Office to set rates for Federal Express."
Medicare units cost United Healthcare $120 million in reduced earnings and cost Aetna Inc. $60 million, Mr. Abramowitz said. But he said there would be "money to be made next year," when the impact of the pullbacks in the Medicare units becomes clear. He predicted that United Healthcare, Aetna and the Cigna Corporation would be the first to attract investors, after the companies report their first- and second-quarter earnings.
Ms. Walter was more cautious. She recommends a handful of managed care companies, largely because they do not have a big stake in Medicare. Her picks include Wellpoint Health Networks, Cigna and Trigon Healthcare, a publicly traded Blue Cross plan based in Richmond.
In the New York region, even though Oxford Health Plans announced it was dropping 26,600, or 17 percent, of its Medicare members, Ms. Walter said she had kept a low rating, "neutral, neutral," on the stock. She said that Oxford's turnaround plan faced "a very tough industry environment, with costs rising," and was "predicated on a number of assumptions, most of which have to go right for the plan to work."
Edward Keaney, an analyst at Volpe, Brown Whelan & Company in San Francisco, said Pacificare Health Systems, which gets most of its revenues from Medicare, "would be a beneficiary of everybody else's pullback." Although Pacificare dropped 20,000 members of its Secure Horizons Medicare division in Northern California, it has been adept in most places at shifting financial risks to physician groups. The groups are typically paid a set fee for each Medicare member, and it is up to the doctors to keep costs within budget.
Mimi Willard, a health care analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said some buyers were attracted by the low prices of H.M.O. stocks, many of which are near historic lows. Also the companies do not have to worry immediately about problems in Asia and other foreign countries, and they are "perceived not to have exposure to potential problems in the economy," she said.
Some traders were encouraged when insiders, headed by Dr. Norman Payson, the chief executive, recently bought Oxford stock. But Ms. Willard agreed with analysts who said the intermediate picture was still uncertain, especially for Medicare H.M.O.'s.
"These are treacherous times for the H.M.O.'s," said Joyce Albers, who follows managed care companies at Deerfield Management, a health care investment fund. "This is certainly not an area for widows and orphans," she said.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Using Biting Humor to Attack Pataki's Record on State Finances

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:

Here are two 30-second advertisements for B. Thomas Golisano that went on the air on Monday.
 
PRODUCER -- Jay Advertising of Rochester
ON THE SCREEN -- In the first spot, four guys speaking in Brooklyn accents lounge on a brownstone stoop, one of them telling a story as the others express disbelief. In the second, a man in shadow, his back to the camera, talks with a bank loan officer, who ostentatiously wipes off his hand after shaking the other man's hand. 

THE SCRIPT -- In the first advertisement, one of the men on the stoop says: "So Georgie says to me, I'll pay you back Thursday. I say, 'Where you getting the money from to pay me back?' Georgie says, 'I'll borrow it from Jimmy.' I says, 'You owe Jimmy already.' Georgie says, 'I'll pay Jimmy with what I borrow from Tony.' I says, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you trying to pull on me, a Pataki?' "
Mr. Golisano: "This kind of thing happens every day in Albany with borrow-and-spend Pataki."
Announcer: "Let's hire an independent governor. Tom Golisano."
Four guys on the stoop, singing: "You say Pataki, I say Pataki, let's call the whole thing off."
In the second advertisement, the man in shadow says: "Hello. I'd like a $20 billion loan, please."
Banker: "Ho, ho. That's a pretty hefty number. And what's the loan for?"
Man in shadow: "So I can say I'm showing a surplus even though my business is billions of dollars in debt."
Banker, in an incredulous tone: "What's the name of this business you run?"
Man in shadow: "New York State."
Banker: "Oh. Nice to meet you, Mr. Pataki."
Mr. Golisano: "This kind of economics can't be explained away. You have to vote it away."
Announcer: "Let's hire an independent governor. Tom Golisano."
Banker: "I'm sure we can come to some arrangement."
ACCURACY -- The advertising campaign turns on Mr. Golisano's contention that Mr. Pataki has increased state debt by $20 billion in less than four years, and that only by borrowing has the Governor been able to both cut taxes and increase spending. The Governor's office has challenged the $20 billion figure, but its accuracy depends on what is counted, and either way, the truth is not flattering to Mr. Pataki. Debt supported directly by state taxes and fees has grown $8 billion, to $35 billion. Debt incurred by public authorities, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and repaid with user fees like subway tolls, has risen by about $20 billion, to more than $90 billion. There is considerable overlap between the two categories, but the total is well over $20 billion.
SCORECARD -- The message is the same as in Mr. Golisano's first round of advertising, but the style is vastly different, and much more effective. The new advertisements -- four in all, with eight more promised -- use humor and sarcasm where the earlier ones just featured the candidate, earnestly reciting facts and figures. The spots hit at Mr. Pataki's claim to be a fiscal conservative who has got the state's finances under control, but it is uncertain whether an attack on that record can succeed when state spending is up and there is a surplus. While the Golisano ads could soften the Governor's support, with just four weeks left in the race and Mr. Pataki far ahead in the polls, they are unlikely to affect the outcome. RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

HEADLINE: More Fallout From Long-Term Capital's Crash

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The near-collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management L.P. continued to reverberate yesterday as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. disclosed its exposure to hedge funds and emerging markets and Moody's Investors Service downgraded the rating outlooks of five of Europe's largest banks.
Lehman Brothers, which has been battered for weeks by unsubstantiated speculation of financial collapse, said that the most it could lose from exposure to hedge funds and emerging markets was $236 million, less than 5 percent of its equity capital. 
 Lehman said it had $72 million of loans with hedge funds not backed by collateral, including cash and Treasury and agency debt. It has $164 million of exposure, including derivatives, in emerging markets that is not covered by collateral.
Lehman expressed concern that speculation about its collapse came from investors interested in driving down the price of Lehman's shares or bonds, a person close to the situation said. Shares of Lehman fell $2.375 yesterday, to $26.625.
Lehman invested $100 million in the $3.5 billion acquisition of Long-Term Capital, based in Greenwich, Conn. Its exposure to the hedge fund is $32 million, backed by $41 million of Treasury securities.
Meanwhile, Moody's said yesterday that it had downgraded the rating outlooks of five European banks on concern that investments in hedge funds and emerging markets could hurt their ability to pay their debts.
Moody's reduced the outlook for the long-term deposit rating and the financial strength rating of Deutsche Bank A.G. and Dresdner Bank A.G. of Germany, Paribas S.A. of France and ING Groep N.V. of the Netherlands to negative from stable. It reduced the outlook of Barclays P.L.C. of Britain to stable from positive.
Paribas, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank were among the banks that agreed last month to take over Long-Term Capital. Dresdner has written off about 240 million marks, or $146 million, because of exposure to the fund. ING said last week it would dismiss 1,200 workers at its investment bank, the result of shrinking profits from emerging markets.

HEADLINE: As Incumbents, Republicans Hold Advantage in 18 Races for Governor

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 5

 BODY:
With elections next month in 36 states, including the 8 most populous, this year's campaigns for governor will determine whether the Republicans maintain their remarkable hegemony in the nation's statehouses or the Democrats rebound from their catastrophic losses of the last four years.
The outcome rests with more than a dozen fiercely competitive races, including those in California, where the lieutenant governor, Gray Davis, is trying to break the Republicans' 16-year hold on the state's top office, and here in Georgia, where Guy W. Millner, a businessman who lost two previous tries for statewide office, hopes to become the first Republican governor since 1868. 
 In a year when the economy remains fundamentally sound and polls show that most Americans approve of the country's direction, the Republicans begin with the advantage of running 18 incumbents, compared with 6 Democratic incumbents and one independent, Gov. Angus S. King Jr. of Maine.
And at the moment, polls show that Republican candidates hold leads, some seemingly insurmountable, in seven of the eight most populous states -- Texas, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. The exception is all-important California, where Attorney General Dan Lungren, the Republican nominee, is thought to be trailing Mr. Davis by a slim margin.
The status of those races has given Republican strategists confidence that they will at least maintain their current count of 32 seats and possibly pick up a few more.
"I think it's safe to say that Republican governors may rival the National Park Service after this election in terms of their sheer control of land mass," said Chris Henick, a political consultant and former executive director of the Republican Governors Association.
But Democrats are running unexpectedly strong races in states like Alabama, New Mexico and South Carolina, and if a few significant races break their way they could still reclaim a share of the turf that was ceded in 1994. "It was a disaster for Democratic governors four years ago, so clearly we'd like to pick up some seats," said Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, the immediate past chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. "The rebuilding process is long and difficult."
In the 1994 elections, the number of Republican governors soared to 30 from 19, the party's largest one-year gain since 1938. The Republicans lifted their tally to 32 in 1996, when they took control of governorships in Louisiana and Arkansas. Only once this century has the party exceeded its current count, and that was in 1921-22, when it had 34 governors.
The party has made similar gains in state legislatures and controls both houses in 18 states, an increase of 10 over 1994. Democrats have two-house majorities in 20 states, and each party controls one chamber in 11 legislatures. (Nebraska's legislature is unicameral and nonpartisan.)
In the last four years, with support from a devolutionary Congress, those Republican governors and lawmakers have left an unmistakable imprint on taxation, welfare, criminal justice and education. And if the Republicans hold or expand their trove of governorships, their dominance could become self-perpetuating after the next redistricting.
Each of the governors elected on Nov. 3 will have veto power over the drawing of district maps after the 2000 census, giving those governors influence for a decade over the partisan makeup of the United States House of Representatives and of their own legislatures. The outcome of this year's races for governor could also affect the organizing strength of the parties in the next Presidential campaign.
Some Democratic strategists said that their party was suffering because it did not build its second string when it dominated gubernatorial politics.
"The Republicans have done a much better job developing the so-called B-team," said Harold Ickes, an adviser to the Democratic Governors Association. "I think we got sort of fat and lazy."
The party must also contend this year with uncertainty over the turnout of its base voters, who could be demoralized over President Clinton's troubles. Studies show that turnout in non-Presidential election years typically drops anyway, a phenomenon that tends to favor Republicans because their core supporters vote more reliably.
Strategists in both parties said that most races for governor this year were being waged on local issues, with candidates parrying over tax cuts, education reform, managed care, gun control and juvenile justice. But some Republican operatives are convinced that the White House scandal is preventing Democrats from gaining traction.
"There's got to be a reason for it, and I think it's Clinton," said Clinton E. Key, executive director of the Republican Governors Association. "Not in a specific sense but just as a general malaise."
The ethical questions surrounding Mr. Clinton have clearly influenced strategy in California, Maryland, South Carolina and Georgia, where candidates have been prompted to emphasize character.
Here in Georgia, the Democratic nominee, State Representative Roy E. Barnes, has been televising an advertisement that attacks Mr. Millner on ethical questions, including being fined for failing to report contributions to a previous campaign. "This year more than ever, character counts," the advertisement concludes.
Mr. Millner has fired back with an advertisement that criticizes Mr. Barnes for, among other things, getting in a shoving match with a prosecutor while defending a client. "If character is the question, Roy Barnes isn't the answer," it says.
Robert S. Kahn, Mr. Barnes's campaign manager, said he probably would not have opened the war on character were it not for Mr. Clinton's travails. "It's certainly on everybody's mind," he said.
A poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week gave Mr. Millner a lead over Mr. Barnes of 47 percent to 41 percent.
Republican incumbents in the strongest position include Governors George W. Bush of Texas, George E. Pataki of New York, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and John M. Engler of Michigan.
In the contest for Florida's open seat, a recent poll showed Jeb Bush, a Republican who lost in 1994, with a 15 percentage point lead over Lieut. Gov. Buddy MacKay, the Democratic nominee. Mr. MacKay has had to contend with demoralizing defections from prominent black Democrats. And his campaign manager, Robin D. Rorapaugh, complained that her campaign could not break through the press's obsession with the White House sex scandal.
"It puts so much clutter in front of voters that it's hard for a local candidate to talk about local issues," Ms. Rorapaugh said.
Top Republican strategists, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say the Florida race is all but over, and leading Democrats acknowledge it is very uphill.
"Florida is, ugh, we have a major challenge," said Gov. Pedro J. Rossello of Puerto Rico, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. "It's doable but time is running out."
In Illinois, where Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, is retiring, the Republican nominee, Secretary of State George Ryan, has held a constant lead of 20 percentage points or more over his Democratic opponent, United States Representative Glenn Poshard, for more than a month. In Ohio, where Gov. George V. Voinovich, a Republican, is retiring to run for United States Senate, the Republican candidate, Secretary of State Bob Taft, has a lead of just under 10 percentage points in the most recent public polls over his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Lee Fisher. Democratic strategists maintain that the race is tightening.
Republicans are also heavily favored to maintain governorships in Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Wyoming. In Massachusetts, where the Democratic nominee, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, has struggled to maintain party discipline, a poll released last week showed Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci, a Republican, with a lead of 11 points. Democrats are expected to keep control in Alaska, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Vermont.
In addition to Mr. Bush in Florida, Republican candidates lead in several states where Democrats govern, including Hawaii, Nebraska and Nevada. Conversely, polls show that the Democratic candidate in Minnesota, Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, is ahead in his campaign to reclaim that state for his party.
But many major races remain neck-and-neck and are likely to stay that way until election day. In Maryland, for instance, polls show the incumbent Democrat, Parris N. Glendening, in a dead heat with Ellen R. Sauerbrey, the Republican legislator who lost the 1994 election for governor by a mere 6,000 votes.
In New Mexico, the former Albuquerque Mayor, Martin Chavez, a Democrat, is waging a spirited campaign to wrest control from the Republican incumbent, Gov. Gary E. Johnson, in a race that strategists expect to be close. The same is true in Alabama, although a poll taken late last week showed Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman, the Democratic nominee, with an expanding lead of 13 percentage points over Gov. Fob James Jr., a Republican who has become a national icon for school prayer advocates.
The most surprising Republican vulnerability is in South Carolina, where public polls show that the Jim Hodges, a Democrat, has cut the lead of Gov. David Beasley to 9 percentage points from 15 in the last month. Mr. Beasley is chairman of the Republican Governors Association, a job typically given to a governor who has few re-election worries.
Other close races can be found in Rhode Island, which features a rematch of the 1994 campaign between Gov. Lincoln Almond, a Republican, and Myrth York, his Democratic challenger, and in Colorado, where State Treasurer Bill Owens, a Republican, faces Lieut. Gov. Gail Schoettler.

HEADLINE: In First Debate, Kennelly Faults Rowland on Child Care

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 5

 BODY:
United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly used the opening debate of the Connecticut gubernatorial race to go after Gov. John G. Rowland with a stick rather than a sword today, setting a dignified tone for the closing month of a campaign in which polls show the Governor holding a huge lead.
Governor Rowland had to answer for some of the less rosy parts of his record, including what Mrs. Kennelly considers laxness in the enforcement of environmental and child-protection laws. But her criticism was limited mostly to asides as she described her plans to bolster public education and give new rights to patients insured by health maintenance organizations. He, too, seemed to be pulling punches, barely mentioning his differences with her eight-term record in Congress. 
 Mr. Rowland was so confident that during his standard nod of appreciation to the sponsors at the close of the hourlong debate, he even thanked Mrs. Kennelly for coming. He said he would focus in his next term on spreading prosperity to the downtowns of the state's largest cities but proposed no new plans. "I think Mrs. Kennelly sees Connecticut's glass as half-empty," he said. "I see Connecticut's glass as half-full."
"And if you look ahead, the question becomes, 'Why would you run again?' " he continued. He said that after talking to his wife, Patricia, "We decided that the real future of Connecticut is how we turn our cities around."
Speaking to an audience of 500 business leaders from prosperous Fairfield County, Mrs. Kennelly suggested that much of the Governor's political fortune stemmed from the economy rather than his policies. "The years leading to the new millennium are too crucial to waste by complacency or political posturing -- too crucial to spend patting yourself on the back about accomplishments that you didn't have much to do with," she said.
Castigating Mr. Rowland over his record of enforcing environmental laws, she said, "A scandal a month is not good enough for the state of Connecticut, especially since so many of your companies came here because of the quality of our life." Mrs. Kennelly accused the Governor of an election-year conversion on the regulation of health insurers, saying of a Connecticut law creating an appeals process against H.M.O.'s, "You signed it because it was veto-proof by the time it passed the Legislature, but I am glad that you did sign it."
Joseph D. Courtney, the Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor and Mrs. Kennelly's running mate, explained her strategy after today's debate, the first of four. "The voters are not going to respond positively to a hammer-and-tong attack," Mr. Courtney said. "The way we win this election is to draw the contrast between her message and the Governor's message."
The two candidates' contrasting styles were shown most sharply when they were asked whether the state's death penalty law should be rewritten to be tougher and more workable. Connecticut last executed someone three decades ago. The candidates both said "yes," but in very different ways.
Mrs. Kennelly, a Democrat, 62, said the law should be tougher and clearer, adding, "Once again, I think we have to get those lawyers in the room and make sure that we write a law that works." Mr. Rowland, a Republican, 41, drew laughter when he responded: "The last thing I want is lawyers in a room figuring this thing out. That's why we've got this mess. If anything, get the lawyers out of the room. Then we can get down to brass tacks."
Since Mrs. Kennelly represents the Hartford area in Congress, today's debate served as her introduction to many of the audience members and television viewers from the New York City suburbs. The debate was broadcast live over radio and cable television. The questioners were newspaper editors, and the sponsor was an association based in Stamford, the Business Council of Southwestern Connecticut.
The candidates differed most markedly on tax cuts. Mr. Rowland, who years ago abandoned his 1994 campaign promise to end the state income tax, was asked whether he planned to phase out the tax in a second term.
"There's always that possibility and that opportunity," he said, pausing for laughter from the crowd, which realized the idea was long dead. Mr. Rowland then acknowledged there was little appetite for it in the Legislature.
Mr. Rowland said taxes had been cut $1.7 billion during his term, including reductions or credits for the income, gas, property and inheritance taxes. "We plan to do it over the next four years as well," he said.
Mrs. Kennelly has proposed a 10 percent reduction in property taxes, which she would accomplish with a state rebate to the cities and towns that impose and collect the tax. "I would hope that the Governor would say today that he would forget that promise that he keeps making and never, never does it -- that he says get rid of the income tax," she said. Mr. Rowland denounced Mrs. Kennelly's proposal as "nothing more than a spending plan, a shell game."
The issue that has dogged Mr. Rowland most consistently concerns the killings of children who were being monitored by the state's Department of Children and Families. Mrs. Kennelly said: "It really is very tragic when a child has to be taken out of his birth home because of neglect and abuse. But it's more than tragic when a child under the care of the state has something happen to them." She said workers were inadequately trained and social workers' caseloads too large.
Mr. Rowland said he had increased spending, staffing and training for the department. "With all due respect, Mrs. Kennelly's facts are entirely wrong," he said.
In the afternoon's one reference to President Clinton's troubles, the candidates were asked to what extent a Governor was entitled to a private life. Mrs. Kennelly signaled for the first time that she planned to vote against impeachment, saying that the overwhelming response of constituents since the broadcasting of Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony had been: " 'Censor him. Punish him. But for heaven's sake, Barbara, don't vote for impeachment.' "
Mr. Rowland said people wanted Congress to act and move on. "Lets get it over with," he said. "Let's have finality. And, by the way, all people should have a private life, including politicians and including candidates."

HEADLINE: Schumer Says Clinton's Acts Were Wrong but Not Impeachable

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
In his first detailed remarks on the Lewinsky matter, Representative Charles E. Schumer said today that President Clinton's lies about his extramarital affair were wrong and possibly illegal but did not warrant impeachment. He called instead for some lesser form of punishment, perhaps censure or a rebuke.
Mr. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is running for the United States Senate, also questioned the impartiality of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, accusing him of having "seriously overreached" in his investigation and of presenting "flimsy evidence" in his voluminous report to Congress. 
 "It is time we move forward, and not have the Congress and the American people endure a specter of what could be a yearlong focus on a tawdry but not impeachable affair," said Mr. Schumer, offering one of the more ringing defenses of the Clinton Presidency among members of the House Judiciary Committee today.
As Mr. Schumer made his comments today, his campaign was preparing a major fund-raising event featuring the President in New York City next Monday, providing further evidence that even when wounded, Mr. Clinton remains a popular and potent political force in New York State. The full House is scheduled to vote on whether to begin an impeachment inquiry of the President on Friday.
Reading from a prepared statement to the committee, Mr. Schumer said important issues, including education and health care, had been pushed aside in the wake of the Lewinsky scandal.
"The world economy is in crisis and cries out for American leadership, without which worldwide turmoil is a grave possibility," Mr. Schumer said. "This investigation, now in its fifth year, has run its course. It's time to move on."
Mr. Schumer, who is known for having once theatrically waved an assault weapon at a Judiciary Committee hearing, but whose attendance this year has been severely truncated by the demands of his campaign, left soon after making his statement to meet with reporters, even as other committee members remained to listen to their colleagues' statements.
The President's problems have hung like a dark cloud over the New York Senate race all year, leaving strategists for both Mr. Schumer and the Republican incumbent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, unsure of what course to take. As a result, neither candidate has said much to defend or criticize the President until today. Mr. D'Amato has said he will not take a stand on whether the President should be impeached and removed from office until the issue goes to the Senate.
The President's problems most clearly posed a problem for Mr. Schumer, who has been a strong supporter of Mr. Clinton and whose evident desire to recruit the President's help in his campaign may have been hamstrung by his seat on the Judiciary Committee, which would oversee any impeachment process.
Mr. Schumer said today that his decision to oppose impeachment unequivocally had liberated him in a way. "I made up my mind yesterday and I slept like a baby last night," he said to reporters.
Mr. Schumer said he felt that the average person would receive no punishment for lying about an extramarital affair, even under oath. But because Presidents "should be held to a higher standard," he said Mr. Clinton should receive a "significant punishment" short of impeachment.
Asked by reporters today if there was not a conflict of interest in his sitting in judgment on a President who was giving him campaign assistance, Mr. Schumer emphatically said no. "I think New Yorkers are fair and they are going to judge what I said based on the merits," he said. "We'll have to let the chips fall where they may politically."
But Mr. Schumer's advisers clearly believe that the chips will fall in their favor. They contend that Mr. D'Amato will now feel pressure either to defend the President, which could anger Mr. D'Amato's conservative base, or to defend the Republican leadership pushing for impeachment, which could infuriate swing voters who like Mr. Clinton, or at least his policies.
Mr. D'Amato displayed some concern about the issue in remarks to reporters today following a Manhattan campaign event at which he received an award for helping direct Federal mass transit money to the New York metropolitan region.
Asked whether he would try to make impeachment a campaign issue, Mr. D'Amato said no, and instead accused an unnamed adviser of Mr. Schumer's of encouraging reporters to write about the matter.
"He has this guy who does it continually, puts out these nonsense rumors and things," Mr. D'Amato said. "We haven't done it and I don't intend to do it."
Asked by a reporter who this adviser was, Mr. D'Amato replied, "If you don't know, then he hasn't approached you."
The three-term Senator also said that he was "not going to be critical" of Mr. Schumer's remarks on impeachment, adding that he would not offer his own opinion because he might be required to vote on whether to remove or punish the President.
"When it comes to the Senate, then I'll act in a manner in which the facts and times dictate," he said.
Mr. D'Amato also continued his attack on Mr. Schumer's spotty attendance record this year, releasing a new radio advertisement that charges that Mr. Schumer has missed more votes, 110, in the last 12 months than Mr. D'Amato has missed in 12 years. The Senate votes much less often than the House. Mr. Schumer has accused Mr. D'Amato of distorting his record, noting that his attendance for votes during 18 years is more than 90 percent.

HEADLINE: 2 Sides Fight Over a Budget, Leaving Some In the Middle

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
The amount of money represents less than one-half of 1 percent of the $34 billion city budget, yet it continues to provoke a dispute between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council over who holds claim to the title of Most Fiscally Responsible.
Yesterday, some of those caught in the middle of the argument over $150 million in spending -- officials of various nonprofit groups that rely on city money -- held a news conference in City Hall Park to appeal for a resolution to the fight. Standing alongside several Council members and the Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields, they laid blame squarely on Mr. Giuliani, who has refused to release money that the Council had set aside for these groups, even though the city is reveling in a $2 billion surplus. 
 They said that withholding the money had affected services to children, the elderly and the poor. To underscore their point, they introduced an elderly man, a foster mother, a formerly homeless man and others to explain the need for the money.
But Mr. Giuliani was not moved. Speaking at his own news conference, he said that he was not about to be persuaded by grandstanding in the park, which he dismissed as the "usual, knee-jerk reaction of New York City career politicians."
"They think it's the same old political game, and they're going to pressure me into spending money that we shouldn't spend," he said. "It's not going to work with me."
As the protesters presented their case outside, leaves fluttered to the ground, a fitting reminder that this dispute began in late spring and has lasted into the fall. It started as a political quarrel between the city's top two officials, the Republican Mayor and the Democratic Speaker of the Council, Peter F. Vallone. From there it escalated into an institutional battle between the Mayor and the Council over who had final control of the city purse strings.
Yesterday's event highlighted the fight's impact beyond the walls of City Hall, where it has caused fiscal headaches or worse for nonprofit groups already operating on tight budgets. With both sides seemingly dug in, this dispute may well wind up in court, as other Mayor-Council disputes have.
At the outset, Mr. Vallone accused the Mayor of holding the budget process hostage because the Democratic Speaker opposed his plan to use tax money for a baseball stadium in Manhattan. The Republican Mayor countered that Mr. Vallone was presenting a pork-rich budget to enhance his chances as candidate for governor.
The Council eventually defied the Mayor by passing its own budget, then overrode his many vetoes. But the City Charter gives the Mayor the right to withhold spending if he thinks it is in the city's best interest. That is exactly what he has done, zeroing in on the Council "member items" -- the Council prefer the term "local initiatives" -- that Council members traditionally have spent on community groups in their districts.
The city's finances remain so robust that tax revenues for the first quarter of the current fiscal year are $200 million higher than expected. Still, the volatility of the global economy has provided the Mayor with the rhetorical reasoning for not spending the money allocated by the Council.
"Maybe back then, in May and June, it seemed like we had all the money in the world," the Mayor said. "But with the world economy and the American economy in a somewhat more precarious situation, I think the wisdom of our saving money is actually going to be seen by everyone."
But Thomas McMahon, the Council's finance director, argued that the Council had passed the "most fiscally responsible budget in city history." And he said that the money being frozen goes beyond the so-called member items; it includes $18 million for expanded day care, $10 million for weekly recycling and $8 million for programs that provide alternatives to jail.
Administration officials insist that circumstances for the community groups are nowhere near as dire as those presented by Council members and advocates.
But Angelita Anderson, the director of the City-Wide Task Force on Housing Court, which helps poor people to protect their rights in the confusing world of landlord-tenant disputes, begged to differ. Because the organization did not receive $263,000 it had been promised, she said at yesterday's news conference, it has laid off several employees and cut back on services.
Theresa Surbeck DaSilva, director of the WEME Mainstream Nutrition and Health Center, which provides 500 meals a day to the homebound elderly on the Upper West Side, said she was worried about having anything left at the end of her fiscal year. "We do need the money," she said.

HEADLINE: In Their Own Words

 BODY:

From the candidates' closing statements at their first debate in Stamford yesterday:
 
JOHN G. ROWLAND
"I think Mrs. Kennelly sees Connecticut's glass as half-empty. I see Connecticut's glass as half-full.
I have spent considerable time over the last four years working on the budget, working to bring hundreds and hundreds of new companies into Connecticut -- a hundred thousand new jobs into our community. 
 We've made investments in higher education. We've made investments in the environment, especially in our open-space programs, that have worked extremely well down in this part of the state.
And if you look ahead, the question becomes, 'Why would you run again?' And Patty and I talked about that long and hard in the early part of this year, and we decided that the real future of Connecticut is how we turn our cities around -- a total focus on turning our cities around.
The greatest problem we're going to face in the future is the lack of a skilled work force. The economy is so good that we need to do more to make sure that we have a skilled work force for the future.
Today, I ask you to support my candidacy, to help me continue the momentum we've built over the last four years. I commit to you that we will, and we can, do more."
 
BARBARA B. KENNELLY
"I think of myself as a straight talker. I understand government -- local, state and Federal. I've served at all levels. I know what government is capable of doing for its citizens with the right leadership. I know how to bring the best and the brightest in government together with the best and the brightest in business to solve problems. I have committed most of my adult life to making government work.
Put simply, I am running for governor because I don't think this administration has done enough to bring Connecticut into the 21st century. I'm running for governor because I know where we've been, I know where we are today, and I know where we should be going.
Tell me: Have we really done enough to have an excellent educational system for the state of Connecticut? Has the Governor's election-year conversion to H.M.O. reform done anything to forward our discussion on the future of health care for all our citizens? Have we taken our surplus resources and developed strategies to invest in future generations? Have we managed our debt so that we're not going to mortgage the future of our children?"

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: NEWS ANALYSIS;
A First Step With No End in Sight

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Almost every member of the House Judiciary Committee paid some tribute to the Constitution and the Founding Fathers today. Many said portentously that their debates and votes would be remembered for generations. The muse of history was obviously working overtime.
True, it was only the third time that Presidential impeachment has been formally considered on Capitol Hill. But only in that limited sense was the approval of a full-scale impeachment process historic. It was by no means decisive, no matter how much the legislators huffed and puffed. 
 This was only a first step along a rocky road whose length is not known -- not by President Clinton, not by the public and not even by committee members (although the chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, said this weekend that he hoped the House of Representatives could finish its work before year's end).
"The Constitution provides our compass," said Representative Edward A. Pease, Republican of Indiana. "I intend to follow it." But neither he nor his colleagues could say for sure where it would ultimately point.
Meeting in the same room where Richard M. Nixon's fate was sealed a quarter-century ago, Republicans stressed parallels to that era. This case is about law-breaking, they said, and not about illicit sex. To which Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's senior Democrat, retorted: "This is not about Watergate. It is about an extramarital affair."
That is the fault line, so far unbridgeable, between the two parties.
People in Washington universally assume that the House as a whole will vote later this week to ratify the committee's decision. The Republicans have the votes to prevail. But if only Republicans support the procedural plans set out by their leadership, as was the case in the final vote tonight, the decision will be seen by many in the country as a purely partisan proposition.
That next roll-call will help set the tone for what lies ahead. If only a half-dozen Democrats join the Republicans, the image of trench warfare will be reinforced and the subsequent inquiry will begin under something of a cloud; if 50 or 75 do so, the vote will confer a greater degree of legitimacy.
The more the average voter thinks that the Republicans are ganging up on the President, his strategists believe, the better his chances of surviving.
Of course, consensus or something approaching it may develop later. Only well into the final stages of the committee's 1974 hearings on the impeachment of Nixon did significant numbers of Republican members join the Democrats in concluding that Nixon had committed impeachable offenses. The fact that they finally did led people on both sides to judge its actions fair.
In the other case of Presidential impeachment, Andrew Johnson survived a Senate trial because just enough members of the opposition party broke ranks and voted to back him.
Once this week's votes have been taken, attention will shift to the mid-term elections on Nov. 3. The conventional wisdom in Washington has shifted rapidly in recent days, from a belief in the days before the release of Kenneth W. Starr's report that changes would be minimal, especially in the House, to a suspicion that Democratic losses would be large, which took hold in the days before the tape of President Clinton's grand jury testimony was released.
Now there is a growing conviction that the Republicans erred by releasing the tape, creating a backlash that could help marginal House Democrats.
Two caveats seem in order, however. While the President's troubles seem less likely to influence Senate races, Democrats were in big trouble in those without any drag from Washington. A number of independent analysts see Republican gains of four to six seats. Major losses in the House are still possible, too, perhaps 20 or more seats if Republican voters turn out en masse and Democrats do not.
"Differential turnouts aren't really very common, you know," said a senior Republican Senator on Capitol Hill. "But this year, Democratic voters seem to be in a sulk, and the Republicans act like they'd turn out even if it snowed on Election Day."
Big gains might embolden Republican legislators in their pursuit of President Clinton. But the political terrain is tricky. After November, both parties will have to play to the 2000 electorate -- larger, spread more broadly across the economic scale, and less intensely partisan -- and that might have a tempering effect on the zeal of the Republicans in Congress.
The detailed terms of the case developed by the inquiry, and how it is developed, will have an impact as well. Unshakeable as the preconceptions of many committee members sounded today, experience suggests that over a long period, some of them and some others in the House will change their minds.
If President Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky are called as witnesses, their deportment will certainly influence some Representatives. How they and their interrogators behave will influence voters as well. Mr. Clinton is a formidable persuader, and any attempt to break down his testimony would run the risk of alienating people who would sense disrespect for the Presidency.
A foreign crisis -- a genuine foreign crisis, as opposed to one that the Administration would be suspected of inventing -- could radically change the context of the inquiry, too. Republicans might find themselves under fire for distracting the Commander in Chief from important security responsibilities.
And what of the topics other than Ms. Lewinsky that Mr. Starr has investigated? Mr. Hyde insisted tonight that the independent counsel was still pursuing the original Whitewater matter and other controversies; one of the committee's ranking Democrats, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, insisted that no more would be forthcoming from Mr. Starr. Ambiguity keeps the pot boiling; wrapping up the other cases would take some of the steam out of the House inquiry.
All of those ideas, all of those possibilities will be in the air as the House debates impeachment in November and December. Depending on how they coalesce, the Republican leadership might or might not be receptive to a compromise, either before a committee vote or after a committee vote to approve articles of impeachment, before ratification by the House as a whole.
At any time, of course, Mr. Clinton could change his mind and decide to resign. Nixon's decision to quit came after the committee had voted. But it was motivated by the emergence of new evidence more than the vote itself, plus the belief he could not win in the Senate.
Mr. Clinton's aides say he would rather be a second Andrew Johnson, surviving in the Senate by a tiny margin, than a second Richard Nixon. As things now stand, he would appear to have a good chance of getting the 34 votes he would need (one-third of the total plus one) to win a Senate trial.
But that is not chiseled in stone, either. The Republicans could have 60 seats by the time the case reached the Senate. In that case, if they lost none of their own partisans, a switch of only seven Democrats would doom Mr. Clinton. A remote possibility, certainly, but then so much of what has happened so far in this case seemed highly improbable until it happened.

Divided House Panel Seeks An Impeachment Inquiry
The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines, 21 to 16, to recommend that Congress open a formal impeachment investigation of President Clinton. The resolution, modeled after the language used in the Watergate inquiry, outlined 15 possible grounds for impeachment. Democrats tried, on another party line vote, to substitute a plan for a more limited, two-phase inquiry. The full House is set to vote on the impeachment inquiry on Friday. A1
 
President Clinton's lawyers accused the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, of misleading a Federal appeals panel on lawyer-client privilege and they asked the Justice Department to release information that he had provided for approval to begin the Lewinsky inquiry.

Technology shares fell sharply yesterday, leading markets lower as the troubled world economy seemed to undermine investor sentiment.
From Japan came the news that some officials believe their big banks are in much worse financial shape than previously thought. From Washington, where the world's financial leaders were gathered for the twice-a-year meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, came no reassurance that world leaders would be able to act quickly to turn the situation around. 
 "It doesn't look like enough is going to be done fast enough," Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers, said.
Three of the major stock gauges fell to within easy striking distance of their Aug. 31 lows.
Foreign stock markets also ended lower, with Japan's Nikkei index down 2.08 percent to its lowest close in nearly 13 years. At the midday break today, the Nikkei was up 1.42 percent, or 183.94 points, to 13,132.06. Brazil's Bovespa index was off 4.5 percent, despite the apparent re-election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. How fast Mr. Cardoso moves to cut Government spending and work with the I.M.F. on a backup rescue plan will be watched closely by investors, who fear that an economic collapse in Brazil would lead to a recession in the United States.
As investors were shunning stocks, they were rushing again into bonds, pushing yields even lower. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond plunged to 4.72 percent and has now fallen four-tenths of a percentage point in just the last week.
Although stocks finished lower, a sharp, end-of-the-day rebound in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks staved off a much steeper decline. The Dow, which was down almost 233 points during the day, finished off just 58.45 points, or eight-tenths of a percent, at 7,726.24. The S.& P. index was off almost 38 points before rallying to close down just 14.04 points, or 1.4 percent, at 988.56.
The Nasdaq index, which is dominated by technology stocks, plunged 78.29 points, or 4.85 percent, to 1,536.69. Cisco Systems fell 13.3 percent, Dell Computer was off 8 percent, Intel fell 3.95 percent and Microsoft declined 2.82 percent.
Part of the selloff was touched off by a report in The Washington Post yesterday that the Federal Trade Commission was investigating whether Cisco had illegal conversations with Lucent Technologies and Northern Telecom about dividing up the networking market. Cisco confirmed the investigation.
Selling pressure also seemed to come from the fear that a slowdown in the American economy would lead to a sharp decline in sales of networking and other Internet and computer products. This belief was probably aided by warnings from several technology companies, including Aspen Technology and Avid Technology, that third-quarter earnings would fall below expectations.
Capital spending, which supports much of the computer industry, has been one of the strong foundations of the economy for the last several years. But there are signs that capital spending is beginning to slow. The recent sharp fall in the stocks of financial companies and the recent reports of their losses will further curb computer investment.
If world leaders cannot reassure investors that they can contain the current financial crisis, investors will focus more and more on the possibility of the American economy finally tipping from slow growth into a recession.
Mr. Applegate is not forecasting a recession yet but said that "there is a growing chance of a pretty significant slowdown." With Stephen D. Slifer, the chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, he is re-evaluating his outlook and said that "all the numbers are going to be lower." This includes his forecast of 1,150 for the S.& P. 500 at the end of this year.
Lawrence Meyer, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said in a speech yesterday that the Fed cut its interest rate target last week by a quarter of a percentage point because the central bank believed the economy will slow next year. He said the cut was part of a strategy to allow the economy to slow with a soft landing, not a recession.
Marshall Acuff, the equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, argued that "the best case is slow growth next year, not a recession." And if that is the case, the Dow could stay above the 7,400 level. But, he added, the odds for a recession are greater than the odds for a sudden strong recovery.

HEADLINE: Transit Repairs Hurried, Unions Warn

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In the latest sign that a surge in ridership may be straining the New York City transit system, union officials warned yesterday that maintenance work on buses and subway cars was being hurried and perhaps shortchanged as the system tries to get them back into operation.
That warning came amid renewed calls by the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group, for increased spending by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on new buses and subway cars that the group said were needed to accommodate the increased ridership. 
 At a news conference that the group held with unions for the transit system's supervisors and track workers, labor leaders said workers were being pushed to get trains and buses with maintenance problems back into operation more quickly.
"It shouldn't be an ordeal to drive a train or bus or to ride in one," said Willie James, president of the Transport Workers Union of Greater New York, which represents 33,000 of the city's transit workers. "That's why we are joining with riders to demand more service."
Some union representatives said they worried that routine preventive maintenance procedures used for years were being performed more rapidly because more buses and subway cars were in use, and more riders mean more wear and tear.
Safety checks on such things as doors, lights and public address systems are normally conducted on subway cars after each 10,000 miles of use (about every six weeks) and on buses after each 3,000 miles (about once a month). But with more buses and subways to contend with, the officials said maintenance workers have a bigger workload.
"Trains come in and go out more quickly, and you just don't want to hold one up in the yard," said Richard Russo, secretary-treasurer of the Subway and Surface Supervisors Association, a subway and bus union. "When people are being pushed, they might miss something."
Transit agency officials responded yesterday by pointing to large new expenditures they have announced in recent months to increase the frequency of bus and subway service. The most recent expansion, called the largest on record, was announced in September, when the M.T.A. said it would use its 1998 budget surplus to spend $44 million on expanded service over the next year.
The transit officials also dismissed criticism of the agency's maintenance procedures yesterday, saying the complaints reflected a predictable desire by union leaders for more jobs and better working conditions.
"I don't think the raw number of jobs is the issue, but the number of bus and subway accidents," said Al O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit, which is part of the M.T.A.
The union officials attending yesterday's new conference were not able to point out any recent mishaps caused by shoddy maintenance.
At the core of the dispute are converging shifts in mass-transit policy: the Metrocard, with unlimited rides, has combined with an upturn in tourism and the city's buoyant economy to draw more people to mass transit, but that rise in ridership has occurred just as the M.T.A has carried out a five-year plan of fiscal austerity. Since 1995, the agency has reduced its employment levels by about 10 percent.
While the Metrocard has helped draw people to the transit system, it has also made keeping track of ridership more difficult, Mr. O'Leary said. Some of the increased ridership numbers could reflect the fact that more people were transferring to and from buses and subways.
The biggest increase in numbers has been on city buses, where ridership had been declining. In the year that ended in September, New York City Transit said, its buses carried 22 percent more passengers each weekday than a year earlier. It predicted continued growth at a slightly slower rate until at least the end of 1999.
Subways have also attracted a flood of new passengers, with ridership up by 5 percent on weekdays for the latest year. Like buses, the agency has predicted continued increases in subway use through 1999.
To push its call to increase the size of the transit fleet, the Straphangers Campaign yesterday announced an advertising campaign.
The $40,000 campaign, in which 2,280 advertisements are being displayed this month in subway cars, is being paid for jointly by the advocacy group and transit unions. The ads depict snails and sardine cans, as symbols for current train and bus service, and urge riders to complain to city and state officials.

HEADLINE: Accord Reached on Bill For More Rent Subsidies

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Senate and House negotiators reached agreement today on a bill that would make rent subsidies available to more poor families and allow more home buyers to qualify for federally backed mortgages.
The bill, which seems assured of passage by Congress and of President Clinton's signature, would create about 90,000 Section 8 vouchers, or Federal rent subsidies, for low-income tenants. It would also raise the loan limits on federally insured mortgages to $197,621 from $170,362. 
 "This puts HUD back in the housing business," Andrew M. Cuomo, Housing and Urban Development Secretary, said today.
Mr. Cuomo said both the rental-subsidy provision and the higher ceiling for mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration would have wide impact in New York City and other metropolitan areas, where there are long waiting lists for housing assistance. Mr. Cuomo said the creation of 90,000 rental vouchers was especially important, because no new Section 8 vouchers had been authorized since 1994. Nearly three million households now receive vouchers.
Only two months ago, HUD negotiators had thought they might persuade lawmakers to authorize 15,000 new vouchers. Authorization of the far higher number left housing officials "ecstatic," as one put it today.
Mr. Cuomo said the higher mortgage ceiling would benefit about 70,000 families, many of them members of minorities.
Mr. Cuomo praised the bill not only as "the reflection of Democratic principles" but also as the product of dogged, bipartisan negotiations. He thanked Democratic negotiators as well as their Republican counterparts.
Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, chairman of the Banking Committee's housing subcommittee, said the House Republican leadership had eased the way for the bill by combining it with the appropriations bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Assuming that the HUD portion passes more or less intact, the housing agency's funds for the fiscal year that began last Thursday would increase about $2 billion, to $26 billion.
Democrats had pushed for measures to prevent housing agencies from separating working families from the very poor, and thus fostering racial as well as economic segregation. Republicans had pushed for measures to help the working poor who live in public housing. Mr. Cuomo said the bill met both needs.

HEADLINE: Close Election Complicates Brazilian Economic Reform

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Through the anxious weeks leading up to the national elections here on Sunday, as some $30 billion fled Brazil despite a doubling of domestic interest rates, international financial officials watched for the Government to tackle cost-cutting reforms as soon as the voting ended.
But today, as official returns indicated that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was barely squeaking through to re-election and governors allied to him were locked in runoffs later this month, the road to reform is looming longer and more complex. Polling groups and television stations that announced an overwhelming victory for President Cardoso before voting ended came under severe criticism. 
 Though exit polls reported Mr. Cardoso taking some 56 percent of the vote, official tallies this afternoon gave the President 51.2 percent of valid votes, with 56.1 percent of the votes counted. His nearest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers Party, took 34 percent, substantially higher than the 24 percent polls on Sunday indicated that he would get.
Mr. Cardoso's margin was just 1.2 percentage points higher than needed to avoid a second round of balloting this month.
Ciro Gomes, an up-and-coming former Finance Minister from the northeastern state of Ceara, took 11.1 percent, while Eneas Carneiro, a nationalist who called for Brazil to build an atom bomb, gained 2.2 percent of the vote. Though voting in Brazil is largely obligatory, the share of abstentions and invalid votes reached 30 percent.
Allies of the President did poorly in many of Brazil's most populous and politically influential states, weakening his hand going into negotiations for overhauling the way the Government spends money.
Though Brazil has not yet submitted a formal request, Brazilian officials have been in Washington negotiating some form of assistance from the International Monetary Fund that will probably total $30 billion or more.
The country's failure to cut spending in two key areas -- social security and civil service -- and to simplify and improve tax collection, makes Brazil heavily dependent on foreign capital at a time when investors are fleeing emerging markets generally.
Brazil's budget deficit is exceeding 7 percent of gross national product, and its current account deficit, which includes its balance of trade as well as debt service and other payments, constitutes more than 4 percent of G.N.P.
Government cutbacks of $5 billion and the doubling of inter-bank loan rates to almost 50 percent have slowed but not stopped the flight of capital. Some $300 million had left foreign reserve coffers today as of 6 P.M., and the Sao Paulo stock market was down 4.47 percent.
Investors appear to be watching for lasting reforms from the Government and for signs that wealthy nations will back Brazil.
But the political arena remained strangely silent today, almost suspended. By this afternoon, Mr. Cardoso still had not claimed victory, and Mr. da Silva had not conceded defeat. Sergio Amaral, the President's spokesman, said Mr. Cardoso would wait until official results were completely tallied before speaking.
Newspapers in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo headlined exit polls showing the President doing vastly better than official tallies reported, and in state races, polling institutes by and large played down the strength of leftist candidates, bringing the institutes under attack.
"The nation has watched the most shameful political and electoral manipulation heard of in recent history," said a statement from the coalition of parties that Mr. da Silva represented. It said polling institutes, news media and electoral officials conspired "to influence public opinion and alter the electoral will."
Mauro Francisco Paulino, director of opinion polls for Datafolha, one of the main polling services, denied any intentional manipulation of the results. He predicted that the final results would support the exit polls.
Claudia Santoro, a spokeswoman for Ibope, the other major polling group, said the director would not speak until all results were tallied.
In Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Brasilia, opponents of the President, largely from the Workers Party, will be competing for governorships in the Oct. 25 runoffs.
In Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, incumbents who had supported Mr. Cardoso failed to win re-election on a first round. The Governor of Rio, Marcelo Allencar, did not run for re-election.
Congress, with its members out campaigning for gubernatorial candidates, will probably not convene to consider reforms before the end of the month, however dire the international situation. Mr. Cardoso appears to be planning for a low profile in the coming weeks, with a brief vacation in Rio state and a trip to Portugal coming up. He is not expected to openly campaign for any candidates.

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR TO CUT BACK AT SCOTTISH PLANT

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The National Semiconductor Corporation will close part of a plant in Scotland and dismiss 600 of the 1,000 workers there because of slumping demand for computer chips. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said that it would take a $25 million charge in its second quarter, ending Nov. 29, for the cutback in Greenock, near Glasgow and that it was interested in selling its remaining operations in Greenock. National Semiconductor shares fell 25 cents yesterday, to $9, on the New York Stock Exchange. They have plunged almost 70 percent this year.

HEADLINE: CLINTON APPEALS FOR JOINT ATTACK IN ECONOMIC CRISIS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
President Clinton today urged a select group of the world's top financial officials to develop a unified attack on the global economic crisis, after nearly three days of debate here have produced a near stalemate over immediate cures.
Mr. Clinton spoke tonight at the beginning of a five-hour, closed session with finance ministers and central bankers from the largest industrial economies and 15 nations with emerging markets that have been stricken by currency devaluations, plummeting stock markets and growing unemployment. 
 But the session tonight focused chiefly on long-term ideas for making the global economy less vulnerable to shocks, proposed by the United States and others, despite widespread criticism here that too little attention is being paid to coordinated immediate action.
 Mr. Clinton returns to the arena on Tuesday morning, when he addresses the International Monetary Fund. It is holding its annual meeting here along with the World Bank.
Mr. Clinton tonight echoed a lament heard often these days by politicians who feel whiplashed by the markets, saying that global capital markets "can react swiftly and harshly when countries stray from sound policies." He added, " the markets also can overreact, subjecting even countries following good policies to severe pressures."
Just hours before Mr. Clinton opened the talks, the markets proved his point, continuing their fall around the globe. While the reasons varied, from heightened fears about Japan's banks to concern that it is taking too long to put together a huge package of aid for Brazil, the declines appeared set off by fears that the first few days of meetings here contained more finger-pointing than plans for action.
Japan's stock market closed below 13,000 on Monday for the first time in 12 years -- further undercutting the financial viability of its banks -- and the Dow Jones industrial average also plunged, before recovering much of the day's loss.
A participant in the meeting tonight at a hotel along Washington's Embassy Row said the President stayed for 90 minutes of the discussion, and at various points drew 15 ministers and bank governors into the conversation. Much of the discussion centered on contrasting views of what set off the instability.
Poland's Finance Minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, a favorite of the I.M.F. because he has embraced Western-style reforms, told Mr. Clinton the problem was not that the world's early-warning system failed, but that countries refused to listen to the alarms.
Another proponent of I.M.F.-style austerity programs, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda of Thailand, made the case that his nation -- the epicenter of the Asian crisis -- was slowly beginning to recover. But that was the only real note of optimism, and outside experts differ on whether Thailand is in recovery or simply not getting worse.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the United States would begin publishing more data about its foreign currency reserves -- a key statistic -- in hopes that other countries would follow suit. But the only action taken by the group, however, was to pass on a series of reports about reform measures to governments around the world, for their perusal.
While officials seem to be reaching some consensus about preventing future turmoil, more fissures opened at today's session over how the world should respond, at a moment when the United States, the Europeans and the emerging-market nations all have different prescriptions.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin directly confronted Southeast Asian nations that have been pressing for -- and in a few cases enacting -- rules that would restrict the rights of investors to move money freely across national borders.
"Misguided exchange and capital controls are not the answer for dealing with the effects of this crisis," Mr. Rubin insisted in a speech to the leading advisory panel to the World Bank.
He was clearly referring most directly to Malaysia, which has not only imposed such controls, but also arrested and imprisoned the country's former Finance Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, an ally of Mr. Rubin's. Malaysia announced today that it would suspend Mr. Anwar's trial, on charges of revealing state secrets and sodomy, while President Clinton visits Malaysia next month for the next major meeting on the global crisis, involving leaders from around the Pacific Rim.
Mr. Rubin also delivered a rare public rebuke to both the World Bank and the I.M.F., institutions created 53 years ago to stabilize the world economy, for their troubles in coming up with common solutions to the crisis.
"It is past time to put aside institutional rivalries unbefitting public institutions with the same shareholders," he said. "The I.M.F. and World Bank must evolve to meet the new demands of the global economy. All of us must work together."
But among the thousands of delegates who moved through the meetings, wending their way from seminars on debt restructuring to glittering embassy receptions, criticism grew that Mr. Rubin and leaders of the other major economies should move more quickly to show they have a short-term plan.
George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said in a forum sponsored by Foreign Policy magazine today that "the G-7 should be shut in a room and not allowed to come out until they have reached a decision" to extend loan guarantees and other backup financing to countries like Brazil that are "essentially following the right policies."
A year ago Mr. Soros was blamed by many at the I.M.F. and World Bank meetings in Hong Kong for accentuating Asia's troubles by betting against its currencies -- an accusation he denied. But today he pressed his argument that countries have increasingly become slaves to the notion that markets are always right and self-correcting, declaring, "Right now, market fundamentalism is a greater threat to open society than any totalitarianism."
In his public comments at least, Mr. Clinton has stepped around the sensitive issue of how much governments should intervene to contain market excesses. It is a territory where he is likely to bow to Mr. Rubin, a former Wall Street trader who is extraordinarily cautious about any moves that might smack of government efforts to restrict the free flow of capital.
Instead, Mr. Rubin has pressed an agenda of long-term fixes to make the way countries handle their resources more transparent and to establish uniform rules when countries or companies cannot pay their debts.
Today several of those were endorsed in three reports issued by the G-22 -- a group of 22 countries that has turned into a think-tank about future economic crises. One called for the release of far more economic data by countries and companies alike, noting that the lack of such information "exacerbated" the panic that began in Asia last year.
Another report endorsed changes in I.M.F. strategy so that countries that could be hit by economic contagion -- a phrase that was rarely heard at these meetings until the Mexican peso crisis of 1995 -- can "seek early assistance." That is the essence of a proprosal President Clinton made on Friday, but its success depends on the approval by Congress of $18 billion in additional funds for the agency. Republicans in the House of Representatives are overwhelmingly opposed, and there was no action today on resolving the House's differences with the Senate, which approved the commitment to the fund more than a month ago.
A report on strengthening weak financial systems in countries around the world calls for a series of regulatory changes, including bankruptcy laws and established procedures to govern the restructuring of a nation's debt. The report suggested that in some extreme cases countries might be forced to suspend all payments to their creditors. This would in turn require foreign banks and other lenders to work out a repayment schedule and pay a greater share of the cost of bringing the country back to solvency.
Many of these ideas have been in circulation for long enough now that they have begun to develop a momentum of their own. But they do not address the current crisis, and many officials here are complaining that Mr. Rubin and the I.M.F. are focusing on rebuilding the hospital before they have treated some critically ill patients.
But coordinated action is in short supply. The markets have been waiting to hear word of some kind of pre-emptive financial assistance for Brazil, totaling $30 billion or more, but while the details have largely been negotiated the Brazilian government is loathe to announce it until President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's apparent victory in a Sunday election is secured.
And representatives of virtually all the major countries here, especially Asian nations, say they are still waiting for most signs that Japan is ready to deal with its banking crisis. The market drop in Tokyo today, just days after the lower house of Parliament passed the latest bill over dealing with the banks, suggested that investors believe that Japan is still not doing enough.
"It's straightforward," said Kenneth Courtis, the chief economist for Deutsche Bank's Asia operations. "We've gotten from Japan all that we are going to get."

Pact at Pratt & Whitney

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Pratt & Whitney of East Hartford, Conn., and the union representing 6,600 hourly wage earners have reached a tentative contract deal that is likely to help the company whittle down its work force.
The pact is expected to offer an early retirement incentive for the 1,000 employees that Pratt wants to eliminate by spring. If enough people do not retire, the jet-engine company presumably would resort to layoffs. 
 Union representatives and officials said they would not discuss details of the proposed pact until employees saw it. A ratification vote is scheduled for Wednesday.
Pratt says it wants to cut employees because of the recession in Asia, which has prompted several carriers there to defer deliveries of new planes. The company says there also has been a temporary dip in orders for military aircraft.

HEADLINE: Assets of a Bombing Suspect: Keen Wit, Religious Soul, Angry Temper

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: MORONI, Comoros

 BODY:
The man accused of directing the bomb attack on the American Embassy in Kenya came of age in this impoverished Indian Ocean archipelago, a land where gifted teen-agers leave home to enroll in the radical Islamic academies of Libya, Sudan and Pakistan.
A tightly wound, brilliant student of the Koran who was thrown out of religious school for caning a lazy pupil hard enough to draw blood, Abdallah Mohammed Fazul set out for Pakistan 11 years ago, at age 15, to continue his education. 
 Sometime over the next few years, American authorities assert, Mr. Fazul fell under the sway of terrorists waging what they call a holy war against the United States. He was transformed into a killer who could coolly execute a bombing that left 250 people dead.
He is still at large after being indicted in the United States under an alias, Haroun Fazil, which he apparently used in Kenya. As the object of a worldwide manhunt, he has a $2 million reward on his head.
The stark portrait of him as a terrorist baffles his wife, his Koran teacher and relatives in Comoros, a country with a relatively liberal Muslim character. Even relatives who admit that he had a darker side say his religious fervor seemed limited to mundane things like animosity toward television and threats to chase family members into the street if he caught them drinking.
Nearly two months after the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, a picture of those charged is coming into sharper focus. They lived in different countries, labored in various professions but shared a devotion to radical Islam and a striking ability to keep family and friends in the dark about what American prosecutors say were their true activities.
Comoran officials express embarrassment that Mr. Fazul has turned the world's eyes on them. But they say he is a true product of the forces that shaped his tropical nation -- poverty, Islam, racism and French colonialism. He is one of thousands of young Comorans who have been forced by the lack of higher education to leave these strange and beautiful islands, where the world's largest volcanic crater meets startling aquamarine waves, where huge bats flit between the palm trees by day and the moon glows vividly at night, especially during power blackouts.
They study far away, in harsh desert lands where the path to holy martyrdom and the path to a bit of cash for a suffering family back home are the same: join the legions of the Islamic Jihad.
The indictments filed so far suggest that Mr. Fazul was no ordinary legionnaire, but a highly intelligent, natural leader who played a central role in the bomb plot.
His wife's extended family lives in a yellow cinder-block building behind a one-room Islamic school. They graciously welcomed two journalists into their threadbare rooms, offered coffee and talked for three hours.
His wife, a first cousin who married him five years ago and lived with him in Sudan and Kenya, called him a hard-working computer student and said he sometimes disappeared for weeks at a time. His big brother said he had been a gentle, sometimes boastful child who could "Smurf-dance like Michael Jackson" and never said anything about hating America.
When pressed, those who knew him said in so many words that they did not know him very well. His siblings did not see him for years at a time, his wife does not expect a message even though he has been gone more than a month, and his old teachers say he never visited. Each said, "He has no friends I know of."
According to the F.B.I., Mr. Fazul headed the Kenya cell of Al Qaeda, the terror network founded by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi businessman. It says Mr. Fazul rented the room where the bomb was assembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy.
On Aug. 14, a week after the Nairobi blast, he flew here. He visited relatives and his local mosque.
On Aug. 22, Mr. Fazul took a flight to Dubai. He had a ticket onward to Pakistan, but it went unused, and he disappeared. Family members say that he left without explaining, as was his custom, and that they drove him to the airport.
Tipped off by Nairobi telephone records that showed calls to a Moroni number, investigators descended on the family home on Sept. 2. The Comoran gendarmes were accompanied by F.B.I. agents with pistols and radio headsets, "just like Delta Force" said an uncle.
They took his brother, Omar, as well as his wife, Halima Badroudine Fazul, and sister-in-law, Nabatte Fazul, in for questioning. They also seized two computers, diskettes, a camera, CD's and tapes, old letters, passports and birth certificates, two Korans, piles of old Newsweek and Time magazines and Kenyan papers, rubber stamps and most of the clothing of the family's men.
 
A Fatal Ending To an F.B.I. Search
The day of the search ended badly. "The F.B.I. behaved correctly -- they were not threatening," said Halima Fazul. "But the Comoran gendarmes tipped my father out of bed to search it, even though he had a catheter in him."
They banged on the ceiling over his bed with their gun butts, she said. On her way back from the police station that evening, she was told that her father, who had been suffering from a bleeding ulcer, was collapsing. She ran, stumbling in the dark. "He took my hand and said, 'Ah, Halima, you're back,' " and died, she said.
When asked about that later, a prosecutor and a ranking gendarme both shrugged, saying they were unaware that the older man had a medical condition.
No complete listing of the evidence against Mr. Fazul has been issued, but a picture can be pieced together from interviews.
Mr. Fazul had passports or ID documents from countries that he is not a citizen of, apparently including Kenya and France, and stamps for forging others.
The Kenyan newspapers he had kept were mostly about the bombing, an investigator said.
There was a list of prominent Comorans who would have to be killed to make way for fundamentalist rule.
Investigators also found a letter he wrote in 1991, at 19, to his brother Omar, then 24, in which he boasted that he had been trained to use explosives and fire machine guns.
Asked his reaction, Omar Fazul, an English teacher, said: "I was impressed -- but I considered it childish. I thought he was boasting. I didn't believe him."
Omar Fazul said he never discussed religion, politics or military service with his brother. "We talk only about family problems," he said. "It has never been proved to me that my brother is an Islamist. He wears jeans and boots."
 
Displays of Versatility And Intelligence
Abdallah Fazul was born in 1973, the youngest of six, just before his parents separated. He began Koranic studies at 4 with an uncle and at 7 began studying with a professional teacher, Fundi Twawilou Abdulfateh. By the age of 9, he knew the Koran by heart and was giving religious instructions on the radio.
He was so smart, another relative said, that he was in third grade while his older sister was in first. He played soccer and the flute and could do a flip. As a teen-ager, he showed off with kung-fu fighting sticks and called himself James Bond.
He also had moments of rage. He got into a fistfight with a teacher at his French public school, and during Koranic studies slammed younger children down in their chairs when they failed at recital.
"He sometimes had a strange attitude," Fundi Twawilou said. "On the soccer field, he would provoke fights with bigger guys. When that guy would go to beat him, he would run away. So Omar, his brother, would be beaten. But Omar has crippled feet, so Abdallah would return to fight for him."
At age 11, he cut another Koran student's ear while caning him. Asked to leave, he studied for two years with Fundi Mohammed Ali, an older teacher, who remembers him as "brilliant, respectful to others, deeply religious and very calm."
At 14 he switched to a school run by Fundi Soidiki Mbapandza, one of the leading Islamic fundamentalists here, before leaving for Pakistan. Outside the tin walls of that school compound, girls and young women enter through one door, carefully avoiding eye contact with the opposite sex, while male students glower at visitors. Fundi Soidiki, who was questioned by the police, declined several requests for an interview.
The most militant strains of fundamentalism are almost unknown in Comoros. The islands are 99 percent Sunni Muslim, and many men wear ankle-length shirts and Arab-style caps, while almost all women wear head coverings and wrap scarves around limbs not covered by their clothes. But the atmosphere is relaxed -- the scarves often merely adorn Western dresses and few women hide their faces or hair. "Mr. Fazul learned a different culture abroad," Justice Minister Mohammed Abdou Mmadi said. "It would be impossible for a Comoran who grew up here to become a terrorist."
The islands are very poor, with a gross domestic product of $470 per person. Tourists -- mostly divers -- are few, and 80 percent of the local people are subsistence farmers and fishermen.
Because scholarships to France have dried up, many accept the meager religious ones offered by Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where fundamentalists recruit them.
"There are thousands of Haroun Fazils all over the world, recruited into the Foreign Legion of Libya and the armies of Iran," warned Said Hilali Moussa, chief of President Abdoulkarim Taki's Cabinet.
Many families get only one letter from their departed sons, said a tourism official. It says they are safe, living in a hostel. "Then they don't hear from them for years, and they they find out they are in the army. Lots end up fighting in Afghanistan."
Something like that happened to Mr. Fazul. "When he came back from Pakistan," a relative said, "he told his mother he wanted to go into the army. She told him, 'It is up to you.' "
After that he became more of a mystery. He was trained, presumably in Afghanistan, and has lived in Sudan, Kenya and perhaps in Yemen, officials said. He comes home only for short visits, never leaves an address and calls from pay phones.
Five years ago, he went with his father to Moheli Island to meet his uncle. His cousins Halima, 17, and Nabatte, 14, were there. "We were eating, and not well dressed, so we were embarassed," Halima Fazul recalled. "We ran inside to change." At the end of the day, he had his father ask for her hand.
Mrs. Fazul used to go fully veiled, with only her eyes showing, relatives said, and neighbors in Kenya said the same thing. But when went out visiting in Comoros, she wore her scarf off her face and was unfazed when her young son pulled it off in front of male visitors.
Her husband used to wear the traditional long shirts but now wears trousers and sometimes a suit. When teased about the Western dress by his father, a relative said, he pointed at his heart and replied: "Proving you fear God is not in your clothes. It's in here."
 
A Shadowy Life Defined by Absences
 He now has money, relatives said. He sends some home, and last year paid half the cost for his mother to go to Paris for cancer treatment. His wife cannot identify his boss or say exactly what he does, except work on computers. "He goes away at 8 and comes back at 6," she said. "I don't know what he does outside."
She denied having heard of Mr. bin Laden before the blast and protested that her husband did not hate Americans. She also gave him an alibi, saying that at 10:30 A.M. on Aug. 7, when the bomb went off, he was with her at the Nairobi airport trying to get her sick father on a plane home.
There have been accusations that a fundamentalist clique within the Comoros Government might shelter terrorists. Critics note that the "hit list" for local politicians found in Mr. Fazul's house called for killing President Taki's political opponents, but not him. And local journalists were surprised to hear that Mr. Fazul got to the airport late for his last flight out on Aug. 22 but boarded the plane in only 15 minutes, as if someone had cleared his way.
Mr. Moussa, the President's top adviser, called the accusations ridiculous and said they emanated from political rivals and separatists. The Government, he said, first heard from the F.B.I. on Aug. 29, a week after Mr. Fazul's departure.
Fundi Twawilou said he still felt like a father to Mr. Fazul and did not believe him guilty.
"Abdallah knows good from bad," he said. "He knows that for planting a bomb that kills 250 innocent people, a Muslim would go straight to hell."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 10, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A caption and a subheading with an article Tuesday about Abdallah Mohammed Fazul, who has been accused of directing the bomb attack on the United States Embassy in Kenya, imprecisely described a result of the search of the Fazul home in the Comoros by the F.B.I. and the Comoros police. As the article noted, although Mr. Fazul's father-in-law did die the evening of the search, the F.B.I. did not play a role in his death. Mr. Fazul's wife, Halima, said, "The F.B.I. behaved correctly."

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
Hold That Bottle, Bring Out the Glass

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
I'LL have a glass of chardonnay," the lady says. Her male companion adds, "Make it a glass of merlot for me."
Wine by the glass: how au courant, how American. Or is it? 
 At Le Rubi, a little cafe I frequent near the Place Vendome in Paris, the first wine drinkers of the day appear around 10:30 A.M. Workmen on their morning break, they call for "un p't rouge" -- a small glass of red wine. At midday the suits crowd in: office workers, ministry clerks, junior M.B.A.'s from the banks. They order the plat du jour and wash it down with a glass of Bordeaux rouge or a cru Beaujolais like Morgon or Julienas. No one orders by the bottle.
In Paris, wine by the glass has been trendy for a hundred years. Actually, people have drunk wine by the glass for longer than that, as there is really no other way to get at it, other than swilling from the bottle, which is uncouth, or squirting it from a goat-skin bag, which is unsanitary if you're out of practice.
In the United States, ordering by the glass did not become a widespread practice until the 1970's, when wine first became popular among trend-setters. At first it was a discreet way to mask one's ignorance. Murmuring "Just a glass of white wine please" sounds a lot better than "I don't know one wine from another."
Then someone came up with the Cruvinet, and ordering wine by the glass became part of the bar scene. The Cruvinet is a brass-trimmed glass cabinet in which opened bottles of wine are hooked up to a source of nitrogen. As the wine is served out by the glass, the nitrogen fills the empty space in the bottle. No air gets in, and the wine, theoretically, can last for days. The one-bottle Cruvinet became the three-bottle Cruvinet and eventually the 25- and 30-bottle Cruvinet.
Then, as quickly as it had arrived, the Cruvinet all but disappeared. Bartenders noticed that the bottles that lasted for days were wines no one particularly wanted and that bottles of popular wines were soon emptied -- even the most expensive ones. There was no need to preserve them in a glass case like Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.
Nevertheless, wine by the glass had arrived. Gradually, the standard request moved up the scale from "a glass of white wine" to "a glass of chablis," to "a glass of chardonnay." Or cabernet, or merlot. As more and more restaurants added wines by the glass to their wine lists, even a difficult-to-pronounce wine could be ordered without loss of face. "I'll have a glass of No. 6" would usually do the trick.
In the late 1980's and early 1990's, wine consumption faltered because of stricter controls on drunken driving, general concerns about alcohol and health, and an economic downturn. Then, with widely publicized claims that wine could actually be good for you, coupled with a brighter economy, wine bounced back. And with fitness as important as ever, having just a couple of glasses of wine at dinner made more sense than drinking a whole bottle. "Drink less but better" became a popular slogan.
Moreover, a new group of wine drinkers had emerged: more knowledgeable, more discerning, more adventurous. They wanted to try different wines but they were not prepared to buy full bottles just to experiment. In fact, the staggering increases in wine prices have made it almost impossible for restaurantgoers of moderate means to sample many sought-after wines. A couple celebrating an anniversary at a prominent New York restaurant might be put off by the $90 price for a bottle of good Champagne. But they might be able to swing two glasses at $17 each.
Some restaurants, like Gramercy Tavern in New York, offer wine by the glass and by the taste. Not sure if the Tulocay Winery's Haynes Vineyard pinot noir is what you want with dinner? Try a three-ounce taste for $4.50.
At I Trulli, another Manhattan restaurant, wine by the glass is supplemented by wine by the flight, served at Enoteca, a wine bar adjoining the restaurant. A flight is a group of wines to be sampled together. One flight consists of two ounces each of three Tuscan wines: two 1995 Chianti Classicos -- one from Rodano, the other from Rocca di Castagnoli -- and a 1994 Sassoalloro from Biondi-Santi. The flight costs $13.25. By the glass, the wines are $6.25, $7.75 and $12.25, respectively.
During the fall, Enoteca is offering a weekly series of flights of more expensive Italian wines. Next week a $36 flight of three so-called Super-Tuscans will be featured: the Solaia 1993, Sassicaia 1994 and Ornellaia 1994.
SoHo Kitchen and Bar, one of New York's oldest wine bars -- and one of its best -- offers more than 100 wines by the glass and more than 20 flights, including, for the exceptionally self-assured, a mystery flight of three whites and three reds. The Hudson Club in Chicago also pours about 100 different wines, but the mother of all wine bars is probably the Panorama Ristorante in Philadelphia, which offers about 120 wines by the glass.
Since it is unlikely that each of those wines will be ordered every day, most large wine bars use some kind of refrigeration and preservation system. Panorama and the Hudson Club use a system called Wine Keeper, which costs about $40,000, said Curt Burns, the wine director of the Hudson Club.
But even the machines, which resemble props from the Sci-Fi Channel, are not infallible. Maria de Corpo, the wine buyer for Mistral, a restaurant and wine bar in Santa Rosa, Calif., told Cheers, a trade publication, that spoilage was still a major problem and that it was important to feature what the customers liked most. In other words, turnover is everything -- just as at Le Rubi.
 
Tastings: A Red With Body
 
Miguel Torres Mas La Plana 1994 Penedes, Spain. About $35.
 WHEN this wine, which is 100 percent cabernet sauvignon, was introduced in 1970, it was known as Gran Coronas Black Label. It was created by Miguel Torres Jr., who joined the family business in the early 1960's and introduced French grape varieties to the Penedes region, southwest of Barcelona. The cabernet vines were planted in the Milmanda Vineyard in 1966.
Until the mid-1980's, the wine was rich and tannic, apparently too much so for the Spanish market. Even though the wine was immensely popular elsewhere, its style was softened to conform more to that of most Spanish reds. In the early 1990's, it reverted somewhat to the earlier versions, with more structure. This 1994 embodies the best of both styles: rich, opaque and intensely flavored. It would be just right for Thanksgiving; it will also last for 15 years.

Master's Touch
Next year will be the centennial of the birth of Alfred Hitchcock, cinema's master of suspense, who was born on Aug. 13, 1899, and died in 1980. The Museum of Modern Art intends to celebrate with a complete retrospective. From April to July, it will show Hitchcock's 53 feature films and two shorts and exhibit posters, photographs and papers relating to the life and work of the man who made films like "The 39 Steps," "Rebecca," "Rear Window," "Vertigo" and "Psycho." 

Contenders
 The 1998 Nobel Prize season opens tomorrow in Stockholm with the announcement of the award in literature. The six prizes -- in medicine, physics, chemistry, economics and peace -- each carrying an award of $938,000, will be announced over nine days ending Oct. 16. Because last year's Nobel laureate in literature, the Italian playwright Dario Fo, proved a surprise, speculation is cautious this year. But the French writers Michel Tournier and Jean-Marie Le Clezio have been contenders for a decade, along with Gunter Grass of Germany and the Dutch writer Cees Noteboom. Also mentioned are the British author Salman Rushdie, the Albanian writer Ismail Kadare and the Portuguese writers Jose Saramago and Antonio Lobo Antunes.
 
Road Trip
With a performance tonight in Rossiya Hall in Moscow, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis, begins its fall 1998 World Tour of 33 cities in Europe, the United States, Canada and South America. Prior to many concerts, the orchestra will offer educational programming that includes master classes, clinics, lectures and workshops for students and others.
 
 Return Engagement
Five years after he stepped down abruptly as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Riccardo Muti was greeted with a thundering standing ovation when he returned on Monday night to lead a benefit performance of Italian and theatrical works at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. "This is a very short visit, but I promise it will not be my last," he said. Mr. Muti, 57, is now the music director of La Scala opera house in Milan.
 
Naysayers
Having already banned productions of the 16th-century opera "The Peony Pavilion" at Lincoln Center Festival '98 and at the Paris Autumn Festival, Chinese officials have now forbidden the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company to perform the opera at the annual Hong Kong Arts Festival, opening in February. The 19-hour epic deals with a young woman who meets her lover in a dream. Cultural officials in Shanghai have deemed the production "ideologically unsuitable and pornographic."

Japan Expected to Pass Bill To Shift Debt to Railroads

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 6

 BODY:
A bill that is likely to lead to a showdown between the Japanese Government and foreign investors has passed the Lower House of Parliament and is expected to win Upper House approval by the time the current legislative session ends later this month.
At issue is the Government's plans to shift debt of 180 billion yen, or $1.34 billion at current exchange rates, onto the seven railway companies formed when the national railroad system was privatized more than a decade ago. The presidents of the seven companies, led by Masatake Matsuda, the outspoken former bureaucrat who is president of the East Japan Railway Company, have vowed to fight the measure, contending it violates their shareholders' rights by illegally changing the terms of the privatization. 
 They are also concerned that at a time when Japanese companies are being forced to turn to global capital markets for financing, the Government actions may inhibit the ability to issue corporate bonds.
Their cause has been joined by two United States Senators -- John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachussetts, and Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York -- as well as several large foreign institutional shareholders.
The Government has backed down somewhat. Its original proposal was to shift twice as much of the debt to the privatized companies. The debt is part of the old national railway's underfinanced pension liabilities.
In a move widely seen as an attempt to divide and conquer, the Government's revised bill includes some subsidized loans for four of the companies, which are operating with losses.
The debts the Government took on as part of the privatization have ballooned to $220 billion from $173 billion, and officials say that without the legislation the taxpayers will have to pay for the pension liabilities. The railways have rejected that assertion.
At a news conference today, Mr. Matsuda said that the Government could have retired its portion of the old railroad system's debt by using the money from the privatization as well as payments the railways make for the high-speed train, the Shinkansen, but, he said, officials opted to spend the money on other things. He again asserted that the Lower House bill violated shareholders' rights.
"If we allow shareholders to be deprived of profits without rational reasons, it means the collapse of the modern state and the free economy set up with corporations at the core," he said.
Mr. Matsuda stopped short of repeating a previous threat he has made to sue the Government, saying he thought it was possible to gain support for the rail companies' position in the Upper House and thwart passage of the bill.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party lacks a majority in the Upper House, but two smaller opposition parties have given their support to the bill in the Lower House. Their members are expected to do the same in the Upper House, giving the dominant party the needed votes.

France Telecom Plans Update for Minitel

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 6

 BODY:
France Telecom, which pioneered the quirky Minitel on-line information service years before anyone ever heard of the World Wide Web, announced plans today to bring its aging child into the modern world.
Working with the International Business Machines Corporation, the French telephone company said it would develop a network to let customers surf the Internet with simple and cheap screen-based telephones, which would also be inexpensive. 
 If all goes according to plan, the new devices would give technophobic customers access to the Internet without using a more complex personal computer. Though the Minitel system would continue to exist, with its homely little terminals and its proprietary network, the company hopes many people will simply gravitate to the newer system and its allure of worldwide access.
I.B.M. is supposed to deliver a prototype networking system by the end of this year, and France Telecom officials hope to start commercial service by the end of 1999.
Minitel, which was begun 15 years ago by the French Government, was one of the first on-line consumer information services. Conceived as a way to bring advanced communications to ordinary people, the Minitel came before personal computers had Windows, before America Online and long before the World Wide Web.
And when the World Wide Web exploded in popularity, allowing people to flit to computers around the world with a few mouse clicks, the Minitel remained almost obstinately old-fashioned. It remains slow, has no graphics and offers access to little outside France. But it remains popular in its home country, where it has about 15 million users and is host to about 25,000 services.
"This is not the end of Minitel, but we have to prepare for the future," said Jean-Jacques Damlamlin, the vice president for development at France Telecom. "Some people are not willing to use PC's for electronic commerce, but they are willing to see us provide a substitute for their Minitels."
Minitel may be slow and dull to watch, but it is simple, cheap and free from hackers. It generates billions of francs worth of fees from electronic commerce, from train reservations to flower deliveries.
Old-fashioned or not, political leaders and many industry experts worry that Minitel's enduring popularity has held back the Internet in France. In a speech in August 1997, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin startled many people by suggesting just that. Minitel, he said, "could be hindering the development of new and promising applications of information technology."
Under the agreement announced today, I.B.M. is to develop a new networking platform that connects a new generation of Internet devices. Unlike most other Internet access providers, France Telecom would take responsibility for maintaining and upgrading the software on individual terminals. Most of the management and navigational information, including profiles of users and their bookmarks of favorite Web sites, would be held within the telephone company's network rather than in the terminals.
But France Telecom executives, who refused to say how much money would go into the new contract, acknowledged there were many uncertainties. The biggest is whether the new screen-based telephones will be cheap enough to attract customers. With computer prices low and falling, company executives say they still do not know for certain whether the new devices have enough price advantage to be economically viable.
Though I.B.M., which is based in Armonk, N.Y., is developing the networking system, France Telecom wants other companies to build the terminals. Company officials say they want to encourage a wide array of equipment manufacturers, and that one of the reasons they chose I.B.M. is that the American computer giant has very little interest in building terminals. "We want the system to be completely open," Mr. Damlamlin said.

HEADLINE: Jean Crockett, 79, First Woman To Lead the Philadelphia Fed

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Jean Andrus Crockett, the first chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and first chairwoman of the finance department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, died on Saturday at her home in Media, Pa. She was 79.
While at Wharton, Ms. Crockett conducted several analyses of the stock market and investors. In 1970, for example, she and two colleagues found that mutual funds did little to improve the market's efficiency. On average, they found, mutual-fund investors would have fared better had they simply bought an equal number of shares of every common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 From 1977 to 1982, she served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and was appointed chairwoman of the regional bank in 1982. In one of her first statements in that post, she echoed a theme sounded by Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, who argued that Federal deficits had to be cut to make the Fed's job less painful. "Interest rates," Ms. Crockett said, "would not have to be this high if fiscal policy were used in addition to monetary policy to fight inflation."
Ms. Crockett was born April 20, 1919, in Tucson, Ariz. Before joining the Wharton faculty in 1954, she was a mathematics instructor at the University of Arizona, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois, a staff researcher for the Cowles Commission at the University of Chicago and an economist with the Commerce Department.
She was promoted to full professor at Wharton in 1966 and named chairwoman of the finance department in 1977. In 1989, she received the university's Distinguished Faculty Award for "pioneering all-University leadership and for dedication to furthering the careers of junior colleagues and graduate students."
Ms. Crockett is survived by her husband, Robert O. Crockett Jr.; three children, Jennifer, Elizabeth and Robert, and three grandchildren.

From Brazil's Perspective, a Bailout Shouldn't Have to Hurt

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 6

 BODY:
In gatherings with financial officials and international investors in Washington, Brazilian officials have been pledging drastic, if unspecified, measures to cut spending by $25 billion over the next three years.
But here in Brazil, the message has been far softer. And investors are beginning to worry. 
 Here, officials shun the word "package" -- with its whiff of sacrifices that would drastically worsen people's lives -- to describe the set of Government spending cuts that will be needed to put Brazil's fiscal house in order.
"With me there will be no shocks or surprises," President Fernando Henrique Cardoso told voters last week in his final televised address before appearing to squeak through to re-election on Sunday. "With me, there'll be no package."
The message was repeated by Sergio Amaral, the President's spokesman, on Monday night. "I reiterate that there will be no economic package, for the simple reason that there are no measures that taken together would amount to a package, and because the President does not consider that the way to conduct economic policy," Mr. Amaral said.
The spokesman cited a speech the President made two weeks ago, outlining fiscal belt-tightening measures, a crackdown on tax evasion and possible tax increases. That, he said, made "very clear what the Government will do." And Government officials said today that broad measures would be made over the next few weeks.
But on Wall Street and at the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington today, where the consensus spread that Brazil's economy was too important to be allowed to collapse, expectations ran the other way.
"It's funny that people there don't want to use the term 'package,' " James W. Barrineau, a Latin American equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said. "That's exactly the word they're wanting to hear in New York.
"Here, everybody has the sense that it has to be a big and credible package, without a lot of wiggle room for the states to siphon off money from the Federal Government," Mr. Barrineau said. "People are waiting to see what is Brazil's goal for 1999, how will it get there, how can it assure us that it's not going to backslide, and how does that help the sustainability of the economic plan."
He said that the poor performance of the Brazilian market, which fell 4.47 percent on Monday, reflected the "less than rousing mandate" won by President Cardoso and the unexpectedly strong showing of the leftist Workers Party in senatorial and gubernatorial races.
With 70 percent of the returns counted by this afternoon, Mr. Cardoso had won 52.5 percent of the vote, while his rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party, had 33 percent.
Today, markets rose 3.49 percent, or 213.51 points, to 6,336.35, on the decision by Spain's central bank to cut interest rates by half a percentage point, which investors took as a sign that Europe would begin taking steps to alleviate the crisis threatening Brazil, the world's ninth-largest economy. By late afternoon, market sources said, $120 million in foreign reserves had left Brazil.
"Brazil is the linchpin of the world financial system right now, and the effort to put together credibility for the Brazilian bailout is central to the world financial system now," said one Latin American investment strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "No matter what happens, Brazil cannot go down."
The difference between domestic and international messages is not new. Buffeted by the Asian crisis last November, the Brazilian Government announced some 51 spending cuts and new fees to raise $15 billion. It went ahead with the measures that raised cash but quietly dropped more politically sensitive efforts to cut spending including, for example, laying off tens of thousands of civil servants.
Alexandre Barros, publisher of a newsletter based in Brasilia, Early Warning, said investors were willing to give Brazil some time to work out its plan of action, but not much. Brasilia is rife with rumors of a United States-led line of credit being extended to Brazil, perhaps as a backup to an I.M.F. package.
But Mr. Barros said that investor patience could turn to panic in less than two weeks. "People expect the fund and Brazil to at least come to terms about what they're going to do, and they're frustrated that nothing solid has come out of the meetings so far," he said.

HEADLINE: Malaysia's Leader Betrays the Future

BYLINE: By Sam Nunn, Douglas Paal and Paul Wolfowitz; Sam Nunn is a former Democratic Senator from Georgia. Douglas Paal served on the National Security Council under Presidents Reagan and Bush. Paul Wolfowitz was Under Secretary of Defense in the Bush Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the Vietnam War era, Anwar Ibrahim was a student leader in Malaysia, admired for his magnetism, Islamic faith and intense nationalism. He spent 22 months in jail under a Draconian law left over from the British period. After he gained his freedom, he entered politics, rising to become Deputy Prime Minister, building a reputation for tolerance and civility along the way. By the mid-1990's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was grooming him to be his heir.
But Dr. Mahathir dismissed Mr. Anwar last month, and today the former deputy is back in a Malaysian jail, held under the same throwback colonial law, which allows indefinite detention without trial. For Dr. Mahathir, who is 72, a smooth succession would have been the capstone of 17 years of brilliant success in building modern Malaysia. Instead, Mr. Anwar's supporters are gathering in the streets in a remarkable show of defiance. 
 It is difficult to understand why things are going so wrong in Malaysia. In the mid-1980's, as the dictatorial regime of Ferdinand Marcos was collapsing in the Philippines, Dr. Mahathir was among the most penetrating analysts of its failures. Yet today, when buffeted by the global economic crisis, he seems not to have learned any lessons from the end of the Marcos era.
Mr. Anwar was never shy about differing with his mentor's policies; as financial matters got increasingly desperate, Dr. Mahathir had him arrested on various disputed charges, including homosexuality -- a crime in the country. When Mr. Anwar turned up in court heavily bruised and claiming he had been beaten in prison, Dr. Mahathir suggested he had inflicted the injuries on himself. Some of Mr. Anwar's supporters were arrested (though some have since been released), and yesterday Dr. Mahathir expelled several members of his party who were linked to Mr. Anwar.
All of this is both alarming and dismaying. Mr. Anwar, 51, represents Malaysia's enlightened, generous side. For many years Dr. Mahathir seemed to embrace his younger colleague, whose combination of religious conviction and executive ability inspired great hopes for his country's future. Today, Mr. Anwar's brave defiance and faith that justice will prevail stand starkly against the full force of the Malaysian Government.
It is sad that Dr. Mahathir's questionable allegations about Mr. Anwar seem to have intimidated many of Malaysia's friends into silence, even though they realize that Dr. Mahathir's actions are threatening his country's future. In light of the damage done by Dr. Mahathir to the universal principles of human rights and to Islamic principles of justice, it was surprising that the American Government's reaction was tardy and weak at first. Fortunately, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin stated forcefully last week that what has happened to Mr. Anwar is "deeply, deeply, deeply troubling." As the world's finance ministers meet in Washington this week, they should also express their concern about the treatment of their former counterpart.
It will be sad, too, if leaders attending the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Malaysia in November do not seek to ease Mr. Anwar's plight.
Mr. Anwar should be released on bail until his case goes to trial, and he should be given proper protection. His trial must be open, fair and without customary political influence. Outside groups should be allowed to observe. Ordinary Malaysians should be free to conduct orderly demonstrations supporting (or opposing) him, not chased through the streets and arrested.
Malaysia's good name, as well as its ability to attract the investment needed for its economic recovery, require that Mr. Anwar and his associates be allowed to voice their opinions -- and be given due process.

HEADLINE: Hold Those Blueprints

BYLINE: By Daniel K. Tarullo; Daniel K. Tarullo is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton was right to call for "urgent steps" to stem the global financial meltdown when he addressed a meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank yesterday. But he went on to echo the call of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain for a new global "financial architecture," a mantra that has been repeated too often in recent days.
An overarching global solution is needed, but to focus on it now risks diverting energy from the short-term efforts to get devastated Asian economies growing and contain the spread of their problems. History will not look kindly on leaders who sat in a crumbling world economy while drafting blueprints for a new one. 
 The President is clearly right that the most important thing is for the United States and Europe to keep growing and for Japan to address its failing banks and depressed economy. But, as the economist Paul Krugman has noted, we also need a Plan B -- a break with the I.M.F. policy that worked in the Mexican bailout of 1995 but has failed in Asia.
Struggling Asian countries need more money than the I.M.F. can hope to provide. One approach is to let them print more money to jump-start their economies while allowing them to clamp down temporarily on the flow of currency out of their markets, which would keep their exchange rates from tumbling.
Another vital step is to quickly shut down or salvage heavily indebted companies and banks. Rather than let Asian countries deal case by case with every bank and company, the I.M.F. and World Bank could help set up centralized agencies -- similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation that cleaned up American savings and loans -- to clean house.
It would also help if development banks and wealthy nations extended more loans, at well below market rates, to help these countries provide basic services and start New Deal-type plans to put people back to work.
Unfortunately, these goals were not advanced at the G-7 finance ministers' meetings last weekend.
In a speech in New York last month Prime Minister Blair called for a meeting of the Group of Seven's heads of state. This might be a useful prod to move us beyond vague bromides. But its focus must be the immediate problems in Asia and Latin America. To use it to create a "Bretton Woods for the new millennium," as Mr. Blair put it, would be misguided.
A key of all proposals for a new global scheme is controlling the flow of money across borders, which is what set the stage for collapse in Asia. But this is hardly a problem struggling countries face in the near future -- few investors are going to be putting any money into their markets. Addressing a problem that no longer exists might mean ignoring the problems we have now.
In this way, planning a new Bretton Woods would overwhelm discussion of short-term solutions. Having led the Clinton Administration's planning for four G-7 summits, I know that because only a few significant results can be achieved, the focus quickly narrows to just a handful of issues.
There are many in and out of government aspiring to the role of John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, who in the waning years of World War II conceived the elements of the Bretton Woods system. But if Asian economies and democracies collapse, if Brazil succumbs to financial panic and if recession spreads to Europe and America, a new global financial regulatory system will be of little help or consolation.

HEADLINE: Budget Showdown in Washington

 BODY:
In an atmosphere already bitter over impeachment proceedings, President Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders are heading toward another nasty confrontation on the budget that threatens to shut down the Government. In this dispute, however, the White House has a strong hand. Despite his political problems, Mr. Clinton is right to insist on legislation free of objectionable attachments to keep government operations going past Friday. The most offensive riders under consideration would damage natural resources, cut programs for schools and the poor and impose mischievous new curbs on abortion and contraception.
The reason for the latest battle is that Republicans in Congress have been mired in their own budget disputes all year, with hard-line conservatives favoring domestic spending cuts, moderates loath to provoke a veto by Mr. Clinton and their leaders reluctant to hand him a fight that draws attention from his sex scandal. 
 In a sign of Mr. Clinton's continued leverage, the Republicans caved in yesterday on the ill-advised $80 billion tax cut approved last month in the House, which was to have been paid for out of this year's budget surplus. The question now is whether they will come to their senses on other destructive measures. At a time of grave financial crisis around the world, for instance, it would be foolish to reject full funding for the International Monetary Fund, which the Senate has already approved. House Republicans should also back down on cuts in education programs, fuel assistance for low-income people and gratuitous gestures like the attempts to weaken the Federal Election Commission or limit contraceptive coverage in Federal employee health benefits.
As they have done in the past, Western Republicans in the Senate have added more than 20 last-minute riders to the Interior Department spending bill that would weaken protections for fisheries, wilderness areas and national forests. House Republicans have badly shortchanged the Everglades restoration program. Can lawmakers be so out of touch that they would try to capitalize on the President's political difficulties for a backdoor attack on the environment?
One of the more absurd contentions by Republicans is that they need to cut programs to make funds available for such emergencies as assistance to farmers, the troops in Bosnia and the crash program to update the Government's computers for the year 2000. But Congress has long recognized that emergencies may be met without cuts in spending elsewhere. In the spending and environmental areas, at least, Mr. Clinton has set out the right priorities. He should stick to them even if it means vetoing unacceptable legislation and provoking a fight that lawmakers do not want.

HEADLINE: Affordable Basic Banking

 BODY:
Making banking services available to citizens who need them has long been a worthy goal, but it will become even more important in January, when new rules require that most recipients of Federal benefits -- including Social Security -- have the money transferred to them electronically. Paper checks will no longer be available.
That is why one section of the House-passed Financial Services bill was so welcome. It directed Federal regulators to require banks setting up financial services holding companies to offer low-cost basic banking services -- a low-fee checking account with limited withdrawals. Such accounts do not offer the flexibility of more popular accounts, but they are vital for many consumers. 
 The lack of such a provision in the Senate bill is a significant problem. Before that bill is acted upon, the basic banking provision should be reinstated.
It would also be good if the Senate would overturn a decision to strip the Comptroller of the Currency of important regulatory responsibilities that were left entirely with the Federal Reserve. That far-reaching decision seems to have been made largely because Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is very popular. But banking issues sometimes are very important for the economy, and the people, through officials appointed by the President, should have a say in them.
The pending bill has many good parts. But if Congress passes the version now pending in the Senate, it may be necessary for President Clinton to veto it and ask the next Congress to do a better job.

HEADLINE: Russia Vows to Block the U.N. From Backing Attack on Serbs

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Russia vowed today to veto any attempt by the United Nations to authorize air strikes against Yugoslavia and warned of "serious international consequences" if NATO proceeds with force to halt the ethnic conflict in Kosovo Province.
Russia's stepped-up effort to insert itself into the diplomatic wrangling over Kosovo comes as Russian officials in Washington and elsewhere are pressing the West to rescue their foundering economy. 
 The paradox was not lost on Russian commentators, who questioned the timing of Moscow's latest bid to assert itself as a rival to the Western military allliance.
"It is difficult to act as a great power when you constantly beg for aid," Georgi A. Arbatov, a retired foreign policy expert and veteran of cold war diplomacy, told a Russian news agency.
Russia's latest diplomatic stand comes in an atmosphere of increasingly open hostility toward the West, which is often blamed here for promoting policies that have led to the Russian economy's near collapse.
Despite the country's weakened position -- or maybe because of it -- Russia's dialogue with the West has taken on a sharper, even bullying edge, on issues ranging from bad debts to foreign policy.
Russia has opposed the use of force by Western countries in previous diplomatic impasses, including action taken against the Bosnian Serbs in 1995 and against Iraq last year. With the architect of Russia's hard-line foreign policy, Yevgeny M. Primakov, now installed as Prime Minister, that policy carries more weight than ever.
But now Mr. Primakov risks antagonizing the governments whose economic help he is seeking.
In working to avert a military showdown over Yugoslavia, Russia is also seen as trying to reassert itself as an indispensable and independent player on the international scene.
In an interview today with the Russian news agency Interfax, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said Russia would "definitely" use its veto on the United Nations Security Council to block any United Nations-sanctioned strike against Yugoslavia. "A military strike will not help normalize the situation but will have the opposite effect," he said.
President Boris N. Yeltsin also made a round of phone calls to Western leaders and the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, urging them to use diplomacy rather than force in stopping further bloodshed in Kosovo, where Serbian forces, deployed by the Government in Belgrade, are accused of committing atrocities against ethnic Albanians.
In the Communist-dominated Russian Parliament, the tone was more strident and belligerently anti-Western. The Speaker, Gennadi Seleznyov, said today that the Parliament would move to break its treaty with NATO if the alliance attacked Yugoslavia.
"If they start bombing, a war will simply begin," Mr. Seleznyov said. "Yugoslavia will respond accordingly and fire at their planes, if they appear above Yugoslav territory."
Russia has historic ties to Serbia, which now makes up most of Yugoslavia. Russian nationalists have been quick to side with their Orthodox brethren against what they see as the West's undiscriminating antagonism to Belgrade. Russian diplomats have tried to use their influence on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to get him to back off his aggressive strategies and negotiate for peaceful settlements.
Last weekend Mr. Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev flew to Belgrade for another meeting with Mr. Milosevic. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said they had warned him that NATO air strikes were likely "if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation."
In warning the West not to strike Yugoslavia, Russian officials have issued vague threats of their own. Mr. Ivanov said in a television interview on Monday that military action could lead to serious consequences, while the deputy head of the armed forces general staff, Col. Gen. Vladislav Putilin, said the Russian military was ready to carry out "any order" from the Kremlin over Kosovo. What such an order might be, he did not say.
In recent public statements, members of the Primakov Government have argued that the International Monetary Fund and other institutions should give Russia more money to compensate for their bad advice. Some have also tried more aggressive tactics, saying the Western banks and governments could find themselves stuck with billions of dollars in Russian debt if more aid was not forthcoming.
But Russia's current economic turmoil, and the uncertain policies of the Primakov Government, have undercut its international standing, adding a note of bitterness to its internal foreign policy debate.
Mr. Arbatov, the former head of the Institute of United States and Canada Studies, said Russia today was "not in a position to expect its opinion to be heeded," and should put its energies into pressing Mr. Milosevic to change course, not the West.
"Too many warnings have been given to the Yugoslav President by Western countries," he said. "Thus the West has gone very far, and retreat would involve a loss of face."

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: WHITE HOUSE MEMO;
Just 2 Miles Separate 2 Bill Clintons

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton's parallel universes have been separated by a mere two miles the past several days, as international financial leaders assemble in downtown Washington hotels to address the spreading global economic crisis while Capitol Hill is consumed by debate over whether to impeach the President.
Mr. Clinton this week convened the top financial policy makers of the leading economic powers to sound the alarm about the growing threat of a global recession. At the very moment on Monday evening that the House Judiciary Committee was completing its debate on authorizing an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Clinton was engaged in a dense discussion on market transparency, the legacy of Bretton Woods and the need for a new global financial "architecture." 
 "He was very focused," said Sir Donald Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, who attended an emergency meeting of top economic officials called by Mr. Clinton on Monday night. "He was the consummate moderator. He even picked up all of our odd jargon."
In the Monday evening meeting at a Sheraton hotel here, Mr. Clinton assumed the role he has often played in international gatherings and round-table discussions at home: the avid listener and synthesizer. In public, at least, the President betrayed no interest in or concern about the impeachment debate raging 22 blocks to the east in the chamber of the House Judiciary Committee, a participant said.
And well he might be focused on the threat of spreading global contagion, because the health of the American economy is one of the chief props supporting his continued public popularity. Were the market and financial troubles of Asia, Russia and now Latin America to drag down the domestic economy, Mr. Clinton could see his approval ratings quickly erode and the prospects of impeachment grow more serious.
It was no coincidence that Mr. Clinton on Monday night seated himself between Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary, and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Greenspan are given much of the credit for soothing American markets and containing inflation as stock exchanges and currencies around the globe have plummeted. If the rest of the world's troubles spread to the United States, even they may not be able to save the President.
Mr. Clinton's focus on the world's economic troubles -- he has spoken on the matter almost every day for the past week -- carries a risk. If he cries "fire" and is then perceived as having done nothing to douse the flames, he could be seen as ineffective, crippled and distracted by his personal and political problems.
The jarring juxtaposition of Mr. Clinton as leader of the global economy and defendant-in-chief left many of the visiting central bankers and finance ministers perplexed and frustrated.
Among European officials, the spectacle of Congress considering impeachment while the world is looking to the United States for leadership in addressing the rapidly spreading financial crisis was disheartening.
"The misperception here in town has to do with the impeachment process, which the world regards as something totally bizarre," said Stephan-Gotz Richter, the head of TransAtlantic Futures, a consulting firm in Washington.
After speaking with European policy makers over the past several days, Mr. Richter said they "feel Congress is going into a reckless mindset while the rest of the world is burning."
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, which is holding its annual meeting with its sister agency, the World Bank, here this week, alluded gently to Mr. Clinton's domestic problems in his address to delegates. He chided the United States for failing to fulfill its $18 billion pledge to the fund, making its job of rescuing struggling economies more difficult.
"In a world of rapid change," Mr. Camdessus said today, "in a world where sudden market developments can destabilize even well-performing economies, the fund needs adequate financing to perform its mandate fully."
Alan S. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and a former member of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said foreign leaders were angry that Mr. Clinton and Congress were entangled in an obsession with private matters as millions of people around the world were watching their dreams of joining the middle class crumble.
"The main view in the rest of world is they can't believe what the United States is putting itself through," Mr. Blinder said. "They're looking with wonderment, bewilderment at what America is doing to itself and they can't understand why.
"Furthermore, they're angry with us. They all know if there's going to be any leadership in the world, it's going to come from the United States, and they see that getting extremely difficult. If the United States doesn't take the lead, nobody will."
Mr. Clinton is clearly trying to provide that leadership, using his fabled ability to "compartmentalize" problems. As much of the nation was devouring the transcripts of the salacious and sophomoric Linda Tripp-Monica Lewinsky conversations, Mr. Clinton was trying to master the intricacies of hedge funds and cross-border capital flows. Congress, meanwhile, was engaged in a Jesuitical disputation on what does and does not constitute an impeachable offense.
Up to now, Mr. Clinton has been able to wall off the threat of impeachment from the problems of the global economy, the midterm elections, Kosovo, the Federal budget, the Iraqi nuclear threat and all the other troubles that land on his desk. But it is the nature of the Presidency that he -- virtually alone in the world -- has to worry about all of them.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A poor showing by Chrysler illustrates the pitfalls of all-stock merger deals with foreign companies.

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE financial bane of Detroit auto makers has been the laggard shares of their stocks; those have tended to sell for only seven to nine times their earnings per share, less than half the market average for big companies.
Investors have feared the American auto industry's reputation for faltering badly during each recession and have refused to pay higher multiples of earnings even as auto makers have amassed huge cash reserves and cut their long-term costs. 
 Last spring, the Chrysler Corporation, which has a particularly bad reputation for encountering trouble during recessions, seemed to have found a nifty way around investor distrust. It agreed to merge with Daimler-Benz A.G., which has traded at a higher multiple in the German market, where investors have regarded auto stocks more favorably.
When news of the merger broke on May 6, Chrysler's shares climbed to 9.5 times expected 1998 earnings -- up from 8.1 times earnings the day before. Daimler's American depository receipts rose to a price-earnings multiple of 25.8, from H 24.3.
But those gains have proved temporary. While investment bankers and auto analysts still expect the deal to be completed, the weak performance of Chrysler's stock since May is an unusual example of the perils of an all-stock merger with a foreign company.
Chrysler shares closed at $40.8125 yesterday, down 62.5 cents from where they had been the day before news of the merger first appeared six months ago. Chrysler's stock is now trading at 7.5 times the consensus forecast of 1998 earnings, according to earnings estimates from the First Call Corporation, which tracks stock analyst opinions. Daimler's stock is now trading at 16.1 times expected earnings this year, though a small part of its drop since May reflects the payment of a special dividend.
Auto stocks have dropped since May, and German auto stocks in particular have suffered as consumer demand in Europe begins to weaken and the strengthening German mark of the last two weeks has eroded the value of car exports to the United States.
Because the Chrysler-Daimler deal is a transaction in which both companies' stockholders exchange their shares for stock in a combined company, Daimler's difficulties combined with a fall in American auto stocks have left Chrysler's shares right back where they were before the deal was announced.
Two weeks ago, Salomon Smith Barney lowered its rating on Daimler's stock to a buy from a strong buy, partly because the company's huge revenues from selling Mercedes cars in the United States were being hurt by the mark's growing strength. Since Chrysler's stock now moves in tandem with Daimler's stock, the recent weakness of the American dollar is thus hurting Chrysler -- a paradox for any American auto maker, which normally tends to profit from a weak dollar.
Chrysler's price-earnings multiple of 7.5 is now slightly less than the Ford Motor Company's multiple of 7.9. The multiple for the General Motors Corporation is 11.9 when calculated with its strike-depressed 1998 earnings, but only 6.5 when calculated with its expected 1999 earnings.
Chrysler's stock now has the lowest average recommendation from analysts of any of the Big Three auto makers, though the difference is fairly small, according to First Call. But anyone who believes that the combined company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., will thrive should buy Chrysler stock rather than Daimler shares, said Mark Rowen, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. That's because Chrysler is selling at a 10 percent discount to Daimler, based on the conversion ratios used in the merger.
There has been no sign that the problems at Chrysler and Daimler will derail the transaction, which has already been approved by both companies' shareholders and was always intended as a strategic move rather than as an outright sale of Chrysler. The only remaining step in the merger is for Daimler stockholders to tender their shares for exchange. If fewer than 90 percent of the Daimler shares are submitted, the deal will receive less favorable tax treatment.
But the fall in Daimler's stock since the merger announcement makes Chrysler more attractive to German shareholders and the merger even more likely to take place. A person involved in the merger said that there had been no discussions about reworking the terms of the deal.
Hedge funds, traditionally active in arbitrage trading of merger stocks, appear to have suffered little harm from Chrysler's difficulties, said Tom Burnett, the director of Merger Insight, a New York firm that researches mergers for institutional clients.
The reason is simple: hedge funds tried to borrow Daimler stock and sell it short to protect themselves against any breakup of the deal. But few Daimler shareholders have been willing to lend their shares, preferring to keep them and exchange them for shares in the combined company. So hedge funds and other arbitragers have been cautious about holding Chrysler shares, Mr. Burnett said.
Chrysler and Daimler are seeking to minimize taxes by treating the deal as a so-called pooling of interests. The rules for such transactions require Chrysler to undo the effects of its recent stock repurchases by selling 30 million shares -- an unenviable task in a market so weak that Goldman, Sachs just postponed its own plans to become a publicly traded company for fear that its newly issued shares would command a meager price.
Chrysler's difficulties have attracted little comment on Wall Street, and its need to sell a lot of stock is part of the reason. Big investment banks are lining up to handle the transaction, particularly as other stock issuances are drying up, and the banks' analysts are reluctant to offend Chrysler by discussing its problems publicly.
For now, the only auto maker that seems to have found a way to push its price-earnings multiple out of line with the industry is Ford. The auto maker posted a $15.95 billion one-time accounting gain in the first quarter when it revalued its 80 percent stake in the Associates, a consumer-finance company, before spinning off its stake in the business to Ford shareholders. None of the analysts following Ford have included this noncash gain in their calculations of the company's price-earnings multiple. But at least one financial information service does so, assigning a price-earnings multiple of less than 3 to Ford as a result.
Patricia Little, Ford's manager of corporate accounting and financial reporting, who calculated the one-time gain to comply with an obscure tax regulation, said that her role had prompted some jokes at the office, such as a suggestion that she deserved a raise.
"I sort of bragged to our C.F.O. that I produced more earnings than anyone else in the company, but he didn't really buy that," she said.

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements today by President Clinton and the leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, at the two organizations' annual meeting:
 
By President Clinton
A half century ago, a visionary generation of leaders gathered at Bretton Woods to build a new economy to serve the citizens of every nation. In one of his last messages to Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt said that the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I quote, "spell the difference between a world caught again in the maelstrom of panic and economic warfare or a world in which nations strive for a better life through mutual trust, cooperation and assistance." . . . 
 But now the health of Asia and indeed the world depends upon Japan.
Just as the United States had to eliminate its deficits and high interest rates, which were taking money away from the rest of the world, over the last six years, now Japan must take strong steps to restart its economic growth by addressing problems in the banking system so that lending and investment can begin with renewed energy and by stimulating, deregulating and opening its economy. For all of us, there can be no substitute for action.
 
By Michel Camdessus, I.M.F.
It would be perhaps too dramatic yet to talk of global recession, but the evidence of the risks calls for immediate action. Fortunately, in the industrial countries of North America and Europe the fundamentals remain sound. For some time, inflation has been subdued. Economic expansion continues in the United States, while in the economies of the euro area the recovery has continued to firm.
But even North America and Europe are not immune, and effects of the crisis are beginning to be felt. It was therefore most appropriate that representatives of the industrial economies recently recognized the shift in the balance of risks from inflation to a slowdown in demand. . . .
If we expect any upturn next year, it will be because of the impressive steps by many countries, some of which were already implementing Fund-supported programs, to shield themselves against contagion.
An example at the onset of the crisis was the Philippines, which was able to absorb the worst of the successive waves of contagion by prolonging and rapidly strengthening an existing successful Fund-supported program.
The reaction of Latin American countries, so admirably illustrated by the remarks of President Carlos Saul Menem, is also to be lauded. By jointly strengthening their defenses they have invited the markets to take greater account of the striking progress accomplished over the past decade and in particular since the Mexican crisis. They have created the conditions for the Fund to negotiate promptly its financial support, if necessary.
 
By James Wolfensohn, World Bank
Twelve months ago there was optimism about Russia with its strong reformist team.
And then came a year of turmoil and travail.
East Asia -- where estimates suggest that more than 20 million people fell back into poverty last year, and where, at best, growth is likely to be halting and hesitant for several years to come. Russia, beset by economic and political crisis -- caught between two worlds, two systems, comfortable with neither.
Japan, the world's second-largest economy, so crucial to East Asian recovery, with a Government committed to economic reform, and yet still in recession, with a profound impact not just in Asia but around the world. Nuclear tests in India and Pakistan. War threatened in Eritrea and Ethiopia. Terrorist bombs in Kenya and Tanzania. . . .
We must address the issues of long-term equitable growth on which prosperity and human progress depend.
We must focus on the institutional and structural changes needed for recovery and sustainable development. We must focus on the social issues.
We must do all this. Because if we do not have the capacity to deal with social emergencies, if we do not have longer-term plans for solid institutions, if we do not have greater equity and social justice, there will be no political stability and without political stability no amount of money put together in financial packages will give us financial stability.

Snagging Gig Young

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So I was having a light lunch of sweet potato fries and sour cream with a couple of girlfriends.
We couldn't trouble ourselves with the silly impeachment hearings. All that fake solemnity and pretense of open-mindedness. 
 Here is Congress, which has boasted more concupiscent hypocrites pouncing on more nubile office girls than any institution in history except maybe Mitsubishi, and they're ready to string up Bill Clinton over sex?
We spent our lunch on truly weighty matters, like how much we had lost on mutual funds. Things have gotten so bad, my stockbroker calls me asking for money, uttering the dread words "margin call."
Where, we fretted, would we ever come up with a pot o' cash to finance our new fall wardrobes? Heaven forfend that we keep wearing black, now that Seventh Avenue has declared gray the new black.
Suddenly it dawned on us. Larry Flynt! The publisher of Hustler had put a full-page ad in The Washington Post on Sunday offering "up to $1 million" to anyone who could provide documentary evidence of "an adulterous sexual encounter with a current member of the United States Congress or a high-ranking government official."
That sounded easy enough. We could hunt down some hypocritical official, trap him into an encounter, and get the bounty. All we needed to do was follow the game plan for snagging powerful, clueless men set out in old Hollywood capers like "How to Marry a Millionaire."
Or we could just follow the man-trap techniques used by Monica Lewinsky to bag the leader of the Free World. Her romantic gambits could have come straight out of those 50's movies. She is a girl who cries out for Technicolor, not black and white.
In the 1954 "Three Coins in the Fountain," Maggie McNamara's character catches an Italian prince by researching his tastes, from wine to opera, and then pretending hers are the same. She even feigns a passion for the piccolo.
In the 1959 "Ask Any Girl," Shirley MacLaine snares Gig Young by stealing his little black book and aping his favorite dates. He likes red hair? She dyes hers. He likes a certain perfume? She buys it.
Monica's seduction methods were based on the old-fashioned premise that men (and fish) are attracted by bright, shiny objects. She stationed herself, in flashy dresses, on rope lines and in the path of the Presidential motorcade. She studied her prey's preferences in books and accessories, and even called an antiquarian bookstore in Annapolis, where the President had browsed, to see what he had lingered over. Told it was a book about American Presidents, she bought it for him.
In the 1953 "How to Marry a Millionaire," Bacall, Monroe and Grable set their "bear trap" -- "All you need is just one big, fat one," said Miss Bacall -- by hanging around Bergdorf's mink department.
Larry Flynt is clearly looking for a deliciously high duplicity level. If we wanted that million, we would need a big, fat Republican bear.
If you want to trap Republicans, you have to hang out at the D.C. steak house the Capital Grille, or at Christian Coalition rallies.
The come-hither lines would have to be issue-oriented. Trent Lott would melt if you purred: "I loved your muscular stance on fast-track." You could bewitch Dick Armey, an economist, with sweet nothings about more supply and less demand. And you could sidle up to Mitch McConnell and coo, "Soft money is sooo sexy."
Naughty Newt Gingrich, the thrice-married nut Bob Barr and confessed philanderer Henry Hyde didn't pose enough of a challenge. We needed a real shocker.
We would have to bag someone like . . . Bill McCollum, the transcendentally geeky Florida Republican on the Judiciary Committee who seems to think impeachment is too kind and that the President deserves a good jolt from Old Sparky. The thought of "an encounter" with the bespectacled Congressman snapped us out of our man-trapping 50's reverie.
Bill McCollum is no Gig Young.
Besides, we already know that Congress is the biggest glass house in the world when it comes to misbehavior. And it would be a waste of time trying to embarrass the Republicans on sex when they are doing such a fine job of embarrassing themselves.

HEADLINE: France Detects Iraqi Nerve Gas, Experts Assert

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 6

 BODY:
French tests appear to have found traces of chemicals linked to the nerve gas VX on Iraqi warheads, according to several weapons experts who said this would confirm earlier American test results.
Several diplomats also charged that the French had delayed releasing the final results because they did not want to undermine Iraq's push at the United Nations this week to lift economic sanctions. 
 French officials denied that they were deliberately withholding test results, and a French diplomat said today that the results are expected to be "completely consistent" with the earlier tests that found no traces of the chemical.
Tension is mounting between the United Nations and Iraq, which has refused to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors and has sent a high-level team to the United Nations to argue that Iraq has released enough information about its weapons program to justify lifting sanctions.
Iraq has denied arming its weapons with VX, a drop of which, on the skin or inhaled, can kill an adult within minutes.
Iraq also disputed earlier American test results finding traces of VX on warheads and asked for further tests, conducted in France and Switzerland over the summer. Preliminary French and Swiss test results found no traces of VX.
But if final French tests do find VX components on the warheads, Iraq's credibility and its case for lifting sanctions would be further weakened. France, which like Russia has major commercial interests in Iraq, has argued that the United Nations should move faster to ease sanctions imposed after the Gulf War.
To begin lifting sanctions, all Iraqi biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, as well as certain missile systems, must be destroyed, and inspectors must be confident Iraq could not rebuild them.
Several weapons experts said that during a technical meeting in September of international weapons specialists, French technical experts had said that four or five of the samples taken from chemical warheads had VX components on them. But at higher-level meetings later that month, these results were not discussed, according to diplomats and weapons inspectors. According to several diplomats, French Defense Ministry officials told European officials that this was too sensitive a time to publicize results that would be damaging to the Iraqis.
The Iraqis, led by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, say that there are no more prohibited weapons of any kind to be found and that the Security Council has a "legal and moral" obligation to lift sanctions. Inspectors reply that there are too many outstanding questions, and missing documentation, on issues like VX and a host of biological compounds to justify relaxing restrictions on President Saddam Hussein.
Today Mr. Aziz angrily lashed out at the United States and the weapons inspection system, suggesting that he was meeting resistance in both the Secretary General's office and the Security Council in his demands for a new look at sanctions in return for Iraq permitting the resumption of on-site arms inspections, which Baghdad ended on Aug. 5.
In a six-month report sent to the Security Council today, Richard Butler, the chief of the program to inspect Iraqi , said that the Iraqis were close to meeting requirements in ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs. But it noted that "the level of verification of precisely how much VX was produced by Iraq is not satisfactory." The report also noted that Baghdad continues to deny that it loaded warheads with VX, contrary to mounting evidence.
The United States has also not submitted a second final report on the warhead samples, according to officials of the United Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq and preventing it from rebuilding its weapons programs. It was the first American report, in June, that revealed the presence of components found in decomposed VX in missile warheads destroyed by Iraq and dug up in April by United Nations weapons inspectors. That report led to Iraqi demands for laboratory studies outside the United States. Tests in France and Switzerland followed in the summer. The Swiss tests, all agree, appear to be negative, with no traces of VX components found.
Weapons experts and diplomats said today that a technical team assembled in New York two weeks ago by the Special Commission, known as Unscom, expected to be able to discuss final results from Switzerland, the Untied States and France. The Americans and the French did not have results ready.
Some diplomats accuse the United States of also withholding information because its scientists did not find VX components on its second batch of samples, so as not to cast doubt on its first tests.
France told the Unscom technical experts that it had four or five more samples to test. Today experts said that there is strong evidence that those outstanding samples had revealed two chemicals found in VX -- though not only in VX. But the Iraqis would be hard-pressed to explain what the chemicals were doing on warheads that Iraq said contained other substances.
The Iraqis used Sarin gas in the 1980s in attacks on Iran and on their own Kurdish population. The French say that the results may be known in a matter of days.
The Iraqi warheads being studied were discovered at a weapons-demolition site north of Baghdad. Commission officials haggled with Iraqis for weeks before being allowed to take some metal fragments from the shells out of the country in May for testing in the United States.
"Forty-four fragments were brought to the U.S. from the Al Hussein destruction site, a site where al-Hussein missiles were destroyed in Iraq, and they were analyzed using two scientific techniques," said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, at a briefing for journalists on Sept. 18. "On about a quarter of those 44 fragments, the analysts found traces of decomposed VX."
"The results were then tested or reviewed by a special Unscom team," Mr. Bacon said. "This is a team of 13 people from seven different countries appointed by Unscom to review the findings of the U.S. lab. That team included representatives from Switzerland, from France, from Russia and from China. The 13 people on that team unanimously concluded that the U.S. findings were valid."
Other warhead fragments from the same site were stored in Iraq by the inspectors, but apparently in conditions that were less than optimal to preserve them. There is also some question whether Iraqis, who had access to the site, could have tampered with them. In any case, after experts at the American military laboratory at Aberdeen, Md., found VX traces on the shells and the Iraqis demanded another set of tests in Europe, the samples for the second round were taken from the fragments stored in the Iraqi warehouse.
Furthermore, metal chunks were not removed from Iraq this time. Instead, 80 swabs were made on the surface of the metal and half were sent to France and half to Switzerland.
American officials were concerned at the time that there seem to be no "custodial command" over the fragments left behind by Unscom, and no knowledge of what the Iraqis might have done with them.
As a result, many questions surrounded the second set of tests even before reports began to emanate from Europe and from the Arab press saying that the Swiss and French had found no VX.
At the Pentagon, Mr. Bacon said that whatever the results from Europe, those findings did not contradict the American conclusion.
"Based on that, the question became not whether Iraq had attempted to weaponize VX but how many warheads it had weaponized with VX," he said.
"What we're dealing with here is something like an archeological site. It's a large area with thousands and thousands of little fragments that have been collected and taken to a warehouse. These are fragments of missiles that the Iraqis have destroyed themselves.
"So it's like if you were trying to analyze different types of grass in a large field," Mr. Bacon said. "You might find bluegrass in one corner of the field and zoysia grass in another corner of the field. Just because you find zoysia grass in the northwest corner of the fields doesn't mean that Kentucky bluegrass or fescue wasn't growing in the southeast corner. So that's where the situation stands."
In Geneva today, a senior American arms control official said that Iraq could reconstitute its chemical and biological weapons programs in a short period of time, and he urged that spot inspections be resumed as soon as possible.
John Holum, acting Under Secretary of State for arms control and international security affairs, said that the Security Council should not agree, as the Iraqis demand, to a timetable for lifting sanctions.
"They were designed to be lifted when Iraq satisfied the international community," he said at a news conference.

China's Central Bank Closes Guangdong Investment Firm

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China, Wednesday, Oct. 7

 BODY:
China shut the investment company of its richest province because the firm was unable to pay its debts. The closing is a sign of the growing strain in China's financial industry.
The central bank closed the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation, revoked its license and promised to make good on the company's debts, the official China Daily reported, citing a local television report. In response, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it might cut the below-investment-grade credit rating on the company's $470 million of debt securities. 
 The 18-year-old company borrows and lends on behalf of the Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong, and manages the province's investments. About half a dozen other companies do the same for various local governments.
Most of these companies have been hurt by a slowing economy and rising bad loans, and the closure of the Guangdong investment company shows how far China must go to avert the sort of financial troubles plaguing other Asian nations.
"We would foresee this as being a cleanup process," said Neil George, international funds director at $20 billion Guinness Flight Investment Management. "Our expectations are that many of the Chinese financial firms and banks are in a low equity position or negative equity position."
An official at the People's Bank of China in New York said he was unaware of any closure. If the company is shut, though, the central bank would insure that its international debt is the first to be repaid, he said.
The reports alone were enough to prompt Moody's to warn that it may cut the "Ba2" rating on the company's debt. Moody's said in August that it might downgrade it and six other investment firms because the companies' finances were deteriorating. In all, these firms have about $3.4 billion of international bonds, according to Moody's.
Among other things, these companies have been squeezed because local governments can no longer support them, analysts say. What's more, few can count on local companies to repay their debts.
The central bank already plans to merge many of these investment companies to shore up their finances.
Strengthening lenders is vital for China. Mounting bad debts are what eventually drove Thailand, South Korea and other Asian nations to turn to international lenders.
More than many other financial firms, China's provincial investments companies were hit hard as the economy slowed. Many underestimated the risk of investing in property and factories. What's more, many borrowed in foreign currencies, leaving them vulnerable to any devaluation of China's currency, the yuan.

HEADLINE: United Ethnically, and by an Assault;
Two Groups of East Indians Are Brought Closer, for Now

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA and VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
By age 5, Rishi Maharaj was waving an American flag. By the time he was a teen-ager, he was haranguing his family to register to vote. Years before he cast his first vote, he was volunteering for political campaigns and manning the local polls.
His patriotic zeal did not seem to matter much one evening in late September, though. While walking along a quiet street in South Ozone Park, Queens, Mr. Maharaj, now 20, was beaten senseless with baseball bats by three young men who, the authorities said, wanted to attack an Indian. 
 Prosecutors say one of the assailants hurled a string of racist expletives while he beat him, saying, "This is never going to be a neighborhood until you leave."
Now, Mr. Maharaj, the son of Trinidadian immigrants of Indian descent, is recovering at home in neighboring Richmond Hill. With numerous facial fractures and a broken jaw held together by a steel plate, he is still too badly hurt to talk about the attack.
But as they sift through the events of that day and the days since, his relatives and other Indo-Caribbeans say the case reflects how they often find themselves outsiders in their eagerly adopted land.
The attack comes at a time of simmering discomfort in South Ozone Park. Once a largely Irish and Italian enclave, the area has become, in the last decade, a popular destination for Guyanese and Trinidadian families moving up from their first immigrant homes in nearby Richmond Hill and Jamaica.
But if Mr. Maharaj was attacked because he was thought to be an outsider in this neighborhood a mile south of where he was born and reared, he and his compatriots have also been largely outside the "Indian" fold to which he was thought to belong.
East Indians from the Caribbean and the subcontinent have remained strangers at best in New York -- sharing the same faiths, but worshiping at separate churches, mosques and Hindu temples, and rarely, if ever, joining the same cultural or social networks.
Many Indo-Caribbeans -- descendants of Indian indentured servants transported to cut cane in the Caribbean 150 years ago, after the abolition of slavery -- have complained about being looked down upon as inauthentic Indians.
At the same time, many have remained apart from their countrymen of African descent.
Now, the attack on Mr. Maharaj, which prosecutors are treating as racially motivated, seems to have offered a rallying cry for "Indians" from both communities. Whether it will last, however, remains an open question.
"The small indignities that people have endured for the last couple of decades -- when something like this happens, all of these feelings resonate," said Roger Sanjek, a Queens College anthropology professor who has written a forthcoming book on race and neighborhood politics in New York. "People feel maybe that jerk who shouted something at me at the stoplight could have gotten out and done this to me. It wasn't that he was from Trinidad. He could've been from Rajasthan and still gotten attacked."
Two Sundays ago, Mr. Maharaj was walking up 114th Street in South Ozone Park with two of his cousins, when one of three men sitting on a nearby stoop, the police said, proposed to set upon "the Indians."
The man, Nuno Martins, apparently thought Mr. Maharaj was speaking too loudly. Then, the police said, Mr. Martins, 19, along with Luis Amorim, 22, and Peter DiMarco, 19, kicked, punched and beat Mr. Maharaj. The police also said Mr. Maharaj apologized repeatedly until he lost consciousness.
According to court records, both Mr. Martins, who is unemployed, and Mr. Amorim, a student at St. John's University, live near the corner where the attack occurred. Mr. DiMarco, who attends Queensborough Community College, lives in College Point.
All three are charged with attempted murder; though prosecutors asked for $500,000 bail, they were released on $20,000 bail each and are due in court tomorrow.
The beating occurred less than 50 yards from the home of Mr. Maharaj's cousins, the Gopees, who moved to 114th Street three years ago after several years in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn.
The Gopees had relatives in nearby Richmond Hill, but in South Ozone Park they found a house with a sprawling backyard and streets that seemed quiet and safe. They did not think twice about moving to a block that was still predominantly white.
"We grew up among people here," said Karen Gopee, a 26-year-old lawyer, whose family immigrated from Trinidad when she was barely a year old. "We consider ourselves to be American."
The attack has left them feeling ambivalent, at best, about the area they call home. In the last two weeks, several neighbors have come to offer sympathies, one even sending a note that implored, "Please don't judge us all by this incident."
Still others have upset them -- unintentionally, Ms. Gopee suspects -- by insisting that the men accused in the beating "wouldn't hurt a fly."
Statistically speaking, South Ozone Park today appears to be racially integrated. According to 1997 census estimates, nearly half its 17,000 residents were white, a third were black, and the rest, Asians and others. How many Indo-Caribbeans live there is impossible to tell, though, since they alternately refer to themselves as Asian, black or simply "other" on Census forms.
In any case, their numbers are far greater in Richmond Hill. There, over the last 15 years, Indo-Caribbeans have bought homes, opened roti shops and travel agencies, and erected their own houses of worship.
The changes in both neighborhoods have not gone unnoticed. Although police figures show few instances of bias crimes, residents and local officials say that tensions between Indo-Caribbean newcomers and neighborhood veterans revolve around more mundane civic matters: Hindu weddings that take place at home and last for days, a bawdy parade every March marking a Hindu rite of spring, or most notably, the illegal conversions of single-family homes into multiple units.
While local civic leaders say their concern is with illegal and potentially dangerous dwellings, regardless of the ethnicity of the people inside, Indo-Caribbeans say they feel they have unfairly been made targets of the housing crackdown.
"This whole area is a hotbed of tension," said Theresa Thanjan, a social worker with Catholic Charities in Southeast Queens. "There's nothing as contentious as the illegal conversions issue."
One recent morning along Lefferts Boulevard, the commercial artery of South Ozone Park, some longtime residents had difficulty accepting the official version of the attack.
"I know they had to be seriously provoked for this to happen," Kristie Pentaleri, 20, said from behind the counter at Star Mountain Cafe. "I don't think it was a racial thing at all." She said she had grown up in the neighborhood and knew Mr. Amorim.
Sipping coffee nearby, Patty Coco, who has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years, was also skeptical. "You can't take two college kids and call them ruffians," he said. "We haven't had nothing like this before."
Mr. Maharaj's family members say they are not so sure. Since the attack, they say, several friends have recalled aloud incidents they had never spoken of before, or reported to the police -- racial epithets, fist fights, beatings that landed them in the hospital.
But the attack on Mr. Maharaj has underscored rifts between these immigrants and their native-born neighbors in Southern Queens, it has also exposed the way New Yorkers of Indian descent are riven by differences real and imagined.
While Indian immigrants tend to be most comfortable in one of the more than a dozen Indian tongues, Indo-Caribbeans generally speak only English. And their food, music and religious rites have been transformed by African and Native American influences in the New World.
Each group also has firm, if inaccurately stereotyped, ideas about the other.
Probir Roy, an India-born accountant in Queens who was among the first South Asians to flock to the family's side after the attack on Mr. Maharaj, ascribed the gulf to differences in language, class and culture. "Though they speak in English," he said, "it's hard to understand their English because of their accents."
Mr. Roy, who arrived in this country in 1971, went on to describe Indo-Caribbeans as more likely to indulge in alcohol, hold blue-collar jobs and have broken families.
"Our kids are in Ivy League colleges," said Mr. Roy, an officer of the Federation of Indian Associations, an umbrella group of about 60 organizations. "The Caribbeans -- their parents are not so concerned to push their kids to be professionals."
For their part, many Indo-Caribbeans complain that they have long been shunned by their compatriots from India. Indeed, the Indian Federation does not include a single Indo-Caribbean group.
"There have been strained relations," said Amit Parasnath, host of a weekly Indo-Caribbean program on WLIB-AM radio. "There has not been much interaction between Indians from India and the Indo-Caribbean community over the years."
In the last couple of weeks, the attack on Mr. Maharaj seems to have caused Indians of both groups to reconsider their relationship in this country. Unusual if not perfect alliances have been forged. Indian New Yorkers belonging to groups like the Federation, which the Maharaj family had never heard of, have rushed to their aid. Letters and petitions addressed to the Queens District Attorney, Richard A. Brown, have been circulating on line, urging a swift prosecution of the suspects.
For the hearing tomorrow, a sundry group of members of South Asian organizations are planning a vigil outside the courthouse.
Still, the ambivalent relationship of Indians from across the diaspora has not been lost on the family of Rishi Maharaj.
Last week, they were invited to a $250-a-plate dinner with the Indian Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, during his visit to New York. Several of Mr. Maharaj's siblings and cousins went, dressed in their best flowing Indian salwar-kameez outfits and armed with petitions for the District Attorney.
A few people signed their petitions. Many refused. Ms. Gopee said she detected a lack of interest bordering on disdain. They left before the Prime Minister began speaking. They said they knew little about him anyway.
"After the response we got," she said, "we were not interested in staying."

HEADLINE: Pataki Has a Million Rebate Checks, in Mid-Campaign

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: LEVITTOWN, N.Y., Oct. 6

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki is taking advantage of one of the most powerful and time-honored perks of political incumbency -- the ability to dole out the largess of government. Instead of the usual library grant here, road project there, though, the Governor is going tradition one better, with two programs that are sending refund checks to more than a million New Yorkers in the middle of his campaign for a second term.
The refunds are a result of Mr. Pataki's having found at least partial solutions to two of the state's more intractable problems -- rising property taxes and Long Island's high utility rates -- and many Democrats have been unwilling to carp about the timing. 
 The Governor traveled to Long Island today to pose for pictures with residents who have benefited from the property tax-reduction program for the elderly, and to hand Angelo Pioli, a man in his 70's, the first of one million rebate checks for customers of the late Long Island Lighting Company. Standing under the oak tree in Mr. Pioli's front yard here, Mr. Pataki insisted that there was nothing political about the blizzard of checks being delivered during the campaign.
"This was the soonest they could go out," he said. "If we could have done it sooner, we would have."
His Democratic opponent, Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, charged that the check-writing was nothing but politics.
"It's really so transparent, it's sad," he said. "He can't possibly think the people are so easily fooled."
But among the parade of Long Island elected officials who joined the Governor and praised him today were a number of Democrats who were not inclined to take issue with the timing.
"Sure, there might be politics to it and he gets the political benefit," said Bruce Nyman, the Democratic minority leader of the Nassau County Legislature. "That's fine with me. He's the one who made it happen."
The utility rebate checks are a product of the $6 billion takeover of Lilco in May by the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency. By refinancing Lilco's debts at lower interest rates, the authority has reduced electric rates an average of 20 percent, saving customers about $490 million a year.
In the next few days, every home and business in Nassau County and the Rockaways is to get a check for $232, and those in Suffolk County will get $101. Each of those one million checks will be accompanied by a letter from the Long Island Power Authority praising the Governor.
This comes on the heels of checks averaging about $750 going to 700,000 low- and moderate-income elderly residents across the state over the last six weeks, under Mr. Pataki's effort to reduce the property taxes charged by local school districts. Beginning next year, every homeowner in the state is to be included in what the Governor has called the Star program, which he says will reduce the average property tax bill 27 percent by 2003.
There was no reason for either program to send out checks. Property tax and utility bills could simply have been reduced by the appropriate amount. Done that way, voters might never have noticed the benefit, or at least might not have been aware that it was Mr. Pataki they had to thank.
The logic behind the utility checks is, according to critics, especially tortured. In 1996, Lilco won a court judgment that said its Shoreham nuclear plant had been overtaxed for years by local governments, creating higher rates that the utility had passed on to its customers.
The rebates are meant to redress those higher charges. But to pay for them, the power authority borrowed money by selling long-term bonds, which are to be paid off through slightly higher utility bills. In other words, in order to give Long Islanders some cash now, the state is borrowing money that they will be repaying, with interest, for 30 years.
Mr. Vallone has been critical of the Lilco takeover -- which was first proposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- though he has not opposed it outright. But he charged that Mr. Pataki's wish to have the takeover concluded early enough to be politically useful caused it to be rushed through without the scrutiny that might have prevented the utility's former chairman, Dr. William J. Catacosinos, from arranging a $67 million pay package for himself and his colleagues, packages whose discovery outraged many people on Long Island.
"The only reason it was rushed through is to be sure that the money would be going out before Election Day," Mr. Vallone said. "Catacosinos and his cronies never would have walked away with $67 million if it had been done properly."
He said that although he supported reducing property taxes, in the Star program the Governor has effectively made a $2.2 billion-a-year promise without knowing how he will pay for it.

HEADLINE: New York Bracing for Medicaid Managed Care

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
After years of policy debates, hand-wringing and foiled attempts, the managed care revolution is finally coming to New York City's 1.2 million Medicaid recipients. And the details indicate just how hard the transition will be.
Information brochures featuring a woman with her child and dog will be remade for Muslim residents of Brooklyn -- without the dog and with more modest dress. Doctors fluent in Tagalog will have to be found. People with no telephones will have to be tracked down with a detective's diligence and be made to understand that perhaps for the first time in their lives, they need to choose a doctor. 
 Nearly every state in the union has required at least some of its Medicaid recipients to enroll in managed care plans; in several counties in upstate New York, mandatory managed care has already begun. But New York City's plan -- whose first phase is expected to be up and running by the end of the year, pending Federal approval -- is not just the nation's largest. It is also likely to be the toughest to put into effect because of the city's vastly multilingual population, the depth of its social problems and relative inexperience with managed care among even its most affluent residents.
The stakes are enormous -- 19 percent of New York City's nonelderly population is on Medicaid. Both the city and the state, which each pick up a quarter of the cost of Medicaid, have made their move into managed care a crucial goal, asserting that it will ease the historically huge fiscal burden while also providing better care for the poor.
"From a public health perspective, we're very hopeful that managed care will create an opportunity to provide more preventative health to correct the fragmented fee-for-service programs for the poor," said Neal L. Cohen, the city's Health Commissioner. "We think there are many gains."
But many health care policy experts, some government officials and advocates for the poor seriously doubt New York's readiness.
"I believe they are not there yet," said Susan M. Dooha, a policy analyst at Gay Men's Health Crisis, the AIDS service organization. "The moving trucks are outside the house, and the people are painting the walls, but I am not confident that the medical home is ready."
The components of the rollout range from the mundane to the profound, and each has provoked concern. Most advocates for the poor say, based on the experiences of the 365,000 residents who have voluntarily enrolled in limited areas of the city, that there has been far too little thought put into how beneficiaries, many of them illiterate, non-English speaking, transient or without phones, will be informed of this sea change.
In addition, recent surveys have found that many doctors' offices and health maintenance organizations, which have grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, lack the proper technical systems to monitor care.
There is also an important economic concern: whether New York State will be able to save money and still entice the commercial H.M.O.'s, which have been dropping out of Medicaid across the country.
So far, only five of the participating H.M.O.'s in the city's mandatory program are commercial companies -- Oxford, HIP, Empire, Wellcare and United Health Care. The rest are what are called provider-sponsored health plans, run by the hospitals, clinics and the like that have traditionally served the poor or H.M.O.'s that were set up for low-income patients exclusively.
The fleeing of commercial H.M.O.'s raises two larger problems: While there appear to be enough doctors to handle the first stage of the rollout, many people fear that further on there will be too few primary care physicians and specialists to give high-quality care. This is especially worrisome, they say, in poor neighborhoods, which have traditionally been underserved by doctors and where patients tend to be far sicker than the general population.
Further, if most of the Medicaid H.M.O.'s are run by the same hospitals and clinics that have been serving Medicaid recipients for years, will mandatory managed care be able to fulfill its promise of better care, with a wider universe of choices, at lower cost? Put another way, will the city essentially end up with separate but unequal managed care systems, one for the poor and one for the middle class?
The most vexing problem is also the hardest to quantify. People on Medicaid, who have long sought out health care only after they get sick, at low-income clinics and hospital emergency rooms, will now have to wrap their minds around a totally different system of care. And dealing with a referral system that has often confused and frustrated a relatively stable and well-educated middle class will be at least as tough for those on Medicaid.
"I don't think they're ready," said Michael Sparer, an assistant professor at the Columbia University School of Public Health, who has done several studies of Medicaid managed care around the country. What he found is that states that gave the least thought to the enrollment process fared the worst.
 
Lessons to Offer From Other States
While no state is quite comparable to New York in size, they have lessons to offer. Tennessee, for example, did not give proper forethought to its enrollment process and was totally unprepared to see enrollment grow from 35,000 people to 275,000 literally overnight. Minnesota prohibits direct marketing by health care plans but had an extensive outreach and education component to its program, which helped beneficiaries understand what they were getting into.
California had a large immigrant population, like New York, and failed to staff its program sufficiently in the beginning, which caused problems. The state used enrollment by mail with limited outreach and education, which resulted in confusion. The program also suffered from a lack of commercial H.M.O. participation. California is still ironing out its kinks but has one advantage over New York: its long history with managed care.
City and state officials acknowledge these concerns and insist that they have learned from their botched attempt to move Medicaid recipients voluntarily into managed care earlier in the decade.
"We have exercised a great deal of caution and diligence," said Robert Hinkley, a spokesman for the State Health Department.
 
Few See the Old System As an Ideal Approach
This time, the city will move slowly, starting with lower Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, and will branch out in stages around the five boroughs. Each phase will take 13 months, with starting dates staggered at five-month intervals.
Few people say that the old system -- traditional fee-for-service medicine -- was ideal. Many doctors would not see Medicaid patients because they found payments too low, and so most Medicaid patients sought care in grim clinics or emergency rooms. Last year, New York City spent $2.8 billion on Medicaid.
Under managed care, Medicaid patients will go to the doctors in their plan, rather than seeking out any doctor who accepts Medicaid. Instead of being reimbursed per visit, providers will get monthly rates, known as capitation, for each patient.
Outside of the cost savings to the state, managed care, in theory, will benefit everyone. Emergency rooms would no longer be overburdened with nonurgent visits. Patients with chronic conditions like asthma would be seen regularly, cutting down on their acute care and decreasing hospital stays. And Medicaid patients would sit side by side with lawyers and professors, getting care from the same providers serving large H.M.O.'s.
But can New York pull it off?
The Health Care Finance Administration, the Federal agency that granted the state the right to switch to mandatory Medicaid managed care, will ultimately have the final vote on the city's readiness, when it studies and reports on it this month.
The Federal Government's approval of the move to mandatory managed care did not come easily. Earlier in the decade, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began to push for Medicaid recipients to move voluntarily into managed care programs. The effort was quickly stymied by fraudulent practices by managed care companies that caused the city to nearly shut down its effort to market their plans.
Since then, the environment for managed care has altered greatly. At that time, managed care companies were fighting one another for Medicaid business. But New York ended up being far less generous than they had anticipated, and the potential for profit was cut even more when the state introduced a competitive bidding process that resulted in rate cuts of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan.
As a result of clamoring among H.M.O. companies, there have since been slight rate increases, but rates are still far below what most plans are looking for. "We strongly believe the success of any Medicaid managed care program relies on a rate structure that supports the services," said Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the H.M.O. Trade Conference in Albany. Ms. Moran said capitation averaged $102 a person, compared with the average of $142 a person in fees for service, causing many health maintenance organizations upstate to drop out.
"If you are a doctor already serving 1,200 patients, how many more can you sign up?" said Ms. Dooha of Gay Men's Health Crisis. "Also, you're talking about a very sick population, so do we have a sufficient distribution and array of specialists? And who will suffer? Will people be getting a five-minute physical? Or will the uninsured no longer get attention? What falls out is of concern to all."
 
The 'Bottom Line' On Doctor Supply
It seems now that for the earliest stages, the supply of primary care doctors will not be a huge problem.
"The bottom line is that capacity is not as bad as we expected going into it," said John Billings, director of the Health Research Program at the Robert F. Wagner School for Public Service at New York University, whose capacity study is considered the industry's gold standard.
While the state defines sufficient capacity as one doctor to 1,500 patients, many advocates for the poor and health care experts feel that is too low. Capacity is also defined by how available doctors are, another problem cited by experts. There is also a fear among most health care experts that once the plan starts moving into areas like the South Bronx and remote parts of Queens, there will be fewer doctors and clinics that serve Medicaid patients.
In a 1996 study of New York City's health care centers for the poor, the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit research organization, found that only half of those surveyed had doctors available after hours and on weekends. This is important because discouraging Medicaid recipients from using emergency rooms for ordinary care is one of the program's main goals.
What is more, only about half regularly called patients who missed appointments, or reminded them to show up. These numbers improved only slightly in a follow-up study in 1997.
But perhaps most daunting is the enrollment process itself. Medicaid recipients will soon be sent packages informing them that they need to pick a plan, and detailing how to apply for an exemption. People with H.I.V. and severe mental illness need not join managed care programs if they do not wish. Maximus Inc., a broker hired by the state to take over the enrollment process, has not yet made these packages public.
But the potential problems are clear enough. Will recipients open a package that comes in the mail, especially if they cannot read it? What if they change apartments frequently, which is common, and never get the package?
Other issues include the fact that the original letters to recipients do not clearly state who is exempt, and there is concern about whether people will get sufficient guidance through the enrollment process.
"The city and state have done no outreach," said Christine Molnar, director of the Medicaid managed care education project for the Community Service Society of New York, an advocacy group working with Brooklyn beneficiaries to aid the enrollment process. "There is no basic education on managed care, how it works, what is mandatory, what isn't.
"The most common thing we hear is that someone goes to the clinic and presents their card and learns they can't go," Ms. Molnar said. "We hear a lot of people who can't get a referral or go to a specialist they traditionally went to and get stuck with a bill or get rejected or get referred to someone out of network."
The way to best track patients and manage their care is through expensive but precious technical systems. This area is another one in which many programs fall down.
The United Hospital Fund study found that computer systems were poor in most of the clinics and unable to track essential information like referral patterns. The follow-up study in 1997 found the systems still lacking.
"There are real potential benefits with managed care," said Kathryn Haslanger, director of policy analysis at United Hospital Fund. "But you need the time and the resources to do it right, and it is hard to do right. The city is taking a big chance."

HEADLINE: Man in the News: G. Richard Wagoner Jr.;
New G.M. President Knows the Profitable Car and the Ugly

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 6

 BODY:
The naming of G. Richard Wagoner Jr. today as the president and chief operating officer of the General Motors Corporation shows how the world's largest corporation is changing -- and how it is not.
In an industry that still views gray hair as a prerequisite for serious responsibility, Mr. Wagoner is a brown-haired 45-year-old. Mr. Wagoner made his reputation not in G.M.'s established markets in North America and Western Europe but in its highly successful Brazilian subsidiary. He even plays basketball, not golf, and watches the basketball games of his alma mater, Duke University, at every opportunity. 
 Yet in many ways, Mr. Wagoner is a younger version of the many finance-minded executives who have dominated G.M. since its inception in 1908. He went straight from Harvard Business School to a job as a financial analyst in the G.M. treasurer's office in 1977 and has worked for the auto maker ever since. Unlike many executives his age, he does not have a personal computer in his office; he relies on his secretary to print out the occasional electronic mail that he receives, although he does use a laptop computer at home.
More important, he is sometimes criticized here for seeming to be more interested in profits and costs than in designing cars and light trucks that will fire customers' imaginations -- a terrible offense for some in Detroit, but one that Mr. Wagoner says is only partly true.
"I know an ugly vehicle when I see one," he said while cheerfully acknowledging that design is not his strongest suit. "In third grade, I drew a tree that my teacher said looked like a first grader's."
But Mr. Wagoner has one of the stronger track records among G.M. executives. As treasurer, and then finance director and finally as president of operations in Brazil in the 1980's and early 1990's, Mr. Wagoner helped build a subsidiary whose vehicles were G.M.'s most profitable until the recent economic downturn there. More recently, the North American operations have earned modest but growing profit margins under Mr. Wagoner despite fierce competition and a generally strong dollar, which makes it easier for foreign auto makers to offer discounts in the United States market.
The decisions by the G.M. board to combine international and North American auto operations and to put Mr. Wagoner in charge of both and promote him to president of the corporation did not register favorably on Wall Street, where some had wanted the company to bring in fresh blood. G.M.'s shares fell $2.50, to $51.25, after the announcement, while shares of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation rose.
As president of G.M., Mr. Wagoner faces a tough task. The merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz A.G. creates another global competitor for G.M. Page C9.
Though the dollar has slipped lately in currency markets, it remains fairly strong against the East Asian currencies of G.M.'s main competitors. The company's market share in the United States has been falling since the 1960's, while its long-profitable international operations are suffering from weaker demand because of economic turmoil in many overseas markets.
In combining its domestic and international auto manufacturing and marketing operations under Mr. Wagoner, G.M. is giving him a corporate empire with annual sales of $136 billion -- more than the General Electric Company, the Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation combined. The only G.M. businesses not reporting to Mr. Wagoner will be the vast auto parts subsidiary, which is to be spun off next year, and the automotive finance, heavy-truck transmission and railroad locomotive subsidiaries.
Combining the domestic and overseas auto divisions will allow G.M. to eliminate seven top-level councils that were intended to coordinate the activities of the two operations. Mr. Wagoner said senior executives would be able to spend less time in meetings and flying to meetings and would be able to make decisions much faster as a result.
George Richard Wagoner Jr. was born on Feb. 9, 1953, in Wilmington, Del. He is married and drives a GMC Suburban.
His broad new role, which covers 76 percent of the company's sales and includes a seat on the General Motors board, would seem to make him the heir apparent to John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive, who was president from 1992 until now.
But Mr. Smith declined to say today whether Mr. Wagoner was in line to succeed him.
"All we're saying today is Rick has been promoted," Mr. Smith said at a news conference this morning.
One of Mr. Smith's closest personal friends, Louis R. Hughes, had been executive vice president for international auto operations since 1992. Mr. Wagoner took over this responsibility today, and Mr. Hughes, while remaining an executive vice president, was given the job of handling the company's various partnerships with Toyota, Isuzu and other auto makers.
Mr. Hughes, 49, accepted this apparent demotion gracefully, praising Mr. Wagoner's competence at the news conference and saying that he looked forward to working with him. Mr. Hughes will continue reporting directly to Mr. Smith.
All 14 executives reporting to Mr. Wagoner will be Americans. In an interview, Mr. Wagoner noted that many of these senior executives had substantial international experience. That no foreigners made it into this elite tier of management at the world's largest multinational corporation, however, shows how slow G.M. has been to open up to outsiders.
"Clearly we've got to move with more foreign nationals," Mr. Wagoner said.
One of the few relative outsiders in G.M.'s senior ranks, Ronald L. Zarrella, a former president of Bausch & Lomb Inc., was promoted today to replace Mr. Wagoner as president of North American operations. Mr. Zarrella had been G.M.'s group vice president for North American sales, service and marketing.
At a company once led by hard-edged men who brooked no dissent, Mr. Wagoner uses basketball terminology to call for a more cooperative approach to management.
"There's an analogy -- running a successful business today is a team sport," said Mr. Wagoner, who is 6 feet 4 but did not play college basketball. "If the center doesn't set the pick, the forward isn't going to be free to take the jump shot."

U.S. Intensifies Threat To Use Force Over Kosovo
The Clinton Administration intensified its threat to use force against Yugoslav military forces as a flurry of diplomacy tried both to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown in Kosovo and to maintain NATO unity behind the use of force. A1

The president of the World Bank publicly broke with the approach that the United States and the International Monetary Fund have taken in managing the global crisis, as President Clinton argued anew that "we must find a way to temper the volatile swings of the international marketplace." A6
 
Nerve Gas Link Found to Iraq
French tests have found traces of chemicals linked to the nerve gas VX on Iraqi warheads, but France has delayed disclosing the results because officials do not want to undermine Iraq's push to lift economic sanctions, according to several weapons experts and diplomats. French officials denied that they were deliberately withholding results. A1

Democratic Leaders Try To Hold Ranks on Inquiry
Democratic leaders worked to keep as many Democrats as possible from voting for the Republican proposal for an open-ended impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. They seemed to back off efforts to fashion an alternative to both the Republican plan and a Democratic proposal offered in the Judicical Committee on Monday.

Democratic leaders want the rank and file to be able to say that they voted for an inquiry proposal, but that they opposed a Republican witch hunt. A1
 
The Republicans' chief investigative counsel, David P. Schippers, held open the possibility that Congress could still consider whether President Clinton abused the power of his office by asserting legal privileges in the investigation by the Whitewater independent counsel. A19
 
Republican organizations and a liberal advocacy group unveiled television advertising campaigns emphasizing issues over scandal. A20
 
Paula Corbin Jones was said to be considering whether to make a counteroffer or to stand firm on her $1 million demand to settle her suit. A19
 
Return of Donations Is Urged
A House committee investigating campaign finance abuses has concluded in a report that the Democratic Party should have returned up to $1.7 million more in potentially tainted contributions than the $3.2 million that the party gave back after President Clinton's re-election. A16
 
More Detail on Aide's Role
A House panel investigating the teamsters union disclosed internal White House documents that shed a fuller and harsher light on an effort by Harold M. Ickes, the former deputy chief of staff, to resolve an agricultural labor dispute in California. A16
 
Hoffa to Pass Up Debate

HEADLINE: Dissension Erupts at Talks On World Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
As President Clinton argued anew today that "we must find a way to temper the volatile swings of the international marketplace," the president of the World Bank publicly broke with the approach that the United States and the International Monetary Fund have taken in managing the global crisis.
In a speech to the finance ministers and central bank governors from 182 nations meeting here, James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank president, said that in the rush to stabilize currencies and bring about economic reform, too little attention was being paid to the growing ranks of unemployed and the risks of undercutting political stability. "The poor cannot wait on our deliberations," he said. 
 Mr. Wolfensohn's warnings underscored the extraordinary dissension and disagreements at this year's meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund over whether the strategy for stopping the global turmoil has been misguided.
While the fund and the bank often disagree privately, today's speech brought into the open months of tension between the two sister institutions over the right strategy for dealing with the crisis. The tension is so great that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today that the two huge institutions must settle their many differences.
Little progress was made today on forging short-term solutions. President Clinton, in his second speech on the world economic crisis in two days, repeated his proposal that the major nations of the world set up "precautionary lines of credit" that would help countries that are taking the needed tough economic steps but nonetheless are caught up in the wave of financial turmoil.
The Clinton Administration also said today that it was holding preliminary discussions to schedule an emergency economic summit meeting in London next month, as suggested by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
The meeting, if it takes place, is intended to follow up on some of the few concrete recommendations to have emerged from this meeting. There is clear consensus for one: a series of global rules on "transparency," requiring countries to make public reports of far more information about their foreign currency reserves and other data that would tip off investors that trouble might be brewing.
There is far more dispute, however, over whether those rules would also apply to private entities, especially hedge funds, the huge investment pools that are blamed by many for exacerbating the crisis with huge bets on the currencies of small countries. Nor is there agreement yet on rules that would force big lenders to pay a far greater share of the burden of bailing out a country.
"What we want to focus on are funds that attack a currency with a view to toppling it," said Sir Donald Tsang, the finance secretary of Hong Kong. But he said there was still considerable argument over how far governments should go in such regulation. "The debacle at L.T.C. helped," he added, referring to Long Term Capital Management, the Greenwich, Conn. hedge fund that required a Wall Street bailout two weeks ago. "Suddenly there was a recognition in this country that we are all in the same boat."
Mr. Wolfensohn, an Australian-born former investment banker known for speaking his mind, painted a bleaker picture than did Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the I.M.F. "We are not in 1928," Mr. Camdessus declared today, with his very comparison sending a chill through the vast hotel ballroom where the officials were meeting.
"If we keep a steady nerve, if all countries pursue stability," he insisted, the world will not slip into recession and "this crisis can be overcome." But he insisted that the burden of economic reform falls on individual nations. And he made specific reference to Russia, saying that the I.M.F. could not resume funding to the country until its new Government embraces reforms.
Mr. Wolfensohn's criticism of the International Monetary Fund's response to the crisis echoed a frequent criticism heard during the meetings: that the focus on stabilizing currencies and balancing budgets, the usual I.M.F. prescriptions, was causing far too much pain to the poor and the middle class. Mr. Wolfensohn contended that with millions of people slipping below the poverty line in Indonesia and with many Russians unable to afford basic commodities, the risks of political upheaval are greatly increased.
"If we do not have greater equity and social justice, there will be no political stability," he said. "And without political stability, no amount of money put together in financial packages will give us financial stability."
He argued that before the world can turn to building what the Clinton Administration calls a "new international financial architecture," it must adjust its approach to the crisis so that "mathematics will not dominate humanity."
Without building political support for the bailout programs that have led to government austerity and unemployment, Mr. Wolfenson said, "we may build a new international financial architecture. But it will be a house built on sand."
Mr. Wolfensohn's critique struck to the heart of the complaints from many nations -- especially Indonesia and Russia -- that have found fault with the fund's priorities. But officials of the fund and the United States Treasury -- which strongly influences its policy -- say that Mr. Wolfensohn has not come up with alternatives that would reform sick economies fast enough.
"It's easy for the bank to play the good guy," said one finance minister here today, who spoke on condition of anonymity, "because helping the poor is a lot more popular than convincing the Russians to collect their taxes and crack down on corruption."
Officials of the Fund argue that they have been loosening conditions to ease the pain on the poorest sectors of society, especially in Indonesia.
 Other officials here, though, describe the problems differently. At a meeting of 22 nations with President Clinton on Monday night, the Thai Finance Minister, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, tried to focus the discussion on short-term issues that need immediate attention.
"The first is the drying up of all investment in the emerging markets," he said in an interview this evening. "And the second is spurring growth in the largest countries," which buy the goods of Thailand and other nations. Mr. Tarrin said that Mr. Clinton led "a very good discussion," but that "we didn't get very far on anything."
European nations, Mr. Tarrin and other Asian leaders said, are complacent, since they have been hurt the least by the global troubles. He said they are immersed in the launch of their common currency, the Euro. The spending limits European countries have placed on themselves to make the currency strong has limited their ability to spend more to stimulate their economies, he said.
And Mr. Clinton, he noted, is still trying to get Congress to approve $18 billion for the I.M.F., though Congressional negotiators said today that they might reach a deal this week. "This has been a big limit on the U.S.," Mr. Tarrin said, because it has prevented Mr. Clinton from proposing any short-term cures that involve more American funds.

HEADLINE: Europe Sharpening Its Challenge To the U.S. Over Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
After more than a year on the sidelines, European governments are challenging the United States over how to address the world financial crisis, suggesting that new ideas and leadership are needed as the turmoil persists and Congress continues to block new funding for the International Monetary Fund.
In ways both subtle and overt, European officials have used this week's gathering of finance ministers and central bankers here at the I.M.F. and the World Bank to remind the United States that they represent an economic power to be reckoned with, and one with the authority to be listened to on the world stage. 
 By flexing their muscles, Europeans are beginning to shed their traditional deference to the United States on global financial policy as they prepare for a new era in which most of Europe will be bound into a single economic unit by a common currency.
Consumed by high unemployment and other economic problems at home, and unconvinced initially that the crisis that began last year in Asia would have much effect on them, European countries stayed largely in the background in the last year as the United States worked closely with the I.M.F. to keep the turmoil under control.
But in the last several weeks and during the meetings here in the last few days, they have proposed shifting more power into an existing policy-setting committee in the I.M.F., a move that could restrict Washington's ability to exert influence directly over the fund's management.
They have given far more enthusiastic consideration than the United States to efforts by the World Bank to shift the focus away from austerity programs to poverty-fighting and to challenge the orthodoxy that controls on the international flow of capital are always a bad idea.
With their economies strengthening after years of stagnation, European officials even dared to criticize domestic politics and policy in the United States, which for the last five years has not been shy about lecturing the rest of the world about how to achieve prosperity and stability.
At the top of their list was the unwillingness of the Republican-controlled Congress to provide the full $18 billion in new funding for the I.M.F. requested by President Clinton, though a resolution of that appears possible this week.
The French Finance Minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, pointedly suggested that those countries who were willing to shore up the I.M.F.'s financial condition act on their own without waiting for the United States.
He also suggested that the United States should consider increasing Government spending or cutting taxes to give a boost to the American economy, given the flexibility created by the Federal budget surplus.
"I cannot really believe that if the slowdown in growth is very important, the Administration will not use at least part of the surplus to sustain growth," Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.
In Asia, where Europe has been seen as disengaged and reluctant to commit money or political capital to dealing with a crisis that has sent millions of people spiraling into poverty, Europe's increased involvement is seen as long overdue.
"At least they should realize there's no such thing as an isolated country," said Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, warning that the Europe's economy would inevitably be harmed if the turmoil is not contained.
American policy makers played down any idea of a rift or confrontation with Europe, saying there were many ideas that deserved to be considered. But one American official involved in Asia policy said the failure of the American-led effort to end the turmoil "further emboldened our European friends" to mount "a more concerted challenge to the kinds of policy directions we've been offering."
To some extent, analysts said, France, Britain and Germany are stepping into a vacuum created by the lack of any obvious new ideas about how to address a crisis that has proven resistant to the traditional market-friendly cures favored by the I.M.F. and American policy makers led by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin.
"Clearly in the past the Americans had a free hand in setting policy goals and the global investment agenda," said Stephan-Gotz Richter, the president of TransAtlantic Futures, a Washington consulting firm that tracks European-American relations.
"Some of the citadels of American power are shaken, and the Europeans are now in a position to be a check and balance on American influence," he said. "It's not a concerted effort to outflank the Americans, it's a competition of the best ideas."
But some of the bankers and government officials attending the meetings and informal discussions here said Europe's assertiveness is part of a broader desire on the part of France and Germany to pound home the idea that the European Union is as big an economy as the United States and should be afforded the same voice in global economic policy. The planned start of the first phase of European monetary union on Jan. 1, they said, has increased the feeling among Europeans that their clout should be respected by the United States and the rest of the world.
"I really do see a new European self-confidence coming up here, although I think we're slightly uncomfortable with it and don't really know what to do with it," said Klaus Friedrich, the chief economist at Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-largest financial institution.
Indeed, it is difficult to define a European approach to the world's current problems. With Britain, France and Germany all now having left-leaning governments, there is greater willingness to consider intervening in markets, although no consensus about actually doing so.
The new German Government in particular, although not represented at this week's meetings, has made clear that it sees controls on capital flows as a subject for serious consideration. Germany's Chancellor-elect, Gerhard Schroeder, is scheduled to meet with President Clinton here on Friday.
Hans Tietmeyer, the head of Germany's powerful central bank, hinted here that the Bundesbank might now be willing to cut interest rates to help avert a global downturn, a shift from his previous insistence that a German rate cut was unjustified.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has been pressing the biggest industrial nations to rethink the structure and goals of international financial institutions like the I.M.F. and the World Bank. Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, proposed regular meetings of the fund, the bank and international banking supervisors to coordinate worldwide regulation.
The new coordinated effort would be intended "not just to point out weaknesses, but to insure that these weaknesses are addressed and to identify systemic risks to the global financial structure," Mr. Brown said.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn said France had come to the meetings with 12 points that it wanted the international institutions to consider, ranging from requiring more disclosure by commercial banks and hedge funds of their international business to creating a decision-making body within the I.M.F. with real political authority.
"Most of the ideas" are now under consideration, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, "so we think that what we did was useful."

HEADLINE: Owner of N.F.L. Team Ties Ex-Governor to Extortion

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Oct. 6

 BODY:
After striking a deal to provide evidence against former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards of Louisiana, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., the co-owner of the San Francisco 49ers, pleaded guilty today to concealing an alleged extortion plot by Mr. Edwards that involved the licensing of a riverboat casino.
Shortly before the proceedings began in Federal District Court here this afternoon, the 71-year-old Mr. Edwards -- tanned, silver-haired, unwrinkled and accompanied by his wife, Candy -- strode into the courtroom, gladhanded with spectators, and took a seat three rows behind Mr. DeBartolo. 
 After watching the 45-minute hearing, a bent knuckle pressed against his lips, Mr. Edwards, who has not been charged in the case, announced to reporters in a descending elevator that his longtime friend had become "the Linda Tripp of Louisiana."
Later he added, "I hope the 49ers lose this Sunday," when they play the New Orleans Saints in a National Football League game.
And noting that Mr. DeBartolo is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr. Edwards scoffed at the prosecutors' contention that he had victimized Mr. DeBartolo. "If I had victimized him, I would have done it for a lot more than $400,000," he said.
The $400,000 is the amount that all sides agree Mr. DeBartolo paid to Mr. Edwards, in new $100 bills, for his services in March 1997.
Today, Mr. DeBartolo, the 51-year-old scion of one of the country's most successful developers of shopping malls, pleaded guilty to one count of misprision of felony, for failing to report what prosecutors characterized as "extortion and fraudulent conduct" by Mr. Edwards.
Under the terms of the plea agreement, Judge John V. Parker sentenced Mr. DeBartolo to two years' probation and ordered him to pay a $250,000 fine, to forfeit to the Federal Government the $400,000 he paid to Mr. Edwards, and to provide up to $350,000 in restitution that could be claimed by anyone hurt by the crime.
After the sentencing, Judge Parker advised Mr. DeBartolo that his lawyer, Aubrey Harwell, had served him well.
"This criminal justice system rewards the fellow who gets to the courthouse quickest," Judge Parker said. " And Mr. Harwell has secured you a prime seat on this train that seems to be leaving the station. In fact, you may have a private car."
During the hearing, an F.B.I. agent, Jeffrey Santini, testified that evidence from witnesses and wiretaps showed that Mr. Edwards and his son, Stephen, had repeatedly sought payments from Mr. DeBartolo in late 1996 and early 1997. The money, Mr. Santini said, was to insure that the state Gaming Board would award the license for its fifteenth and final riverboat casino to a consortium that included Mr. DeBartolo.
Although Mr. Edwards left office in January 1996, prosecutors say, he maintained influence with the six-member Gaming Board through other elected and appointed officials. Mr. Santini said Mr. Edwards put Mr. DeBartolo "in fear of economic loss relative to the awarding of his joint venture's license if he did not pay Edwards substantial sums of money."
First, Mr. Santini testified, Mr. Edwards demanded "a $50,000 per month sham consulting agreement payable to Stephen Edwards and a price per head of each customer aboard the riverboat." Then, he said, Mr. Edwards asked for the $400,000 lump sum "by stating, in substance, that he must have payment of that amount by March 13 or there could be problems with the licensing."
Even after that payment was made, Mr. Santini said, the Edwardses sent Mr. DeBartolo "yet another proposed retainer agreement for $10,000 per month."
Prosecutors said that on March 12, 1997, Mr. DeBartolo gave Mr. Edwards the $400,000 after a lunch in California. The next day, the Gaming Board granted the casino license to the Hollywood Casino Corporation, the Dallas company that included Mr. DeBartolo as an investor. The board later withdrew the license after learning of the Federal investigation. In late April, Federal agents raided Mr. Edwards's house and office and seized the $400,000.
Federal prosecutors called Mr. DeBartolo's plea "a major development" in their efforts to convict the flamboyant four-term Governor.
"I don't think anyone in their right mind would underestimate the value and significance of Mr. DeBartolo's cooperation," said Eddie J. Jordan Jr., the United States Attorney in New Orleans and the lead prosecutor in the case.
Prosecutors have already told both Edwardses and several other targets of the investigation that they are likely to be indicted. Mr. Jordan declined to say today when those indictments were expected.
Today's plea agreement also raises questions about whether Mr. DeBartolo will regain control of his beloved 49ers, the professional football team he managed until last December, when he stepped down as chairman after prosecutors notified him that he might be indicted.
Mr. DeBartolo said today that he would immediately "start the process of getting my football team back."
But Paul Tagliabue, the league commissioner, said in a statement today that Mr. DeBartolo's plea agreement was not made as part of any arrangement with his office.
"Until our office is able to complete a thorough review of today's agreement and related matters," Mr. Tagliabue said. "I have directed Mr. DeBartolo to continue his current inactive status with respect to both the affairs of the 49ers and the N.F.L."
Several league officials and team owners said today that Mr. Tagliabue would have broad discretion to fine Mr. DeBartolo and suspend him from team activities before allowing him to apply for reinstatement.
The complex Federal investigation, while not limited to Mr. Edwards's dealings with Mr. DeBartolo, is rooted in the intersection of two captivating American families.
Mr. Edwards, a son of Acadiana, revels in his carefully crafted reputation as a high-rolling scoundrel who staged poker games at the Governor's Mansion and proudly reported $308,000 in winnings on his 1995 income tax returns.
Mr. Edwards estimates that he has been investigated by 22 grand juries, and enjoys taunting Federal prosecutors. This investigation, he has said, is simply a reflection of their frustration.
But what makes this investigation different from previous ones is the existence of thousands of hours of wiretap recordings of Mr. Edwards, who has always taken precautions to avoid that hazard.
In his testimony today, Mr. Santini included a snippet of conversation at the Edwardses' law offices in which Stephen Edwards asks his father if he thinks a colleague "could be wired or anything."
"I'll be careful," Edwin Edwards replies.
Mr. DeBartolo grew up in the shadow of his father, Edward DeBartolo Sr. Starting with a strip mall in a Youngstown suburb, the elder DeBartolo built the largest mall development firm in the country, with interests in office towers and horse racing tracks. In 1977, he bought the 49ers for $17 million and turned the team over to his son.
Because the company had holdings in Louisiana, including a racetrack, Mr. Edwards and the elder DeBartolo became fast friends, hunting ducks, sharing meals at the Governor's Mansion, and taking each other to football games.
"They both grew up with nothing and became successful people," said Sid S. Moreland 4th, a former gubernatorial aide to Mr. Edwards. "They had a bond. They clicked."
When Mr. DeBartolo died in 1994, the relationship was bequeathed to his son, but it was not the same.
"Eddie's a completely different animal from his father," Mr. Moreland said. "He'd come to Baton Rouge, but it was like he was there to pay homage to the Governor because his Daddy told him to. His relationship with the Governor was much more formal and stiff than with the old man."
Since his youth, Mr. DeBartolo has had a reputation as being somewhat undisciplined. An enthusiast of both sports and gambling, he opened his wallet for the 49ers. Salaries surpassed those of many teams and players received gifts of Rolex watches. The talented players loved their boss.
After his father died, Mr. DeBartolo formed DeBartolo Entertainment and began to seek a gambling business. He spent millions on unsuccessful gambling initiatives in several states before finding luck in Louisiana. He parlayed a $1,000 investment into a nearly $90 million gain on two riverboats that were sold in 1996. Then he began to pursue the state's final riverboat license, which led him to Mr. Edwards.
Mr. Edwards said today that he would prove his contention that Mr. DeBartolo had simply paid him a legal consulting fee to protect his business interests in Louisiana. He said Mr. DeBartolo never would have been convicted but understood that his former friend cut a deal because "he was scared to death."
Mr. DeBartolo said he was ready to put his Louisiana experience behind him. "This has been a horrendous ordeal," he said, "and I'm just very grateful for where we are today."

HEADLINE: LIBRARY/BLACK-ORIENTED SITES;
For Buppies With a Capital 'P'

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:

WWW.BUPPIE.COM
 THIS site aimed at "buppies" -- black urban professionals -- is not as snooty as it sounds. There is actually a surprising amount of useful information at Buppies on Line. 
 But the site's creators, who use the slogan "Bringing black America together in cyberspace," are mindful of what the first "p" in buppies stands for. A banner on the home page advertises the Buppies Online Resume Databank, a service that allows users to submit and edit their resumes in an on-line database that companies can peruse for potential employees. It's difficult to gauge the databank as a job-searching tool: a feature that would show users a list of participating corporations is not yet running.
The emphasis on professionalism is carried through to other sections of the site. The education page features articles on scholastic software for children and on preparing for college exams. On the sports page however, the professional tone starts to wilt: an article on golf, predicated on the success of Tiger Woods, concludes with an apparently irony-free discussion of how women can pursue promising mates on the links. Acting helpless, according to this article, is a sure tactic: "No self-respecting black man can resist a damsel in distress."
Still, there is plenty of good information on the site, and it is organized in a way that is easy to navigate. There is some lighter stuff here, too, like a list of vacation spots -- bed-and-breakfasts, spas, resorts, -- with black owners and operators, and a calendar of this year's high-profile black college football games that includes useful tourist information for all the games' home cities.
Elsewhere, Buppies on Line tackles headier topics like the question of whether the Social Security reserve should be invested in stocks and bonds in addition to Government securities. Clearly, such topics affect all Americans, but finding them here may increase the likelihood that more African-Americans will read about them.
The flaw here is timeliness. Buppies on Line hasn't been updated since early August, and many of the articles have been out of date much longer than that. The Social Security article, for example, shares the screen with features on subjects that include Jesse Jackson's Wall Street conference (which was held in January), Roger Ferguson Jr.'s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board (which happened last November) and the announcement of an urban renewal program by Robert Reich (before he resigned as Labor Secretary in November 1996).
Even some of the more current information seemed forced into categories that don't quite fit. This past summer, for example, under Issues Affecting Us, there was an article in about President Clinton's top Secret Service agent being forced to testify before the grand jury in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter. First of all, the account never clearly stated whether the agent is black, which is relevant only because the article was included on a black-oriented Web site. More to the point, the site never addressed the issue of how this article would affect African-Americans.
