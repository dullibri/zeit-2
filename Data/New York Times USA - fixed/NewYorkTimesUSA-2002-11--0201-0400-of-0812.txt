HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: HAWAII; 
In the 50th State, the End of the Democrats' 40-Year Streak

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
For only the second time since statehood, a Republican has captured Hawaii's highest office.
 The state Republican chairwoman, Linda Lingle, a former mayor of Maui, won 51 percent of the vote on Tuesday, defeating Lt. Gov. Mazie K. Hirono in a race to succeed Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, who is retiring. 
 The last Republican chief executive here, William F. Quinn, was appointed territorial governor in 1957, became the first elected governor when Hawaii joined the Union in 1959 and served until 1962. Since then, the Democrats had enjoyed an uninterrupted reign, built by their championing plantation workers, other union members and the state's diverse ethnic groups of Asian heritage. 
Political analysts said the victory by Ms. Lingle, 49, signaled rising dissatisfaction that stemmed largely from Democratic scandals and a faltering of Hawaii's economy, Ms. Lingle's appeal as an advocate for change, the growing influence of residents migrating from the mainland and erosion in party loyalty among Japanese, Filipinos and other ethnic groups that have traditionally voted Democratic.
"The old Democratic faithful are getting older, and the younger ones don't know what the faith is," said Dan Boylan, a history professor at the University of Hawaii-West Oahu.
That faith was far from entirely absent, though. The Democrats retained control of the Legislature, even strengthening their hold there in the 51-seat House, where Republican representation dropped to 15 seats from 19 -- below the crucial total of 17 required to wrest bottled-up bills from committee.
The voters also re-elected the state's two representatives to the United States House, both Democrats, including Patsy T. Mink, who died on Sept. 28 after 12 terms in Congress. Special elections will be held on Nov. 30 to fill the remainder of her term, and on Jan. 4 to fill her seat in the 108th Congress.
The candidates for governor, Ms. Lingle and Ms. Hirono, differed only slightly on the issues. Both signaled a desire to improve the public school system and to diversify the economy away from its dependence on tourism.
But Ms. Hirono failed to convince the voters that after 22 years in public office as a member of the governing party, she was up to the task of change.
Ms. Lingle lost to Governor Cayetano in 1998 by fewer than 5,000 votes. This time, analysts said, she had more on her side.
Two weeks before the election, she had spent nearly three times as much as her opponent. The Democrats, meanwhile, had been buffeted by scandal: members of the Honolulu City Council had been convicted of accepting kickbacks and misusing campaign funds, a state senator had pleaded guilty of tax evasion and campaign finance abuses, and the Honolulu mayor, Jeremy Harris, had become a subject of investigation over his campaign fund-raising practices; that inquiry continues.
"People bought the argument that we really do need change and that Mazie is too closely associated with the old-boy network," said Chad Blair, a political science instructor at Hawaii Pacific University. "Lingle convinced them. She almost did four years ago. It means the voters said the Democrats finally failed."

HEADLINE: Anticholesterol Drug Found to Help Paralytic Mice 

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
Experiments in mice suggest that statins, drugs normally used to lower cholesterol, may also prevent or lessen paralysis in people with some forms of multiple sclerosis, researchers are reporting today. 
 But the researchers warned that people with multiple sclerosis should not start taking statins in hopes of fighting the disease. The drugs must still be tested in people for that use. They may or may not work, and could even make the disease worse. 
 "We really urge that patients do wait for the results of clinical trials," said Dr. Scott S. Zamvil, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of California in San Francisco, and the senior author of a report on the research being published today in the journal Nature. Co-authors included researchers from Stanford, led by Dr. Sawsan Youssef and Dr. Lawrence Steinman.
Dr. Zamvil said the research team hoped to begin tests next year in people with very early signs of the disease; the patients will be given Lipitor, the statin used in the mice.
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society also said patients should wait. Dr. Stephen Reingold, the society's vice president for research programs, praised Dr. Zamvil's study, but, he added, "As attractive as it may be, there is no data to support the use of statins in multiple sclerosis" in people.
Dr. Reingold and other researchers said that some patients with multiple sclerosis were already taking statins because they also had high cholesterol. But no one knows whether the statins are affecting their multiple sclerosis. 
Dr. Reingold said that normally, a mouse study would not receive a great deal of attention because such studies are considered an early phase of research. But in this case, he said, interest is high for several reasons. Statins are already on the market, and if they work, patients will welcome them, because existing treatments for multiple sclerosis are only moderately effective and must be injected several times a week, whereas statins come in pill form. 
Although statins were approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for lowering cholesterol, doctors could legally prescribe them now for patients with multiple sclerosis. Once a drug is approved for one use, doctors can prescribe it for others. 
The drug's manufacturer, however, is not allowed to label or promote the drug for a new use unless it goes through a new approval process.
A spokeswoman for Pfizer, which makes Lipitor, said she could not say "definitively" whether the company would seek approval for a new use of Lipitor if clinical trials showed it worked for multiple sclerosis. Lipitor is already the No. 1 selling drug in the world, with sales of $7 billion in 2001, according to IMS Health, which tracks the drug industry.
Pfizer did not pay for Dr. Zamvil's study, but did give him a $100,000 grant after the study was finished. His study was paid for by the National Institutes of Health, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and private foundations. 
About 300,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis. It affects nerves in the spinal cord and brain, and can cause weakness, paralysis, fatigue, cognitive problems and vision loss. Symptoms may come and go, and vary from mild to severe. The disease is not fatal.
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder, in which the body fights its own tissues as if they were foreign. In this case, the target tissue is myelin, a fatty substance that coats nerve fibers. Cells in the immune system attack myelin, causing inflammation.
Researchers thought statins might help because studies had shown that the drugs, in addition to lowering cholesterol, could reduce inflammation. To test that theory, they used strains of mice in which they induced a disease much like multiple sclerosis. The mouse disease is considered a good model of multiple sclerosis, but not perfect: some drugs that have worked in the mice have also worked in people, but others have not, and some proved harmful. 
The researchers gave Lipitor to small groups of mice, from 7 to 14 animals, with different forms of the disease, to see if the drug could prevent or treat relapses. 
"The majority of the mice had markedly lessened paralysis," Dr. Zamvil said.
"These drugs have to be given under very careful medical supervision," Dr. Steinman said. Side effects can include liver abnormalities and muscle damage.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP; 
As Party Discontent Swirls, Gephardt Leaves a Top Spot

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, who has struggled for eight years to return the Democrats to power in the House, will step down as minority leader, a senior aide said tonight.
 Mr. Gephardt's decision comes a day after his party suffered a pivotal defeat at the polls, losing at least five House seats and the control of the Senate. The loss had caused open discontent among Democratic members with his leadership, and even his supporters said he would have to choose between running for president and leading the House Democratic caucus. 
 Mr. Gephardt's aide said his boss has not yet decided on his presidential plans. But Mr. Gephardt's regular visits to New Hampshire and Iowa, and his eagerness in raising money, have led many Democrats to assume he will be a candidate in 2004. Mr. Gephardt never intended to try to run for president while serving as leader, the aide said, but several Democratic members said his staff had made some preliminary calls today to sound out members on the possibility of doing both.
The leadership vacancy will create an immediate struggle for succession among different factions of the party, and two of the leading candidates began jockeying for position today. Representative Martin Frost of Texas, the chairman of the Democratic Caucus and a political centrist, issued a statement announcing his candidacy. Mr. Frost's spokesman, Tom Eisenhauer, said the party needed to take note of the nation's shift to the right in Tuesday's election and not select a leader from the party's left wing.
He was referring to the other leading candidate for the position, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic whip, who also issued a statement announcing her intention to run. To win back the House in 2004, Ms. Pelosi said, the Democrats need to draw clear distinctions between their plans and those of the Republican Party.
Mr. Gephardt's aides said the congressman, who has represented a St. Louis district since 1977, spent the day discussing his future with his wife in their Washington townhouse. 
On Tuesday night, as he made his way around the hotel ballroom here, Mr. Gephardt clearly had a sense that his political hopes, both personally and for his caucus, had crumbled. His smile seemed mirthless and frozen for the local television cameras as he refused to give up hope, but he acknowledged in an interview that the Democrats could not compete with President Bush's popularity on security issues.
"Clearly voters are worried about security," Mr. Gephardt said. "Clearly the president and the Republicans have dominated that issue, in part because he's the president now. And he's trying to address those issues, as he should, and people are worried." 
He said his party's economic message was lost amid the special-interest cash that poured into the Republican coffers, citing in particular the contributions from the pharmaceutical industry that countered the Democratic platform of creating a prescription drug benefit under Medicare.
But many Democratic representatives have begun to express concern that the loss was not entirely due to external factors, and today several disappointed Democrats began openly suggesting that it might be time for someone else to lead them out of exile.
"When you get beat as bad as we've been beat, you've got to look at everything, including the management," said Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York. "We've tried and tried for years and the old plays aren't working. The Mets fired Bobby Valentine because it was the best thing for the team, and now I think we've got to consider some similar big changes without worrying about anyone's feelings."
Several members said that Mr. Gephardt could not lead the caucus if he decided to pursue his presidential ambitions.
"It would be irresponsible of him to do both, both for the caucus and for America," said Peter Deutsch, a Florida representative. "It's been obvious for months that he's planning to run for president, and his staff right now is making calls to see whether there would be support for him to do that and remain as leader. I can tell you that the universal response he's gotten is that he cannot do both."
Mr. Gephardt ran for president in 1988, and was battered in the Super Tuesday primary of March, winning only his home state of Missouri. His message at the time was one of economic nationalism, urging a halt to what he said were unfair trading practices of other countries, but his stump speeches never caught fire with voters and he suffered a chronic shortage of cash.
His party has picked up seats during several of the election cycles of his leadership tenure, but control of the House has been firmly in Republican hands since 1994. He retains a great deal of support among the Democrats, and there was little doubt that if he chose not to run for president, he would have easily been re-elected as minority leader. 
"The notion of blaming him for what happened last night is utterly simplistic and unjustified," said Representative Howard L. Berman of California. "There were a lot of broad national and local trends at work, and it's important to remember that this is a guy who's given every waking hour for years to help the Democrats regain control. He's tried as hard as he possibly could."
Mr. Gephardt angered more liberal members of his party last month by signing on to President Bush's version of a resolution to authorize military force in Iraq. Some members said they wished he had more forcefully spoken out against the Bush administration's tax cut in the campaign, while others said the Democrats were simply in need of a fresh face at the helm.
"In the private sector, if you brought in results like Dick's, you probably would have been fired or relieved of your duties a while ago," said Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee, a frequent critic of Mr. Gephardt. "I think it's time to introduce some new faces and new ideas into the leadership ranks."

HEADLINE: Corporations Revise Wish Lists; 
Republican Victory Sets Stage for Pro-Business Agenda

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
Waking to a new power configuration in Washington yesterday, business leaders began to revise their wish lists for action on contentious issues like taxes, health care costs, personal-injury lawsuits and the ability of government employees to strike.
 "This historic election sets the stage for aggressive action" on a pro-business agenda, said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. He listed the association's top goals as expanded tax cuts, a new law governing terrorism insurance, a prescription drug policy for the elderly and a resolution of asbestos-related lawsuits that have hurt the stock prices of manufacturers and prompted numerous companies to seek protection in bankruptcy court. 
 Other business leaders and executives, when asked what they most hoped the new Republican majorities in both House and Senate would be able to accomplish for American business, cited the swift passage of terrorism insurance rules, a lessening of environmental regulations and a bankruptcy law that will make it more difficult for people to escape their debts. 
Many also foresaw a more receptive climate for new limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and punitive damages awards. Lester Brickman, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School, recalled that President Bush gained popularity in Texas as "a direct outcome of the largely successful tort reform efforts," and would be emboldened by the Republican victories.
"I expect he will now elevate tort reform to a more forward position in his domestic political agenda," Professor Brickman said.
Perhaps so as not to jinx things, or perhaps so as not to appear to be gloating at the successes of the party that has traditionally represented business interests, most of the executives and business leaders interviewed stressed that the Republicans' majorities are slender. Even now, they said, they were not sure American business would achieve its most important goals.
"We're still going to have a very divided government," said John W. Snow, chief executive of the CSX Corporation and former chairman of the Business Roundtable, an elite group of the chief executives of large companies. 
Business leaders and their opponents in Washington agreed that if the Republicans overreach in their zeal to advance a pro-business agenda, they risk a strong protest. Public sentiment is still running high for shareholders and low for executives, they pointed out. That made some think there would not be any effort to rein in shareholder lawsuits, even though many corporate executives complain about them.
Nor are there widespread expectations of a rollback in recent legislation to hold executives and directors more accountable.
"I think that some people in business would like to weaken the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, but that is not going to happen," said Damon Silvers, associate general counsel at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., referring to one such corporate-accountability law. "Attempts to roll it back would hit a wall."
Despite their reservations, business leaders saw an advantage in having Republicans controlling Congressional committees, and therefore the legislative agenda.
R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that with a Republican replacing Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, as chairman of the Senate labor and human resources committee, managers might now hope for new wage-and-hour laws, legislation promoting the use of arbitration instead of lawsuits, and an end to new rules governing retirement benefits.
"I think they'll still be introduced, but now we'll be better positioned to block them," he said.
Mr. Snow said he thought the greatest boon to business would be the Bush administration's ability to name federal judges and regulatory officials without an extended fight in the Senate. "I'm a Republican," he said. "I'm glad the Senate is in the hands of the Republicans. I feel more comfortable with that.
"But the country's still divided on health care, on education, on policies for the elderly," he added. "There are still major fights, and the underlying political divisions in the country are still not resolved."

An Even Stronger Tie to Washington

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
Detroit had considerable influence in Washington even before the election, and that will only become stronger now. Andrew H. Card Jr., the president's chief of staff, served as General Motors' top lobbyist in the 1990's, for example, and carmakers have a bipartisan coalition of Congressional allies made up of Republicans and Midwestern Democrats in auto-manufacturing states. 
 With Democrats like John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and the longest serving member of the House, leading the charge, the auto industry had little trouble winning legislative battles even before Republicans gained control of the Senate. 
 The biggest recent victory came last March, when Congress killed a proposal to increase fuel-economy standards, which had not been significantly raised since the 1980's. Meanwhile, the popularity of sport utility vehicles has pushed the gas consumption of the average automobile to a 20-year high, making the issue hugely important to environmental groups like the Sierra Club.
Still on the table as part of the energy bill are tax credits for consumers who buy vehicles that use fuel-efficient technologies like hybrid gas-electric engines. Carmakers want credits worth up to $4,000 for all types of vehicles that use such technologies. Some Democrats objected to offering credits to owners of pickup trucks and S.U.V.'s, saying that it is counterproductive to give an incentive to buy vehicles that guzzle gas, even if they do use the newer technologies.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the group would "stay on the course" toward the full range of tax incentives. DANNY HAKIM

Additional Cuts To Revive Growth

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Several business groups said their biggest concern was getting tax cuts that stimulate economic growth, while holding down government spending to avoid structural budget deficits that would persist even after the economy recovers.
 "We are most interested in a stimulus package," said R. Bruce Josten of the United States Chamber of Commerce. 
 He called for increasing the amount that businesses can write off immediately for investments in capital equipment, to $50,000 from the current $22,500.
The White House has already said it would seek to make permanent the tax cuts that Congress adopted last year; they are now scheduled to end in 2011. A revision of the estate tax, more breaks for retirement savings plans, greater deductibility for investment losses and other tax issues also are on the president's agenda, and they will receive a warmer reception in a Senate controlled by the Republicans.

Tablet PC's: Computing Drawn Anew

BYLINE:  By David Pogue; E-mail: Pogue@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CONTRARY to popular belief, Microsoft isn't the 800-pound gorilla of the computer industry; it's the 800-pound pit bull. However mediocre its first attempt at something -- be it Windows, palmtops or online services -- the company doggedly plugs away, spending whatever years and dollars are needed to make its inventions successful. 
 The latest example of Microsoft's tenacity is a computer design called the Tablet PC, which it officially unveiled today. (Computers based on this design, from Compaq, Acer, Toshiba, Fujitsu and other companies will go on sale in the coming weeks.) It's the latest expression of a long-running Microsoft fantasy: a future world in which you'll write directly on the screen of your PC with a plastic-tipped pen. You'll take handwritten notes, mark up documents right on the screen and capture doodles on the digital equivalent of cocktail napkins. 
Pen computing, as this concept is known, has been catnip to investors and inventors for years, but Silicon Valley is strewn with the corpses of famous disasters. Microsoft's own WinPad and Windows CE devices were expensive flops. The GridPad and the Go Corporation's Eo are distant memories. Apple's Newton rests in pieces. As recently as this year, the innovative I.B.M. TransNote and the Sony Vaio Slimtop Pen Tablet slipped quietly into oblivion. 
But Microsoft is confident that this time, it has found the formula for pen-computing success. So confident, in fact, that Bill Gates told a recent trade show crowd, "Within five years, I predict it will be the most popular form of PC sold in America."
A key reason for its confidence is that instead of some home-grown operating system, these new machines run something called Windows XP Tablet PC Edition -- an enhanced version of Windows XP Professional that runs any Windows program. 
And in hopes of avoiding the ridicule heaped on Apple's Newton, Microsoft emphasizes that handwriting recognition isn't an important aspect of the Tablet PC. A keyboard is standard equipment. 
That statement may surprise anyone who, upon hearing the term Tablet PC, imagines a clipboard-shaped computer. Where would the keyboard go? 
As it turns out, only some Tablet PC's are actually tablets; these machines, which include the Compaq TC1000, Fujitsu Stylistic ST4000 and Motion M1200, come with separate or detachable keyboards. Other models, including the Toshiba Portege and the Acer TravelMate C100, look at first like traditional laptops. When you don't need to type, you can rotate the screen 180 degrees away from you and fold it back down over the keyboard. That makes a double-thickness slab, its touch-sensitive surface exposed and ready for handwriting. 
The screen responds only to the touch of a special magnetic-tipped stylus. You're free to rest your hand on the screen as you write, without worrying that your flesh will trigger random "mouse clicks." On the other hand, this arrangement doesn't allow you to use your fingernail or a toothpick in a pinch, as you can with a Palm organizer. If you misplace that stylus, your expensive touch screen goes numb.
Writing on the screen is fun. Still, it's not as satisfying as paper. Your work is frequently interrupted by the unwanted appearance of Windows shortcut menus, thanks to the unfortunate location of the "right mouse button" -- a switch on the pen shaft -- precisely where your fingers naturally grip. You miss the traction of real paper, too; trying to write on glass is like trying to pole vault on ice. 
The brightest spot of the Tablet PC is a new note-taking program called Windows Journal. It displays a photorealistic picture of lined writing paper, which you can fill with your own scrawl. After taking notes, you can move blocks of handwriting around, delete them or even format them in colors or "boldface" (fattened penstrokes). 
Incredibly, you can even search your entire "note pad" for certain words, even if you wrote them sideways in the margin or upside-down. That feature alone is so useful and smart, you almost start to believe Microsoft's assertion that there's no good reason to convert your notes into typed text. 
Then reality sinks in. Text didn't become the world's most popular electronic format by accident. For most people, typing is far faster than handwriting. Text is universally readable, too, which is more than you can say for a lot of handwriting. Text can be edited, checked for spelling, reflowed, formatted, copied, pasted, e-mailed and reused. To share your handwritten Tablet PC notes with other people, by contrast, you must export them as TIFF graphics files or Web pages, or ask your colleagues to download a free Journal viewer that Microsoft intends to put on its Web site. Neither approach will win you brownie points at the office. 
Typed text is also a global standard because almost every program understands it. But for the moment, only a handful of programs accept Tablet PC-style handwriting. For example, Tablet PC owners can download a free software add-on that lets them add handwritten comments in Microsoft Office programs. 
This Office Pack, as it's called, lets Outlook send handwritten e-mail -- an intriguing novelty. True, your recipients won't be able to search your correspondence, sort it or copy its contents, because your message is sent as an attached graphic. (In fact, recipients whose e-mail programs don't display graphics won't see your note at all.) Still, handwriting can add a whole new intimacy to e-mail, expressing personality in a way that typed text can't touch. 
On the other hand, Microsoft missed a big boat in the Word component of the Office Pack. You can't simply mark up a Word document with circles, arrows and crossout lines, as a proofreader might with a red pen. You can do that in PowerPoint, and you can import a Word file into Windows Journal as a frozen graphic and mark it up there. But in Word itself, your handwriting is confined to square boxes in the margins.
This handful of ink-enabled programs will get you only so far. You'll eventually want to enter text into some of the 10,000 other Windows programs, which means that you'll have to use handwriting recognition after all.
To use the Tablet PC's "write into any program" feature, you begin by calling up a floating window called the Tablet Input Panel. After you write a few words into it and pause, a typed interpretation of what you wrote is "typed" into your document. 
If your script or printing is very neat, the handwriting recognition is often accurate -- but often, "often" isn't good enough. The errors are tiny but infuriating, the tsetse flies of Windows: "I'll see you next week" becomes "Jill see you next weeks," and "This software is terrific" becomes "this software is trifle."
Each mistaken transcription, botched punctuation mark and improperly capitalized word forces you into an excruciating spasm of touch-screen microsurgery. Time ticks by as you try to correct the first transcription problem without introducing new ones. There's no way, furthermore, to input a word in all caps, as in "We LOVE computers," using this panel; such attempts come out lowercase.
A Microsoft spokesman admitted that even he doesn't bother entering text like e-mail and Web addresses using handwriting -- he uses the keyboard. On the laptop-shaped Tablet PC's, that's not such a problem. But if you have a slab-shaped model, you have to summon the miniature on-screen keyboard, whose keys you painstakingly tap with your pen. This is progress?
The Tablet PC offers rudimentary speech-recognition software, too. It requires a headset microphone (not included), a keyboard to correct the transcription, the tolerance of co-workers within listening range, and the patience of Job.
I tried out five Tablet PC models: two slab-style machines with optional docking stations (the Motion and the Fujitsu), two laptops with rotating displays (the Acer and the Toshiba), and an ingenious hybrid from Compaq. (It's a slab with a keyboard that hugs its back. You can rotate the keyboard through space until it locks into standard laptop position -- or remove it entirely.)
They're nice-looking, lightweight machines with some neat features. For example, you can rotate the screen image 90 degrees with the touch of a button. In fact, when the Compaq and Motion tablets are in their docking stands, the screen image rotates automatically when you rotate the tablet itself. 
On the other hand, every Tablet PC lacks serial ports and parallel ports, many have undersized screens (10.4 inches), and CD or DVD drives are generally external components you have to carry separately. To reduce heat and extend battery life, most of these devices incorporate cool-running but slowish processors. 
The slab designs work well in the office; you can pop one off of its dock (a $250 or $300 extra) and run to a meeting without having to shut the machine down. Yet you shouldn't consider one as a replacement for a standard laptop; strange as it may sound, it's a hassle to take these tablets on the road. Not only are there so many pieces to carry (slab, keyboard, external CD drive, power cord), but the delicate screen is exposed in transit. Add a padded slipcover to your equipment list.
The clamshell designs and the Compaq hybrid are more practical, because they're full-fledged laptops that become slabs only when necessary. Trouble is, most cost $2,200 and up --much more than comparably equipped, non-Tablet PC laptops. You're paying about $500 extra for that touch screen. (Compaq took a different economic tack. Its TC1000 costs only $1,700, about the same as a normal laptop--but the Transmeta processor isn't especially frisky, and the screen is disappointingly dim and grainy.)
Make no mistake: a touch screen can be a useful enhancement. You can use a Tablet PC standing up -- not something people do every day, to be sure, but handy in certain lines of work. Tablet PC-compatible drawing and sketching programs like Corel Grafigo and Alias SketchBook offer the unparalleled pleasure of drawing directly on the screen. (On models except the inexpensive Compaq, you get a fatter line the harder you bear down with the pen.) And for people who take handwritten notes in meetings but never need to pass them on, Windows Journal could be an attractive alternative.
But these are isolated perks for isolated situations: insurance investigations, graduate school classes, hospital rounds, package delivery, and so on. For everything else, writing on the screen is primarily a novelty, an expensive piece of demo ware that introduces pointless barriers to many tasks that would be swift and simple on a traditional laptop. Especially in this economy, it doesn't seem likely that the masses will beat a path to Microsoft's door, grateful to pay a $500 premium for the opportunity.
Meanwhile, Microsoft faces a tough competitor, the dominant player in the business-meeting note-taking market. It's a rugged, crashproof portable that accommodates any writing implement, feels just like paper and costs .02 percent of a Tablet PC. If it's prestige you're after, you can even tell your friends that it has a fancy name: Windows XP Legal Pad Edition.

HEADLINE: Bush's Validation Day 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The re-election of the president's brother in Florida was the test Democrats chose to weaken George W. Bush's political clout. Bill Clinton and Al Gore stumped against Jeb Bush; Clinton's Democratic National Committee boss poured in millions. The Bush brothers greeted the personal challenge with enthusiasm.
 Jeb Bush won big; George W. won even bigger. In Florida and all across the country, the president laid his high ratings on the line to give national meaning to local elections. Had his party in the White House suffered the usual midterm losses in Congress and statehouses, Democrats would have said he had been repudiated. The opposite happened; his gutsy gamble paid off, and Bush's 2000 victory was resoundingly validated. 
 I was rooting for a shake-up of Congress, with control of both houses switching and a check on executive power maintained. But the change to G.O.P. leadership in the Senate -- with today's primacy of foreign affairs and judicial appointment -- was central. And the strange thing happened: the close Senate races did not average out but broke mostly one way, this time to Republicans. 
What message will Democrats take from Bush's validation day? G.O.P. partisans fervently hope defeated Democrats will say "No more Mr. Nice Guy," angrily return to class-war, peacenik principles and oppose Bush on the liberation of Iraq and on tax cuts, including the "death tax." However, the Clintons -- with control of the purse strings -- will likely keep their party on the moderate middle-road message of me-too. 
What will Republicans do with the across-the-board power position they have not had since Eisenhower's time? We can expect a surge of interest in "affordable health care," specifically an entitlement for prescription drugs that Democrats have blocked as not generous enough. 
In that connection, we can hope to see payback time for the trial lawyers who are the Democrats' chief source of big bucks. In return, politicians of the left have made possible huge payments to individual plaintiffs, with a large cut to their lawyers, thereby driving up medical insurance costs. Under New Bush, tort reform should be on the way. 
Partisan unionists who have jerked the chains of grateful politicians on homeland security legislation, demanding civil service protection from firing, will find fewer obstructionists beholden to them in powerful committee positions. Same with the Democratic teachers' unions opposing reformist education ideas: conservatives are still smarting at Bush's abandonment of vouchers in order to get any bill at all.
What about the underlying promise of the 2002 campaign -- that the U.S., with or without the backing of Russia and France in the U.N., would force Saddam Hussein out of office before he can blackmail us not only with germ and poison-gas weapons but with nuclear bombs? 
As Election Day drew near, Bush's tone grew more dovish. Colin Powell further watered down our already weakened resolution in the U.N. and the president began to waffle, allowing as how "regime change" didn't mean Saddam's removal, but merely a change in his weapons-development practices. 
If Bush permits the invasion winter to go by, as Saddam employs his sophisticated form of rope-a-dope with inspectors often fooled before, it would occur to Democrats that summerlong invasion posturing was a device to distract media attention from the economy. A charge of "phony war talk" would become a rallying issue. 
And should Iraq's regime remain unchanged -- a secret arsenal of terror ostensibly cooperating with inspections ("Gee, were we building that? It must be a rogue operation") -- then hard-liners as well as Wilsonian idealists will see themselves betrayed. They would hold the midterm referendum on Bush to have been won on spurious grounds; a multilateral wimpout would have been more honestly conducted by dovish Democrats.
Thus does the new political dominance focus responsibility. The Republican triad of president, speaker and majority leader has no excuse for failing to deliver. The opposition must conceive and articulate contrary views. The press is charged more than ever to investigate and expose. 
About the media: Thanks to a massive glitch, its audience was treated to election returns without a frenzy of early projections based on maybe-right exit polls. Viewers tasted a delicious throwback to reality numbers. Is this a great country or what?

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Bush Facing 2 Challenges: S.E.C. Choice And Economy

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
President Bush led his party to a stunning midterm election victory despite a series of daunting economic problems that might have been expected to produce the opposite result.
 The stock market fell more after his inauguration than during any similar period since the Hoover administration. The economy lost more than two million private-sector jobs, and investor confidence plunged amid corporate scandals that reminded some of the 1930's. 
 Even as the president was celebrating the election results on Tuesday night, his choice as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission was resigning and the Federal Reserve was preparing to cut interest rates to the lowest levels in decades. Both moves reflected worries that the situation was significantly worse than it appeared only a few months ago. 
Now a victorious president confronts a question most commonly asked by presidents who have suffered severe midterm election rebuffs: What will it take to get things back on track before he seeks re-election in two years?
In the economy, it is clear that the Federal Reserve's contributions to stimulus are coming to an end. After cutting the key interest rate it administers to 1.25 percent, the lowest since John F. Kennedy was in the White House, it indicated it did not expect to cut rates again soon. In any case, it cannot cut rates much further.
"It makes sense for the Fed to act very aggressively when it doesn't have much ammunition left," said Bill Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs. "But we shouldn't kid ourselves that this makes everything all right."
If further stimulus is needed for the economy, the Fed's situation makes it all the more likely that the burden will rest on fiscal policy. There is a widespread expectation that Mr. Bush will look for more tax cuts, while concentrating spending increases on the military and fighting terrorism. With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, there is every reason to think he will get much of what he wants.
But his first challenge will be naming a new S.E.C. chairman to replace Harvey L. Pitt, who resigned on Tuesday night. Mr. Pitt is widely viewed as having botched the appointment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, whose chairman, William H. Webster, is facing an investigation of his role as chairman of the audit committee of U.S. Technologies and is involved in a "who said what" dispute with the company's former auditor -- a firm that the new board will regulate.
Names of potential S.E.C. chairmen circulated widely yesterday, but there was no indication that any of them met with the approval of Mr. Bush, who must decide which constituency to appease in making an appointment that will be scrutinized.
When Mr. Pitt was chosen, it was reported that other candidates had been blocked because they were viewed as too eager to impose new regulations. That, of course, was before scandals at Enron and WorldCom led to passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, which established the new accounting regulator and called for a series of new regulations.
A new chairman, if chosen quickly, will have to decide what to do about the accounting oversight board. That will involve choosing a new chairman if Mr. Webster steps down, as many expect he will do, or it will involve deciding whether to ask Mr. Webster to do so. To lure a new, high-quality chairman, it might be necessary to offer that person some choice in whether other board members should also leave.
In choosing a new chairman, Mr. Bush may have wider latitude because the confirmation will be up to a Senate controlled by his party. But any choice comes with risks. Choosing a tough prosecutor would no doubt win public acclaim, but if that person knows little about securities laws it could be a major handicap.
"You want someone who is technically proficient," said Joel Seligman, the dean of the Washington University law school in St. Louis and a historian of the S.E.C. "This is a very hard job to learn."
Indeed, the S.E.C. faces major issues in many areas, ranging from the structure of securities markets to reforming the way research is done.
Mr. Seligman pointed to the 1973 appointment of Ray Garrett Jr., a highly respected securities lawyer, after his predecessor, G. Bradford Cook, was forced out as a result of a scandal that made his honesty suspect. "That is the kind of person you want, probably someone with an accomplished career in securities law, someone who will be a healer and a consensus builder," Mr. Seligman said. (Mr. Garrett's executive assistant when he was chairman was a young lawyer named Pitt.) 
But any lawyer who had represented a wide variety of clients would also face questions of conflicts of interest, as followed Mr. Pitt in his first year in office. To others, it is important to avoid such questions.
With the S.E.C. having been politicized to an extent that is unusual in its past, with Democrats having called for Mr. Pitt's ouster and voiced suspicions that he was doing the White House's bidding in opposing one candidate for the accounting board, there is clearly a case to be made for a chairman who does not appear to have strong political ties or leanings. Some wonder whether a veteran commission staff member, like Steven Cutler, the director of enforcement, might have a chance.
On the economy, Mr. Bush may need to decide quickly whether to change any members of his economic team. He will also have to decide whether to propose large block grants for the states, whose fiscal problems will probably get more attention now that the election is over and the winners must confront large deficits that -- unlike the federal one -- must be closed somehow. To do so would increase the federal deficit, but to not come to the aid of the states would run the risk of their budgets acting as a severe drag on the economy in coming months.
The results of those decisions will become clear only over the next couple of years. But by then, they could have a major impact on whether Mr. Bush can win a second term.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE AGENDA; 
Republicans Have Edge, But Passing Bush's Plans May Require Compromise

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
Winning control of the Senate will clearly help Republicans pass some of President Bush's legislation, but how much will depend on when and how Democrats choose to fight.
 Mr. Bush campaigned long and hard not only for Republican candidates, but also for several measures that Senate Democrats have stalled, like a Homeland Security Department, where he could override Civil Service rules, and the Republican version of prescription-drug legislation. 
 The first test may come, even this month in the lame-duck session, over the domestic security legislation. Some Democrats expected their colleagues to quit insisting on civil service protections for workers, but others said that was unlikely. 
A major effort next year will come when Mr. Bush seeks to make permanent the tax cuts enacted in 2001. 
They are set to expire in 2011. But while some tax cuts can be enacted with 51 votes, under Senate rules permanent changes will require 60. That would mean assembling some Democratic supporters, too, and that would almost certainly require concessions from the Republicans, like an extension of unemployment benefits.
On these and other issues, having the presidency and both houses of Congress could make the Republicans insist on having their way down to the last detail. But it could also offer a reason for compromise. When Mr. Bush runs for re-election in 2004, he will want a record including more domestic accomplishment than he has recorded so far. President Bill Clinton and the Republican-led Congress compromised in 1996, and both won re-election.
One obvious opportunity for compromise is a prescription drug benefit for the elderly. House Republicans have repeatedly passed bills with a large role for insurance companies. 
Their Senate allies have blocked Democratic efforts to run the program through Medicare. But if he wants an accomplishment to run on, Mr. Bush may have to deal with centrist senators and their ideas of compromise.
At a White House briefing, Ari Fleischer, the press secretary, took a cautiously optimistic tone yesterday. "I think there's no question that last night's results increased the likelihood of getting things done for the American people," Mr. Fleischer said.
But the numbers alone cannot make that true. With their new majority of 51 or 52 senators (depending on the Louisiana runoff), Republicans can propose a legislative agenda, and they can control committees. But these days, no one can control the Senate. Almost any remotely controversial bill must overcome a potential filibuster, and that takes 60 votes.
Instead, political realities could persuade Democrats to go along. The historic dimension of Republicans' recapturing the Senate and increasing their majority in the House might convince the new Senate minority that the nation demands action, even acquiescence.
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said yesterday that Democrats should seriously fear the consequences if they instinctively fight the president time after time.
"How often do they want to be seen as the obstructionist party?" Mr. Gingrich asked. "Can 'no' be their only answer?"
Senate Democrats were still licking their wounds yesterday and had not begun developing a strategy. But even Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, who is known for preferring accommodation to confrontation, said he doubted that many of his Democratic colleagues would surrender to the president.
Indeed, after the bitterness of the election, Mr. Breaux said, "some might be a little less likely to help."
One Senate aide pointed out that Democrats had taken worse beatings, in 1980 and 1994, and so were not shattered by Tuesday's results.
Democrats, no longer facing an imminent election, could also push some legislative measures of their own or fight to increase spending in such areas as education. They might try that this month. And without the obligation of trying to hold everyone from Paul Wellstone to Zell Miller together on an issue, Senator Tom Daschle may find the role of minority leader easier than that of majority leader.
"It's easier to play defense," one Democratic aide said.
But the initiative will lie with the Republicans. They may try again to authorize oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, though there is little reason to think they could break the filibuster that would certainly be mounted. Fifty-one votes will also be enough to confirm many judicial nominations that would be buried in committee under the Democrats. But that certainly does not apply to a conservative Supreme Court nominee, whom Democrats would feel obliged to filibuster.
The partisan gridlock of this fall had many legislative casualties, including reauthorization of the 1996 welfare law, a model of Clinton-Republican cooperation. The House passed legislation to renew the law, but a Senate Finance Committee approach never came to a vote. Democrats want more money for child care than Mr. Bush has proposed, and they also want more credit given for education and training to satisfy the minimum work requirements in the law. 
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who is about to resume his old role as majority leader, said yesterday: "So much of what we need to do is obvious. Just take the list of what we didn't get done this year, and we need to work on those. We need to have a budget, to begin with. We need pension reform, welfare reform. We need to do more in education. Let's quit talking about doing something for low-income elderly that need prescription drugs. Let's look at what we can do to target some tax cuts that would help the economy. Let's have fiscal restraint. Let's begin to get control on the spending."
But Mr. Lott also acknowledged that it would take a while. He said: "The Senate was designed by our forefathers to be very slow and difficult to move. And boy, they succeeded."

Victory, and Challenges

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

 BODY:
Like Ronald Reagan, who was underestimated by those who saw him only as a superficial actor, President Bush is often taken too lightly by opponents preoccupied by his mangled syntax and his seemingly shaky grasp of issues. That is less likely to happen after Tuesday.
 The Republican victories in the midterm elections were remarkable in historical context. No other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934 has seen his party gain ground in the Senate and the House two years into his first term. Mr. Bush and his chief strategist, Karl Rove, devised a closing campaign blitz-krieg for the president that paid dividends, especially in the party's Southern stronghold. 
 Still, the Republican pickups in the House were relatively small, and in the Senate the entire margin of control was provided by narrow victories in a pair of races where the Democrats fielded replacement candidates -- in Minnesota, where former Vice President Walter F. Mondale stood in for Paul Wellstone, who was killed in a plane crash last month, and in Missouri, where Senator Jean Carnahan, who was seeking to fill out the rest of the term won by her husband, Mel, killed in a similar accident two years ago.
In a CBS News poll taken on the eve of the voting, only 27 percent of voters said their Congressional votes would be cast in support of Mr. Bush. The majority, 55 percent, said the president would be no factor in their voting, and 15 percent said they would be voting against him. But if Mr. Bush favorably influenced a quarter of the electorate, that was a lot, especially in a hard-fought campaign.
How much Mr. Bush will be able to achieve on Capitol Hill remains to be seen. On many issues, party lines do not hold, as Senator Tom Daschle found to his regret, and the president has few votes to spare. Sixty votes, not 52 or 53, often constitute real working control in the Senate.
Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, hoping soon again to be the majority leader, gave much of the credit for Republican victories to Mr. Bush. "He put his prestige on the line," Mr. Lott said yesterday, "and I believe it made a huge difference in the election."
Trying to sound brave in the face of a stinging defeat, Mr. Daschle said yesterday of himself and his fellow Democrats: "We're not going away just because we lost. We're going to fight on for our beliefs."
But with a popular Republican in the White House, and Republicans sitting atop slim yet solid majorities in both chambers of Congress, who is to lead the fight for Democrats? From what power base? On what set of issues? Those were the most important questions facing the Democrats in the wake of their electoral failure Tuesday. There were no quick, easy answers.
Mr. Bush's successes in the election underscored a leadership vacuum within the Democratic Party in which its leaders in Washington may once again lose influence to newcomers at the state level.
Mr. Daschle was defended as an accomplished leader yesterday by Mr. Mondale. But recriminations were rife within the party, with many well-known figures questioning Mr. Daschle's decision to oppose Mr. Bush's plan for a Department of Homeland Security, which enabled Mr. Bush to build a campaign on the theme of national defense. That approach paid dividends in Georgia, among other places, where Representative Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, unseated Senator Max Cleland, who had voted against Mr. Bush.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, who is expected to relinquish his job as House minority leader, said that rekindled memories of Sept. 11 and the prospect of war in Iraq made it impossible for the Democrats' economic message to be heard. But that message was never very clear, if only because many Democratic incumbents supported the president's huge tax-cut package last year.
The outcome significantly weakened the presidential prospects of both Mr. Daschle and Mr. Gephardt in 2004, top Democratic handicappers said. Mr. Daschle is likely to hold onto his leadership post within the party; no challengers are currently in sight. He can take some solace from the fact that he apparently won his proxy battle with Mr. Bush in South Dakota, where Senator Tim Johnson, a close Daschle associate, eked out an exceedingly narrow victory, perhaps subject to recount, over the president's handpicked candidate, Representative John Thune. But the loss of the Senate is a dubious presidential credential.
As for Mr. Gephardt, he is widely expected by his colleagues to give up the leadership to devote more time to a second run for the White House. But quite apart from the fact that House members have historically found it difficult to win nomination for the presidency, Mr. Gephardt will carry an additional burden: for two years, he put all his chips into an ultimately futile bid to recapture the House, and he will shoulder some of the blame.
Another Democratic loser was Terry McAuliffe, the party's national chairman. Mr. McAuliffe was derided yesterday by New York Democrats who said he undermined the party's nominee for governor, H. Carl McCall, by publicly stating that he had withheld funds from the McCall campaign because he doubted the Democrat could win. Mr. McAuliffe is also linked to former President Bill Clinton, whose centrist policies, once highly successful, are now seen as a handicap to a party in need of a better-defined identity.
Although former Vice President Al Gore, the party's presidential nominee in 2000, could point to few achievements in Tuesday's results, he was singled out by disgruntled Democrats for the aggressive way in which he sounded the party's economic message during the campaign. If he chooses to run for president in 2004, he now looks like a slightly more formidable contender for the nomination.
But much of the leadership for the Democrats will have to come from their big-state governors.
They now control the governorships in four of the eight largest states, having held on to California and added Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Gov. Gray Davis of California, who won re-election, has not so far been able to cut much of a swath nationally. But the party has high hopes for Ed Rendell, the governor-elect of Pennsylvania, who is a well-seasoned Philadelphia and national politician, and for Michigan's governor-elect, Jennifer Granholm, the state's attorney general.

HEADLINE: Thursday Morning Quarterbacks 

 BODY:
If Richard Gephardt goes through with plans to pass up another term as House minority leader, it could provide an opportunity for the Democrats to figure out exactly what they intend to stand for during the upcoming period of Republican domination on both sides of Congress. Mr. Gephardt certainly can't be blamed for everything that went wrong on Tuesday, but there's nothing like a bad election night to get a party focused on its identity problems.
 Both parties actually should be careful about the lessons they draw from the election. President Bush has a right to be a very happy man this week. It was his willingness to put his prestige on the line in three weeks of tireless, well-aimed campaigning that won the day for his party. Nevertheless, he would be mistaken to read too much into the results. 
 The president's personal popularity coupled with his party's savvy campaign strategy certainly could become the basis for a solid Republican majority in the future, but it is not there yet. On Tuesday the country continued to be split almost exactly down the middle. The Democrats' two most crippling losses occurred in Minnesota and Missouri, where the voting margins narrowed to practically nothing.
Obviously, a narrow win is better than a narrow loss, but Mr. Bush has a habit of interpreting even the tiniest margins of victory as mandates for sweeping change. The last time around he seized on an election in which he lost the popular vote as justification for pressing forward with a lopsided tax plan and other programs beloved by business interests and the conservative G.O.P. base. Now, having run to the center in order to win their critical races, the Republicans will be tempted to embark on an aggressively conservative agenda -- saddling the country with right-wing judges for the next 30 years or resurrecting some of their more repellent energy strategies, like opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling.
The Democrats, for their part, don't seem to be having much problem taking their defeats seriously. The one thing the party had plenty of yesterday was self-criticism, although there didn't seem to be a large supply of people willing to take personal responsibility for the loss of control of the Senate and the increased Republican majority in the House. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority whip, said the Democrats had failed utterly to distinguish themselves from the opposition. Representative Martin Frost of Texas, who like Ms. Pelosi wants to be a candidate for the leader's job if Mr. Gephardt steps aside, was arguing that the election proved the country was moving to the right and that the Democrats needed to follow suit.
Democrats are certainly frustrated by Republicans' skill at co-opting the rhetorical center. But it doesn't take a genius to realize that a party that wants to run on the nation's economic problems needs to have a coherent economic strategy first. Instead of explaining to the public why they felt long-term tax cuts for the wealthy were a bad idea, most Democrats in tight races either dodged the issue or voted with the president.
Mr. Bush's political genius has always been in defining a narrow list of issues he supports and then sticking to his message. The Democrats could do the same thing, rallying behind their popular positions on the environment and Social Security. But they must also figure out whether they are a party that disapproves of huge long-term tax cuts for the wealthiest sliver of the American population. If they can't agree on that one, there will be good reason for the rest of the country to wonder what exactly they stand for.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pitt's Belated Departure 

 BODY:
The most overdue concession statement on election night came not from a candidate but from Harvey Pitt, the beleaguered chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under cover of the election returns, Mr. Pitt tendered his letter of resignation, advising President Bush that "the turmoil surrounding my chairmanship" was impeding the work of the S.E.C. 
 That's an understatement. His stewardship of the S.E.C., the key regulator of the stock market and of publicly traded companies, was nothing short of disastrous. The White House played a role in this debacle. It allowed Mr. Pitt to stay on the job just when the country most desperately needed strong leadership to restore investor confidence. In addition, the timing of the resignation was totally cynical. Not until the polls closed was Mr. Bush prepared to concede that he had put the wrong man in the job. 
 What sealed Mr. Pitt's fate was his hasty and ill-considered appointment of William Webster to run the new accounting oversight board, instead of a plausible watchdog over the industry. He failed to disclose to either the White House or the other S.E.C. commissioners that Mr. Webster had headed the audit committee of a company accused of serious improprieties. This could not have been appreciated by Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff, who had unwittingly urged Mr. Webster to take the job. 
President Bush must now hasten to appoint someone of stature -- preferably someone with a strong record regulating financial markets or prosecuting malfeasance -- to lead the S.E.C. The embattled agency's mission has never been more critical to the nation's well-being. For those needing a reminder of just how vital it is to restore confidence in the integrity of financial markets, Election Day also brought news that WorldCom's fraudulent accounting is now estimated to have exceeded an astonishing $9 billion.
The void created by Mr. Pitt's lack of credibility as a regulator empowered officials like New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, to pursue inquiries into Wall Street's tainted research. But the country is even better served if a stronger S.E.C. takes the lead in protecting investors. We hope the new auditing oversight board will also play an important role in preventing future Enrons and WorldComs. Mr. Webster is clearly not the right person to lead the board. He should resign, along with the S.E.C.'s chief accountant, Robert Herdman, who was involved in Mr. Webster's appointment.
The economy is in a frail state, as evidenced by yesterday's aggressive half-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. A crisis of confidence in the fairness of the financial system has contributed to the economy's woes. The S.E.C. now has to become a part of the solution.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK; 
If Pataki Has a Grander Wish, 3rd Term Could Be a Charm

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki woke up yesterday morning with an impressive victory behind him, but as he looks ahead he faces a governmental and political landscape very different from the one in which he has flourished during his first two terms.
 For most of the last six years, Mr. Pataki had the wind at his back. The economy was booming and revenues poured in from Wall Street at record levels, allowing him to cut taxes while expanding spending on popular government programs like health care, education and the environment. In an increasingly Democratic state, this fit nicely with his political ambitions, helping the Republican governor build a powerful winning coalition with support from reliably Democratic constituencies like unions, environmentalists and Hispanics. 
 Even as the economy slumped during this election year, Mr. Pataki managed to avoid deep cuts or tax increases that might have offended some of these supporters by using clever fiscal legerdemain and spending most of the savings the state had built up during the late 1990's. 
Now, however, Mr. Pataki must close a budget gap for the next fiscal year that most experts say will be at least $6 billion. The resulting pressure to cut spending will make it much harder for him to keep his new friends happy, especially if he keeps his promise not to raise taxes.
Even old allies in Albany are already signaling their distaste for cuts in the education and health care programs he promoted as successes during his campaign.
"I don't believe the governor is going to be looking backwards and going backwards," said the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno. "I don't see him cratering a quality of life that New Yorkers have been brought to enjoy."
But just as Mr. Pataki's political and governmental ambitions reinforced each other during his first two terms, they may do so again if the governor decides to seek national office during his third. Just as his spending initiatives helped build political relationships with New York liberals, shrinking the government could become an important credential for building bridges to conservative national Republicans if he tries to position himself for higher office or a job in the Bush administration.
The governor studiously avoids acknowledging national aspirations, but he is just as careful to avoid promising to serve out his term. "I'm very excited by my political future, serving as the governor of this great state," Mr. Pataki said yesterday.
But his advisers are not as reluctant to speculate about the next step for a politician who has risen to the pinnacle of state politics. If the vice presidency were to become available in the next election cycle, they say, President Bush might find it expedient to put a moderate Northeastern Republican who favors abortion rights on the ticket.
Much of that is out of Mr. Pataki's control and depends on what the national mood is in 2004. 
Should the most important issues in most Americans' minds shift from terrorism and war back to domestic matters like health care, then Mr. Pataki, a fiscal conservative who is viewed as a moderate on social issues, might become a more attractive candidate for vice president, these strategists said.
"If you are looking for a model of a Republican that can go into any Democratic constituency and get votes, George Pataki is at the top of the short list," said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican political consultant.
Mr. Pataki's victory on Tuesday was impressive by many standards. In New York City, where Democrats outnumber Republicans five to one, he received 39 percent of the vote, the best showing for any Republican since Nelson A. Rockefeller ran in 1970. Hispanics gave him about 38 percent of their vote, according to a study of election districts conducted yesterday by John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. That is also a record for a Republican.
He defeated the Democratic challenger, H. Carl McCall, by 704,000 votes, or 16 percentage points. The only worse defeat for a Democrat in a governor's race came in 1998, when Mr. Pataki trounced Peter Vallone by one million votes, a margin of 21 percentage points.
"Clearly, back-to-back landslides in a five-to-three Democratic state has got to catch people's eyes," said Michael McKeon, the governor's campaign spokesman.
Representative John Sweeney, an upstate Republican who is close to the governor, said the party leaders "have to look at George Pataki at a national level for the lessons of how to survive in a tough environment."
The environment in Albany, however, is likely to get tougher. Democrats in the State Assembly increased their majority on Tuesday to 103 members, from 99. The Republicans who control the Senate also picked up a seat, giving them a 37-member majority.
The Senate and Assembly leaders both indicate that they will resist severe cutbacks, as will the unions. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said yesterday that he would urge Mr. Pataki to go to his Republican colleagues in Washington and request more federal aid before considering cutting popular programs. He also suggested that Mr. Pataki's pledges not to raise taxes, lay off workers or increase tuitions and fares would be impossible to keep.
For his part, Mr. Pataki is confident about his ability to solve the state's fiscal problems, though he has not provided details.
"We will have our budget proposal when we have our budget proposal," he said yesterday. "We don't want to raise tuitions or taxes or fares."
Denis M. Hughes, the president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O, said that labor leaders would probably have greater access to the governor than ever before, thanks to the endorsements of many of the largest unions, but that it was unclear whether that will translate into fewer budget cuts.
"I've been doing politics for a long time, over 20 years, and I can't imagine a worse situation for working men and women than the situation we face, in terms of budget problems," said Mr. Hughes, whose organization did not endorse a candidate for governor.
Mr. Pataki rarely talks politics in public, so it is hard to know how he views the shifts in the political winds. He said that in his third term he would focus on the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, a project that doubtless will be one of his legacies, good or bad. So far, he has played a low-key role in the plans for the site where the World Trade Center stood, partly out of political caution, but there is a general consensus within the administration and Legislature that the pace of redevelopment will pick up now.
Mr. Pataki also says one of his major goals will be to make upstate New York into a haven for emerging high-technology industries. He has sown the seeds, in the form of state grants and tax incentives, for research and development centers in all of the rusting cities along the old Erie Canal. 
He often talks about wanting to replace the old manufacturing industries that were born and thrived in the last century with a new wave of industries, like nanoelectronics, bioinformatics, genetic engineering and other cutting-edge technologies.
The governor wants to leave his mark on environmental policy, too. He has promised to make New York a leader in cutting greenhouse gases and promoting renewable energy sources like fuel cells, windmills and geothermal technology.
These goals may have to wait until the budget gap is dealt with, legislative leaders said. The true test of Mr. Pataki's new coalition with traditional Democrats may come when he introduces his budget proposal in January.
"In a real way, the budget will be a test of these new relationships," said one legislative aide.

Kids Today? Sharpton Grimaces

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
IT began predictably enough, a political chat yesterday with the Rev. Al Sharpton. He blamed Democrats for their own Election Day rout, said they should have fought the president on Iraq and the economy, said the party had to get back to its roots.
 "They forgot: you don't imitate the opposition, you oppose it," he said. "There was no voter registration drive, nothing. I think they got what they asked for. Nothing." 
 Then the conversation changed direction. He said he was saddened by the younger generation of black America, saddened that too many young people are captivated by hip-hop, inured to violence, dismissive of public life and politics.
"I'm not speaking only as a civil rights leader," he said. "I have two daughters, 15 and 16. Who are they going to marry? Guys who think it's O.K. to call them a 'ho'? Here's the real problem: The drive, the ambition, the desire to reach higher goals seem to have been lost in this new generation, particularly of black men. This whole glorification of decadence, of acting like this is black culture. Black culture is striving, it's achieving."
Now this is Al Sharpton, who could be reinventing himself once again, molding himself into a more middle-class figure as he contemplates a run for president and promotes his new book, "Al on America" (Dafina Books, 2002). But he did sound, as he sat in his Harlem office yesterday, as if he meant what he was saying.
"We've allowed a whole generation to just say, 'Hey man, it's like that and it's cool and that's the black thing.' These kids don't aspire to anything. We've got to stop that." It was, he said, the responsibility of blacks -- political leaders, D.J.'s, preachers, teachers and others with influence -- to turn things around. "This is something that cannot be done by the white community."
Statistics showing that many more women than men attend the City University of New York, which has large black population, were revealing of the damaging values, he said; black women are not under pressure to be "macho," to deride education. Mr. Sharpton tells of a black student who was the first in her family to go to college. When her brothers and sisters learned that she was making straight A's, they said to her, " 'Oh, you acting white now?' Like there is something black about flunking."
THERE are Sharpton critics who would say he and other liberals created the problems he cites by contending that African-Americans have been victimized and by favoring permissive policies. Mr. Sharpton said that there had probably been too great an emphasis on victimization but, he added, "We've always fought for equal opportunity, never for irresponsibility."
Then what is the cause? He mentioned a few, including affluence, indulgence, progress that has given young people more options and a less urgent need to struggle, and the aging of political leaders. Mr. Sharpton, 48, noted that at pre-election rally the other night for H. Carl McCall, he and Bill Clinton were among the youngest political figures present. "And come on, with all due respect, you can't make Bill Clinton the leader of black America. It's insulting." 
But clearly the leadership of the Democratic Party is not prepared to risk alienating more conservative white voters by treating Mr. Sharpton as the leader of black America. Just as it wasn't comfortable giving Jesse Jackson too prominent a platform. Which could be why Mr. Sharpton may run for president so he can command his own platform.
Not that he wants for attention, some of it unwelcome. There's the persistent criticism of his controversial past and some unwanted popularity. Mr. Sharpton said it saddens him that he's often hailed on the streets by black men, impressed because he served jail time for demonstrating in Vieques.
"Well, I went to jail for a cause, not for snatching a pocketbook," he said. "That is a distorted, jaded credential. It's the baggy pants, it's 'Did you go to jail?' Nobody is challenging that this whole violent, sex-crazed type of matrix is not black culture."
Al Sharpton, going mainstream in middle age? "I don't care if you're Giuliani or Sharpton," he said, allowing a laugh. "When it hits home, it's another thing."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: TRENDS; 
Victorious Democrats Credit Message and Machine

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Marveling at the ease with which Frank R. Lautenberg won New Jersey's United States Senate race, New Jersey Democratic leaders said today that Tuesday's election results were a testament to both the party's message and its political machine.
 Bonnie Watson Coleman, chairwoman of the Democratic State Committee, said that once Mr. Lautenberg replaced Senator Robert G. Torricelli on the ballot, he assumed control by preaching the core Democratic issues of abortion rights, gun control and environmental protection. Ms. Coleman said that the county chairmen also mounted a big get-out-the-vote effort that contributed to Mr. Lautenberg's comfortable 10-point margin of victory over the Republican Douglas R. Forrester. 
 "The party apparatus was up and running," she said gleefully at a press conference in the State House.
But Republicans, still reeling from last November's election, when they lost control of the governor's mansion and both houses of the Legislature, said they, too, could take some comfort from Tuesday's results. Republicans maintained their hold on 6 of the state's 13 seats in the House of Representatives and fared well in many local races.
The state Republican chairman, State Senator Joseph R. Kyrillos Jr., said that if the State Supreme Court had not allowed Mr. Lautenberg to replace Mr. Torricelli after the deadline for replacing candidates had passed, Republicans would have won their first United States Senate seat in New Jersey in 30 years.
"The trend would have been in reverse had the election taken place a month ago with a different candidate," he said. He added that Republicans have "half of the State Senate seats, nearly half of the Congressional delegation, half of the County Boards of Chosen Freeholders."
"We're going to have a lot of local successes," Senator Kyrillos said.
While some of members of the Forrester campaign have privately criticized the state Republican Party for failing to provide enough money and field support, Mr. Forrester himself had only kind words for the party. Speaking at a press conference today, Mr. Forrester said his defeat was caused by the candidate switch and the fact that he had to run two campaigns against better-financed opponents.
Among Republican activists, the loss re-ignited the simmering dispute between the moderate and conservative wings. The moderates, who have long dominated New Jersey's Republican Party, said Mr. Forrester's positions on gun control, abortion and the environment were simply too far to the right for a moderate state like New Jersey.
But some conservatives said that Mr. Forrester had spent so much time hedging on the positions that he had failed to energize the right-wing voters who make up the Republican base.
"The election results should be a wake-up call to Republicans," said Marie Tasy, director of New Jersey Right to Life. "They don't have the pro-life base to kick around any more."
While Mr. Lautenberg's victory extended the Democrats' winning streak over Republicans, it did little to alter the balance of power between the parties, and some political analysts warned that the Democrats should not mistake their current success for a mandate.
While James E. McGreevey was elected by a resounding margin last year, the Democrats' victory in the State Legislature was due more to a favorable redistricting map than any ideological shift toward the party. The fact that Democrats replaced Mr. Torricelli with a retired elder statesman like Mr. Lautenberg also suggests that the party has few rising young stars.
With legislative races scheduled for next year, Democrats also have to remember that for all the spoils of power, there is a built-in burden.
"The Democrats this year could just point the finger at Washington and blame Bush for the economy," said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University. "Next year, New Jersey voters who are upset about high property taxes and a freeze in state aid to schools are going to be pointing the finger at them, and if they haven't produced, by making a difference in people's lives, they will pay the price."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE OVERVIEW; 
VICTORIOUS REPUBLICANS PREPARING A DRIVE FOR BUSH AGENDA AND JUDGESHIP NOMINEES

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Republicans began setting plans yesterday to push forward a domestic agenda of tax cuts, a national energy policy, creation of a vast homeland security department and the confirmation of conservative judges as they savored a sweep of the midterm elections that gave them complete control of the Capitol.
 The Republican resurgence came after an election in which President Bush's party defied historical trends and expanded its control of the House and retook the Senate. Republicans captured three Democratic seats in the Senate, and held all but one of their own vulnerable seats. They were assured at least 51 seats in the 100-seat Senate. 
 The shift in power had deep implications for government policy and for the next presidential election, with Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans emboldened and Democrats in disarray. 
Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, was ready to reclaim the role of majority leader only 17 months after he unexpectedly lost power when Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont became an independent. Mr. Lott was making plans for the lame-duck session of the outgoing Congress next week and for the 108th Congress, which takes office in January.
"We're ready to go to work," said Mr. Lott, who was already in his office at 7 yesterday morning when he took a congratulatory call from the president. "As I've said to others, 'Let's roll.' "
The jubilation among Republicans was captured in a memorandum that Matthew Dowd, Mr. Bush's campaign pollster, sent to party leaders saying, "The unprecedented, historic nature of last night's results cannot be overstated."
Even so, Republicans remembered how they had overestimated their mandate in the era of Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, and vowed not to repeat that mistake. One senior Republican leadership aide said: "I don't think we're going to overreach. If you overpromise, you usually underdeliver and create a whole bunch of problems for yourself."
The Republicans' control of the Senate was sealed when Senator Jean Carnahan of Missouri conceded defeat early yesterday morning. Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, recruited as a last minute stand-in for Senator Paul Wellstone, who died in plane crash, was also rebuffed in his comeback bid.
Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, will have to defend her seat in a runoff election in December because she failed to draw 50 percent of the vote.
A new cast of senators, some of them prominent conservatives, stood ready to take control of the Senate's committees. In some significant changes, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah takes control of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma becomes chairman of the budget committee, and Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma assumes the chairmanship of the environment and public works panel. 
Mr. Bush, who put his prestige on the line and campaigned doggedly for vulnerable Republicans, was credited by both parties with providing the energy and personal popularity that propelled Republicans to victory, strengthening his own position as the parties now turn their attention to the 2004 presidential election.
The White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, portrayed the outcome of the election, which caught even many Republicans by surprise, as a statement that Americans wanted an end to Washington gridlock.
"I think what Democrats and Republicans and independents and people who just plain don't care about politics want from Washington is leaders who come to Washington to get something done," Mr. Fleischer said. "And that's the part of Washington that the president would like to expand."
He said Mr. Bush would now "fight for his ideas and fight for his principles," putting a sharp focus on the weak economy and domestic security.
Mr. Bush chose not to speak publicly yesterday about the results, a silence that Mr. Fleischer characterized as a "touch of graciousness."
Following the president's lead, Republicans in Congress were carefully choosing their words and seeking to avoid the triumphant tones of 1994 when they swept into control of the House and Senate.
Still, Mr. Fleischer's remarks appeared to put battered and dispirited Democrats on notice that they risked political peril if they tried to block Mr. Bush's agenda by using the Senate power of unlimited debate.
Despite the Republicans' success, Democrats retained enough strength to have the ability to tie the Senate in procedural knots.
A defiant Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said: "We're not going to go away. We may not be in the majority, but we're going to fight just as hard for the things we believe in now as we have before."
Still, Democratic leaders disagreed over how to proceed and found themselves arguing over what went wrong in a campaign in which they had hoped to ride the weak economy to traditional midterm gains in Congress. 
The election dealt setbacks to the presidential aspirations of Mr. Daschle, of South Dakota, who once again becomes minority leader, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader.
Mr. Gephardt, who is exploring a presidential run, decided yesterday not to seek re-election as minority leader, a senior aide said, a step that left him freer to pursue his own independent stand on issues.
In the recriminations over the Democrats' losses, two House members had already called for him to move aside. "It is now clearly time for him to step down," said one, Representative Peter Deutsch of Florida.
A fierce leadership race erupted between Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California and Martin Frost of Texas.
Congress is set to return next week for a lame-duck session, and it is possible that Republicans could take control swiftly. The timing will depend on whether Dean Barkley, an independent whom Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota named as a short-term replacement for Mr. Wellstone, decides to caucus with the Republicans.
Republicans could also take control if James M. Talent, a former Republican representative, is quickly seated to replace Mrs. Carnahan. Their matchup was a special election for the remaining term of Mrs. Carnahan's husband, Mel, who was elected in 2000 after he died in a plane crash. She was appointed to the seat.
Mr. Lott made clear that he hoped to wrap up the session within days and put off most major legislation until next year.
"I'm not an advocate of lame-duck sessions whether I'm in the minority or the majority," he said.
Some Republican priorities were instantly clear.
"So much of what we need to do is obvious," Mr. Lott said at a news conference. "Just take the list of what we didn't get done this year." Other new initiatives were expected to be advanced by Mr. Bush in his State of the Union address early next year.
Republicans said they would push to rein in spending and make Mr. Bush's 10-year $1.35 trillion tax cut permanent, and possibly propose other tax cut measures, like a new capital gains reduction and larger breaks for investor losses. They hoped to revive Mr. Bush's stalled national energy plan, including his call for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. They also want to press for passage of legislation creating a vast domestic security department.
They also wanted to pass stalled legislation on welfare, on creation of a prescription drug benefit, on giving religious charities a larger role in providing social services, and possibly a measure banning an abortion procedure that Republicans have dubbed "partial-birth abortion."
Mr. Lott also homed in on judicial appointments, and other Senate Republicans said they expected the handful of Bush judicial nominees who have been delayed in committee to receive swift consideration.
But he also indicated that he was cautious about moving forward too precipitously. 
"I've learned from experience," he said. "I'm getting a second chance to do this job. I hope I will do it, you know better than last time, and learn from those experiences. And one of them is, you don't take off down the trail, saying what you are going to do, without a lot of consultation."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE MINORITY PARTY; 
Democrats Catalog Mistakes; Gephardt Ceding House Post

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The Democratic Party turned on itself yesterday in a bitter if familiar round of recriminations over what many officials described as an election night debacle. Democratic leaders said the outcome had left the party without any clear leaders and hampered its hope of winning back the White House.
 One of the party's two most prominent elected leaders, Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, said through aides last night that he would not seek re-election as minority leader when House Democrats caucus next week. They said he was stepping down from his leadership post to prepare for a likely presidential race, but other Democrats said that Mr. Gephardt faced the prospect of a challenge from dispirited party members critical of how he waged an election in which Democrats lost seats to the Republicans. Page B6. 
 Across the nation, Democratic leaders argued that the party and its candidates had failed in this campaign season to offer voters a clear alternative to Republican policies, and had done little beyond trying to stir existing anxieties about the state of the nation and the economy. 
In particular, some Democratic leaders said the party had made a mistake in failing to engage President Bush on his tax cut -- one clear area of economic disagreement between the two parties -- and by falling in line behind Mr. Bush when he pressed the issue of Iraq in the midst of a fall election 
"The national Democratic Party never defined the Democratic agenda," said Dick Harpootlian, the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. "Other than being sort of whiney as we got drug into the Iraq war, we never really defined our position on the economy, we never said what we would do differently."
"We have no message this year other than we're not Bush," Mr. Harpootlian said. "Well, guess what? Eighty percent of the people like Bush."
Douglas Sosnik, the White House political director under Bill Clinton, said: "I don't think that the Democratic Party gave the folks out in the states any reason to have passion about the midterms, in order to energize them to vote. That's an arduous task in the best of circumstances -- which this is not."
Al Gore, the former vice president and a potential candidate for president, said in an interview with ABC News that Democrats should not "mistake the magnitude of this loss -- there has to be a major regrouping."
"It means that the Democrats have to be the loyal opposition in fact and not just name," Mr. Gore said.
In California, Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco was unsparing in his criticism of party leaders last night.
"I don't think we Democrats are speaking to our base with the level of enthusiasm we should and we don't make it a priority," Mr. Brown said. "In any campaign, you first maximize your own strength, and then add to it. We've been doing just the reverse, doing the best we can to get swing voters and then assuming our base was there. Well our base was there, but it was at home and not at the polls."
The loss forced a day of soul-searching and hand-wringing among Democratic officials intent on figuring out what had gone wrong, and what it meant for the vibrancy of a party that is now completely shut out of power. While Democrats had grown increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of winning back the House as Election Day approached, few expected that they would lose more seats in the House, while losing complete control of the Senate.
The outcome posed a particular problem for Mr. Gephardt, because he had invested so much time and prestige into trying to win back the House. Mr. Gephardt's aides had said before the election that, assuming his party did not win the majority, he was almost certain to step down to run for president as soon as the election was over.
Mr. Gephardt moved ahead with that decision in the midst of one of the darker days for Democrats in recent times, and on a day of turmoil in his conference. "Having suffered historic losses in the House is not the best way to introduce yourself as a president," said one senior Democratic strategist who is sympathetic to Mr. Gephardt.
The day loomed as well as a huge loss for the party's high-flying national chairman, Terry McAuliffe. Mr. McAuliffe appeared staggered by the outcome as he went through a day of appearances, trying to explain why his predictions of victory had been so wrong.
Mr. McAuliffe disputed criticism from some Democrats that the party shared much of the blame for what went wrong, arguing that Democrats had not been able to overcome Mr. Bush's popularity or Republican spending. "I could clearly make the argument that George Bush should have done a lot better last night," the Democratic chairman said.
While there was criticism in some quarters of Mr. McAuliffe, most was focused on elected officials -- in particular, Mr. Gephardt and Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, another prospective presidential contender for 2004.
But again and again, Democrats argued that the source of the party's problems this year was that it had failed to provide voters with a reason to throw out a party in power. 
"We needed to be more specific," said Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida. "To be effectively heard, you have to be both the diagnostician -- what is your definition of the problem -- and second, the prescriber, where you suggest what to do about the problem."
The main point of dispute among many Democrats was whether the party should have directly engaged the Republicans on the $1.35 trillion tax cut passed under Mr. Bush, or on the president's push for a resolution to allow him to oust President Saddam Hussein of Iraq from office. Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Daschle had decided in the midst of the campaign to agree to Mr. Bush's request for authority, a decision that some liberal Democrats criticized as a political calculation.
Joe Lockhart, a White House press secretary under Mr. Clinton, said Democrats might have made a mistake in failing to draw a clear line between the parties on the issues that dominated the Congressional agenda this year. 
"It wasn't crazy to follow this strategy," Mr. Lockhart said. "But I think that given that it failed, we have to sit down and figure out what to do -- and the first thing we need to do is how to engage people directly."
But Chris Lehane, who served as Mr. Gore's press secretary in his failed 2000 presidential bid, said: "We have no one to blame but ourselves. In a time where we saw the greatest loss of wealth in the history of the world, we were devoid of a message -- namely, not taking on the Bush tax boon for the wealthy."
Other party leaders, though, said that the Democrats could not reasonably argue against the tax plan, since so many members had supported it when it passed, and that coming out against tax cuts would hardly have been helpful to embattled incumbents in states like Missouri and Minnesota. Indeed, Mr. Gore gave a speech on economic policy in the middle of the campaign and repeatedly declined to say whether he thought Mr. Bush's tax cut should be rescinded.
To make matters worse for Democrats, the problems that the tax cut caused for Democrats this year seem likely to persist over the next two years as Democrats prepare to for the presidential campaign. 
"The tax cut put the Democrats into a box that we still have not figured our way out of," said Howard Wolfson, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "We are going to have this argument in 2004: It is unavoidable."

HEADLINE: Cairo Journal; 
Saddam's 'Weapons' Costly, 'Bush-Sharon' Cheap

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
The dates nicknamed "Saddam Hussein's Weapons of Mass Destruction" were not selling so well today, the first day of Ramadan, at the wholesale market where thrifty Cairenes purchase their holiday treats. 
 It is something of a tradition for purveyors of the dates, hazelnuts, dried apricots and other delicacies used to break the daily fast at sundown to give pet names to their dozen or so date varieties. 
 "Yasir Arafat" and the revived best seller from last year, "Osama bin Laden," were already all but gone -- a reflection that the plight of the Palestinians and the fight against terrorism remain the preoccupations of the moment. 
"The names attract the attention of the clients," said Khaled Hussein, shouting above the din in the market, situated underneath the ramps leading to one of the main bridges across the Nile. "Even if they are sad, they stop and look and laugh." 
The "Mass Destruction" moniker went to a particularly long, somewhat costly date imported from Iraq. 
"Look at them, they look just like Scud missiles," said another seller, Sayid Mahmoud, scooping one out of an overflowing burlap sack. "Sales are just O.K. I think people are waiting to see what happens with America. I'm sure if he uses his missiles, sales will improve."
Mostly, shoppers seemed to find the "Mass Destruction" dates too expensive. Sellers too, acknowledged that it was a bad year. With the Egyptian pound sinking against the dollar, prices for some imported goods were up 50 percent over last Ramadan. 
"The holiday spirit of Ramadan is basically gone, especially among the young people with all their unemployment, their frustrations," said Ashraf Mustafa Amin, the 33-year-old owner of a factory for Pharaonic souvenirs. "The problem is that every year the situation does not improve. In fact, every year it gets worse and worse."
To relieve their doldrums, most Egyptians and, indeed, people across the Arab world look forward to the special programs that television stations roll out to take advantage of the mass audience gathering to eat. Ramadan marks the holiest month on the calendar, but over the generations the original spirit of religious reflection and good works has gradually been overshadowed by extended nightly meals. 
Usually one program pulls out ahead of the pack, because of its stars or controversial nature. Last year the issue was polygamy, with a show that glorified a middle-class man who married the maximum four wives allowed under Islam. 
This year the early lead seems to be going to "Knight Without a Horse," a series that has already received worldwide attention, even though the first episode was not scheduled to be shown until late tonight. 
The Bush administration encouraged Arab governments to ban the series because it incorporates ideas from the long discredited "Protocols of the Elders of Zion," an anti-Semitic forgery by the czarist secret police that purported to lay out a plan by Jews to dominate the world. 
With some 20 Arab stations set to broadcast "Knight Without a Horse," the producers, script writers and actors held a news conference Monday to defend the program, saying it merely depicted the early Arab struggle against Zionism and foreign occupation. 
Muhammad Sobhi, the screenwriter and a main actor, said he recognized that the protocols were a forgery, but said that in any event, it appeared to be the blueprint of Israeli plans to deny the Palestinians a state of their own. 
There was a certain degree of gloating among the creators because of the attention, not least because so many Arab intellectuals say they are weary of being preached to about human rights and other values when Washington does nothing to stop Israel from using missiles against Palestinian homes. 
"If this series scares the United States and the Zionist entity," Mr. Sobhi said, using the name for Israel favored by those who abhor its existence, "then we will make many more like it."
The Egyptian government spokesman, Nabil Osman, issued a three-page statement expressing surprise at the outcry.
"It is neither acceptable nor reasonable to selectively heap accusations of anti-Semitism on artists simply because they sympathize with the plight of the Palestinian people and thus are critical of Israeli policies and practices," the statement said, adding that banning the series would stifle artistic creativity. 
Oddly enough, at the same time that the government was rising to its defense, Dream TV, the mostly privately owned satellite station that produced the 41 episodes, was being officially reprimanded for an earlier broadcast -- a talk show last month that discussed female masturbation. An oversight board barred the piece from being rebroadcast and admonished the station to treat delicate topics with greater sensitivity. 
Of course, many in television circles believe that the real root of the warning lay elsewhere. Dream TV had also recently broadcast remarks by Muhammad Hassanein Heikal, a towering figure among Egyptian thinkers, in which he disparaged the idea that President Hosni Mubarak might be succeeded by his son Gamal. Mr. Heikal said it was unthinkable that Mr. Mubarak, 74, could seek a fifth term when his current one expires in 2005 and noted that the president himself had rejected the idea of a dynasty.
Both topics -- the matter of succession and Mr. Mubarak's son -- are off-limits in Egyptian media, and either is likely to send Mr. Mubarak into a rage. 
Egyptians shopping for their holiday dates today waved away such questions, saying they were too burdened by economic troubles to worry about things like succession or outside criticism of what appeared on Egyptian television. 
One sure sign of that was that lots of people were buying the absolute lowest quality of dates, nicknamed "Bush and Sharon."
"They are the worst; not sweet at all, very bitter," said one seller, Mr. Hussein. "The others are all healthy, very sweet, from good palms. We expect people to buy these cheap ones either for charity or maybe to throw at each other."
One shopper was buying two brimming bags of "Bush and Sharon" dates, about 22 pounds for about $5. 
"At least they are so tough that I know they won't have any mites in them," he said, adding, "It's the most I can afford."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
White Hot: From Rap To Riches

BYLINE:  By ELVIS MITCHELL 

 BODY:
THE mission of "8 Mile" is essentially to garner sympathy for a white rapper involved in an old-school shootout -- a rap contest. This may be the final frontier for pop, more unbelievable than the prospect of launching a member of 'N Sync into orbit. The film's star, Eminem, doesn't appear to have a great deal of range, but he can play himself. Even though the protagonist is named Jimmy Smith, the thoughtful "8 Mile" is a raw version of the rapper's own story.
 This is basically an 80's go-for-it movie (the picture feels like some odd combination of "Flashdance" and "Purple Rain"), and the director, Curtis Hanson, working with a screenplay by Scott Silver, has done a fine job of giving it a soul, though it's a gloomy, peeling-paint one. The movie has the echoey, haunted heart of Johnny Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' "Hurt": maybe the project doesn't make sense in the abstract, but once you submit to it, it works. 
 One of a handful of films made in Detroit, "8 Mile" doesn't feature the Motown renaissance that Mayor Coleman A. Young dreamed of in the 1970's. Instead it's the beaten-down city: 8 Mile refers to the line of demarcation between Detroit and suburban, mostly white Oakland County. (The joke is that Oakland County is home to both the megastar white rapper Eminem and the parents who are most afraid of his influence on their kids.)
Mr. Hanson's last two pictures, "L.A. Confidential" and "Wonder Boys," were about the trouble that words can cause. And Jimmy Smith, who is called Rabbit and is determined to be a rapper, spends a great deal of time in hot water because of his mouth. When "8 Mile" begins, Rabbit has moved back into the trailer park home where his mother (Kim Basinger) and little sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield) live, to find that one of his high school friends is now involved with his mom. Rabbit has just broken up with his girlfriend and belongs nowhere. "8 Mile" could be set in a Johnny Cash song, since Rabbit unabashedly refers to himself as white trash.
Rabbit doesn't even fit in at the rap contests in the Detroit club run by his black pal, the dreadlocked entrepreneur Future (Mekhi Phifer). The gray, rust-belt industrial tones captured by the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto ("Amores Perros") add ominousness to the restroom where Rabbit is sweating as he anxiously waits to take his turn onstage. It's Mr. Hanson's way of cooking up tension. We're always waiting for something to happen, and it occurs at the strangest times and in the strangest juxtapositions, for example, a fight at a radio station. The struggle plays out silently in the background, while the foreground action -- an interview in a soundproofed studio -- goes on undisturbed.
And it is backstage at the Detroit club, before Rabbit goes out to confront the crowd and compete, that we become aware of his odd remoteness. This is partly because Eminem gives little as an actor. In some ways he's very similar to another white pop-star-turned-actor, Mark Wahlberg. Both have soft, sandpapery voices and a stern politeness when they speak. They're going to make each word count, right down to never dropping a G from the end of an -ing.
Eminem, though, has a relentless, unblinking stare. (It's the expression seen on gifted kids in horror movies.) In contrast to the intensity of his gaze, Eminem's facial muscles are often slack. He has lost weight for his first starring role, and the cleft in his chin has deepened, becoming another shadowy place where he seems to be hiding things. He holds back, waiting, a little nervous. It's only when he gets angry that he comes to life and his voice takes on a shank's edge, dull and rusty.
Rabbit's main competitors -- Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie) and his Leaders of the Free World squad -- often dismiss him as "Elvis," a white boy appropriating black culture. But when Rabbit starts hollering or rapping, he does indeed give off the explosion of vitality that Presley had while singing in his very early movies. (Here, he becomes the real Slim Shady.)
And like Presley in most of his films, Eminem is given an actressy flirt of a love interest. Her name is Alex, played by the smudge-eyed Brittany Murphy, who can't even walk into a room without sizing up the camera. Exuding a baby-girl narcissism, Alex -- who wants to become a model and get out of Detroit -- looks at Rabbit as just another opportunity. Taryn Manning, in a much smaller role as Rabbit's ex-girlfriend, is far more believable and makes a bigger impact.
Rabbit keeps his rocket-from-the-crypt ambition focused, doing day work for little money at an auto stamping plant. His real life begins at night when he goes out to compete in hip-hop contests. But he is so unnerved by appearing onstage that, for most of the picture, Future's faith in the white rapper's skills seems misplaced. Only Future and the millions of record buyers in the moviegoing audience have any idea of Rabbit's abilities. The film is like a rap version of "The Incredible Hulk," and when Rabbit triumphantly rocks the joint at the end, he's flushed, every vein in his body distended -- the underdog giving vent to his rage and winning the crowd over. The movie exploits Eminem's slight physical presence, saving the pop-star magnetism for the climax.
"8 Mile," which opens nationwide today, is full of Detroit in-jokes, like Rabbit's referring to himself as "810," one of Oakland County's area codes. And there's a grand-slam joke using the song "Sweet Home Alabama," an omnipresent Motor City radio favorite that has extra resonance in Detroit, a place that refuses to give up its rock 'n' roll roots. It's too bad the movie can't acknowledge that although Detroit was late to rap, it was the birthplace of everything from Motown to the MC5 to Kid Rock. (Kid Rock can also be found on the soundtrack, alongside rap stars like Eric B. and Rakim.) In musical terms, Detroit is like Weimar Berlin, a place where economic and social turbulence create art.
The question is, does "8 Mile" do a convincing job of evoking hip-hop culture? Is the movie real enough for the rap world to take seriously, a question that, applied to himself, has dogged Eminem personally throughout his career. It should be noted that standards are a lot lower for rap movies. After all, Eminem had an almost secret cameo a year ago in "The Wash," a slovenly comedy starring his mentor, Dr. Dre. "8 Mile" is neither as real nor as harrowing as the recent crime film "Paid in Full," which may be the "Mean Streets" of rap. The spirit of rap suffuses "Paid" just as "Streets" encapsulated the intensity of pop.
And what Mr. Hanson has done with "8 Mile" is make a pop movie instead of a movie about pop. There's nothing disreputable about this. The movie is a success on its own terms because the director doesn't condescend to pop music. (As evidenced by the way he used music in "L.A. Confidential," he respects its powers.)
Mr. Hanson keeps the picture alive with the interplay between Rabbit and his crew, which gives it a verbal slapstick flow. The director is great with guys letting down their guard when women aren't around, rapping an impromptu "Pimpin' Ain't Easy" and breaking into brawling locker-room chatter. A winning touch is giving Rabbit's sweet, hapless friend Bob (Evan Jones) the big-money nickname Cheddar.
But the revelation is Mekhi Phifer, who shows a witty cool as Future. Between "8 Mile" and "Paid in Full," he's given his career a revivifying jolt, playing these big-brother roles with an impassioned trust. By not straining to show he's up to the demands of a major picture, he succeeds.
It's too bad "8 Mile" isn't totally as generous as Future -- whose real name in the movie is David Porter, which could well be a tribute to Isaac Hayes's songwriting partner. (The movie is full of flavorful pop allusions, including a scene that shows Douglas Sirk's race melodrama "Imitation of Life" playing on a television set. Like Sirk, Mr. Hanson makes movies about coming to grips with one's true identity.)
"8 Mile" could do without an unnecessary class swipe. In a final throwdown, Rabbit clowns a competitor by revealing that the guy went to suburban Detroit Cranbrook, one of the finest private schools in the country. The death of Jam Master Jay, the turntablist of Run-DMC, whose members all hailed from middle-class backgrounds in Queens, reminds us that what's important is the talent you bring to the stage.
On the other hand, the film embraces the absurdity of a white rapper who takes down a brother in a club full of black people -- perhaps more black people than own Eminem records. But this fantasy does acknowledge that rap has conquered the world of the young. It's the primary way kids of all races communicate. It's inadvertently hilarious that Eminem scores in this way; with his long, noble nose and porcelain skin, he could be one of the Mies van der Rohe structures on the Cranbrook campus.
"8 Mile" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language, joint smoking, sex scenes and smoking-barrel violence.

HEADLINE: Debt Crisis For Venture In Cellphones In Mexico 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Vodafone Group and Verizon Communications spent over $2 billion in Mexico to buy what was once a promising wireless telephone company in one of the world's fastest growing markets. Their gamble has not paid off.
 On Wednesday the company -- Grupo Iusacell, the No. 3 wireless provider in Mexico -- said it would have a hard time repaying its $840 million in debts as they were currently structured and was seeking talks with creditors about restructuring them. Up to $415 million of the debt will come due in mid-2004. 
 The announcement came a day after Standard & Poor's downgraded Iusacell's credit rating to CCC+, well below investment grade, and said a further reduction was possible. 
"The downgrade and credit-watch placement reflect growing concerns about Iusacell's liquidity and refinancing ability in a time of increased financial market volatility and uncertainty in the telecommunications industry," Patricia Calvo said in her report. 
Iusacell's American depository receipts, which traded as high as $4.58 in January, closed unchanged today at 68 cents. 
Iusacell has been steadily losing revenue and market share to its two larger rivals -- America Movil, the dominant carrier with almost 80 percent of the Mexican wireless market, and Telefonica Moviles of Spain, which has stepped up its investment in Mexico and surpassed Iusacell to become the No. 2 provider. 
Analysts say that Iusacell's problems stem from a decision to concentrate on the kind of service common in the United States, where customers sign a service contract and are billed for calls after they are made. In Mexico, such service is practical only for high-income customers.
The vast majority of the explosive growth in Mexican cellphone use -- it has grown more than eightfold in four years -- has come in prepaid service. Users pay in advance for a set number of calling minutes by buying a calling card. That system lets lower-income people control carefully how much they spend on the phone, and it relieves the phone provider of most of the credit risk. 
"My opinion is simply that they missed the opportunity on the prepaid side," said Ignacio Ponce de Leon, a bond analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities in New York. "If they had gone with that earlier, they would have done better." 
Even Iusacell's current customers are defecting. Its subscriber rolls fell by about 1 percent in the third quarter, and revenue was 25 percent lower than in the third quarter of 2001. "They are losing to competitors," Mr. Ponce de Leon said.
A Verizon predecessor, Bell Atlantic, first bought a small stake in Iusacell in 1993. It then expanded the stake to 39.4 percent and took operating control in 1997, investing $1.2 billion in all. The company's Mexican founder, Carlos Peralta Quintero, sold his 34.5 percent stake to Vodafone for $974.3 million early this year. The remaining shares are publicly traded. At current prices, its total market capitalization is just $61 million.
To revive the company's fortunes, its chief executive, Carlos Espinal Guifarro, has laid off workers and cut back investment. But most importantly, he has promised that the company will soon offer seamless service in both Mexico and the United States. "That might be what turns the tide," Mr. Ponce de Leon said.
Iusacell executives declined to comment for this article.

HEADLINE: Australian Bank's Earnings Soar on Housing Lending 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

 BODY:
The housing boom in Australia is buoying the country's big banks, but it is being tempered by weakness overseas.
 Yesterday, the country's largest lender, National Australia Bank, reported $1.9 billion in net income for the year ended Sept. 30, a 62 percent increase from the previous year. But when one-time items were excluded, the bank's earnings increased 56.1 percent. 
 The bank, based in Melbourne, said home mortgage lending had risen 18 percent, but income from insurance and fund management had fallen 26 percent because of what its chief financial officer, Richard McKinnon, told shareholders were "the worst investment markets for over a decade."
The bank also cut its earnings forecast for this fiscal year. Investors responded by bidding the bank's stock down 5.4 percent yesterday.
"In April, we were expecting to see signs of a reasonable recovery in the U.S. and in Europe; this will not now be the case," said Frank J. Cicutto, the bank's managing director and chief executive.
National's nearest rival, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, warned last week that falling global stock prices would hurt profits, so shareholders were braced for similar news from National, analysts said. But weaker results from corporate banking and from banks it owns in Britain and Ireland were more of a surprise. 
Analysts said the banks' faltering results signaled that Australia's consumer-driven economy could not shrug off the effects of a severe drought and lower demand for Australian exports much longer.
"It's a reflection of the fact that we've had two economies in Australia: a housing-led boom and a fairly subdued business sector," said Ross Brown of Deutsche Bank in Sydney.
On Wednesday, Australia's prime minister, John Howard, warned that the country's economy would probably grow only about 3 percent this year, lower than the nearly 4 percent the government had forecast.
Anyone watching property markets in Sydney or Melbourne could be forgiven for thinking that Mr. Howard was talking about a different country. Aided by government incentives and low interest rates, Australia's housing market is so hot that rents are falling as tenants line up to become homeowners. But Australia's benchmark stock index has fallen roughly 11 percent this year.
National's results benefited from much smaller one-time charges this year than last. It managed to book a small profit on the sale of its American mortgage lending unit, HomeSide Lending, to Washington Mutual; last year it wrote down its investment in the unit by $2.2 billion.

Because of an editing error, an article in World Business on Friday about results for the National Australia Bank for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 misstated the change in its net income excluding one-time items. The figure fell 5.9 percent; it did not rise 56.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Productivity Is Up Sharply In Good SignFor Long Term 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Productivity, the amount of goods and services Americans produced in each hour they worked, grew rapidly in the third quarter, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The gain was the fifth consecutive quarterly increase, a much stronger performance than usual in times of economic weakness. The continued progress suggested that a significant share of the step-up in economic efficiency achieved during the boom of the late 1990's could continue over the longer run.
 But even though the stronger growth in productivity could lay the foundation for higher incomes, economists said the gains did not necessarily foreshadow a quick upturn in today's slack economy. In part, that is because the sources of productivity gains have changed. Corporate leaders who turned their attention outward in the late 1990's, looking for advanced technologies to expand their businesses, are returning to the search for internal efficiencies -- how to be better, rather than bigger. 
 "We're very much seeing a refocusing on the traditional productivity issues," said Michael van Biema, a professor at Columbia University who recently completed a study of productivity in the service sector. "Companies are looking at trying to do a lot more with less."
Compared with the second quarter, the productivity of workers in nonfarm businesses rose 4 percent in the third quarter while the number of hours they logged changed little. The Labor Department also announced yesterday that first-time claims for unemployment benefits slipped to 390,000 last week, but most Wall Street economists still foresaw a weak fourth quarter.
The notion of doing more with less may already be taking hold in industries that make long-lasting items like refrigerators and furniture. In the summer months, productivity zoomed up 8.8 percent in that area, and hours worked dropped 4 percent. In October, after a string of weak economic reports, layoffs by makers of cars and industrial goods returned to levels not seen since January, said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement specialist that tracks job losses.
Several experts have observed that companies are more willing to move quickly to lay off thousands of workers than in previous slumps. In the past, companies often tried to hold onto workers in bad times because hiring was a costly process. When demand for goods and services fell, leaving less work for the same number of people, productivity would often drop. Now that habit of retention may be disappearing.
"I think the 1990's changed that whole paradigm -- that you rode with your people through the down times," Mr. Challenger said. "We're in a just-in-time environment right now. There are a lot more vehicles for companies to find people, so they're much more accessible. People change careers much more often."
Trends in inflation and executive pay may also have helped to shift the dynamics of hiring and firing.
"Corporate efforts to cut costs are, if anything, even stronger than in previous recoveries," said Jan Hatzius, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. Because inflation is low, dollar figures for sales may look less impressive than in times when prices are rising fast, he said. Reducing expenses may be providing an easier way to improve the profit figures that Wall Street focuses on.
The bulk of savings and profits achieved by higher productivity appears to be flowing to owners and shareholders. In the last 12 months, the Labor Department reported, inflation-adjusted compensation for workers increased 1.7 percent, on an hourly basis, though their productivity shot up 5.3 percent. 
"While the recession was mild last year, the profit decline, at least in the S.& P. 500, was horrible," Mr. Hatzius added. Moreover, "the fact that management's compensation is more directly linked to stock market performance might also have given them an incentive to cut costs more ruthlessly."
Dr. van Biema said managers at several service companies, which are far more numerous than manufacturers, have told him that strategic plans aimed mainly at expansion have given way to intense drives for productivity.
"The response I would get during the preceding four years," Dr. van Biema said, "when everybody was on the Internet bandwagon, was, 'We're not really interested in productivity improvement, we're interested in new growth, new sales and using the Internet.' With the change in the economy, people are focusing on making corporations more productive."
The economy also posted above-average gains in productivity during the Internet boom. But Dr. van Biema said that according to his research, the bulk of the efficiencies were incidental to grand projects for new, often Internet-based businesses. Now, he said, companies are enhancing productivity deliberately, by paying attention to traditional management strategies and, in some cases, by stripping out recently created infrastructure that was never used to its potential.
Even between companies in a single industry, gaps in productivity in the last few years were surprisingly wide. "It was typical that you could find differences of 3 to 1," Dr. van Biema said.
In the future, Mr. Hatzius predicted, productivity gains will settle at a slower, but still historically high, rate. "In terms of the long-term trend, my best guess is still that you are somewhat higher than you were from the mid-70's to the late 90's," he said. "Rather than 1.5 percent, 2 percent seems achievable for the long-term trend."
Yet that forecast should not provide much solace to investors and workers worried about a return to recession.
"The strong productivity growth is a wonderful thing for your long-run living standards, but it doesn't mean you can't have recessions," Mr. Hatzius said, echoing many economists' views. "Talking too much about productivity in a business cycle context makes it sound like a panacea, which I don't think it is. There's certainly a danger that we slip back into recession. It's a pretty significant danger, actually."

HEADLINE: Into The Wilderness 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For those of us who think the nation has taken a disastrous wrong turn these past two years, Tuesday's election changed everything and nothing. 
 Clearly, we're going to have an extended sojourn in the political wilderness. Even criticizing the Bush administration's policies will become far more difficult. It will be hard even to find out what it's up to; the most secretive administration in the nation's history will now be even less forthcoming. And anyone who criticizes the administration, even on purely domestic issues, will be accused of lacking patriotism. After all, that strategy worked even against Senator Max Cleland, a genuine war hero who lost three limbs in his country's service. 
 What hasn't changed is the fundamental wrongness of this administration's direction. Too many pundits, confusing politics with policy -- or engaging in sheer power worship -- imagine that a party that wins a battle must be doing something right. But it ain't necessarily so. Political victory doesn't make a bad policy good; it doesn't make a lie the truth. 
But what do we do about it? 
Some of my friends are in despair. They fear that by the time the political pendulum swings, the damage will be irreparable. A ballooning federal debt, they say, will have made it impossible to deal with the needs of an aging population. Years of unchecked crony capitalism will have destroyed faith in our financial markets. Unilateralist foreign policy will have left us without real allies. And most important of all, environmental neglect will have gone past the point of no return.
They may be right. But we have to behave as if they aren't, and try to turn American politics around.
It won't be easy. There are essentially no moderates left in the Republican Party, so change will have to come from the Democrats. And they are deep in a hole.
It's not just Sept. 11. As Jonathan Chait points out in The New Republic, the Republicans also have a huge structural advantage. They can spend far more money getting their message out; when it comes to free publicity, some of the major broadcast media are simply biased in favor of the Republicans, while the rest tend to blur differences between the parties.
But that's the way it is. Democrats should complain as loudly about the real conservative bias of the media as the Republicans complain about its entirely mythical liberal bias; that will help them get their substantive message across. But first they have to have a message. 
Since the 2000 election, and especially since Sept. 11, much of the Democratic leadership has argued that the party must play it safe -- don't criticize the Bush administration too much, don't propose anything drastic that will offend corporations and the wealthy. What we should have realized, and what Tuesday's election disaster confirms, is that this plays right into Republican advantages. Talk radio and Fox News let the hard right get its message out to its supporters, while those who oppose the juggernaut stay home because they don't get the sense that the Democrats offer a real alternative. 
To have a chance of breaking through the wall of media blur and distraction, the Democrats have to get the public's attention -- which means they have to stand for something. 
It's obvious what the Democrats should stand for: Above all, they should be the defenders of ordinary Americans against the power of our burgeoning plutocracy. That means hammering the Republicans as they back off on corporate reform -- which they will. It means defending the environment against the administration's sly, behind-the-scenes program of dismantling regulation. 
And it means doing what the party has refused to do: coming out forthrightly against tax cuts for corporations and the rich -- both the cuts passed last year and those yet to come. In the next few months the Bush administration will once again demand tax cuts that benefit a tiny elite, in the name of economic stimulus. The Democrats mustn't fall for this line again; they must insist that the way to stimulate the economy is to put money in the hands of people who need it.
If the Democratic Party takes a clear stand for the middle class and against the plutocracy, it may still lose. But if it doesn't stand for anything, it -- and the country -- will surely lose.

HEADLINE: Chief of Utility In Kansas Is Indicted Over a Loan 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
A federal grand jury in Topeka, Kan., indicted David C. Wittig, the chairman and chief executive of Westar Energy Inc., today on fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges relating to a loan he took from a bank in Topeka.
 While the indictment focused solely on the personal loan Mr. Wittig received from Capital City Bank, the stock of Westar -- his employer and the owner of the largest electric utility in the state -- plummeted more than 20 percent after the grand jury's action was announced. 
 Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Wittig, 47, a former Wall Street investment banker, and his personal banker, Clinton O. Weidner III, 49, of falsifying banking records last year to invest $1.5 million in a real estate project in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
Shares of Westar had already fallen by more than 35 percent before today because of mounting losses and soaring debt at the company. They lost another $2.35 today, tumbling to $8.50 a share before the New York Stock Exchange halted trading before noon.
According to the indictment, Mr. Weidner, a loan officer and the former president of Capital City Bank in Topeka, asked Mr. Wittig to invest $1.5 million in a real estate development project in Scottsdale.
Mr. Wittig declined, according to the indictment, but agreed to lend Mr. Weidner the $1.5 million if Mr. Weidner agreed to increase Mr. Wittig's personal line of credit by $1.5 million -- to $5 million. In April 2001, Mr. Weidner increased the line of credit, the indictment said, and then took the money designated as a loan to Mr. Wittig and wired it as a down payment to get a 50 percent interest in the Scottsdale project. He agreed to repay Mr. Wittig, court papers said.
In bank records, Mr. Weidner said that Mr. Wittig would use the additional money to complete renovation of a mansion and for other use, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors accuse the two men of falsifying records and disguising the loan. The indictment says that the loan was discovered last March by the bank. Capital City said today that Mr. Weidner resigned that same month.
A week ago, Westar, which supplies power to over 640,000 customers in Kansas, said that it would restate its earnings for the first half of the year and report an even larger loss for the period after uncovering accounting errors.
In September, Westar -- formerly known as Western Resources Inc. -- announced that a federal grand jury had subpoenaed records and testimony from company officials about the use of corporate aircraft and their conduct of annual shareholders meetings.
Westar, which is based in Topeka, issued a terse statement late today that said Mr. Wittig had asked to be placed on administrative leave so that he could defend himself against the charges. He has worked at Westar for more than five years.
"The board of directors has agreed to this request and has placed Mr. Wittig on administrative leave without pay," the company said. "The board intends to appoint an acting president and chief executive officer promptly."
Westar declined to say if Mr. Wittig remained chairman.
Analysts said the indictment darkens a cloud over the company, which had revenues of $2.1 billion last year.
"This is a personal issue, but it raises more concerns about the possible misuse of the corporate aircraft and the possibility of shareholder lawsuits," said Markos Kaminis, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
Neither Mr. Wittig nor Mr. Weidner would comment.
James Eisenbrandt, a lawyer for Mr. Wittig, issued a statement saying his client is not guilty.
"The line of credit provided to Mr. Wittig was proper," Mr. Eisenbrandt said in a statement. "It and the loan to Mr. Weidner were paid in full, plus interest; and neither the bank nor any federal agency lost one penny."
In a telephone interview, Robert Eye, a lawyer for Mr. Weidner, added, "Once the evidence is presented, Mr. Weidner will be vindicated."
Mr. Wittig, a former investment banker who worked in New York at Kidder, Peabody & Company and rose to become co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers before leaving in 1995, grew up in Prairie Village, Kan., and graduated from the University of Kansas at Lawrence with a degree in economics in 1977. He returned to Kansas in 1995 to join Western Resources, which bought Kansas City Power and Light in 1998.
Last year, at hearings over a rate increase, a consultant to the state's consumer advocate said that Mr. Wittig and other executives appeared to have used Westar's corporate jet for personal use.
The United States attorney's office is investigating the company's use of the corporate jet. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 9, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the indictment of the chief executive of Westar Energy on fraud and other charges referred incorrectly to the company's bid to acquire Kansas City Power and Light in 1998. The two companies did agree to merge, but the deal was never completed; Kansas City Power and Light is now a unit of Great Plains Energy.

HEADLINE: Peace Plan By U.S. Splits Netanyahu And Sharon 

BYLINE:  By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
A dispute between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his new foreign minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over an American blueprint for peace emerged here today, reflecting the strains between them as they prepare to compete for the leadership of the Likud Party.
 Mr. Netanyahu took office on Wednesday, promising to work harmoniously with Mr. Sharon, but signs of tension between the two men quickly appeared. They are to face each other in a party primary in the next few weeks that will determine the Likud's candidate for prime minister in national elections expected in January. 
 After a meeting between the two on Wednesday night, in which they reportedly discussed policy differences and the timing of the primary, there were public indications today that the two men did not see eye to eye.
Their policy disagreement was over a recently proposed American "road map" to peace, which envisions a Palestinian state in three years. Although Mr. Sharon has criticized the plan, he has been careful not to dismiss it out of hand, saying Israel would study it carefully before responding.
Mr. Netanyahu, in contrast, told reporters after he took office that the American road map was not on the agenda at the moment. The expected war in Iraq would put off discussion of it, he said. Mr. Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state, while Mr. Sharon has said he accepts the idea.
According to Israeli media reports, Mr. Sharon complained to Mr. Netanyahu about his remarks in their meeting on Wednesday. Mr. Sharon made his views public today.
"I will not tolerate harm to our international relations, harm that might seriously damage our international standing and our efforts to bring economic assistance to the State of Israel," he said in a speech. "That is why I announced that I will not harm the deep strategic understandings with the United States, and the special relationship formed with the American administration."
After Mr. Sharon's coalition with the Labor Party fell apart last week, his aides gave assurances that he would keep all of his commitments to President Bush, including a pledge not to harm Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Mr. Sharon said he would not depart from the government's policy guidelines, adopted when he formed his coalition.
Mr. Netanyahu, for his part, said on Tuesday that an American attack on Iraq that would topple Saddam Hussein would provide a good opportunity to banish Mr. Arafat.
In the West Bank today, a Palestinian suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt and another Palestinian were killed when the device blew up under army fire at a checkpoint near Nablus.
After an alert went out for a suicide bomber heading for Israel, soldiers at the checkpoint stopped a taxi and ordered passengers out, telling them to lift their shirts, an army spokesman said. The soldiers saw that one man was wearing an explosive belt, and when he ran toward them, they opened fire, detonating the bomb, the spokesman added.

HEADLINE: Pataki Plans Larger Role Downtown 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
After remaining largely removed from the details of the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan over the last year, Gov. George E. Pataki plans to take a more direct role in the process, state officials say, starting with considering major changes in the leadership and structure of the rebuilding effort.
 Among the changes being discussed are ways to satisfy New York City officials' desire for more influence over what happens at the former World Trade Center site, officials close to the governor say. 
 In addition, some people close to the governor are pushing for the replacement of John C. Whitehead as chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency coordinating the rebuilding. Mr. Whitehead said yesterday that he had not been asked to resign and that he had no intention of stepping down. 
During Mr. Pataki's re-election campaign, critics said he was not taking a leadership role in the rebuilding because forceful decisions could anger constituencies vital to the campaign.
He has more control over the process than any other official. He appoints half the directors of the development corporation and, with the New Jersey governor, controls the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site. Also, much of the federal money related to the recovery effort runs through state agencies. 
With his re-election secured, Mr. Pataki has less reason to worry that decisions about the rebuilding could become a political liability. 
The anticipated change in focus by the governor is intended to speed the pace of redevelopment and to set clear goals for the next stage, which begins next month when a new round of design plans will be released to the public. From those plans, three designs will be chosen early next year.
Rebuilding officials say that while they believe much has been accomplished so far -- for example, in getting money for projects, beginning transit repairs and planning a memorial -- city and state officials are aware there is little concrete evidence of progress to display to the public. 
Among the changes now being contemplated are ways of giving New York City a more direct role in the rebuilding, state officials say. Although the mayor appoints half the development corporation's directors, the agency's staff is full of Pataki allies, and the city has almost no influence over the Port Authority.
Louis R. Tomson, the president of the development corporation and a close ally of Mr. Pataki, said in an interview Wednesday evening that the governor wants to include Mr. Bloomberg in any changes. 
"He feels very strongly that he's got a responsibility as governor to collaborate with the mayor in making sure that Lower Manhattan is rebuilt," Mr. Tomson said, adding, "I think we'll find a way to accommodate them having more say."
Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said the city's main focus has been "on making sure that the planning process doesn't overly focus on the World Trade Center site itself, but instead meets the needs of Lower Manhattan as a whole and the city as a whole."
Mr. Bloomberg has said the city is working on its own rebuilding ideas, and city officials say those are expected to be released in two weeks. 
The city, facing a $5 billion budget gap next fiscal year, will need money to make all those things happen. Money is one thing the development corporation has -- as much as $7.3 billion, including $4.5 billion in money allocated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency that will be used for transportation projects, and $2.8 billion in Community Development Block Grant money allocated to the development corporation for housing grants and other development projects.
With the state also facing a large budget gap, and with New Jersey making claims to some of the transportation money through its control of the Port Authority, the development corporation's bank account is all but certain to be the focus of intense wrangling.
When the development corporation was created one year ago, Mr. Pataki appointed Mr. Whitehead as its chairman, in part because, as someone who held high positions on Wall Street and in Washington, he would be seen as not easily influenced by politics. 
Officials in the governor's office, though, grew irate at Mr. Whitehead's repeated displays of independence, including criticism of some state business grant programs. Now, speculation about Mr. Whitehead's imminent replacement is widespread. 
Michael McKeon, the communications director for Mr. Pataki, said yesterday that there were no current plans to replace him. "It's always natural after a year of time to evaluate what has happened and how to improve on something," Mr. McKeon said. 
Mr. Whitehead said that although he was reluctant at first to take the job, "I'm into it now." He added, "I have no plans to quit, and I have no desire to be relieved of my responsibilities."
State officials said efforts might be made to restructure the development corporation's functions, possibly by removing the function of planning for a memorial from the rebuilding effort. 
Mr. Tomson himself also has been the subject of speculation about whether he will leave his job soon. He commutes weekly to his home near Albany and is said by people close to him to be eager to reduce his workload. 
In an interview, Mr. Tomson said that he intended to remain in his job until a clear plan for the trade center site is decided upon, but that he intended to leave soon thereafter. He said he believed that should be accomplished "in the near future," almost certainly by midyear.

HEADLINE: Notes Show Fed Concern Over Limits 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Some Federal Reserve policy makers expressed concern in September that the current low rate of inflation might limit their choices in cutting short-term interest rates to bolster the economy, according to meeting minutes released today. 
 "Some observed that a significant decline in inflation from current levels could imply an unwelcome tightening of monetary policy in real terms," according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept. 24. 
 "In addition," the minutes said, "further sizable disinflation that resulted in a nominal inflation rate near zero could create problems for the implementation of monetary policy through conventional means in the event of an adverse shock to the economy that called for negative real policy interest rates." 
The discussion may shed some light on why the Fed left interest rates unchanged at the September meeting, on a 10-to-2 vote, as the central bank worried that it could be edging closer to running out of ammunition in the form of rate cuts. 
At its meeting on Wednesday, policy makers cut the federal funds rate to 1.25 percent, a four-decade low. 
According to the minutes, two committee members -- Edward M. Gramlich, a Fed governor, and Robert D. McTeer Jr., president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas -- argued that the potential costs of cutting rates in September were low compared with the risk of additional economic weakness. 
The Fed cut rates 11 times in 2001 in an attempt to stave off recession but had held rates steady through 2002 until Wednesday's surprisingly large cut of half a percentage point. 
The minutes said forecasts pointed to "quite low and perhaps declining inflation over the next several quarters," and the panel members "did not rule out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation."
The Fed members also pointed out that heightened "geopolitical risks," assumed by Fed watchers to be a reference to a possible war with Iraq, were a "major source of uncertainty" in the economy. 
But the members did not intend to signal they would take a specific action, the minutes said.

HEADLINE: Refusing to Follow Move by Fed, Europeans Hold Key Rate Steady 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Bucking both the Federal Reserve and the increasingly plaintive calls of European politicians, Europe's central bank said today that it would leave interest rates unchanged.
 A day after an unexpectedly steep cut in interest rates in the United States, the European Central Bank said it would wait for more evidence that the economy there was faltering before it lowered its benchmark rate. 
 The Bank of England also left its key rate unchanged today, though with Britain's economy in generally better shape than those of the three big Continental nations -- Germany, France and Italy -- the decision was less contentious.
With new statistics showing rising unemployment in the largest economy, Germany, economists say a cut in the European benchmark rate, which now stands at 3.25 percent, is long overdue. The Germans, they say, need a looser monetary policy to revive an economy on the brink of a double-dip recession. 
"All the economic arguments were in favor of cutting rates today," said Martin W. Hufner, chief economist at Hypovereinsbank in Munich. "They'll have to do it in the next month or two months."
Mr. Hufner and other critics said that in holding the line now, the European bank seemed motivated less by economic calculations than by the desire to avoid looking like a handmaiden of the Fed. "It's never a good thing when the Fed cuts rates on a Wednesday and the E.C.B. cuts them on a Thursday," Mr. Hufner said. "It gives them the image of a junior partner, which they don't want to have."
The bank also does not like the appearance of capitulating to pressure from political leaders in the 12 countries in the euro zone, for which it sets monetary policy. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany and other officials have urged the bank to lower rates, as have major companies like Siemens.
"These are all quite petty reasons," said Cesar Molinas, the head of fixed-income strategy at Merrill Lynch in London. "But like it or not, these institutions find themselves immersed in politics."
Some economists say the bank may have wanted to avoid the mixed market reaction to the Fed's half-point rate cut. Stock prices jumped after the announcement on Wednesday, then fell back sharply before rising again as investors sought to make sense of the altered economic landscape in the wake of the election. Today, United States stock indexes fell more than 2 percent. 
With European interest rates remaining well above those in America, the euro continued to rise against the dollar after the bank made its announcement. But despite the sluggish performance of the American economy, it is expected to do better than those in Western Europe, helping to sustain the capital flows into the United States that are needed to finance a huge current-account deficit.
Stock markets across Europe tumbled today, though few investors had truly expected the central bank to cut rates. Investors were more focused on signals that the bank might be preparing to ease its stance later.
The bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, noted for the first time that the governing council had engaged in a spirited debate whether to cut rates. He also said the bank would watch closely for further signs of erosion in growth -- declaring that the data so far painted a conflicting picture.
Mr. Duisenberg reiterated that the bank's primary mission was not to spur growth, but to curb inflation. Inflation is now running at a rate of 2.2 percent, above the 2 percent ceiling set by the European Union. Mr. Duisenberg said he was not overly concerned as long as oil prices did not spike.
Picking up a theme of the Fed's, Mr. Duisenberg said confidence in Europe had been rattled by "geopolitical tensions" -- an allusion to President Bush's intended military strike against Iraq. The uncertainty, he said, was enough to derail an expected recovery in European economies.
Germany, which reported its jobless figures for October, provided the starkest evidence of that weakness. The number of people out of work rose by 22,000, to 4.12 million on a seasonally adjusted basis -- its highest level in nearly four years. The unemployment rate increased to 9.9 percent from 9.8 percent.
Germany also reported unexpectedly weak manufacturing orders in September, suggesting that the worst might be yet to come. Some experts say unemployment is likely to climb above 4.5 million this winter.
Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said, "Relaxing monetary policy would be a positive impulse for Germany, but it will not solve the underlying problems in the economy." 
Other experts noted that tailoring European monetary policy to the economy of Germany would put healthier countries at risk. Ireland, for example, is still growing; lower rates could spur inflation there.
"The problem with a one-size-fits-all monetary policy is that it fits only the most average country," Mr. Molinas said.
Mr. Duisenberg disputed the suggestion that the European bank was somehow responsible for the misery in Germany. He urged European political leaders to adopt sound fiscal policies and to overhaul their economies.
Asked whether he was taking a hard line on interest rates as a way to punish the politicians for their profligate spending and budget deficits, Mr. Duisenberg paraphrased Queen Victoria: "I am not amused."

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Says 9/11 Grants To Businesses Are Taxable 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service says that government money to help Lower Manhattan small businesses recover from the September 2001 attack is subject to federal taxes, even though grants to individuals for personal expenses like housing are not.
 In a letter sent Wednesday to New York's Congressional delegation, Charles O. Rossotti, on his last day as I.R.S. commissioner after recently announcing his resignation, said that current law required this. But he also said that a business receiving the aid would generally not pay taxes on the full amount, because it could offset against the grant amount the deductible business expenses paid with the money. 
 But members of Congress and spokesmen for small businesses in Lower Manhattan, who had been pressing for the I.R.S. to declare flatly that the grants would be exempt from federal taxes, were critical of Mr. Rossotti's letter after receiving copies yesterday. 
They said that despite expense-deduction provisions in the tax code, much of the grant money would still be returned to the government in taxes, and that using the deductibility provisions to minimize taxes on the grants would be complex and burdensome for most small businesses, in contrast to a simple exemption of the grants from taxes.
"Downtown business owners don't need to be spending their time on tax-avoidance planning, as the commissioner is suggesting," Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of Manhattan and Queens, said. "They need to be spending their time rebuilding their businesses."
And Senator Charles E. Schumer said, "My overall reaction is that in many instances small businesses will be required to pay taxes on the grants, and that was never the intent of Congress." He said that if the I.R.S. did not change its interpretation, he would press for legislation "so that no grant recipient would pay taxes" on the money. 
The grants come from the two major programs intended for small-business recovery and revival in Lower Manhattan, both run by the state and city with federal funds. 
One program provides businesses with up to 500 employees compensation for up to 25 days' worth of revenue losses. Under the other program, many businesses that have up to 200 workers, and that sign new or renewal leases of at least five years in the area by the end of 2004, can seek up to $5,000 per employee.
In explaining why expense-deduction provisions in the tax code would not necessarily wipe out taxes on a grant, Michael Hirschfeld, a Manhattan tax lawyer, gave the examples of two businesses receiving $20,000 grants late in the same year. 
One spends all $20,000 for business costs in that year, and no taxes have to be paid on the $20,000. The other spends only $10,000 of the grant that year, and the remaining $10,000 early the next year. It has to pay taxes in the year it received the grant, on the $10,000 not spent that year.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Sues Hedge Fund Manager 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The hedge fund manager Beacon Hill Asset Management was sued yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the firm of failing to disclose huge portfolio losses earlier this year. 
 The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, accuses Beacon Hill of overstating the values of two hedge funds it manages, Bristol and Safe Harbor, between July and September while the funds lost $400 million, or 54 percent. 
 The suit seeks both civil penalties and the transfer of fund assets to a new investment manager independent of Beacon Hill. Beacon Hill has agreed to move the assets of the funds to a rival, the Ellington Management Group, a spokesman said. 
Beacon Hill, founded in 1997, told investors in early October that its funds had lost 25 percent in September. A few weeks later, the group more than doubled loss estimates and said it would close the funds over the next six months. A spokesman, Armel Leslie, said the firm "has agreed to effect an orderly transition of the funds to a new investment manager." 
The S.E.C. suit attributed the losses largely to short positions taken on Treasury securities, which have rallied in recent months as interest rates fell to their lowest level in almost 40 years. 
Beacon Hill is one of the biggest hedge fund managers in the mortgage-bond market, and the short positions in Treasuries were intended to "mitigate the effects of interest rate movements" on its portfolio, the S.E.C. suit says. 
Beacon Hill, based in Summit, N.J., also has offshore offices in the Cayman Islands. It is 50 percent owned by the Asset Alliance Corporation, the investment company run by Bruce Lipnick, its chairman and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
In the Politics Of New York, Popularity Tops Cash

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
It was the most expensive political race in New York history and probably the most expensive ever in the United States, outside of a presidential contest. But when the polls closed on Tuesday, it was hard to say exactly what the politicians had bought with a combined investment of at least $140 million.
 Turnout as a percentage of registered voters was the lowest in at least 70 years for a governor's race in New York. And the winner was the candidate who anyone with even a modest interest in the contest could have predicted. 
 The final spending tallies for the individual candidates are still not available. But spokesmen for candidates estimated that Tom Golisano spent about $70 million and H. Carl McCall about $15 million. Gov. George E. Pataki invested at least $45 million in the race. And Andrew M. Cuomo, who dropped out of the Democratic primary against Mr. McCall, spent an additional $12 million.
The previous record in a nonpresidential campaign in the United States was the $119 million spent in the 1998 California governor's race. No other race in the United States this year appears to have come close to New York's, even in Texas and in California, contests where wealthy candidates relied at least partly on their own fortunes.
So what lessons are to be learned from New York State's gold-plated campaign? There are at least two, campaign finance experts and political consultants said. No matter how rich you are, if you do not have the backing of the Democratic or the Republican Party, it is extremely difficult to win a statewide election in New York. And even if you come from a major party, if you are trying to oust an incumbent as popular as Mr. Pataki, you have to have a large reserve of money in the bank.
"The problem is, how do you oust someone who is popular?" said Robert M. Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies, a campaign finance research group. 
Affluent candidates willing to bankroll their own campaigns have been successful in American politics. But they generally win an election -- as did Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and United States Senator Jon S. Corzine -- only once they have the endorsement from a major party.
Mr. Golisano, who ran as an Independence Party candidate, spent just about as much as H. Ross Perot did nationwide in 1992 as a Reform Party candidate, once the numbers are adjusted for inflation. Yet neither got more than 20 percent of the vote.
Having spent about $110 for each of the 634,000 votes he won on Tuesday, Mr. Golisano, a billionaire businessman, did raise his name recognition. And he earned more votes in this race, his third, and the one in which he spent by far the most.
His campaign spokesman said that Mr. Golisano knew his candidacy was a long shot, but that, if he was going to go for it, he might as well go full throttle. "He is an entrepreneur," said Ernest Baynard, the spokesman. "As a man who has smartly taken chances in his life, he believes it is better to dare mightily and fail, than to not be on the field at all."
Mr. Pataki always led in the polls, and he was able to collect millions from individuals and companies that do business with the state.
Among his largest donors were Douglas Durst, the Times Square developer; Charles B. Wang, the chief executive of Computer Associates, which is a state contractor; and Steven Roth, who owns shopping malls and office buildings. 
Even in the final days of the campaign, Mr. Pataki was able to pull in large sums -- more than $1.1 million in donations of more than $1,000 each, compared with just more than $210,000 for Mr. McCall -- including at least $25,000 each from Harris Beach, the Rochester law firm; Jack J. Dreyfus Jr., founder of the Dreyfus Corporation; and Michael B. Picotte, an Albany real estate developer, according to campaign finance documents. 
As for Mr. McCall, he came out of the Democratic primary with $2 million in the bank. Mr. Pataki had more than $20 million. Mr. McCall's campaign manager says it was a handicap from which Mr. McCall could never fully recover. "The negative advertising was effective in distorting Carl McCall's record," said Allen P. Cappelli, the campaign manager. "And we did not have the resources to adequately respond."
Even if Mr. McCall had raised as much as Mr. Pataki, it is not clear he would have won, Mr. Stern and others said. But one lesson that no one could debate is that with each year that passes, the price tag for entering the game of politics in New York State seems only to go higher. Mr. McCall learned that the hard way.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Leaving Ghosts Behind in a Quest for a Better Life

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO 

 BODY:
Valerie Ujueta lives less than 20 feet from Linden Hill Cemetery in Queens. It's the only house on the block, a place where, from time to time, black cats can be seen chasing each other up and down the stairs.
 "It's peaceful; nobody bothers us," she said. 
 To outsiders, the house may seem haunted. And the woman who lives there? In some ways, she is. 
For Ms. Ujueta, abandonment and loss have been running themes in a 43-year life. She has been widowed twice, and after the Sept. 11 attacks she lost a job at a company that sorted mail for the World Trade Center. The work helped pay the bills for her and her six children: Jastin, 18; Gisselle, 17; Jordan, 12; Jilliann, 11; Joshua, 10; and Jeremy, 8.
But there is one thing Ms. Ujueta refuses to lose: her hope for a brighter future. Aided by agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, she is trying hard to keep the ghosts at bay.
Ms. Ujueta's resilience was born of hardship. Her first husband, Jastin and Gisselle's father, died. She returned to Queens and rented the house near the cemetery, renovating, cleaning and painting the inside herself. In 1987 she remarried, to Carlos Ujueta, who did computer repairs. She had four more children with him.
The Ujuetas had planned to drive to Orlando the month Mr. Ujueta died in 1996 of a brain aneurysm. They were going to take the children to Disney World, and maybe even move to Florida. Instead, Ms. Ujueta was left to care for the six children.
Ms. Ujueta was determined to keep her family together, although her husband's relatives suggested that the children might be better off with them. She told her brother, Ronnie Tringali, " 'I'm not giving them away,' " she remembered.
"To me, they're all I really have," she said, looking at four of the children, who had joined her in their home. "They're everything to me." 
Ms. Ujueta had the support of her brother. But he fell ill in 1995, and Ms. Ujueta cared for him until he died.
In 1997, she took a job at Global Research Distribution in Queens, where she worked nights sorting financial mail going to and from the trade center. Ms. Ujueta received merit raises after three months, and more raises and responsibilities followed. So did 9/11.
Ms. Ujueta was preparing her children for school on Sept. 11, when she saw the holes that had been ripped in the buildings across the river. They all watched the towers collapse.
"But I saw this, never thinking it would affect my job," she said. "My whole world fell apart."
Her company found itself forced to cut costs. Ms. Ujueta was laid off. Though eligible for disaster relief funds from the Red Cross, she has not been able to find steady work since Sept. 12, 2001.
Ms. Ujueta makes purses out of burlap and the legs of old jeans, selling them for $10 to make ends meet. But it has not been enough. Her grandmother, who is 91, sends her money when she can, and the children help her around the house. But caring for her children and trying to find work are difficult, and she no longer receives disaster unemployment benefits.
The Red Cross gave her a phone number for the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven agencies that receive money from the Neediest Cases Fund. Ms. Ujueta called and spoke with Diana Naftal, a social worker at the agency's Atlantic Avenue office.
With winter approaching, the agency gave $600 to Ms. Ujueta to buy each child a new coat and a new pair of boots. It also gave her $308 to pay her three-month-old phone bill.
Catholic Charities, another agency that receives funding from Neediest Cases, gave her $486 to prevent her electricity from being turned off.
"What impressed me most was that she made this vow to herself that she'd always be there for her kids," Ms. Naftal said. "Through all this, she's been a normalizing presence. She's made it O.K. for them. They know that she can do that. She's willing to do anything." 
Ms. Ujueta is benefiting from Ms. Naftal's agency in other ways. Intent on changing her life, she is learning how to write a resume and is registering for computer classes. Gisselle wants to be a beautician and is looking into taking classes, and Ms. Ujueta has been enrolling the children in after-school activities.
Ms. Ujueta has begun working for a cousin who owns a beauty salon in Merrick, on Long Island -- sweeping the floors and washing hair three days a week -- while continuing to look for work elsewhere. She also dreams of renting a house from her in Bellmore. There, Ms. Ujueta hopes, her daughter will not have to worry about being harassed by gangs, and the children will be able to attend better schools.
And all those ghosts may seem a little farther away.
"It made all the difference to have somebody on my side," she said.

HEADLINE: Council Votes To Raise Pay For 50,000 In Health Care 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The City Council unanimously approved a union-supported bill yesterday that would raise wages for more than 50,000 workers employed by agencies that have city contracts to provide day care, home care and help for people with cerebral palsy. 
 The sponsors of the so-called living wage bill say the legislation is needed because it is wrong for city contractors to pay some workers so little that they live in poverty. 
 Under the new bill, day care, home care and cerebral palsy workers employed by companies with city contracts must receive at least $8.10 an hour with health coverage, or $9.60 an hour without coverage. Over four years, those minimums will rise by $1.90 an hour and then be indexed to inflation. 
The Council passed the bill, 46 to 0, after months of wrangling with the Bloomberg administration, which had criticized an earlier, more ambitious version of the bill as too expensive. Mayoral aides estimated that the earlier bill would have cost the city $100 million when it faces a $5 billion deficit.
In the hope of winning mayoral support, Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, worked with other council members to scale back the bill last week. Mr. Miller said the revised bill would cost the city about $1 million this year and $2 million next year. "In bad times, a good investment is still a good investment, and perhaps even more important to make," he said.
The new version of the bill excludes several groups covered by the original version: about 250 employees at business improvement districts and 2,700 workers -- mostly janitors, security guards, cooks and mailroom workers -- at businesses that received grants or tax subsidies to persuade the businesses to remain in the city. The revised bill also excluded cleaning workers and security guards at buildings where the city rented a large amount of space.
Three unions lobbied strongly for the bill: 1199/S.E.I.U., the health care union that represents 50,000 of the home care workers covered by the bill who average $7.50 an hour; the United Federation of Teachers, which represents nearly 1,000 employees at United Cerebral Palsy; and District 1707, which represents about 8,000 day care workers. The bill was also backed strongly by the Working Families Party and by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now and the New York City Central Labor Council. 
Almost all the money to finance the raises for the workers will come from Albany. 
"This is not merely a pay raise for deserving workers, it is a lift for the local communities and businesses where the money will be spent," said Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council. But Mr. McLaughlin said the bill fell short because thousands of workers were excluded. Several council members said they would seek to expand the bill's coverage in future legislation.
"Those corporations that got out of the net, we're going to come back with a bigger net," said Bill Perkins, one of the bill's main sponsors.
The city's largest janitors' union, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, had unsuccessfully lobbied for the bill to include the janitors and security guards later excluded. But that union gained a victory yesterday when the Council voted, 45 to 1, to approve a bill that would bar new building owners or new cleaning companies at buildings from laying off the building's old janitorial staff for 90 days. 
Larry Engelstein, the union's general counsel, said hundreds of janitors were thrown out of work each year when new landlords or cleaning companies came in. "We've had a series of contractors that came in, threw the workers out, and that unsettled their situations and left their families without income," he said. 
Mr. Miller said he was optimistic that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg would sign the bills. Jordan Barowitz, a City Hall spokesman, said, "We will review the bills, but we have concerns." 
During the vote, more than 100 members of Local 32BJ sat in the balcony of the Council's chambers and chanted their union's name. Several council members interrupted their speeches to lead the chants.

HEADLINE: To Shrink Education Budget, Klein May Halve Tuition Grants for Teaching Fellows 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein may cut financing for a program that has drawn people from other careers into teaching and helped New York City fill hundreds of vacancies in its poorest, lowest-performing schools.
 Under the two-year-old program, New York City Teaching Fellows, the Department of Education pays the entire bill for people from other careers to get master's degrees while they teach in troubled schools. The department pays about $12,000 for each fellow to get a master's degree in education during the first two years of teaching, but Mr. Klein is considering cutting that amount by up to half as he looks for ways to trim the school system's $12 billion budget. 
 Teaching fellows might be able to cover the loss with grants from AmeriCorps, a national service program that provides tuition reimbursement for people who work in poor communities, education officials said yesterday.
The city no longer has a severe shortage of certified teachers, because of the fellows program, other aggressive recruitment efforts and a recent contract that raised teacher pay by up to 22 percent. But the city still projects that it will need at least 8,000 new teachers a year as baby boomers retire and attrition rates remain high. Since a new state policy requires all public school teachers to be certified by September 2003, Mr. Klein cannot afford to eliminate the fellows program altogether, the officials said.
David Chai, a spokesman for Mr. Klein, said yesterday that, in fact, Mr. Klein liked the teaching fellows program and wanted to continue increasing the number of fellows. But Mr. Chai confirmed that the chancellor was looking for outside funds for the fellows' tuition.
"He believes there is an enormous cadre of talent there, and that there is tons of potential to increase the numbers," Mr. Chai said. "But he is also mindful of the current budget constraints."
Harold O. Levy, the former chancellor, created the fellows program in 2000, when he was under a court order to hire only certified teachers for the city's 100 worst-performing schools. The State Education Department created an alternative form of certification just for the fellows, who needed no teaching experience but had to be college graduates with a grade point average of at least 3.0.
To get the alternative certification, the fellows needed only to take a summer crash course in teaching, pass two state certification exams and start their master's programs when they began teaching in September.
Thousands of lawyers, accountants, social workers, businesspeople and others have applied to the program, whose first advertisements trumpeted the fact that most New York City fourth graders read and wrote below grade level and asked, "Are you willing to do something about it?" 
Though the program was originally aimed at people who had tried at least one career and were seeking more meaningful work, it has drawn an increasing number of recent college graduates, lured by the promise of a free master's degree in tough economic times.
About 320 fellows started teaching in September 2000, and the total has grown to almost 3,000 this fall. Interest in the program rose sharply last year after the Sept. 11 attack, and many applicants told the department that they wanted to do something more meaningful with their lives. But the program was also attracting people who craved job stability. About 15,000 people applied to be teaching fellows last year, 1,925 entered the program in the summer and 1,759 remain. A total of 414 fellows have quit the program and left the school system, according to the department.
Several officials involved with the program said one option was for AmeriCorps to finance part of each fellow's master's program. Teaching fellows are already eligible for AmeriCorps grants of up to $4,725 a year for two years, which they must use for student loan repayment or other higher-education expenses.
But fellows cannot get the AmeriCorps money until they complete a year of teaching. It was unclear yesterday whether Mr. Klein expected future fellows to pay part of their tuition out of pocket and wait two years to get reimbursed, a scenario that might discourage people from applying.
Mr. Chai said Mr. Klein was looking for ways to shrink not just the amount the Department of Education pays for fellows' tuition, but other program expenses as well. Recruitment and advertising are other costly pieces of the program, along with mentoring by experienced teachers -- required for all fellows during their first year of teaching -- and the $3,000 stipends that the school system pays fellows while they complete the summer training. Altogether, the department pays about $25,000 per fellow.
"He is looking at all aspects of the program to see if there are indeed cases where we can get a better bang for the buck," Mr. Chai said.
Alfred S. Posamentier, the dean of education at City College, where many teaching fellows are getting their master's degrees, said he thought that fewer fellows would abandon the school system if they had to pay for part of their master's programs. "People value things more if they have a financial investment in it than if they're given it completely for free," he said.

HEADLINE: El Museo Is Thinking Outside the Barrio; 
Incoming Leader Inherits Debate Over Museum's Cultural Mission

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
El Museo del Barrio officials were ecstatic: their Frida Kahlo exhibition was a blockbuster.
 Before it ended in September, the exhibition drew more than 70,000 visitors over four months, tens of thousands more than usually visit the museum in an entire year. It even brought the stars and the paparazzi out one night for a showing of the movie "Frida," with the actress Salma Hayek among the hip New York crowd that strolled from the museum's theater to the gallery where Kahlo's self-portraits were on view along with works by Diego Rivera and other Mexican modernist painters. 
 It was the kind of exhibition that fit in with the officials' ambitions to make El Museo, on Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, a world-class cultural institution for anything Latino.. 
"El Barrio" is the East Harlem neighborhood that created El Museo in the 1960's as a place of cultural pride for Puerto Ricans, and as space for art not represented elsewhere. But around El Barrio, there are fears that exhibitions showcasing the likes of Frida Kahlo are helping subvert the museum's original function by gradually displacing the community-based artists it was intended for. 
The debate over the long-term vision for El Museo is about to fall into the lap of Julian Zugazagoitia, 38, El Museo's newly appointed director, the first who is not Puerto Rican. A museum administrator and curator who was born and raised in Mexico, Mr. Zugazagoitia (pronounced soo-gah-zah-go-ee-TEE-a) takes the helm on Nov. 18 at a time not only of heightened criticism, but of post-Sept. 11 belt-tightening that has put a damper on the museum's dreams of expansion.
With his decidedly outsider's background, Mr. Zugazagoitia, who was executive assistant to the director of the Guggenheim Museum, could become a lightning rod for complaints from those worried that the museum is becoming estranged from its neighborhood. 
"All we have is El Museo del Barrio," said Juan Sanchez, a painter, photographer and printmaker who is part of a campaign to keep El Museo true to its roots. 
"Latin America never includes Puerto Rico as part of the Latin American experience in art, while we're also marginalized from the American scene," said Mr. Sanchez, who was born in Brooklyn to Puerto Rican parents. He has exhibited at El Museo and at major museums like the Museum of Modern Art. "The threat of El Museo losing its identity as a Puerto Rican institution is very critical for us."
Mr. Zugazagoitia has a doctorate in philosophy and aesthetics from the Sorbonne and vast international experience that includes serving as director of visual arts for the Spoleto Festival in Italy and as special adviser to the director of the Getty Conservation Institute and a consultant to it.
Until 1999, when he arrived in New York, he lived in Paris and elsewhere in Europe for nearly 20 years.
In an interview at El Museo's offices, Mr. Zugazagoitia was unfazed by the criticism. He said he hoped to channel "all this effervescence" into something constructive that moves beyond discussion to make El Museo's voice even stronger in the art world. "The community is close to the museum, and that's a positive thing," he said.
To some Puerto Ricans, El Museo's working-class, socially conscious origins make it a symbol as emotional as Vieques, the Puerto Rican island used by the United States Navy for target practice. The search for a new director over the summer set off a petition drive, rallies and calls for community participation in the selection, to no avail. 
Now the same advocates, including artists, scholars and members of the cultural affairs committee of Community Board 11, are pressing for representation from their ranks on the museum's board in a campaign called "We Are Watching You." Museum officials said there was consensus among them to add such representation.
"It's not just about paintings; it's about our history," said Arlene Davila, an assistant professor of American studies at New York University who is among those who have met with museum officials. 
But El Museo, which was so mismanaged in the mid-1980's that the city froze its government financing, has been able to thrive financially and gain more visibility by striking a balance between its mission and what is popular. In the 1990's, its mission was broadened to preserving and promoting "the cultural heritage of Puerto Ricans and all Latin Americans in the United States," taking into account New York's increasingly diverse Hispanic population.
It has made room for more works from Latin America, which Museo officials say connect that population with its historical and aesthetic past.
"We can't limit ourselves," said Tony Bechara, a painter who is chairman of El Museo's 23 trustees, 12 of them Puerto Rican, he said. "We tried that, and we were going bankrupt." 
Critics say they welcome inclusion; El Museo has always shown other Latin American artists. But they want it to remain a Puerto Rican institution. Their wish list also includes proposals that Mr. Zugazagoitia said he would happily carry out, like permanent space for an exhibition documenting El Museo's history and new programs to train Latino curators and artists. But he said the real challenge is how much can be done in a more constrained financial climate.
"Sept. 11 can be seen as a turning point for many things, especially the ability of capturing and seizing corporate generosity," he said.
While El Museo remains on solid financial ground, officials said, it expects its financing from the city and private sources to shrink in the economic downturn. So far, board officials said, El Museo's budget continues to grow, and plans for a $6 million renovation, including a new courtyard cafe, are going forward.
But El Museo's expansion plans suffered a blow this year when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg decided to give the renovated Tweed Courthouse in Lower Manhattan to the public schools system rather than to the Museum of the City of New York. That museum is just a block from El Museo, which had hoped to expand into its neighbor's site and acquire five times its current space.
The expansion may still happen, but for now El Museo must make do with only three gallery spaces, a 599-seat theater and offices scattered on two floors of the city-owned Heckscher Building.
The limited space allows for only a permanent exhibition of Taino art, from the indigenous people of the Caribbean; an exhibition of items from the museum's 6,500-piece permanent collection that range from pre-Columbian objects to contemporary paintings and sculptures; and, in the third space, changing exhibitions of contemporary and historical art. 
Mr. Zugazagoitia said finding more space, even outside the neighborhood, would be a priority. "For cutting-edge dance you go to BAM," he said. "For something of good quality that's Latino, you come here."
Mr. Zugazagoitia said that the museum represents Puerto Rican, Latino and Latin American communities "in that order," but that he also believes in balancing "the best of our past and the best of our contemporary art." While many are withholding judgment on him, the fact that he is not Puerto Rican reinforces what Mr. Sanchez, the artist, said was "a progressive move to convert El Museo to something else."
Mr. Bechara said Mr. Zugazagoitia was chosen for his knowledge of the art world and his personality, but also has a mandate to keep El Museo involved with its immediate community. For his part, Mr. Zugazagoitia said he was ready to talk with the museum's critics.
"I'm starting with a clean slate," he said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ARABS; 
Syria Fears Isolation More Than War

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Bouthaina Shaaban, an articulate former professor of English and translator for the president, runs the government's new office to reach out to foreign media and present a friendlier face to the world. But ask her about American policy in the Middle East, and specifically Iraq, and get ready for a tongue-lashing. 
 "This is Israel's agenda," Ms. Shaaban said. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is a "butcher." War on Iraq would serve no purpose. Syria has no place on the United States list of terror-sponsoring nations, especially given the key help it has provided American officials in hunting down militants from Al Qaeda. 
 Much of Syria's public oratory has been similarly angry in recent weeks. But Western diplomats and analysts say that privately, its tone has been milder. At the same time, they say Syria has deep concerns about its security if a pro-American government is installed in Iraq, its neighbor to the east. 
Syria would, in a sense, be isolated in its opposition to Israel, with pro-America Turkey to the north and Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel, to the south. Syria's foreign policy for decades has revolved around its role at the forefront of opposition to Israel. It will never give up that role, analysts say, but adhering to it without regional allies would condemn Syria to the political and economic backwaters.
"It's very difficult for them to accept the reality" of an American offensive against Iraq, said Ibrahim Hamedi, a Syrian who is bureau chief for Al Hayat, a pan-Arab newspaper in London controlled by the Saudis. "It's against the whole Syrian strategic interest," he said. "Syrians are thinking, 'What is the best way to make the minimum losses out of all this war? We don't want to upset America, but we have to defend our interests.' " 
At the same time, there is a sense that after Iraq, Syria would be next. That feeling has been fed by several recent statements by John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control, regarding Syrian programs for chemical and biological weapons and nuclear power.
As recently as last week, Mr. Bolton repeated concerns that Syria has a stockpile of a nerve agent and the ability to produce small amounts of a biological agent. In October, he also said Syria had benefited from Russian technology for its nuclear program. That drew a rebuke from the Syrian government, which summoned the American ambassador, Theodore H. Kattouf, to explain. The Syrians were pleased to note that in last week's comments, Mr. Bolton omitted the nuclear issue. 
Syria insists said its nuclear program is for research and civilian purposes, and denies having chemical and biological weapons programs. In a speech in May, Mr. Bolton said Syria has a stockpile of sarin, the nerve agent, and is working on the more lethal agent VX. He said Syria was improving the process to make its own chemical weapons so that it could rely less on foreign suppliers. 
Many interpret such statements as an attempt to intimidate Syria, or to force it to acquiesce to American action in Iraq. 
"It is very foolish, and poor pressure," said Imad Fawzi Shueibi, a professor of sociopolitics at the University of Damascus, whose office is dominated by a portrait of President Bashar al-Assad. "You have to try another way." 
Syrians also note that mention is never made of Israel's nuclear weapons, the existence of which Israel neither confirms nor denies. 
Privately, Western analysts say the country's chemical and biological weapons programs are less advanced than Libya's or Iraq's, and are seen as a deterrent against an attack with those weapons by Syria's enemy, Israel. They say the tight control the government has on society makes it unlikely the agents would fall into terrorists' hands.
Others here wonder if another message was sent Monday, when an American plane patrolling the skies over northern Iraq strayed into Syrian air space. The United States quickly expressed regret over what it termed an accident, but suspicions linger. 
Significantly, though, the official Syrian press was silent on the issue. Moreover, President Assad was said to be annoyed when the government spokesman said this week that Syria would reject the resolution on Iraq that the United States and Britain have proposed to the United Nations Security Council. According to local news media, the president felt it was unwise to single out the American proposal rather than continue Syria's policy of calling for the enforcement of earlier resolutions. 
Both events are signs that Syria wants to stay in Washington's good graces as best it can. 
At the same time, Syria is seeking to shore up a bulwark to counter American threats to Iraq. President Assad met last month with Iran's intelligence minister, Ali Yunesi, and Syrian officials recently met with Jalal Talabani, one of the key leaders of the Kurdish area in northern Iraq.
The question on many minds is what exactly Syria will do if there is an invasion of Iraq. 
Professor Shueibi said that if it happened under a United Nations resolution, "then Syria will accept that, but it will not agree with it." Haitham Kelani, a military historian here, said an army mobilization was unlikely, given the high financial cost.
Another delicate issue is Hezbollah, the armed political force in Lebanon's central valley, the Bekaa. Arms supplied to Hezbollah by Iran are widely believed to travel through Syria, and Syria maintains a heavy troop presence in Lebanon. 
Many in the Middle East worry that if the United States invades Iraq, Israel would take the opportunity to attack Hezbollah, which could widen the conflict.
Mr. Hamedi, the jounralist with Al Hayat, believes the United States and Syria are approaching a bargaining stage, in which the United States would seek promises from Syria, like keeping a lid on Hezbollah, refraining from its own military intervention and from opposing an opposition government, and providing logistical cooperation for activities like search and rescue.
As one non-American Western diplomat put it, "The Syrians want to keep the relationship on a reasonably even keel, but the question is, are they willing to pay the price?"

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SOUTHEAST ASIA; 
Qaeda Meeting in Thailand Reportedly Plotted Attacks on Tourists

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
A group of Al Qaeda operatives met in Thailand and discussed plans to attack bars, nightclubs and tourist resorts throughout the region months before the October bombing in Bali killed more than 190 people, Asian and Western officials said this week. 
 The group was led by a senior lieutenant of Osama bin Laden and included a Qaeda explosives expert, who was later arrested and told American officials of the January meeting during his interrogation. 
 "They talked about hitting soft Western targets throughout Southeast Asia," an American official said. The blast at an Indonesian resort area in Bali may have been the first such attack, Western diplomats said. 
"Is Thailand next?" is the question being asked by seemingly everyone here, from bartenders to hotel owners, to businessmen and diplomats, as well by many Thai officials when they are speaking privately.
The presence of Al Qaeda in Thailand, with its free-wheeling culture, chaotic cities and porous borders, is greater than the Thai government has been willing to acknowledge, or than Western governments, including the United States, were aware of, diplomats from several countries said in interviews. 
An attack here could further unsettle a region where Thailand serves as the economic engine and the hub of tourist industry that draws more than 10 million visitors a year to this country alone. 
A Western intelligence analyst said Thailand was a vital link in the "international terrorist's underground railroad." 
Two of the Sept. 11 hijackers traveled from Afghanistan to Malaysia and then in effect laundered themselves through Thailand before entering the United States, Western officials said this week. 
Last month, a dozen suspected Qaeda operatives fled to Thailand from Malaysia and Singapore, and then disappeared, to the embarrassment of the Thai government, Asian and Western officials said. 
A Thai government spokesman, Sita Divari, said today that the government was certain that there was no Qaeda network in Thailand and that there was no serious threat of a terrorist attack. 
It is an assertion that diplomats here have been hearing for months and which they do not take seriously. "People who claim this country is devoid of any prospects of terrorism are naive," one ambassador said.
Officials investigating the Bali attack are now looking closely at Thailand and suspect that the plan to set off a car bomb in front of a popular nightclub on Oct. 12 was hatched during the meeting in January. 
The meeting, these officials said, was called by a man who has become the most wanted terrorist in the region, Al Qaeda's top man in Southeast Asia, Riadun Isamuddin, known as Hambali. 
Also attending, they said, was a Qaeda explosives expert, Mohamed Mansour Jabara, a Kuwaiti national with a Canadian passport who was picked up in Oman in March and is now in American custody. Precisely when he told American officials about the January meeting is not clear. 
Mr. Jabara was one of the main planners in a plot to blow up the American, Australian and Israeli embassies in Singapore last December. When the plot was uncovered, he and several others fled undetected to Thailand, Asian and Western officials said. 
Counterterrorism experts say Al Qaeda, no longer dependent on camps for its operations, is probably working in small groups, much like the one that met here. The Bali operation, an American official said, may have been the work of cells in several countries, none of them larger than six or eight men.
The fear now is that Thailand will not only provide an easy base of operation for terrorists working in smaller cells, but also that the country itself is high on the list of potential targets as Al Qaeda shifts its focus to tourist sites. 
"We have already seen in recent months more and more information that tourist centers are under threat," the chief of German intelligence, August Hanning, said this week. "It is because tourist centers cannot be guarded." 
He named the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand as the likely next targets. 
Thailand has long been a route for drug traffickers and people smugglers, a country where guns and explosives are readily available and where preparing fraudulent documents is a developed industry. 
"It is easy to get a false passport in Thailand," a European ambassador said. adding, "A professional terrorist can enter this country and leave quite easily, after having launched an attack."
Even a Thai intelligence official acknowledged that it would be relatively easy for a terrorist "to hibernate" in Bangkok, a teeming city of 12 million people, thousands of whom are tourists or transients. 
Western diplomats agreed. Until recently, visas were not required here for citizens of most countries, including those from the Middle East. The government did not ask a lot of questions of visitors, especially of the foreign men who patronize the bars and nightclubs that form the center of Bangkok's tourist industry.
"Who knows who's here," an ambassador said.
Deepening worries is the relative inexperience and disorganization of Thai intelligence agencies, which are short on manpower, training and resources, officials from several countries said. Generally speaking, they are considered better than the intelligence services in Indonesia, the officials said, but not in league with a country like Singapore.
"I don't think anyone's intelligence here is terrific," a Western ambassador said. 
But diplomats and others also said the Qaeda presence in Thailand, a largely Buddhist country of 62 million people, is not as big as in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation. 
Nonetheless, in recent weeks Germany, several other European nations and Australia have issued warnings to their citizens to exercise extreme caution in certain popular tourist areas in Thailand. The United States has issued a new travel advisory covering all of Southeast Asia. 
The Western intelligence analyst summed up the reactions here since the Bali blasts as "hysteria, and a false sense of confidence." Western governments have overreacted with their travel warnings, he said, while the Thai government has refused to face up to terrorist threat it faces. 
It is not clear why the travel warnings vary from country to country, since they are sharing intelligence, diplomats said. "We interpreted it differently," an American diplomat said. 
But several ambassadors acknowledged that the warnings were heavily influenced by the domestic political concerns of governments seeking to protect themselves against charges, in case of another attack, that they did not take all precautions.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Republican takeover of the Senate as well as the House (front page, Nov. 7) is a direct result of the Democrats' failure to challenge the Bush war rhetoric and advocate for those of their principles that Americans care most about, including public health, the environment and the economy. 
 As a result, thousands of Americans may needlessly die in a war over oil; decades-old laws protecting our air, water and lands will be weakened to line the pockets of polluters; and corporate malfeasance will continue as payback to Republican special interests.
The damage is done. The American people are the real losers in this election.

HEADLINE: Be Careful What You Ask For 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Republicans are really in a pickle now.
 No, it's true. Just consider the picture in the fall of 2004 as President Bush battles to hold onto Congress and his own house: 
* The new Scalia Supreme Court has accepted an abortion case that could overturn Roe v. Wade and abortion rights in America. The federal budget deficit has hit $400 billion, and the expanded 2003 tax cuts mean that the federal debt is out of control. This has kept the Dow below 7,000. 
* The '02 election has emboldened conservatives to take hard-line positions and overshoot their mandate, just as they did under Newt Gingrich in 1994, so that more high school students now learn about creationism than about condoms. The result, once again, is rising public anger at right-wing ideologues.
* In response to huge budget deficits, states have had to slash school spending. Test scores are dropping, and a growing number of children are being left behind. Even centrists are angered by logging of old-growth forests and the administration's fervent push to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
* The occupation of Iraq is increasingly unpopular at home, with an average of one American killed there every two weeks and Iran gaining influence in the anarchic south. The catastrophic failure to engage North Korea has led that country to start up its Yongbyon reactor, churn out many nuclear weapons and test its new three-stage Taepodong 2 missile, which can reach New York.
The above paragraphs will self-destruct next year, well before they could embarrass me by being juxtaposed with reality. As Mark Twain said, the art of prophecy is difficult, especially with regard to the future. But it does seem plausible that Republicans will overinterpret their mandate (if 22,000 votes had gone differently, the Senate could have remained Democratic in January). 
President Bush is, like President Reagan but unlike his father, a natural leader who is unafraid to use political capital and even borrow some from the bank. If he pushed an aggressive platform before, with a minority of the popular vote and a divided Congress, imagine what he'll seek now. Already the Republicans are oozing hubris.
(You can't much blame them. As David Letterman observed about the Democrats, You know you're in trouble when your bright young star of the future is Frank Lautenberg.)
Yet the reality is that this will be an excruciating economic climate in which to govern. New York State alone will face a $6 billion shortfall next year, and war spending and tax cuts could easily push the federal deficit to between $200 billion and $400 billion in 2004, up to a precarious 4 percent of G.N.P. Services and school programs around the country will be cut, and voters will find someone to blame in two years' time. The Democrats, out of power, won't make a convenient whipping boy.
John Ellis, a Bush cousin and longtime conservative political analyst, gets it exactly right on his Weblog: "The 2002 result is a strong vote of confidence for the Bush administration. It is not a mandate. The great danger that now looms for the G.O.P. is that it will mistake the vote of confidence for a mandate."
In his press conference yesterday, Mr. Bush gave no sign he is intoxicated by election vapors; even when goaded by reporters looking for a good story, he didn't speak dreamily about appointing John Ashcroft to the Supreme Court, drilling for oil in Yellowstone or exiling liberals to Guantanamo. The key test, though, will be in the coming weeks as we see whether he reads the soon-to-be-passed U.N. resolution on Iraq the same way everyone else does.
Mr. Bush's problem is that he has launched a diplomatic process in which he has little faith. The reality is that he went to the U.N. to get international legitimacy, not weapons inspections. So he may soon be tempted to short-circuit the diplomatic process.
The resolution, as it is presently drafted, requires Saddam Hussein to make a full declaration of his secret programs within 30 days. It's a good bet that there'll be a lot of doubt that his declaration is completely truthful, and so hawks will encourage Mr. Bush to launch a war at that time. They will urge him to announce that the declaration is false and constitutes a "material breach" -- and then send the bombers.
If that happens, we could be at war by year's end. We might be paying for such hubris for years to come.

HEADLINE: The President and Lame Ducks 

 BODY:
President Bush's measured tone and modest demeanor at his post-election news conference yesterday provided a timely reminder of why he has the support of so many voters who appear to disagree with so many of his policies. Tuesday's results had obviously put him in a good frame of mind. But he did not gloat, and indeed seemed at pains to avoid the triumphalism that some Republican leaders couldn't resist expressing when the election returns showed that their party had captured the Senate and enlarged its majority in the House. The image he projected was one of inclusive leadership rather than narrow partisanship, and while the country is clearly in for some bruising ideological battles come the next Congress, the president's manner -- at turns affable and somber, and wholly disarming -- seemed well suited to the needs of the moment. 
 Among these needs, as Mr. Bush observed, is to make sure that the 107th Congress makes good use of the few weeks remaining to it before it passes into history. The president set two very appropriate goals for the necessarily brief lame-duck session that begins next week. Neither will be easy to finish but both are achievable. One is to complete work on a Department of Homeland Security. The other is to approve terrorism insurance. We would add a third: helping the unemployed. 
 Homeland security has been blocked by Democratic opposition to Mr. Bush's plan to reduce civil service protection for the employees of the new department. This is no longer a fight worth pursuing. While we believed the Democrats had the better position, the one thing voters made clear on Tuesday is that they support the president on the homeland security issue. The Democrats should go along, and Senator Robert Byrd, the powerful Democrat from West Virginia who believes that the antiterrorist apparatus was constructed too quickly, should drop his threat to filibuster the bill. 
Mr. Bush was right to put a high priority on terrorism insurance, which is needed because some real estate development projects around the country are in danger of being stalled by the difficulty in getting coverage for a cataclysmic disaster like the one that struck the World Trade Center. Both the House and Senate have approved versions of a terrorism insurance measure. The only obstacle to final passage has been a quarrel between Republicans who want to use the bill as a vehicle for tort reform -- that is, to rein in large damage awards in lawsuits -- and Democrats who are afraid to offend the trial lawyers. A sensible compromise is within easy reach if the two sides will suppress their political egos.
Though Mr. Bush did not mention it, Congress could do several things to help the nation's unemployed while boosting the fragile economy. It should extend temporary unemployment benefits beyond the Dec. 31 deadline, while continuing assistance to about a million workers who have exhausted their benefits or will do so shortly. These people need help, and it will not bankrupt the government to provide it. Such assistance would also be fully consistent with the conciliatory and helpful tone the president sought to project yesterday.

 BODY:
A 2nd Term and a 3rd Husband
 Having won a second term this week, LT. GOV. MARY DONOHUE plans to say "I do" next week for the third time. Ms. Donohue, 55, will marry ANTHONY J. RICCI, 56, who works for the accounting firm KPMG. The Associated Press said that they grew up in Troy, N.Y., and that he accompanied her to President Bush's inauguration last year. And where is the wedding? Her spokesman would not say. A spokesman for GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI, who chose Ms. Donohue to be his running mate in 1998 after a feud with BETSY McCAUGHEY ROSS (she went through her own second divorce while in office), said he did not know if Mr. Pataki would attend. 

A Bondish Encounter
JULIANNA MARGULIES once wanted to be a Bond girl. "I was supposed to test for one of the Bond movies" while still on "E.R.," she said. But the Bond producers wanted a five-month commitment, and she did not have that kind of time.
Eventually, she quit "E.R." And made a movie with PIERCE BROSNAN.
Not a Bond film, but "Evelyn," a drama set in Ireland in the 1950's about an unemployed single father's struggle to get his children back.
So did she enjoy their rather long screen kiss? "Both Pierce and I, when the director went, like, 'Great, cut, O.K., let's move on,' we were like, 'Hang on, we've been waiting the entire film,' " she recalled.
By now she was at a party in the Fifth Avenue apartment of the photographer NANCY ELLISON and her husband, WILLIAM D. ROLLNICK. Her co-star did some rough-housing with the Rollnicks' dog, Buzz, who may or may not have been impressed. "Last week Buzz jumped into MEG RYAN'S lap on that couch over there," said Mr. Rollnick. "He loves Meg Ryan."

A Tough Morning After
Think that getting up before dawn and doing a network television program is tough? KATIE COURIC said yesterday that she was "a nervous wreck," and what she was talking about was a benefit she has been helping to plan. 
Four days to go. The benefit, at the Waldorf-Astoria, is for a center for gastrointestinal health at New York-Presbyterian Hospital that will be named for her husband, Jay Monaghan (he died of cancer in 1998). It will feature songs from "West Side Story" performed by the likes of ROBIN WILLIAMS, MERYL STREEP, KELSEY GRAMMER, BEYONCE KNOWLES and BETTE MIDLER, among others.
"I'm looking forward to Tuesday night," she said, "and Wednesday morning even more."
Would she take a morning off from "Today"?
"I looked into that possibility but was told no way," she said. "It's sweeps, honey." Ah, November, the first ratings "sweep" month of the season, when the networks try for the biggest audiences and thus the most favorable advertising rates.

He of the Gleaming Flute
It sounded like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," except that the flutist JAMES GALWAY said he had not seen the film. But there he was, talking about using Windex on something besides glass: his flute.
Explanation, please.
One of the characters in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" raves about Windex as a wonder drug that can heal cuts, among other things.
Mr. Galway said he uses Windex to remove fingerprints from his flute before photo sessions for his albums. And that led a conversation about how things have changed since his first album was released in the 1970's. "You have to have a past, a notorious past, now," he said. "You have to have been arrested. Either that, or you have to be Hollywood photographic material. VANESSA MAY might make such a career, but there are others who haven't been photographed in a wet T-shirt playing a white violin going over a wave."

Quibble With the Home Office
BOBBY VALENTINE sounded as if his strategy was to blame DAVID LETTERMAN'S writers. Or, who knows? Maybe the host.
When not signing autographs at KEITH HERNANDEZ'S Field of Dreams gala on Wednesday, he talked about his appearance on the "Late Show" earlier in the week. He read a top-10 list -- "Top 10 things I, Bobby Valentine, want to get off my chest." No. 1 was, "I had no idea there's a baseball team in Anaheim."
"They weren't quite my lines," Mr. Valentine said, "and they were changed at the last second. So I wasn't all that comfortable with them."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: NEW MEXICO; 
Resume and Message Help Ex-Clinton Official to Victory

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., Nov. 7 

 BODY:
It has been a longstanding tradition in the Richardson family to pummel Republicans. As center for Tufts in its 1913 football game against Army, William B. Richardson took credit for ending Dwight D. Eisenhower's gridiron career by breaking his leg in a pileup.
 "Eisenhower was quoted later saying 20 people claimed to be responsible, but my father told me he heard the bone crack," Mr. Richardson's son, Bill, said with a laugh. "And my father was a Republican." 
 Bill Richardson, a lifelong Democrat at 54, insists he has not broken any Republican legs, but in a 20-year political career that reached another milestone on Tuesday, he has broken quite a few Republican hearts.
A former congressman, United Nations representative and energy secretary, Mr. Richardson was elected governor of New Mexico, defeating a Republican, John Sanchez, by 20 percentage points, the largest margin in the 23 races for governor. 
In addition, Mr. Richardson became the only senior official in the Clinton administration who won. Three other cabinet members seeking to become governor of their states never made it out of the primary: former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich in Massachusetts; Andrew M. Cuomo, the former housing secretary, in New York; and former Attorney General Janet Reno in Florida. Erskine B. Bowles, a Clinton chief of staff, lost his North Carolina Senate bid to Elizabeth Dole.
The only other ranking Clinton aide who did win on Tuesday was Rahm Emmanuel, a political consultant, who was elected to a House seat from Illinois.
Mr. Richardson said he did not follow his Clinton colleagues closely enough to assess why they lost. But his own success, he said today in an interview, derived from his ability to articulate an economic message that proved effective in a state facing a host of social and financial ills. It was also a message, he said, that might have helped more Democrats prevent the kind of losses they suffered on Tuesday.
"I ran on bread and butter issues of economic growth, cooperation between labor and business, modernizing the stagnant New Mexico economy," Mr. Richardson said, ticking off specific ideas, like cutting taxes and offering tax credits to businesses paying above minimum wage. "I told people, 'I want to put more money in your pockets.' "
He also promised greater access to health care, higher teacher salaries and negotiating reasonable compromises between environmental and energy interests.
Any of that sound familiar? And former President Bill Clinton, who left office in 2000, did not even come to New Mexico to campaign.
"The truth is, none of these races had anything to do with Bill Clinton," Paul Begala, a television commentator and former Clinton political consultant, said of races that former Clintonites and Democrats, in general, lost. "What it did have to do with was Bill Clinton's ideas, tactics and techniques that were forgotten by Democrats, that you have to campaign with ideas. You have to stand for something."
In succeeding the Republican governor, Gary E. Johnson, who was barred by law from seeking a third term, Mr. Richardson had several natural advantages over Mr. Sanchez, a roofing contractor and one-term state lawmaker. With a strong base of support across northern New Mexico and a Clintonesque lust for campaigning, Mr. Richardson had won eight terms to Congress, always with comfortable margins. As a special international envoy for Mr. Clinton and later as United Nations delegate, he honed skills as a negotiator and mediator. As energy secretary, he plunged into issues vital to Western interests.
Further, he ran in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans three to two.
By the time Mr. Richardson announced he would run for governor, he was perhaps the best-known politician in the state. Billy Sparks, Mr. Richardson's spokesman, said the Guinness Book of World Records had accorded him the record in the arcane category of most hands shaken by a politician in one day, 13,392, breaking President Theodore Roosevelt's record of 8,515.
"He's very experienced, he had a lot of money and, with his message, he won the swing vote, conservative Democrats," said Gilbert St. Clair, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico. "He took Republican issues, and that appealed to conservative Democrats."
As one of 11 new Democratic governors-elect Mr. Richardson is part of the lone bright spot for his party this week. He called the nationwide results "a debacle for Democrats but a temporary debacle" and said the outcome would put new pressure on Republicans to unite the country and pass sensible legislation.
"We should admit we took a shellacking, regroup and learn, not just put our heads in the sand," he said. "We can recover. We can even talk about tax cuts; there's nothing evil about them when you can put money in people's pockets. Now we have to develop a national economic message that's clear and concise, with an emphasis of giving more money back to families."
There is little wonder that the message worked in New Mexico. By 2000 census data, 17.7 percent of its residents are poor, the highest percentage of any state. It is among the leaders in the percentage of people without health care and the rate of violent crime, and near the bottom in teacher salaries.
"We've got a lot of problems, and I've got a lot of work to do," Mr. Richardson said, conceding that with a Democratic-controlled State House and Senate, he would have few excuses for failure. "Just give us a little time. It's not going to be easy."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 10, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Bill Richardson, a Democrat who was elected governor of New Mexico, referred incorrectly to his 20-percentage-point margin of victory. It was the largest in the 23 races that resulted in the election of new governors, not the largest in the races for governor.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE PRESIDENT; 
After G.O.P. Triumph, Bush Sets Security Department and Tax Cut as Priorities

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that his top priority after the Republican victories in the midterm elections was creating a new Department of Homeland Security, long stalled in Congress, and that he wanted it done before the end of the year.
 Mr. Bush also said it was essential for Congress to make his $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax cut permanent after its planned expiration in 2010, a centerpiece of his domestic agenda that the Democratic-controlled Senate had blocked. 
 In a 47-minute news conference in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the president made it clear that he would use his party's victory in Tuesday's election to muscle forward large parts of his agenda, even though he promised to reach out to Democrats to help him in governing. 
Mr. Bush also said for the first time that Vice President Dick Cheney would be his running mate in 2004 because "he is a superb vice president, and there's no reason to change."
But the president added a caveat, saying that he was still recovering from his brutal campaigning schedule during the 2002 races and that Mr. Cheney would be on the ticket "should I decide to run."
The president avoided the kind of gloating that his advisers believe doomed the Republicans after they captured the House and Senate in 1994. Mr. Bush refused several times to call Tuesday's results a mandate for his presidency and said the candidates deserved the credit, not him.
"I think candidates win elections because they're good candidates, not because they happen to have the president as a friend, or a foe, for that matter," Mr. Bush said.
The president added later: "I really don't put this in personal terms. I know people in Washington like to do that. You know, George Bush won, George Bush lost. That's the way they do it here. Zero sum, in Washington." 
Mr. Bush kept to a careful tone of humility even though White House advisers have been ecstatic about how the Republicans recaptured the Senate and made gains in the House.
Mr. Bush, who was credited by both parties for providing the excitement that propelled his party's candidates to victory, appeared to be heeding, if not agreeing with, cautionary voices in the party who said that narrow Republican victories in Minnesota and Missouri proved the election was not a fundamental realignment or a repudiation of the Democrats.
"I've talked to leaders of both parties and assured them I want to work with them," Mr. Bush said, his manner subdued after 10,000 miles of campaigning took him to 15 states in the five days before Election Day.
The president said that he had spoken to Senator Tom Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat who will lose his position as majority leader, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who said today that he would step down as minority leader.
Despite the generous words, Mr. Bush said he would insist that the Senate, which will still be led by Mr. Daschle in the closing days of a lame-duck session, pass legislation creating a Homeland Security Department, even though Mr. Daschle had blocked it because of objections over protections for workers' rights. 
"The election may be over, but a terrorist threat is still real," Mr. Bush said. "The Senate must pass a bill that will strengthen our ability to protect the American people."
The president added that it was imperative that Congress send him a bill to sign before the session ended. Congress is scheduled to return to Washington early next week, and leaders have said they hope to wrap up their business with little delay.
Mr. Bush said he would push for virtually every other significant piece of legislation on his agenda that had been stalled or blocked by the Senate, among them a prescription drug plan for Medicare, terrorism insurance for businesses, a partial privatization of Social Security and an energy plan that would include drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
"Listen, there's going to be a huge laundry list of things people want to get done," Mr. Bush said, "and my job is to set priorities and get them done."
Mr. Bush ignored a question about whether he would push for new restrictions on abortion, as some conservative Republicans have pressed him to do. "I appreciate all the advice I'm getting," Mr. Bush said, to some laughter. "One of the things about this job, if you listen carefully, you get a lot of advice."
But Mr. Bush said that he did not "take cues from anybody," including the conservative wing of his party, and that he was not changing the political philosophy he ran on in 2000.
"I'm the same guy after the election I was prior to the election," Mr. Bush said.
The president said he wanted to see his federal judge nominees who have been defeated, delayed or blocked by the Senate get "a fair hearing and get approved." 
He added that he would push for the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be controlled by Orin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, to approve Justice Priscilla R. Owen of the Texas Supreme Court and Charles W. Pickering Sr. of Mississippi for appeals court posts.
The nominations of both had been bottled up, by a single vote, in the committee when it was led by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. 
Mr. Bush offered up a warm public endorsement of Harvey Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who had privately infuriated the White House and resigned as the polls closed on election night. Mr. Bush said today that Mr. Pitt, who created a political firestorm over his selection of the head of a new board overseeing the accounting profession, had resigned on his own.
"He made the decision himself that he thought that he couldn't be as effective as he needed to be," Mr. Bush said. "I received his letter. I appreciate his service."
The president praised Mr. Pitt for working hard to reopen the financial markets quickly after the attacks of Sept. 11 and for weeding out corporate fraud.
Mr. Bush also praised William H. Webster, whom Mr. Pitt had selected to lead the accounting oversight board. Mr. Webster is under investigation by the S.E.C. inspector general for his role as the head of the audit committee of a virtually insolvent company facing accusations of fraud. 
"There's a I.G. investigation going on at the S.E.C.," Mr. Bush said. "We'll see what that says. But I will tell you, William Webster is a fine man. He is a decent, honorable public servant who has served our country well."
Mr. Bush also defended his team of economic advisers, who have been criticized even by many Republicans as ineffective while the economy has continued to stumble. 
"Listen, my economic team came in during very difficult times," Mr. Bush said. "There was a recession, there was a terrorist attack, there were corporate scandals."
Mr. Bush said his team had done a good job of developing, selling and enacting his tax cuts, "and for that, they deserve a lot of credit."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 9, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A chart yesterday with an article about President Bush's election efforts on behalf of Republicans used a misspelled given name in some copies for the Alabama governorship candidate for whom he campaigned. The candidate was Bob Riley, not Bib. A picture caption with the article gave an incorrect site in some copies for the president's news conference on Thursday. It was in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, not the White House.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE DEMOCRATS; 
House Democrats Seeking Leader to End Losing Trend

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
House Democrats, trying to regroup after this week's bruising election losses, began searching for their new voice today through a leadership fight that could define the party's direction. 
 Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a liberal Californian, and Martin Frost, a Texan viewed as more moderate, began their campaigns to succeed Richard A. Gephardt as minority leader after Mr. Gephardt failed for a fourth time to lead his party in retaking the House. 
 The competition was being framed as a choice between a woman from one of the party's anchor states who could reinvigorate House Democrats with new ideas and leadership style and a man who has tangled successfully with tough Texas conservatives like Representative Tom DeLay, who will be the new majority leader in the House. It presents lawmakers with a crucial decision on which candidate they think can shape a message and an agenda that can broaden the party's appeal to voters. 
Mr. Frost went quickly on the offensive in a morning news conference, saying Mrs. Pelosi would lead the party left, condemning Democrats to permanent minority status.
"I think that her politics are to the left," said Mr. Frost, who said the election demonstrated that the nation was moving in the opposite direction. "And I think that the party, to be successful, must speak to the broad center of the country."
Mrs. Pelosi, 62, the No. 2 Democrat in the House and the early favorite in this race, said in a statement that she would lead with "clarity and firmness" and not "allow Republicans to pretend they share our values and then legislate against those values without consequence." 
The intramural face-off, waged a bit like a contest for class president, drew more attention than leadership contests usually do because of its implications for the party's future. House Democrats wasted no time on Wednesday in assigning blame for the loss of at least five seats, with several members saying the party needed a new approach. Though no one immediately challenged Mr. Gephardt, he chose to step down.
Mr. Frost, 60, a lawyer from Fort Worth who has been in the House since 1979, cautioned against too abrupt a change, particularly when Mrs. Pelosi and 125 other Democrats -- a majority of the caucus -- opposed the resolution giving President Bush authority to take unilateral action against Iraq. "If you're seen by the country as not standing for a strong America, the country will not listen to you on other issues," he said.
Mr. Frost, the chairman of the party caucus, struggled in explaining where he split with Mrs. Pelosi on domestic issues. But he said his main objective as leader would be to highlight economic problems. 
Republicans were watching the contest with some amusement, though one top aide said they would be willing to go "door to door" for Mrs. Pelosi, thinking she would be the best foil as a liberal who represents most of San Francisco.
In reality, several Democrats said, the candidates have similar voting records and each would be attacked by Republicans. For instance, Mr. Frost received an 85 percent rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action in 2001 while Mrs. Pelosi scored 100 percent.
"I don't think there is anybody in the race who is not a fairly liberal Democrat," said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California, who supports Mrs. Pelosi but belongs to the moderate Blue Dog Coalition. "This is not about personal philosophy. She will take the caucus in the direction we need to go."
Mrs. Pelosi started out the race that will be decided by secret ballot next Thursday with several built-in advantages, including strong support from her home state, which will send 33 Democrats to the House. She also has natural appeal to women and other liberal members. 
But Mr. Frost and his allies disputed suggestions that she had the position wrapped up.
"This is a real race," said Representative Peter Deutsch, Democrat of Florida, who said he believes Mr. Frost provides the best opportunity to regain the majority.
Mr. Frost and Mrs. Pelosi have raised large amounts of money for fellow Democrats, and Mr. Frost noted that Democrats picked up 14 seats when he ran the party's House campaign arm in 1996 and 1998.
Some Frost supporters said they worried that moderate and conservative Democrats would be tempted to switch parties should Mrs. Pelosi take over, though Mr. Frost said he would urge members to stay in the party no matter what happened. 
A spokesman for Mrs. Pelosi discounted the idea that there would be defections or that Mrs. Pelosi's election would represent a swing to the left. "Her record is her record, but she has been very good at reaching out to all members of the caucus," the spokesman, Brendan Daley, said. 
Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texan who is supporting Mrs. Pelosi over his state colleague, said the party needed new energy. 
"It is not a question of geography or ideology," Mr. Doggett said. "It is a question of who is going to be able to get as much as they possibly can from the talent of our caucus and get away from a leadership clique."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION; 
Excerpts From News Conference: Imagine 'Hussein With Nuclear Weapons'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:

Mr. Bush
This is an important week for our country and for the world. 
 The United Nations will vote tomorrow on a resolution bringing the civilized world together to disarm Saddam Hussein. 
 Here at home, our citizens have voted in an election that I believe will strengthen our ability to make progress for all the American people. 
I congratulate the men and women, Republicans and Democrats, who were elected this week to public office all across America. I appreciate their willingness to leave their private lives and to serve their communities and to serve our nation. 
I also commend the millions of voters across America and across the political spectrum who went to the polls. At a time when our freedoms are under attack, it is more important than ever that our citizens exercise the rights and responsibilities of our democracy. 
Now that the voters have spoken, I urge the members of both political parties to come together to get things done for the American people. I've talked to leaders of both parties and assured them I want to work with them. I talked to Senator Daschle yesterday and said that although the Republican Party now leads the Senate, I still want to work with him to get things done for the American people. I talked to Leader Gephardt as well. 
I look forward to working with members of the Congress and the newly elected governors to make America's families safer in their homes and their communities, to make our economy stronger so people can find work, to make our country a better and more compassionate place. Members of the new Congress will take office in January and they'll have a full agenda. 
The current Congress, however, will return in just a few days to take up some unfinished business. We have a responsibility to protect the American people against threats from any source. 
I'm grateful to members of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, that came together to support the war against terror and to authorize, if need be, the use of force to disarm Iraq. We must bring the same spirit of bipartisan cooperation to the urgent task of protecting our country from the ongoing threat of terrorist attack. 
The single most important item of unfinished business on Capitol Hill is to create a unified Department of Homeland Security that will vastly improve our ability to protect our coasts and our borders and our communities. The election may be over but a terrorist threat is still real. 
The Senate must pass a bill that will strengthen our ability to protect the American people and they must pass a bill that preserves the authority every president since John Kennedy has had to act in the interests of national security. 
It's imperative that the Congress send me a bill that I can sign before the 107th Congress ends. 
We have a responsibility to strengthen the economy so people can find work. We're working to keep this economy moving. And one immediate thing Congress should do to help people put back to work is to pass legislation so that construction projects can get insurance against terrorism. This will spur construction and create thousands of good hard-hat jobs that are currently on hold because projects without insurance cannot be built.
Although it's late in the process, Congress must show fiscal discipline. At a time when we're at war and a time when we need to strengthen our economy, Congress must be wise with the people's money, fund the nation's priorities and control wasteful spending. The workers of America deserve our action on these important issues, which have been stalled, yet when approved will strengthen our economy. 
Many of the fundamental economic indicators are good. Interest rates are low, so Americans can buy more homes. Inflation's low, so paychecks go further in buying groceries and gas. The productivity of our workers is high. 
The economy has come out of a recession and is growing, but I'm not satisfied because I know we can do better. We must have an economy to grow at a faster and stronger pace so Americans can find a job. And so I'll work with the new Congress to pass new growth and jobs packages early next year. I look forward to welcoming a new Congress. And I look forward to working with the current Congress to finish some very important work. 
And now it's my privilege to take some of your questions.

Questions and Answers

Q. Do you believe that Tuesday's election gave you personally a mandate? And now that you have the Republican Congress, what will you do specifically beyond terrorism insurance and government spending restraints to address the real anxieties and the wiped savings of everyday Americans who also fear for their jobs?

A. First, I think candidates win elections because they're good candidates, not because they may happen to have the president as a friend, or a foe, for that matter. The races that were won were won because people were able to convince the voters they could trust their judgment, convince the voters they care deeply about their circumstances. I believe there is a mandate in any election, at least in this one -- it's that people want something to get done. They want people to work together in Washington, D.C., to pass meaningful legislation which will improve their lives.
The best way to win an election is to earn the trust of the voters. And that's what happened in state after state after state. We had some really good candidates who overcame some pretty tough odds. They were running against incumbents in a lot of cases. And they ran great races. And they were reassuring people. And I really attribute the successes to the nature of their candidacies and the hard-working people that turned out to vote.
There were some really effective voter turnout organizations around the country. And I think the way to look at this election is to say that people want something done. I think they see the risks are high -- the risks of being able to find a job or the risks of keeping the homeland secure. And they want people to come together to work on it. And that's what I intend to do. 

Q. The specifics of your ----

A. Oh, sorry, yeah. Well I'll let you know at the right time. Right now we've got to get through a lame-duck session. Lame-duck session, for people who don't know what that means, it means the Senate's coming and the House is coming back between now and Christmas and they've got a few days to get some big things done.
And the most important thing to get done, I want to emphasize, is to get a Department of Homeland Security finished. Some rumors moving around that, you know, we may not be too keen on getting that done. I want it done. It is a priority. We've got a good bill out of the House, and they need to get a bill out of the Senate and to conference and to my desk. I don't know how much time that's going to take, but having watched the debate prior to the election it may take some time. But it doesn't matter how long it takes, they need to get it done. 
Second, they need to get a budget done. They need to get the bills, the appropriation bills done. 
And I mentioned they've got to get the terrorism insurance bill done. Now, given the amount of time they're likely to be here that's a pretty big agenda. And in terms of afterwards, I'll let you know. But there are some issues of course that I intend to work with the Congress on and one of them is to get prescription drug benefits to our seniors. That's an important issue. It's an issue that I talked about at every speech, the candidates I'm sure of both political parties talked about it. And that's something that we need to get done. But let's get out of this lame-duck session first.

Q. How confident are you that the Security Council will approve the resolution on Iraq? And if that happens, what happens next? What's the next step?

A. Well, first of all the resolution we put down is a tough, new resolution. Talks about material breach and inspections and serious consequences if Saddam Hussein continues to defy the world and not disarm. So, one, I'm pleased with the resolution we put down, otherwise we wouldn't have put it down.
I just talked to Jacques Chirac and earlier today I talked to Vladimir Putin. I would characterize our conversation -- I'm loath to put words in somebody else's mouth. That's evidently not the case with a lot of people in Washington, but nevertheless I am. And I'm optimistic we'll get the resolution vote tomorrow, let me put it to you that way.
And the resolution is a disarmament resolution, that's what it is. It's a statement of intent to once and for all disarm Saddam Hussein. He's a threat. He's a threat to the country. He's a threat to people in his neighborhood. He's a real threat. And it's now time for the world to come together and disarm him.
And I'm -- when this resolution passes I will be able to say that the United Nations has recognized the threat and now we're going to work together to disarm him. And he must be cooperative in the disarmament. So the job of inspectors is to determine his level of cooperation, see. He's got to be the agent of disarming. He's got to agree that what we're doing is what he said he would do and, just like the United Nations has agreed that it is important to disarm him for the sake of peace. And so the next step will be to put an inspection regime in there. After all the declarations and after all the preamble to inspections, that he's got to show the world he's disarming. And that's where we'll be next. ---- 

Q. What is the logic of your insistence on invading Iraq at some point, which may some day have nuclear weapons, and not laying a glove on North Korea, which may have them or may produce them? Both of which of course would be against international law. And I have a follow-up.

A. Well I may decide to let you have that follow-up or not depending whether I like my answer. I am insistent upon one thing about Iraq, and that is that Saddam Hussein disarm. That's why I'm insistent. He agreed to do that, by the way. Saddam Hussein said he would disarm. And he hasn't.

Q. You don't ----

A. Let me -- is that the followup? O.K., that is the follow-up. I do care about North Korea. And as I said from the beginning of this new war in the 21st century, we'll deal with each threat differently. Each threat requires a different type of response. You've heard my strategy on dealing with Iraq. I've been very clear on the strategy all along. And tomorrow it looks like part of that strategy is coming to, to fruition.
With North Korea we're taking a different strategy initially. And it's this, that we're going to work with countries in the neighborhood to convince North Korea that it is not in the world's interests that they develop a nuclear weapon through highly enriched uranium. We know they've got the capacity through plutonium. We have I.E.A.E. inspectors there watching carefully their plutonium stockpile. And then we discovered that, contrary to an agreement they had with the United States, they're enriching uranium with the desire of developing a weapon. They admitted to this. And so therefore we have worked with our Japanese friends and South Korean friends, with the leadership in China, I will talk with Vladimir Putin about this after my trip to the NATO summit, to remind North Korea that if they expect to be welcomed into this family of peaceful nations, that they should not enrich uranium.
I thought it was a very interesting statement that Jiang Zemin made in Crawford, where he declared very clearly that he wants a nuclear-weapons-free Korean peninsula. That was, in my judgment, an important clarification of Chinese policy that I hope the North Koreans listen to. 
I believe we can achieve this objective, Helen, by working closely with this consortium of nations, which have got a valid interest in seeing to it that North Korea does not have nuclear weapons. . . . 

Q. You are leaving the impression that you wouldn't mind, if we go to war against Iraq, that you deal with another nation which may have weapons in a different way. But there are two other impressions around. One, that you have an obsession with going after Saddam Hussein at any cost. And also that you covet the oil fields.

A. Well, I'm -- some people have the right impressions and some people have the wrong impressions.

Q. Can you ----

A. Yeah, well those are the wrong impressions. I have a deep desire for peace. That's what I have a desire for. And freedom for the Iraqi people. See, I don't like a system where people are repressed through torture and murder in order to keep a dictator in place. That troubles me deeply. And so the Iraqi people must hear this loud and clear, that this country never has any intention to conquer anybody. That's not the intention of the American people or our government. We believe in freedom and we believe in peace. And we believe the Iraqi dictator is a threat to peace. And so that's why I've made the decisions I've made in terms of Iraq.

Q. On Iraq you've said many times that if Saddam Hussein does not disarm he will be disarmed militarily if necessary by the U.N. or the U.S. and others. There's a school of thought that says going to war against Iraq would be a dangerous and misguided idea because it would generate a tremendous amount of anger and hatred at the United States and out of that in a sense would be creating many new terrorists What's wrong with that analysis?

A. Yeah. Well that's like saying we should not go after Al Qaeda because we might irritate somebody and that would create a danger to Americans. My attitude is you've got to deal with terrorism in a firm way. And if you see threats, you deal with them in all different kinds of ways. The only way in my judgment to deal with Saddam Hussein is to bring the international community together to convince him to disarm. But if he's not going to disarm, we'll disarm him in order to make the world a more peaceful place. And some people aren't going to like that, I understand. But some people won't like it if he ends up with a nuclear weapon and uses it.
We have an obligation to lead. And I intend to assume that obligation to make the world more peaceful. Listen, there's risk in all action we take. But the risk of inaction is not a choice as far as I'm concerned. The inaction creates more risk than doing our duty to make the world more peaceful. And obviously I weighed all the consequences about all the different ---- hopefully we can do this peacefully. Don't get me wrong. And if the world were to collectively come together to do so and to put pressure on Saddam Hussein and convince him to disarm, there's a chance he may decide to do that. And war is not my first choice, don't get, you know, it's my last choice. But nevertheless it is a, it is an option in order to make the world a more peaceful place. 

Q. I want to return to the elections. You're being quite humble about the results and your role. But many conservative lawmakers and many more conservative groups are saying, "seize the moment." They say early in the new Congress you should push your plan to partially privatize Social Security, you should push for new restrictions on abortion, you should push and renominate the judges that were rejected by the Senate and that you should push a total overhaul of the tax code. What are your views on that?

A. Well, I appreciate all the advice I'm getting. One of the things about this job, if you listen carefully, you get a lot of advice. And I, it's important for a president to set priorities, and the two biggest priorities are the protection of the American people. That's why I want them to get this Homeland Security Department done. And the other one's people being able to find jobs. And we'll work on those. And tax relief or tax reform, however you want to describe it, is part of, in my judgment, of creating economic vitality.
But there are other things we can work on. Obviously I'd like to see some of my judges get a good, a fair hearing and get approved. And Medicare prescription drugs is a very important issue. Needs to get done. Terrorism insurance is an important issue. Energy bill's an important issue. I mean there's a lot of things we can do and should do when they come back. And I can't remember the litany of things -- but listen, there's going to be a huge laundry list of things people want to get done. And my job is to set priorities and get them done. And job creation and economic security as well as homeland security are the two most important priorities we face.

Q. Social Security and any new restrictions on ----

A. Well, no, I think the Social Security debate is an incredibly important debate. And we call them personal savings accounts, so that people have the option at their choice to manage their own money. That'd be younger workers. Obviously we've got our share of older workers that the promises we have made will be kept. And the danger really is for young workers, that's the threat, as to whether Social Security will be around for young workers without some massive tax increase. And I still strongly believe that the best way to achieve security in Social Security for younger workers is to give them the option of managing their own money through a personal savings account. And, yeah, it's an important issue as well. Listen, there's a lot of important issues.
The budget's an important issue. The budget's an important issue coming out of the lame duck session. And the budget, as you know, you're an old hand around here, is always an important issue in the next session. So that's always an issue too. There's some practical matters as well that will occupy time here in Washington, D.C.

Q. I'm wondering, sir, is Harvey Pitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., just the first member of your economic team to go? And a separate question, will you ask William Webster to resign?

A. Well, let's see. Let me start with Pitt. Harvey Pitt did some very good things at the S.E.C. And it's important for the American people to know that. Right after 9/11 he did a lot to get the markets opened. Really was, played a major role in that and received good credit for that. And I want to thank Harvey Pitt for that and the American people should as well. He has done a lot to make it clear to corporate Americans that think they can -- don't have to be responsible in their positions. He's for a lot of enforcement, more so than ever in the history. He's enforced the corporate responsibility ethos. He has disbarred more people. More money has been disgorged as a result of illegal activity, and that's positive, that Harvey's done as well. And under his watch C.E.O.'s must verify their returns and that's good. All that's positive. He made the decision himself that he thought that he couldn't be as effective as he needed to be. I received his letter. I appreciate his service.
William Webster, there's an I.G. investigation going on at the S.E.C. We'll see what that says. But I will tell you, William Webster is a fine man. He is a decent, honorable public servant who has served our country well. . . . 

Q. Is he just the first member of your economic team to go? The implication is ----

A. Listen, my economic team came in during very difficult times. There was a recession, there was a terrorist attack, there were corporate scandals. We have done a lot to return confidence and to provide stimulus through tax cuts. My economic team developed a tax-cut package, sold the tax-cut package, is implementing the tax-cut package, and for that they deserve a lot of credit. They made good progress, we're making good progress in the economy. There's still work to do. And I appreciate the hard work of the economic team.

Q. You were very gracious earlier giving credit in this last election to the individual candidates. But a lot of those candidates say that they have you to thank. Given the fact that your own election for president was so close it had to be decided by the Supreme Court, do you now feel personally reassured that these mid-term elections validated your ----

A. Thank you for that loaded question. Sometimes you win them and sometimes you lose elections. That's just the way it is. And I was pleased with the results. I was more particularly pleased for the candidates who worked so hard and their families and their workers. That's how I feel about it. I really don't put this in personal terms. I know people in Washington like to do that, you know. George Bush won, George Bush lost. That's the way they do it here, zero sum in Washington. I know that.
But if you're really interested in what I think, I think the fact that Norm Coleman ran a very difficult race in difficult circumstances and won speaks volumes about Norm Coleman. The fact that John Thune ran a difficult race against difficult circumstances and at this point is still short nevertheless speaks volumes about his desire and his intention to serve the country. There's case after case of people who have put their reputations on the line, who spent a lot of time away from their homes and their families, shaken a lot of hands and put their hearts and souls, in both parties. They deserve the credit. Thank you for trying to give it to me, but they deserve the credit. 
I know what it's like to run for office. I know the strains it puts on families. I know the, you know, the tire -- the endless hours you spend campaigning and all the wonderful questions you have to answer as part of a campaign. I know all that. And these candidates deserve all the credit. And I was proud to help some of them the best I could. But the way you win a race is you convince the people of your state or your district that they can trust your judgment and they can trust your character and they can trust your values. And it takes a lot of work to do that and these candidates get the credit. And I, you know, I appreciate you pointing out that some people have given me credit. The credit belongs to the people in the field. . . . 

Q. You have put a lot of effort toward getting the United Nations to rally the world to disarm Saddam Hussein, and yet you and your aides have expressed a great deal of skepticism about whether Saddam Hussein will actually comply. Can you give us an idea, sir, how long do you think it might take for the world to know whether Saddam Hussein actually intends to go along with the call of the world to disarm? Will it be a matter of days or weeks, months or perhaps a year, sir?

A. Well, this much we know, it's so far taken him 11 years and 16 resolutions to do nothing. So we've got some kind of history as to the man's behavior. We know he likes to try to deceive and deny. And that's why this inspection regime has got to be new and tough and different. The status quo is unacceptable, you know, going to send a few people in there and hope maybe he's nice to them and open up the baby milk factory. It's unacceptable. And so that's why you'll see us with a different inspection regime, one that works to see to it that Saddam Hussein disarms. It's his responsibility to disarm.
I don't put timetables on anything. But for the sake of peace, the sooner the better. And we'll see. But you must know that I am serious, so are a lot of other countries, serious about holding the man to account. I was serious about holding the U.N. to account. And when they pass this resolution, which I hope they do tomorrow, it shows that the U.N. is beginning to assume its responsibilities to make sure that 11 years of defiance does not go unanswered.
It's very important that the U.N. be a successful international body. Because the threats that we face now require more cooperation than ever. And we're still cooperating with a lot of nations. We're still sharing intelligence and cutting off money the best we can. And there are still law enforcements efforts taking place all around the world. And that's why the international, you know this international body called the U.N. is an important body for keeping the peace. And it's very important that they're effective. And we'll see starting tomorrow. 
And then the key on the resolution I want to remind you is that there are serious consequences. And that's one of the key elements to make sure that everybody gets the picture that we are serious about a process of disarming him in the name of peace. Hopefully, he'll choose to do so himself. . . . 

Q. Now that the 2004 presidential campaign has unofficially begun, can you tell us whether Vice President Cheney will be your running mate again? Or will you instead choose someone who might harbor greater presidential ambitions to perhaps succeed you one day?

A. Well, first of all, I'm still recovering from the '02 elections. And we've got plenty of time to deal with this issue. But should I decide to run, Vice President Cheney will be my running mate. He's done an excellent job. I appreciate his advice. I appreciate his counsel. I appreciate his friendship. He is a superb vice president. And there's no reason for me to change. I also want to thank him for all his hard work during the campaign. He was out there toiling along, working hard and turning out the vote. And I want to thank him for the hours he put out there as well.

Q. Last time you had to kind of convince him to take the job. Have you talked to him this time, whether he is interested in serving another term?

A. I'm confident that he will serve another term.

Q. You said this afternoon that the U.N. Security Council vote tomorrow would bring the civilized world together against Iraq. But broad opposition remains all over the world to your policy. Will you continue to try to build support? If so, how will you do that?

A. Broad opposition ----

Q. Or do you think that a Security Council vote would be all the mandate you need?

A. Yeah. First of all, you know, broad opposition around the world, not in the support of my policy on Iraq?

Q. Yes.

A. Well, I think most people around the world realize that Saddam Hussein is a threat. And they -- no one likes war. But they also don't like the idea of Saddam Hussein having a nuclear weapon. Imagine what would happen. And by the way, we don't know how close he is to a nuclear weapon right now. We know he wants one. But we don't know. We know he was close to one at one point in time. We have no idea today.
Imagine Saddam Hussein with a nuclear weapon. Imagine how the Israeli citizens would feel. Imagine how the citizens of Saudi Arabia would feel. Imagine how the world would change, how he could alter diplomacy by the very presence of a nuclear weapon. And so I -- a lot of serious people around the world are beginning to think about that consideration. I think about it a lot. I think about it particularly in the regard of making the world a more peaceful place. 
And so it's very important for people to realize the consequences of us not taking the case to the U.N. Security Council. People need to think about what would happen if the United States had remained silent on the issue and just hoped for a change of his attitude. Or maybe hoped that he would not invade somebody again. Or just hoped that he wouldn't use gas on his own people when pressure at home began to mount. 
I'm not willing to take those kind of risks. People understand that. I think a lot of people are saying, gosh, we hope we don't have war. I feel the same way. I hope we don't have war. I hope this can be done peacefully. It's up to Saddam Hussein, however, to make that choice. 
I also want to remind you that should we have to use troops, should it become a necessity in order to disarm him, the United States with friends will move swiftly with force to do the job. You don't have to worry about that. We will do, we will do, we will do what it takes militarily to succeed. 
I also want to say something else to people of Iraq. That the generals in Iraq must understand clearly there will be consequences for their behavior. Should they choose, if force is necessary, to behave in a way that endangers the lives of their own citizens as well as citizens in the neighborhood, there will be a consequence. They will be held to account. And as to the Iraqi people, what I said before, the Iraqi people can have a better life than the one they have now. They can have -- there are other alternatives to somebody who is willing to rape and mutilate and murder in order to stay in power. There's just a better life than the one they have to live now. I think the people of the world understand that, too. 
I don't take, I don't spend a lot of time taking polls around the world to tell me what I think is the right way to act. I've just got to know how I feel. I feel strongly about freedom. I feel strongly about liberty. And I feel strongly about the obligation to make the world a more peaceful place. And I take those responsibilities really seriously. 

Q. You said you've reached out to Democrats. Does this mean that you will be governing more from the center and taking fewer cues from the conservative arm of your party?

A. I don't take cues from anybody. I just do what I think is right. Just the way I lead. And what's right is to work to stimulate the economy. I strongly believe that tax relief was the right thing to do. If people are really interested in job creation they ought to join me in my call to make the tax cuts permanent. It's an important part of sending a signal that there is a certainty in the tax code, that all the benefits from tax relief don't go away after 10 years.
I like to say, you might have heard me once or 10 times or 100 times, the Senate giveth and the Senate taketh away. That means there's uncertainty when that happens. And you've got to have certainty in a system that requires risk. And making the tax cuts permanent is an essential part. And so that is a common-sense drive to create jobs. I will just tell people what I think about how to solve the problems we face. And I ran on a political philosophy. I'm not changing my political philosophy. I am who I am prior to -- you know, that I'm the same guy after the election that I was prior to the election. And it's just who I am and how I intend to lead this country. . . . 

Q. Getting back to the question of Harvey Pitt.

A. Yes.

Q. What kind of person are you looking for to fill that position now? And how quickly do you want to move on that? And then also, as much as you said that Mr. Webster is a well-respected and quality person, do you think that the chairman, whoever that new chairman is, should have a chance to select their own person and have a fresh start?

A. Well, I think -- kind of the double whammy hypothetical here. I think that the -- Webster, first let's find out what the facts are. So everybody knows. That's why they're doing this investigation. And it's, one fact is irrefutable, he's a decent man. He served the country well. And I know he can do that job. Secondly, as soon as possible for the S.E.C. nominee. And somebody who is going to continue to fulfill the obligation that -- of holding people to account. In other words, holding wrongdoers to account and making sure the numbers are fair and open and transparent and everybody understands the facts when it comes to accounting so that we continue to regain confidence in our system. That people when they invest based upon the numbers of a particular stock are confident in that which they read. And that's an essential part of the S.E.C. job. And I'm confident we can find somebody soon to be able to do that.

Q. I want to go back to your earlier point about the risks of an action versus the risk of inaction.

A. Yes, where would that be in the Congress or ----

Q. Against Iraq.

A. Oh, O.K.

Q. Your C.I.A. director told Congress just last month that it appears that Saddam Hussein, "now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks against the United States."

A. Mm-hm.

Q. But if we attacked him he would "probably become much less constrained."

A. Yeah, well ----

Q. Is he wrong about that?

A. No. I think that if you would read the full -- I'm sure that he said other sentences. Let me just put it to you, I know George Tenet well. I meet with him every single day. He sees Saddam Hussein as a threat. I don't know what the context of that quote is. I'm telling you the guy knows what I know -- that he is a problem and we must deal with him. And, you know, it's like people say, oh, we must leave Saddam alone, otherwise if we did something against him he might attack us. Well, if we don't do something he might attack us. And he might attack us with a more serious weapon.
The man is a threat. I'm telling you. He's a threat not only with what he has. He's a threat with what he's done. He's a threat because he is dealing with Al Qaeda. In my Cincinnati speech I reminded the American people a true threat facing our country is that a Al Qaeda-type network trained and armed by Saddam could attack America and leave not one fingerprint. That is a threat. And we're going to deal with it. 
The debate about whether we're going to deal with Saddam Hussein is over. And now the question is how do we deal with him? I made the decision to go to the United Nations because I want to try to do this peacefully. I want Saddam to disarm. The best way to convince him to disarm is to get the nations to come together through the U.N. and try to convince him to disarm. We're going to work on that. We've been spending a lot of time, I wouldn't exactly call it gnashing of teeth, but working hard at the U.N. resolution. It took a while. But we've been grinding it out, trying to bring a consensus, trying to get people together so that we can say to the world the international community has spoken through the Security Council of the United Nations. . . .

Q. Do you intend to resuscitate the nomination of Priscilla Owen and Charles Pickering? And also, how bloody do you think the next Supreme Court nomination will be?

A. Well, first, I want the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to understand that I am very serious about the reforms that I suggested in the East Room about how to get this process of nominating judges and approving judges on the right course, not only for this administration but future administrations, not only for this Senate but future Senates. And so step one on the judiciary process, I believe there needs to be reform. I would be glad to reprise the reforms if you can't remember them.

Q. Owen and Pickering ----

A. I'll be there in a minute. I'm using this as an opportunity to make a point on judicial reform. And that is that if a judge thinks he's going to retire, give us a year's notice if possible. And then we will act, we the administrative branch, would nominate somebody and clear them within 180 days. And then the Senate Judiciary Committee has got 90 days to go through the process and then get the person's name to the floor and 180 days for an up or down vote. To me that would be a needed and necessary reform. So step one on the nomination process is to work with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy to put these reforms in place, is to convince members of the Senate we're serious about a process that will get rid of the old bitterness of the judicial process. This is probably not to your liking, by the way. You love those court fights. I'm confident that it makes great cover and great stories.
I also said at the time of Priscilla Owens not being put to the floor of the Senate that I would hope that the Judiciary Committee would let her name out to the Senate floor at some point in time. We don't have to recommit them. They never -- they're there. Pickering and Owen are still there at the committee level. They just weren't ever, their names were never let to the floor for a vote. By the way, if they had been let to the floor for a vote we believe they'd have won the vote. And perhaps the reason that's why they were never let to the floor for a vote. But so I hope that Judiciary Committee will let their names out and they get a fair hearing. . . .

Q. Some critics contend there is racial disparity in how immigrants are handled here. And speaking of the Haitians versus the other immigrants, do you support the current law on the books about Haiti and why either way?

A. First of all, the immigration laws ought to be the same for Haitians and everybody else, except for Cubans. And the difference, of course, is that we don't send people back to Cuba because they're going to be persecuted. And that's why we've got the special law on the books as regards to Cubans. But Haitians and everybody else ought to be treated the same way. And we're in the process of making sure that happens.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE CLASS OF '02; 
Experience Wafts From the List of New Senators and Governors

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
There are no Contract With America activists, no soccer moms, no political cowboys riding in on the back of a single untamed issue.
 By and large, the new crop of senators and governors catapulted to national prominence on Tuesday are people with steady hands and serious resumes -- well qualified, well grounded and stylistically earnest, many of them professing interest in building bipartisan bridges. 
 "These are candidates who were solid citizens, maybe even dull sometimes, people who were reliable and dependable," said Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report. "Sometimes voters like the Jesse Venturas of the world, people who are colorful and flamboyant. I don't think people were looking for that this time around." 
Whether because of post-Sept. 11 anxiety, concern about the flagging economy or jumpy anticipation of a war with Iraq, successful candidates this year tended to be seasoned racehorses, not headstrong stallions. 
The new group of Republican senators, for example, includes three current or former members of the House: Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who defeated the incumbent, Max Cleland; James M. Talent of Missouri, who unseated Jean Carnahan; and John E. Sununu of New Hampshire, who defeated Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and whose father, John H. Sununu, is himself a former governor who was chief of staff to the first President Bush.
Two attorneys general are also headed for the Senate: John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who is the son of David Pryor, a former senator and governor. In Minnesota, Norm Coleman, the Republican who defeated Walter F. Mondale, is a former mayor of St. Paul.
The nation's new governors have similar credentials. Current or former congressmen were elected governor in Illinois, Maryland, South Carolina and perhaps Alabama, where the outcome remains disputed. Former mayors won in Tennessee and Pennsylvania. State attorneys general won in Michigan and Wisconsin. A former United States attorney was elected in Wyoming, and the state insurance commissioner became governor-elect in Kansas.
"We had been seeing more of the phenomenon of a governor who does not have a political background," said Peter Wiley, an official of the National Governors Association. "But this time we only had a handful of states where the person who was victorious did not have a background of holding office."
Even in those states, Mr. Wiley said, the victors usually had strong executive experience. Mitt Romney, the Republican governor-elect here in Massachusetts, is a venture capitalist who led the Salt Lake City Olympics. Donald Carcieri, another Republican, was chief executive of a holding company that, he said, had a budget larger than the general revenue of Rhode Island, where he was elected governor.
On the Republican side, the selection of many candidates was part of a White House effort, led by President Bush's chief political strategist, Karl Rove, to handpick people with political experience and pleasing personalities, said Charles Black, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House. "There's no doubt that what the president and Karl did was try to recruit really quality candidates," Mr. Black said, "not only people who had good credentials and experience but who also had good campaign skills."
Some are already seen as having the potential to rise still higher. Most notably, Mr. Romney is considered a possibility to follow in the path of his father, George W. Romney, a Michigan governor who became a Republican presidential aspirant.
Jennifer Granholm, who will be Michigan's first Democratic governor in 12 years, is considered a rising star because of her telegenic looks and charismatic style. But she can rise only so far: as a native of a foreign country (she came to the United States from Canada at the age of 4), she is constitutionally disqualified from serving as president. 
This new generation of senators and governors bucks another trend of the last decade or so, when sharp-tongued partisans often fared well in elections. Perhaps because of a growing number of independent voters and their central role in tight races, candidates this year tended to be moderate in style or substance, or both. Mr. Black said the White House had supported candidates "with the populist touch, people who know how to present their conservative philosophy in a way that reaches out to moderate voters."
"They're nonthreatening," he said. "If they modeled it after anyone, it was probably after George Bush, who's conservative in philosophy and moderate in tone."
Mr. Sununu, for example, opposes abortion, as did Robert C. Smith, the senator he ousted in New Hampshire's Republican primary. But while Mr. Smith demonstrated his opposition on the Senate floor by stabbing a plastic doll with a pair of scissors, Mr. Sununu's serious, somewhat awkward demeanor would hardly lend itself to such a tactic. 
"He's trained as an engineer, and he's got an engineer's personality," said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire survey center. "He's just not as gregarious, but I'm not sure it hurt him."
In the general election campaign, Mr. Sununu even tried to distance himself from his party at times, to appeal to independents who had previously supported his opponent, Governor Shaheen.
In Missouri, Mr. Talent's campaign style also cushioned some of his conservative views. 
"He looks young and earnest, maybe Clark Kentish," said Lana Stein, chairwoman of the political science department at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "Actually a lot of things he supports can be quite right of center, but he doesn't talk about that. You couldn't tell that he would be as right wing as I think he is."
Instead, Mr. Talent "was campaigning heavily that he wanted a prescription drug plan, that he wanted to save Social Security," Dr. Stein said, adding, "He was adopting some of the Democratic themes." 
Mr. Black agreed. "Jim Talent would say, 'Sure, I'm right-to-life and proud of it,' " he said. "But he didn't lead with that."
Many candidates emphasized bipartisanship. "This was the year of nice," said John R. Petrocik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Missouri-Columbia. "This is the year in which one of the secrets to defeating the opponent was doing it in the context of gridlock: the work of the country isn't being done, we have to get bills passed. 
"Candidates were saying: 'The country is tired of acrimony. They want things fixed. We look like we might be on the edge of a war, and we can't look like a bunch of angry politicians.' " 
In Minnesota, Mr. Coleman ran for the Senate by talking repeatedly about cooperating with the Democrats and "changing the tone" in Washington. "I think the folks are looking for public officials who have the capacity to bring people to the table, to work together, to reach across the aisle, to solve a problem," he said during the campaign.
Mr. Rothenberg, the political analyst, said that where previous election cycles had brought "more and more ideological members of Congress and even some governors," voters this year sought the steadying hand of calm and experience, a search that he attributed in part to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
"After 9/11, the threat seems so much more real to Americans, all this talk about terrorism around the world," he said. "It's a combination of that plus uncertainty around the economy. Voters just weren't looking for someone who just fell off the pumpkin truck."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
PRESIDENT WARNS HUSSEIN TO HEED A CALL TO DISARM

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER with JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
With the Security Council moving toward approving a resolution on Friday to force Saddam Hussein to disarm, President Bush warned today that if Mr. Hussein failed to comply, Washington and its allies would "move swiftly with force to do the job." 
 In a news conference, Mr. Bush also issued his most explicit warning yet to the generals serving Mr. Hussein, saying they would be "held to account" if they responded to any attack by endangering lives in Iraq or in neighboring countries. Without saying so precisely, he was clearly warning them against executing any orders from Mr. Hussein to release chemical or biological weapons or to take aim at Israel if Iraq were attacked. 
 Mr. Bush said he was "optimistic" that the United States would get broad support on the resolution. 
France said it would vote in favor of the resolution after Mr. Bush spoke by telephone with President Jacques Chirac. The conversation resolved the sparring between Paris and Washington over whether the resolution would allow Mr. Bush to order an attack on Iraq without returning to the United Nations for specific authorization.
But differences with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia remained, even after Mr. Bush spoke with him today. 
Mr. Bush, in his first public appearance since the Republicans gained control of Congress on Tuesday, also said that his top domestic priority was security, and that he wanted Congress to establish a new cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security by the end of the year. Article and text, Page A24. 
While Mr. Bush said several times that he hoped war could be avoided, he expressed considerable skepticism that Mr. Hussein would comply with the inspection and disarmament process laid out in the resolution, which took final shape tonight in the Security Council. 
Whatever the diplomatic niceties, Mr. Bush made it clear that he regarded the resolution to be all the authority he needed to act against Iraq should Mr. Hussein balk. Though Washington would consult other members of the Security Council, it would not feel it necessary to win their approval.
To drive home his determination, Mr. Bush described at some length his fears of what President Hussein might do if left unchecked.
"If we don't do something, he might attack us," Mr. Bush said. "And he might attack us with a more serious weapon." He added that Mr. Hussein might also provide such a weapon to what he called "an Al Qaeda-like network" that could detonate it in the United States and "leave not one fingerprint."
With a successful election now behind him and a victory in the United Nations within reach, Mr. Bush used his news conference to drive home his point that Mr. Hussein had little hope of evading the disarmament that he agreed to at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
In the opening moments of the news conference, Mr. Bush cast the confrontation as one that pitted "the civilized world" against a murderous tyrant. 
He acknowledged that the confrontation itself could lead the Iraqi president to lash out in ways he has never before dared, but said that was the lesser risk. 
His voice tinged with a bit of sarcasm, he allowed that "some people aren't going to like" the forced disarmament of Iraq, but noted drily that "some people won't like it if he ends up with a nuclear weapon and uses it."
Picking up on the challenge to the United Nations that he repeated so often on the campaign trail, Mr. Bush referred to the 16 past United Nations resolutions on Iraq, which he contends Mr. Hussein has ignored.
"This would be the 17th time that we expect Saddam to disarm," he said. "This time we mean it." A moment later, he added, "This time it's for real."
In a comment that seemed aimed at the United Nations -- and perhaps also reflected on the record of two predecessors, Bill Clinton and his own father -- Mr. Bush said, "And I say it must not have been for real the last 16 times, because nothing happened when he didn't." 
At the United Nations today, the vote was formally scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday.
After Paris tenaciously resisted Washington during eight weeks of arduous negotiations, Ambassador Jean-David Levitte said his country's last doubts had been eliminated by small revisions made this afternoon. "It is ready for us," a French diplomat said. "We got what we wanted."
Asked if France intended to vote in favor, the diplomat said, with a smile and a sigh of relief, "Yes!"
The United States representative, John D. Negroponte, and Sir Jeremy Greenstock, of Britain, said they decided to schedule the vote after momentum built today in favor of the measure.
China, a permanent member of the Council that has remained in the background throughout the talks, came forward today to suggest that it, too, would vote in favor.
"If we can compare the differences of all sides to clouds, I can say that the clouds are getting thinner and thinner," said Zhang Yishan, the deputy representative from China, which holds the Council presidency this month. "The sunlight of unity is about to come."
The shift came after the United States and Britain, which is also sponsoring the resolution, changed two small words that made a world of difference to France. France took the lead in the talks, representing the views of China, Mexico and other nations that feared the United States would use the resolution to launch war immediately to topple Mr. Hussein.
In a hasty drafting session this afternoon, American and British diplomats simply changed the word "or" in one passage to "and," and substituted the word "secure" in a phrase that previously said the Council could act to "restore" international peace and security.
France had insisted on two stages of Council deliberations, including a commitment by President Bush to wait for United Nations weapons inspectors to submit a report, and to allow the report to be weighed by the Council, before he would send its troops into war in Iraq.
"There is now no route through this resolution that circumvents the weapons inspections," a British diplomat said. "There will be input from the inspectors -- that's clear."
American and British diplomats stressed, however, that they did not feel that their hands are tied by resolution in the event the Security Council does not deem a violation by Iraq serious enough to bring on a military attack.
Among the envoys from the five permanent, veto-bearing nations, only the Russian ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, remained distant. 
Mr. Lavrov said only that he had heard the explanations from American and British diplomats, that neither nation "interprets the language as containing automatic use of force," and would report this to Moscow.
Among the 10 other Council members, only Syria voiced any objections. The Syrian representative, Fayssal Mekdad, objected to the absence of any reference to the possibility of lifting economic sanctions against Iraq if it complied fully with the weapons inspections. He said it would be "very, very difficult, if not impossible" for Syria to take part in the vote. 
But these remarks led Council members to assume that even Syria, the only Arab nation on the Council, would not vote against the resolution.
Mr. Bush, appearing more relaxed than he has in weeks, was conciliatory on every subject other than Iraq. He dismissed suggestions that North Korea -- which is believed to possess two or more nuclear weapons and says it is developing more -- poses a more urgent threat to the United States than does Iraq.
"We're taking a different strategy" on North Korea than on Iraq, he said, before adding a telling word: "initially." That left hanging the possibility that a more muscular confrontation with North Korea could be in the offing once Mr. Bush had dealt with Iraq.
In fact, Mr. Bush seems to be having more success getting the world together on a strategy for disarming Iraq than on a strategy for disarming North Korea, which told American officials a month ago that it is enriching uranium, a hard-to-detect technology to develop nuclear warheads. 
Mr. Bush talked today of forging a common approach with Japan, South Korea and China. But South Korean officials are clearly not in agreement with the Bush strategy of economically isolating North Korea, and Mr. Bush himself steered clear today of discussing the question of whether the United States would halt its shipments of oil to the North. 
His reluctance to discuss North Korea's nuclear program stood in stark contrast to his eagerness to describe his fears about what would happen if Mr. Hussein ever got such a weapon.
"We don't know how close he is to a nuclear weapon right now," Mr. Bush said of Mr. Hussein. "We know he wants one.
"Imagine Saddam Hussein with a nuclear weapon," Mr. Bush continued. "Imagine how the Israeli citizens would feel. Imagine how the citizen in Saudi Arabia would feel. Imagine how the world would change, how he could alter diplomacy by the very presence of a nuclear weapon." 
Tonight Mr. Bush invited several prominent Muslims to an iftar dinner, to break the daily Ramadan fast, and used it to argue that there is no reason to fear a war against Islam.
"Our nation is waging a war on a radical network of terrorists, not on a religion and not on a civilization," he said. "If we wage this war to defend our principles, we must live up to those principles, ourselves. And one of the deepest commitments of America is tolerance."

HEADLINE: A Debut Today for Single-Stock Futures 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Single-stock futures -- hailed by some on Wall Street as a great innovation and viewed by others as nothing more than a way to let gamblers put down less money -- will begin trading on two American exchanges today. 
 Initial volume may be rather impressive, as the competing markets scramble to appear more successful and more liquid. Even so, it is far from clear whether the products will be the boon to depressed markets that futures dealers hoped for when they lobbied Congress to make the products legal. 
 Nasdaq Liffe Markets will begin offering futures on 10 stocks and 4 exchange-traded funds. OneChicago, a joint venture of the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, will start with futures on 21 stocks. 
The two markets are mutually hostile. Both operate electronically but use different methods to assure liquidity in what could prove to be thinly traded markets. And they are incompatible. While they will trade futures on some of the same stocks, a speculator who buys a future on one exchange cannot sell that contract on the other.
And what is a single-stock future? It is a contract to buy 100 shares of stock, at the stated price at a later date. Economically, the buyer of such a future has taken on the economic risks, and rewards, of buying the stock. So why not just buy the stock?
The primary answer is leverage. Anyone who wants to buy 100 shares of Microsoft at $56 today has to put up half the purchase price, or $2,800, because the minimum margin for share purchases is 50 percent. But a Microsoft futures contract will be available for a 20 percent margin, or about $1,120. Assuming Microsoft rises, the buyer of the future will have profits almost as great as the buyer of the shares, on a much smaller initial investment.
The profits will be a little smaller because in normal times, the Microsoft future will trade at a premium to the stock, reflecting the advantages of that margin discount. The premium would be reduced if Microsoft paid a dividend because the owner of the futures contract would not receive the dividend.
The other big advantage of futures trading over stock trading is that there are no limitations on short sales. Someone who wants to bet that Microsoft shares are headed lower can sell them short, by borrowing them and selling them. But that sale can be made only on an uptick, defined as a price higher than the last different price. That can make it harder to lock in a short sale when a stock is falling anyway.
But a future can be sold at any time, at whatever price can be obtained. So the futures have attractions for traders who want to be able to sell short whenever they please.
Single-stock futures have been available in London since the beginning of 2001. They have not been wildly successful, however, with total monthly volume peaking at 595,294 contracts in June and falling to 217,169 contracts last month. American investors cannot legally trade them, and the industry holds the Securities and Exchange Commission responsible for that.
The S.E.C. historically saw no need for the contracts in this country. But in 2000 Congress pushed for the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to reach a deal allowing them. The futures exchanges wanted a new product to revive volume, and legislators were in a mood to accommodate them.
Both markets plan to offer futures on more stocks over coming weeks. Trading in them, assuming the market develops, could provide insights into just how active short sellers are. In a stock that is hard to borrow for shorting, the futures price might fall below the stock market price because of the extra selling pressure. That probably will not happen soon, however, because the first futures being traded are generally on larger and more liquid stocks, which are relatively easy to short.
The Nasdaq Liffe Market, owned by Nasdaq and the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, or Liffe, will operate much like the Nasdaq stock market, with competitive market makers. A number of large brokerage firms have agreed to act as market makers on the promise that they can take the other side of public orders from their customers, for at least half the shares.
The OneChicago market has primary market makers, as do the options exchanges and the stock exchanges, who will be in charge of making markets for individual futures. It remains to be seen which market will do a better job, either of providing better prices or of gaining business.
Both markets will initially offer contracts expiring in December, January, February and March, recognizing the fact that most activity in futures markets is in the near months. But the Nasdaq Liffe market will also offer contracts for June, September, December and March 2003.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "With Student Cheating on the Rise, More Colleges Are Turning to Honor Codes" (news article, Nov. 2): 
 Cheating is made easier through unimaginative instruction. 
If you look at the many commercial term paper sites on the Internet, you will find that there are large numbers of papers for only a small number of topics. 
Faculty members are under increasing pressure to devote time to research instead of teaching, a fact that helps explain why the same questions and problems and term paper topics are assigned again and again. 
Students, also under increasing pressure and stress to perform well in terms of paper grades, respond to these incentives.
If professors were more creative and less repetitive in their teaching, that market for one-size-fits-all term papers would not work as well.

HEADLINE: For the Chinese, Stability Above All 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Shambaugh ("Will the Party Lose China?," Op-Ed, Nov. 7) is correct in highlighting the Communist Party's gradual decay and the widespread cynicism of it within Chinese society. But his argument fails to recognize that there is an even greater cynicism for the expected alternative: democracy. 
 Though the Chinese may be largely disenchanted with their rulers' corruption and a weak rural economy, they are pleased with the country's overall economic stability. Viewing the instability that led to Russian and Indonesian democracy has created a Chinese population that is decreasingly agnostic of the leadership. 
After decades of socioeconomic turmoil and change, the Chinese are looking less for a grand plan for the future and more toward the solidity of the status quo.

Worries About Iraq and Economic Recovery Hurt Shares

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A United Nations resolution against Iraq and a downbeat outlook from McDonald's renewed investor doubts about the strength of the economic recovery, sending stocks lower yesterday to end the week mixed.
 The Dow Jones industrial average posted its fifth consecutive week of gains, while the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index snapped their four-week winning streak. 
 Trading was choppy as investors digested a busy week of news, including the midterm elections. Many were still reacting negatively to the half-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, analysts said. 
"Investors are worried the economy isn't turning around like we had expected," said Matt Brown, head of equity management at Wilmington Trust.
The Dow declined 49.11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 8,537.13. Earlier in the day, blue-chip stocks rose as much as 82 points.
The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite fell 17.44 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,359.27. The S.& P. dropped 7.91 points, or 0.9 percent, to 894.74.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.2 percent, the Nasdaq fell 0.1 percent and the S.& P. 500 dropped 0.7 percent.
The United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a tough new resolution on Iraq, aimed at forcing Saddam Hussein to disarm or face "serious consequences." President Bush immediately went to the White House Rose Garden to warn Mr. Hussein to comply at once.
The dollar fell to its lowest level against the euro in nearly three years. The euro has been gaining against the dollar since mid-October. Yesterday, it climbed to $1.0132 from $1.0088 on Thursday.
"It's very hard to get any sustainable rally with that negative cloud out there," Mr. Brown said. "I think the volatility is here to stay. But the outlook for us is that stocks are still better than bonds over the next year."
McDonald's, meanwhile, said it would not meet its 2002 earnings target and would close 175 restaurants, citing increased competition in a weak economic environment. Its shares fell $1.52, to $17.79.
"The McDonald's warning is a cause of concern," said Tony Cecin, director of institutional trading at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "It says this recovery is going to be slower and come in more fits and starts. Right now, the key ingredient is how to get business spending again."
Still, losses were somewhat limited, analysts said, by an underlying optimism among investors after a four-week rally on better-than-expected earnings. Since hitting a five-year low on Oct. 9, the Dow has gained about 1,200 points, or 17 percent.
Investors also are hopeful that a Republican-controlled Congress will support deeper tax cuts to help businesses.
Tenet Healthcare fell $13.05, to $14.90, after its chief operating officer and chief financial officer left the hospital chain amid an investigation by the federal government over its Medicare payments for costly procedures.
Shares of the Walt Disney Company dropped 58 cents, to $17.68, after a larger fourth-quarter profit met analysts' expectations, but the company said that sales at its theme parks remained slow.
El Paso declined $1.52, to $7.68, after it reported a third-quarter loss, missing Wall Street's estimates.
Shares of Nvidia, a graphics chip designer, fell $3.19, or 22 percent, to $11.36, a day after it reported weak quarterly earnings. Gainers included Eli Lilly, which rose $3.28, to $62.24, after saying regulatory approval of three new drugs will not be affected by its manufacturing problems.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was heavy.
Treasury bond prices rose as the market closed early in advance of the Veterans Day holiday on Monday.
The 10-year note gained 5/32 , to a price of 101 7/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.85 percent from 3.87 percent on Thursday. The 30-year bond jumped 19/32 , to 108 29/32 . Its yield dropped to 4.80 percent from 4.88 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
ABB to Shed Units and Cut 10,000 Jobs

BYLINE:  By ALISON LANGLEY

DATELINE: ZURICH, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Jurgen Dormann, the new chief executive of ABB, the embattled Swiss heavy-machinery maker, tried to restore confidence in the company today by laying out his plans for a radical overhaul.
 The plan, presented at a daylong meeting with investors, includes sweeping layoffs, the sale of two major businesses and other cost-cutting measures intended to restore profitability and growth. But it will also shrink the company, once hailed as Europe's answer to General Electric, to two-thirds its former size. 
 For the second time in his two months on the job, Mr. Dormann reduced the company's revenue and profit forecasts for the current year. 
"We are aware of the fact that what is expected of us is action," he said. "We must act accordingly." 
ABB has been buffeted for more than a year by problems, from a slump in capital spending by its customers to soaring asbestos-related litigation to turmoil in its top executive ranks. Its shares have lost 85 percent of their value this year.
Mr. Dormann said today that the company's revenue would be flat or down for 2002, and could grow by 4 percent next year, well short of the previous 6 percent target.
Central to the latest overhaul plan, the company's third in four years, is a sale of the oil, gas and petrochemicals division, which constructs and equips refineries and other industrial plants, and its building systems unit. The two units together accounted for some $6.6 billion in revenue last year. 
The company is counting on a planned Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by a United States subsidiary, Combustion Engineering, to wall it off from rapidly growing liability in asbestos litigation. The company would then turn over all of Combustion's remaining assets and some additional cash from the parent company, perhaps $1.1 billion in all, to settle the suits. Mr. Dormann said today that he expected talks with the plaintiffs' lawyers to yield such an agreement in four to six months.
ABB will also eliminate at least 10,000 jobs, on top of about 12,000 already eliminated in the last 16 months, and take other measures to save a total of $800 million by the middle of 2004. The slimmed-down company will have about $16 billion in annual revenue and some 100,000 employees, Mr. Dormann said; it had $23.7 billion in revenue and 150,000 employees last year.
The company's $5.5 billion in debt will be halved by 2005, according to the company's chief financial officer, Peter Voser. 
Mr. Dormann is a German who has put his reputation on the line by taking on the job of salvaging ABB. He told analysts today that he would try to bring a more disciplined management style to a company that was created by merging Asea of Sweden and Brown Boveri of Switzerland and has grown into a complex conglomerate through hundreds of acquisitions. 
"I guess I go back to my Prussian roots, where I say something and then I do it," Mr. Dormann told analysts. "That was not easy before, because the structure was so difficult and there was a lack of transparency, which brought with it a lack of accountability." 
Mr. Dormann said in October that his predecessor, Jorgen Centerman, was dismissed after less than a year on the job because he was moving too slowly, especially in selling peripheral businesses.
Mr. Dormann said ABB was in talks with three potential buyers for the oil and gas division and hoped to reap a substantial gain from the sale. The much smaller building systems unit would be more difficult to sell, he said.
Mr. Dormann and Mr. Voser, his closest aide, today made clear their frustration with previous management. Mr. Dormann said the company had become dysfunctional from growing too fast and too indiscriminately., When he took over the reins, he said, no one at ABB could give him a precise figure on the number of companies it had bought in the past decade. The best guess so far, he said, is 500 to 800.
Many of the new acquisitions do not fit well with ABB, Mr. Dormann said, and attempts to integrate them are failing. Previous management tried lumping many of them into a new division called Group Processes, which "attempted to make one shoe fit all business -- you just couldn't do that," he said.
The chaos that resulted was "ridiculous," he said.
"There were too many internal turfs. And that is changing -- that is what is different now," he said. "We will have one common goal, one ABB. We can do that with our core business of just two divisions." 
Any manager who cannot live within this new corporate culture, Mr. Dormann said, will be asked to leave.
Previous management wasted time hoping for a revival in demand that never materialized, Mr. Voser said. "The markets did not improve, we weren't fast enough in implementing cost cuts and we haven't divested fast enough," he said.

HEADLINE: Abuse Scandal Is Deterring Catholic Donors, Poll Says 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
Two out of three American Roman Catholics who attend Mass regularly say the nation's bishops have done a "bad job" facing the crisis of sexual misconduct by priests, and a more sweeping majority says each bishop should make a full disclosure of the scandal's financial costs, according to a new survey.
 A Gallup poll that is the most detailed study of how the United States' most committed Catholics view the sexual abuse crisis suggests that parishioners across the nation worry that their donations to the church are being used for legal fees in abuse lawsuits or to pay hush money to victims. One in every five Catholics surveyed said the scandal had prompted them to stop donating to the local diocese. 
 "The bishops are heading for trouble if they think they can continue to run things like so many multimillionaire barons," said Francis J. Butler, president of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities, the association of Catholic philanthropists that commissioned the survey. "Parishioners won't tolerate that anymore." 
Mr. Butler's group gave a copy of the poll to The New York Times yesterday and planned to deliver the results of the survey to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops today.
Although about 65 million Americans identify themselves as Catholics, many rarely attend Mass. The survey was administered to 1,001 Catholic households during the first three weeks of October. Its results were drawn from the responses of 656 parishioners who said they attended Mass once or almost once a week, and therefore appeared to represent the church's bedrock faithful. Three-quarters of those Catholics said they spent several hours a week on parish activities.
The Archdiocese of Boston and a handful of other dioceses have acknowledged that they face financial problems because of reduced giving and the mushrooming costs of abuse lawsuits, and many Catholics are concerned that the scandal has plunged the nationwide church into financial crisis. A recent article in the Jesuit magazine America examined how bishops might use bankruptcy laws to advantage. 
Yet because diocesan finances are kept secret by many bishops, data on how the crisis has affected parishioners' donations has been unavailable until now.
In the survey, about one in nine of the regular Mass-goers said they had been putting less money in their parish collection plate in the months since the abuse scandal began in January. About 3 percent of Catholics -- mostly more affluent and conservative parishioners -- reported increasing their parish giving. 
The nation's 194 dioceses have been harder hit: 19 percent of those surveyed said they stopped supporting their diocese, with some saying they were diverting those donations to other Catholic causes. 
Charles E. Zech, a Villanova University economics professor who prepared the questionnaire and analyzed the survey results, said in an interview that he was surprised at the consensus among the most faithful Catholics that bishops should be required to make a full report on how much they have spent to respond to sexual abuse allegations. Seventy-nine percent of those surveyed called for such a report. 
Foundations and Donors, whose member groups and philanthropists give the American church $200 million a year, asked the bishops' conference this year to hire an independent auditing firm to prepare a diocese-by-diocese report on how much the bishops have spent to respond to abuse cases. 
One influential prelate, Cardinal William Keeler of Baltimore, responded to the request by reporting last month that his archdiocese had spent $5.6 million over 20 years on settlements, counseling and other expenses related to abuse cases.
But most bishops, who under church law have virtually complete discretion over diocesan finances, have ignored the call for more accountability, and several bishops criticized Cardinal Keeler for revealing financial information, Mr. Butler said. 
"There's a fortress mentality at work in many dioceses," he said.
The bishops refused to consider the request by Foundations and Donors for a national financial report at their semiannual meeting, which begins Monday in Washington, Mr. Butler said.
Most of the questions in the Gallup survey focused on parishioners' attitudes about bishops' accountability, especially on financial matters, but one was very broad: "Do you think the U.S. Catholic bishops have done a good job or a bad job in dealing with the problem of sexual abuse of young people by Catholic priests?"
"A bad job," said 64 percent of those surveyed.

HEADLINE: Slowing the Spread of AIDS in India 

BYLINE:  By Bill Gates; Bill Gates is chairman and chief software architect of Microsoft and co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
India is well on its way to becoming a global economic superpower. Its economy has significantly outpaced much of Asia in recent years, its internationally competitive information technology and pharmaceutical industries are projected to grow dramatically this decade, and the country's purchasing power is now the fourth largest in the world, after the United States, China and Japan.
 But much of this progress will be threatened by AIDS. India already has at least 4 million people living with H.I.V., and the United States National Intelligence Council predicts that the number of people infected in India could jump to between 20 million and 25 million by 2010. 
 There is still time, however, to prevent a widespread AIDS epidemic in India. H.I.V. infection rates are low -- less than 1 percent of the adult population is infected. Having failed to prevent enormous human suffering already experienced in Africa, the international community has an opportunity to support India's efforts to stem its AIDS crisis before it's too late.
The humanitarian imperative for action is undeniable. But there are other reasons for the West to be concerned about India's future. It is the world's largest democracy and a crucial ally in an unstable region. With one of the largest scientific and technical work forces in the world, it is also an increasingly important business partner for many countries. 
India's leaders are well aware of the risk AIDS poses -- they are beginning to speak out, breaking powerful and longstanding taboos about discussing sex, drug use and this disease. The prevention efforts being made here are already starting to show measurable results.
In fact, with its vast human resources and burgeoning pharmaceutical industry, India may be one of the developing nations best positioned to contain the epidemic and offer global leadership in confronting AIDS. By vigorously pursuing H.I.V. prevention, and by marshaling its impressive scientific research sector to develop the vaccines, microbicides and treatments that could help stop the epidemic worldwide, India can make a significant contribution well beyond its borders.
Over the years, I have developed close professional and personal ties to India. India's rapidly growing software sector has made the country a critical partner to many American companies, including Microsoft. India's teachers, scientists and business professionals are laying the foundation for extraordinary economic and social change that would be threatened by AIDS. 
Much more needs to be done now to reach the populations that fuel the spread of the disease in India. For example, mobile populations -- truckers, soldiers and migrant laborers -- have H.I.V. rates up to 10 times greater than the national average and serve as a bridge from high-risk groups to the general population. Other nations -- including Senegal, Thailand and Brazil -- have demonstrated that H.I.V. rates can be reduced, sometimes substantially, through programs that reach those most at risk. 
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is in India this week to make a long-term commitment to Indian partners for a major new prevention initiative aimed at mobile populations. The initiative will focus on proven prevention strategies, such as voluntary counseling and testing, condom distribution, and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases as well as public education programs to reduce the fear and stigma of AIDS.
India cannot face the challenge of AIDS alone. Wealthy nations, businesses and the philanthropic world must contribute to efforts to contain India's AIDS crisis before it expands. Far greater resources and expertise must be devoted to prevention programs, training health care workers and supporting research into new medical advancements. 
We know how to prevent the spread of H.I.V. and AIDS. The choice now is clear and stark: India can either be the home of the world's largest and most devastating AIDS epidemic -- or, with the support of the rest of the world, it can become the best example of how this virus can be defeated.

HEADLINE: How the City Pays for State's Sins 

BYLINE:  By Andrew White; Andrew White is director of the Center for New York City Affairs at New School University.

 BODY:
In state offices turnover was almost nil in this week's elections. Gov. George E. Pataki and all but three incumbent members of the state legislature won re-election.
 One of the consequences of New York's immovable political system, which trades budget fairness for political benefits, is the fiscal crisis in New York City and other counties across the state. These deficits are not simply the result of a cyclical (and thus predictable) economic downturn. They stem from decisions made in Albany on tax cuts, public-sector pensions, Medicaid expansion and more, which shift costs to local governments. 
 Because of tax cuts Mr. Pataki has signed since 1994, state revenues will be $14.4 billion lower this year than they would have been otherwise, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. More than a dozen other cuts are slated to take effect in 2003. New York once ranked near the top nationally in terms of the state's tax burden on personal income. No longer: it is now among the bottom 20 states.
But it's a bait and switch. When state and local taxes are combined, New York still ranks at the top in terms of taxes as a percentage of personal income. As state taxes are slashed, local taxes grow.
It didn't used to be this way. Fifteen years ago, state and local governments shared the cost of public services in the state, with help from Washington. (The federal government pays for about 10 percent of New York City's budget, mostly for social services.) Back in the 1980's, the state-local tax burden was split evenly. Today, localities cover nearly 10 percent more of these costs than the state. As Albany has shared less revenue, state mandates have driven local spending increases.
Fiscal conservatives holler that profligate local governments must show more restraint. But local governments don't have much room. Of New York City's $42 billion budget, for example, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council have direct control over only about $15 billion. The rest is inaccessible -- thanks to federal and state mandates, pensions and debt payments.
Facing a deficit of $5 billion or more, the city's budget decisions will inevitably hurt low-income mothers, teens in foster care, parents in Family Court and others who rely on social programs but never vote in large enough numbers to gain the favor of Albany dealmakers. Meanwhile, some politically connected unions have won substantial pension deals in recent years from Albany. In 1999, for example, Mr. Pataki, with the help of the legislature, circumvented New York City's collective bargaining process and signed into law new pension benefits for jail guards worth $100 million annually. City taxpayers will foot the bill.
New York City has little power to defend itself from Albany's manipulations. Consider Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people and the single greatest state mandate. While the federal government funds half the cost of Medicaid, and the state covers about one-third of the city's costs, City Hall must pay the rest. This year, city taxpayers will spend $3.7 billion on Medicaid, according to the City Council, up from $2.5 billion in 1998.
This rise in Medicaid spending is driven in part by rising health-care and nursing-home costs. But it is also the result of recent Albany political deals: the extension of subsidized health insurance to hundreds of thousands of working-class New Yorkers, a much-needed hike in salaries for some low-wage health care workers and higher reimbursement rates for hospitals. These initiatives won the governor critical electoral support from the state's powerful health care workers union, as well as from the medical establishment.
It's not the substance of the deals that is the problem. These workers deserve more pay and better benefits. It's that Albany refused to postpone tax cuts to cover the $260 million bill city taxpayers will have to absorb between now and 2005.
There are other reasons why New York City mayors tend to dislike New York governors. The repeal of the commuter tax in 1999, for example, opened up a recurring $360 million city budget hole. Last year Albany eliminated the 23-year-old stock transfer incentive fund, costing the city $114 million annually.
The governor and most members of the state legislature will cut taxes and shift costs whenever they can. But their political opportunism has a cost. In New York City that cost may well be service cuts, rising indebtedness and a soul-crushing squeeze for a city that spent 10 long years climbing out of its last crisis-driven nightmare.

HEADLINE: Shuttle's Crew Is Poised to Continue Building of Space Station 

BYLINE:  By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
If the next space shuttle mission to the International Space Station seems familiar, that's because it is. Next week's planned voyage of the shuttle Endeavour is almost a mirror image of an October mission that added a large support beam to the station.
 The Endeavour, carrying seven American and Russian astronauts, is scheduled to blast off on Monday morning from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on an 11-day mission. The shuttle will carry another 28,000-pound truss segment to expand the space station and a new crew of three to take over operations at the station for the next four months. 
 When the Endeavour returns to Earth, it will bring back the station crew that has been aboard since June, Valery G. Korzun and Sergei Y. Treschev of Russia, and Dr. Peggy A. Whitson of the United States.
The station, which has been continually staffed for two years, will get its sixth resident crew: Capt. Kenneth D. Bowersox of the Navy, who will serve as commander; Dr. Donald R. Pettit, a chemical engineer who will serve as science officer; and Nikolai M. Budarin, a Russian engineer employed by the RSC Energia aerospace company.
The shuttle's cargo bay is filled by the 45-foot-long Port 1 truss, an aluminum girder that will be attached to the station to support other equipment. The $390 million segment, built by the Boeing Company, is crammed with wiring, cables and piping that will be a major part of the station's communications, data relay and cooling systems.
Using the robot arm of the space shuttle and a larger robotic crane aboard the station, astronauts will fasten the truss to the port side of a central beam segment attached to the Destiny science module. Last month, crew members from the shuttle Atlantis hooked an almost identical truss to the starboard side of the structure.
With the addition of the port segment, the truss will span 134 feet. This beam will eventually grow to 356 feet to support four giant solar power arrays and several new modules for the station.
During its five years of construction, the station has become the largest man-made object ever in space. The research outpost is now 171 feet long, 240 feet wide and 90 feet high, and has a mass of 197 tons.
The project, a partnership of 16 nations including the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada and many European nations, is expected to cost more than $60 billion to build and at least $30 billion to maintain over a 15-year life span.
Last month, William Gerstenmaier, NASA's space station program manager, said the construction schedule had been revised to stretch out assembly through 2008, about two years longer than previously planned. The main American segments should still be completed on schedule, by February 2004, but addition of a Japanese module and a centrifuge unit will be delayed for budgetary reasons, he said.
All the project's partners have been challenged by its price tag as budgets shrink because of the world economic downturn and unexpected cost overruns. The American part of the project is believed to be $4.8 billion over budget and several United States additions to the station have been canceled.
The Endeavour crew, under the command of Capt. James D. Wetherbee of the Navy, who has flown on five previous missions, will conduct three spacewalks to attach the truss to the station. The spacewalks will be conducted by two Navy men: Captain Michael E. Lopez-Alegria, a veteran of two previous missions, and Cmdr. John B. Herrington, who is making his first flight and is the first American Indian astronaut. Lt. Col. Paul S. Lockhart of the Air Force, the mission's pilot, has flown on one previous shuttle mission.
Also aboard the shuttle will be about 1,500 pounds of supplies for the station, including food, film, batteries and clothing, as well as new research equipment. On its return, the spaceship will bring back several completed scientific experiments and station refuse.
After the shuttle completes its stay at the station but before it returns to Earth on Nov. 21, it is to release into orbit two satellites, each the size of a toaster, that are tethered together by a 50-foot line as part of a Defense Department experiment.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Success Among Latinos Worries Some Democrats 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
Latinos, the group of voters most courted by Republicans in New York's election for governor, appear to have rewarded Gov. George E. Pataki for his extensive efforts, leaving Democrats arguing over the long-term impact on their party.
 Some Democrats say Latino voters merely responded to an assiduous attempt by Mr. Pataki to get their vote -- an effort that included a television commercial with him speaking Spanish and the opening of an Amigos de Pataki outpost -- but that Latinos remain Democrats at heart. 
 Others say Mr. Pataki's success was no fluke; that Latinos are increasingly open to appeals by Republicans even though they still favor Democrats most of the time. 
Political analysts can offer only rough estimates of what the vote was this year, because detailed surveys of voters leaving polls are not available. But analysis of results in election districts that are heavily Hispanic indicate that Mr. Pataki won a third or more of the Latino vote, a personal best for the three-term governor and evidence that the Republicans succeeded in driving a wedge in the black-Latino coalition that has come together in the past to support Democratic candidates.
One analyst, John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, calculated that Mr. Pataki's Democratic opponent, H. Carl McCall, got more than 90 percent of the overall black vote, but only 56 percent of Latino voters supported him. Mr. McCall was the first black candidate from a major party to run for governor in New York.
While some Democrats acknowledged the Republican gains in a state where three-quarters of Hispanic voters are registered as Democrats, many more insisted any inroads went only as deep as the candidate. Even when Latinos voted for Mr. Pataki, these Democrats said, they went for the Democratic party line for the rest of the ticket.
"Did the people leave the party? Absolutely no," said Representative Jose E. Serrano, who said that his largely Hispanic district in the South Bronx gave Mr. Pataki about 30 percent of the vote, while majorities of up to 90 percent and more went to Mr. Serrano and other Democratic candidates on the ballot. 
Surveys confirm that most Latino voters are sticking with the Democratic Party despite their marked willingness to cross party lines for individual candidates. A survey of 400 Latino voters in New York last month by the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute in California found that while a plurality favored Mr. Pataki over Mr. McCall, they still considered the Democrats best suited to solve the nation's problems.
Rodolfo de la Garza, a vice president of the institute and a political science professor at Columbia University, noted that moderate Republicans who have carved out sizable Latino support in New York elections, like Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg and now Mr. Pataki, have had no coattails. 
Outside New York, he said, in states like Texas, Arizona and Nevada, many Republican candidates campaign on issues that reinforce the anti-immigrant impression many have of the Republican Party, repelling Latino voters. "We see no evidence of this Republican appeal, even in New York," he said.
Carmen Leyton, 48, a Democrat who is Dominican and lives in Washington Heights, is among the voters who validate the research. Mr. Pataki was the first Republican she ever voted for, she said. She appreciated his stance in favor of legalizing the status of some undocumented immigrants in New York and his support for the families who lost relatives last year in the crash of American Airlines Flight 587, bound for Santo Domingo. 
But every other candidate she chose last Tuesday was a Democrat and she has no plans to switch parties. "I'm 100 percent Democrat," she said. "The Republicans go where the money is."
Still, Washington Heights, which is heavily Dominican, just inaugurated its first Republican club a few days ago and counts on leaders like Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, who is a Pataki supporter. Mr. Mateo said younger Hispanics find the Republican Party appealing because they are not looking for programs or handouts, just access to economic and political opportunity.
"The Democrats want to keep you poor so they always have a poor base," he said.
Michael McKeon, spokesman for the Pataki campaign, said New York's Republicans plan to keep working at chipping away at the Democratic base.
"New immigrants come here to build business and build a better life for their families," he said. "The governor absolutely believes that the Republican Party offers the Latino community a much better home than the Democratic Party."
An increasingly diverse Hispanic population has indeed created openings for Republican candidates, particularly those who like many Latino voters take both liberal and conservative positions and do not fit tightly into an ideological category. 
Mr. Mollenkopf said Mr. Pataki seemed to do better in electoral districts with a large South American population than in those where Puerto Ricans and Dominicans predominate. In one district covering Elmhurst, Queens, where many Colombians, Ecuadorians and Peruvians live, for instance, Mr. Pataki got 61 percent of the vote, compared with 38 percent in sections of Washington Heights and 28 percent in Puerto Rican sections of the Bronx, he said.
Some Democrats said the results in the governor's race did not bode well for the party, if only because the more often people cross party lines, the more comfortable they get.
"Latinos already did it with Giuliani and Bloomberg and now with Pataki," said Luis Miranda, a strategist who worked on the McCall campaign. "You have to worry."
Democratic leaders like the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr. and Representative Gregory W. Meeks of Queens said the time had come for their party to address the vote drain and get back to basics.
"We end up with these philosophical debates about abortion or gay marriages, and the issues get attached to the Democrats and we can't get our message out about working families," Mr. Carrion said. "The message should be, 'I'm going to fight for you, and you should be able to have what everybody else has.' "

HEADLINE: McDonald's Cuts Forecast And Will Close 175 Outlets 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings would fall short of earlier forecasts and announced plans to close 175 underperforming restaurants in 10 countries and to completely shut its operations in three other countries.
 McDonald's officials did not issue a revised estimate for the fourth quarter but said the closing and restructuring efforts would reduce pretax income by $350 million to $425 million. The company also said it would cut 400 to 600 jobs worldwide, with 250 job reductions in the United States. The company did not identify the countries that will be affected by its plans. 
 The announcement is the latest piece of bad news from McDonald's, which has reported declining earnings for seven of its last eight quarters. For the last three years, the company has been struggling to compete against its traditional fast-food rivals while facing new competition from healthy-food chains like Subway and the new fast-casual dining category, which includes companies like Boston Market. 
"They're losing market share across the board," said Mitchell J. Speiser, a senior restaurant analyst with Lehman Brothers. "As the competition has focused more on particular demographics, McDonald's is trying to be everything to everybody and in the process is losing their point of differentiation, even with children."
Jack M. Greenberg, McDonald's chairman and chief executive, said the actions were the right thing to do to secure the health of the company's business.
"We remain focused on growing our existing restaurants' sales, and we're committed to making the changes necessary to succeed in the challenging worldwide economic and competitive environments in which we operate," Mr. Greenberg said.
McDonald's strategy has been to compensate with growth, opening new restaurants at a pace of nearly 1,000 a year. In October, the company introduced a $1 value menu that includes some of its premium sandwiches, like the Big 'N Tasty, in an effort to win back lunchtime customers from its rivals. The deep-discounting program has fallen short of expectations, according to analysts. It drew more customers into stores, but failed to generate a significant sales increase because the prices were so low that sales of the more expensive items suffered, leaving the company in the position of eating its own lunch. 
The dollar menu also touched off a price war with Burger King and Wendy's that has already shown signs of damaging both those businesses. On Thursday, Diageo, the owner of Burger King, said the price war had slowed its sales and discouraged Burger King's potential buyer, an investment group led by the Texas Pacific Group, to balk at a previously agreed-upon $2.26 billion sale price. Wendy's also said on Thursday that it would not meet its earnings forecast for 2002.
Investors sent McDonald's shares down $1.52, or 8 percent, to $17.79.
McDonald's franchisees were more concerned yesterday with the company's business strategy than its declining profit forecast, said Dick Adams, a consultant to 500 McDonald's franchisees in America. Mr. Adams said profitability was his clients' chief concern and that promotions like the $1 Value Meal were hurting their bottom lines.
"That's another effort to force growth when it's not really there," Mr. Adams said. "As the industry becomes more saturated and more competitive, the constant struggle to build top-line sales becomes more difficult for the franchisee." 
Though ailing, McDonald's is still the leader in the domestic hamburger market with a 43.1 percent share, garnering more than $20 billion in sales, according to Technomic, a restaurant consulting firm. Burger King posted $8.59 billion in sales in 2001, with 18.5 percent of the market, while Wendy's had $6.15 billion in sales, with a 13.2 percent share.

Re "Corporations Revise Wish Lists" (Business Day, Nov. 7): 
 The gates are down and corporate America shamelessly announces its new entitlement claims, confident that voters won't protest and don't know that its taxes are among the lowest in industrialized countries. 
 With its demands for more tax cuts, Alaska drilling and weak programs for investor security, the environment, H.M.O.'s, prescription drug coverage, and I.R.S. collections, it will, we can be certain, quickly condemn anyone who questions these actions as practicing class warfare.
All gall has many parts.

HEADLINE: AMHERST-WILLIAMS: The Biggest Little Game in America; 
Where Winning Breeds Criticism

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Nov. 8 

 BODY:
At Williams College, the fall sports teams are fabulous again. And that is the problem, at least to some on campus.
 The football team has not lost in two years, the women's cross-country team is favored to win the small-college national championship, three other teams are nationally ranked and no team will have a losing record. 
 It would be one thing if this were a one-year bonanza. But for more than a decade at Williams, one of America's most selective liberal arts colleges, the sports teams have been far superior to those at any other college its size (enrollment is roughly 2,000). All this winning has made some faculty members and students uneasy and has stirred a debate more common at the nation's largest universities. 
At Williams, and similar colleges in the region, the question is: Can an institution prized for its academics harmoniously house a powerhouse athletic program, even as it is defined by Division III, in which recruiting and athletic scholarships are prohibited and in which the football coach can double as the assistant track coach?
"We must assert the primacy of academics; we're not here to produce professional athletes," said Stephen C. Sheppard, a Williams economics professor who helped write an in-house report last spring that outlined an overemphasis on athletics. "We're getting uncomfortably close to the Division I model. A great athletic experience does not mean your football team must be undefeated. We always hear about the life lessons sports teaches, so wouldn't the odd loss here and there be therapeutic?"
What would George Steinbrenner, Williams class of '52, think of that?
As Williams takes its 7-0 football record against rival Amherst College on Saturday in what is called the biggest little game in America, each college has spent the last year in a hand-wringing tug of war over how to balance the pursuit of athletic excellence without impinging on lofty academic missions. This year's freshman classes at Williams and Amherst, for example, were the first shaped under new guidelines established to constrict the number of students admitted because they were top athletes.
These students are referred to as coaches' "tips" because they were designated on a list devised by coaches and submitted to the college admissions department during the application process. These students, Williams officials say, have average SAT scores of 1300 to 1350 and are ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school class. The average SAT score for the latest freshman class at Williams, including athletes, was 1408, and those students typically had a class rank in the top 5 percent.
The disparity may not seem great, but because 80 percent of applicants to Williams are rejected, every slot in an incoming freshman class of 525 is scrutinized and highly valued. With 66 tipped athletes gaining admission and another 20 applicants admitted who are termed athletic "protects" -- those whose grades and scores meet the usual academic standards and who were also singled out by coaches -- the number of athletes admitted has led to a campus controversy. Until the recent release of the in-house report, many Williams faculty members had no idea that athletics played some role in the admission of roughly 16 percent of the student body.
"When the faculty heard those numbers, there was more than surprise; it was perhaps outrage," said Lee Y. Park, chairwoman of the chemistry department. "There is a significant portion of the faculty that thinks we've gone too far in our pursuit of athletic success."
Not surprisingly, members of the athletic community have been bewildered that their success has become a source of contention. With 31 varsity teams, nearly 40 percent of the Williams student body plays an intercollegiate sport. Last year, Williams won 84 percent of its games and earned, for the sixth time in seven years, the Sears Directors' Cup, awarded to the nation's top Division III athletic program.
"We should be feeling a lot better than we're being allowed to feel," the Williams athletic director, Harry Sheehy, said. "Although it is a luxury to have these conversations with the faculty. People at other schools wish they had our so-called problem."
Still, Williams athletes have sensed a backlash in some quarters. Some say they have been careful not to wear a Williams sports team jacket in the classes of certain professors, who by their public comments are perceived as anti-athlete.
"Almost all of the faculty has been supportive," said Garrett DiCarlo, a senior tackle on the football team who is majoring in mathematics and economics. "But I have been treated differently in a negative way by a few teachers because I was an athlete. And on our teams, we will talk about that amongst ourselves: 'Look, you might want to take off that Williams football sweatshirt before you go to his class.' "
Joyia Chadwick turned down volleyball scholarships at Division I colleges to come to Williams. "It's funny that anyone could call this a jock school," Chadwick, a sophomore, said. "Everyone comes here first for the academics. We want a very challenging, competitive academic environment, but a lot of us also want to have a challenging, competitive athletic experience. So we have the best of both. What's wrong with that?"
Few at Williams would disagree, but some faculty members and students would add that it is a matter of balance. They have cautioned that unbridled athletic success can come at the expense of academic excellence.
"There is no question the vast majority of athletes I've encountered are committed to their academics," Park said. "But I have had a few students in my classes who were athletes and I wondered why they were here. Academics were secondary to them. We have to do something about that, and we're not the only schools looking into the role of athletics in the same way."
Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., joined Williams and Amherst this year in reducing the number of tipped athletes admitted to 66. Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me., reduced its number from 99 to 79. The four schools are part of the 11-member New England Small College Athletic Conference.
"I didn't disagree with the reductions because we've always had periodic reviews of this kind of thing," said Jeffrey Ward, Bowdoin's athletic director. "I also don't think anything was out of whack. We just reaffirmed our values. But smart kids want good athletics, too. We're probably as successful athletically as we've ever been, and I don't expect that to change."
Amherst's athletic director, Peter Gooding, said he thought the reductions in tipped athletes fostered greater harmony between the faculty and the athletic department.
"Many of our faculty had no concerns at all, but for those that did, they appreciated that something was done to control the arms race," he said. "I'm not sure there was good reason for concern, but there was a perception that something was amiss. That changed the atmosphere."
A key factor in the discussions at each of the colleges was the 2001 publication of "The Game of Life: College Sports and Education Values," by James Shulman and William Bowen, a former Princeton president. The book was harshly critical of the effect athletics has on academics and focused on how small elite colleges, like those in New England, are not immune.
The book advanced the phrase "culture of athletics," and it was meant to describe how athletes take over the social fabric of some colleges and hurt the classroom dynamic in others. Some of that was borne out when Williams surveyed its students recently.
Morton Owen Schapiro, Williams's president, calls Bowen a mentor and has recently overhauled some housing and classroom policies to moderate some of the effects delineated in "The Game of Life" and in Williams's own study of athletics. He also said that the admissions department would continue to be more stringent about the academic qualifications of all athletes admitted.
But Schapiro insisted that Williams would not diminish as a Division III athletic power or lessen its commitment to wildly successful sports teams. He said he thought that athletes had been unfairly blamed in the past year.
"It's too easy these days to blame athletes for everything," said Schapiro, whose office shelves contain not just books but also a football. "It would be ridiculous not to court athletes, but it should be done in proportion to how we court other things. We let kids into this school for all kinds of reasons. We're not just good at athletics, we're good in art, theater, at the symphony.
"The vast majority of our athletes do very well academically. We're making some adjustments. Soon, it's going to be all athletes doing very well academically."
Meanwhile, in his office near the Williams athletic complex, the football coach, Dick Farley, whose record in 16 seasons is 108-16-3, has been focusing on keeping his team's winning streak alive against the only opponent that matters to most alumni.
"I've never told the admissions department who to admit and they've never told me what play to run during a game," Farley said. "We respectfully disagree, and sure, there is a tug of war going on right now. But say what you want, when that game starts Saturday, I know what they will want. They'll want us to win."

TEAMSTERS' EFFORT FAILS NARROWLY AT AMERICA WEST

BYLINE:  Reuters

 BODY:
 An effort by the Teamsters union to organize thousands of airport customer service, reservation and tour sales agents at America West Airlines failed narrowly yesterday, the labor group and the airline said. 
Organizers fell 240 votes short of gaining majority support from more than 3,600 workers who were eligible to vote. Balloting was conducted by telephone in recent weeks and tabulated by the National Mediation Board in Washington. It was one of the largest organizing votes by the Teamsters this year. The airline workers, the largest employee group at America West, are the only ones at the carrier not in a union. America West is based in Tempe, Ariz.

Commerzbank R eflects Germanys Many Banking Ills

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Klaus-Peter Muller has what may be the worst job in German banking.
 Commerzbank, where Mr. Muller has spent most of his career and is now the chairman, has virtually every symptom of the multiple ills that afflict Germany's banking system. The malaise runs so deep that when an unknown 24-year-old credit analyst at Merrill Lynch mused in a leaked e-mail message that Commerzbank faced a cash shortage, it was enough to set off a panic that the bank, Germany's fourth largest, might collapse. 
 Yet Mr. Muller, a blunt, bantam-size Dusseldorfer who spent the formative part of his career in New York, is not moping. 
"I'm having fun, I swear to you," he said in an interview in his 48th-floor office at the bank's mist-shrouded headquarters here. "If you ever get on a rocky ship, you should have someone like me on board."
Next week, Commerzbank will report third-quarter results, which most analysts expect will show a loss. It is also expected to disclose plans to lay off as many as 1,500 employees, including one of every four people in its investment banking division, in an effort to slice $495 million out of its $5.4 billion in annual costs.
This is the latest round in a grueling cost-cutting regime that is transforming a sprawling global institution into a smaller, more domestically focused bank. But while Mr. Muller said the harsh medicine would put Commerzbank back in the black, its long-term prospects remain gray.
Germany, the economic sick man of Europe, has many more banks and local branches than it needs. It has not updated its banking laws since World War II and its lenders with global ambitions are hemmed in by fierce local competitors. As a result, banking here has become a hand-to-mouth business.
"We're one of the few countries in the world which still has a banking system of this kind," Mr. Muller said. "It's outdated, it is old-fashioned and it does not offer a level playing field."
The biggest trouble is that German retail banking is dominated by savings institutions and cooperatives owned by cities and states, which are run on a less commercial basis than their publicly traded rivals. This creates a fragmented industry, in which even the biggest banks are minnows.
Commerzbank, with 750 branches, has barely 2 percent of the total branches in Germany. Together, the five largest banks account for only about 10 percent of Germany's 54,000 banking establishments.
Opportunities to expand are cramped because so much of the industry is in public hands. As a result, Commerzbank has not been able to match the growth of European rivals like Barclays, which has 12 percent of all branches in Britain, or BNP Paribas, which has 9 percent of the French market.
"We do not need thousands of co-op banks; we do not need hundreds of savings banks," Mr. Muller said. "What I would like to see is what has happened in every other country -- a chance to consolidate."
None of these impediments mattered much when times were flush. With a buoyant German economy and Frankfurt's designation as the home of the European Central Bank, the big banks were thinking globally. Like its crosstown rivals, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank expanded aggressively outside its home market, and into activities beyond commercial banking.
It bought Jupiter, a leading British asset management firm, as well as the asset management arm of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. It spent millions to build an investment banking operation from scratch, with high-priced bankers in New York, London, and Tokyo.
Commerzbank hired Norman Foster, the celebrated British architect, to design a dramatic 50-story headquarters building in Frankfurt. It is Europe's tallest skyscraper and features garden terraces planted with exotic trees.
"They had a good life for many, many years," said Fred B. Irwin, a vice president at Citibank in Frankfurt. "But Germany is overbanked, and when revenues dropped, their high cost base was exposed."
Mr. Muller, 58, took control of Commerzbank in mid-2001, just as the dimensions of the downturn were becoming clear. Net profit plunged to 74 million euros ($74.7 million) in the first half of 2002, from 302 million euros ($304.9 million) in 2001. The investment banking business dried up, after four years of profits.
Worse, German and foreign companies began to fail, leaving Commerzbank with millions in uncollected loans. It set aside $200 million in provisions for loans to Leo Kirch, the fallen Munich media tycoon, and more than $100 million for Warnaco, the bankrupt American apparel maker once run by Linda J. Wachner.
All told, Commerzbank expects to declare 1.3 billion euros in loan-loss provisions in 2002 -- a forecast it increased twice.
Mr. Muller said his staff deserved credit for avoiding some corporate black holes, like WorldCom, to which it had once lent $800 million but no longer has any outstanding loans. Still, with 42,000 corporate insolvencies in Germany -- and bankruptcies still being filed every day -- the prospects for relief are dim.
"Even if you have good risk management, a weak economy does not give you great business opportunities," he said.
Faced with falling revenue and rising bad loans, Mr. Muller had little choice but to attack Commerzbank's costs. He announced 4,300 layoffs and closed more than 200 branches. On Tuesday, people close to the bank's planning said, he will announce 300 layoffs in the investment banking unit, which will be folded into Commerzbank's corporate banking division, as well as more than 1,000 job cuts throughout the rest of the bank.
Mr. Muller said he would not abandon the bank's foray into investment banking. But he will consider selling any business that does not yield an adequate return. He is currently trying to sell Montgomery, and only recently withdrew Jupiter from the market because of the poor climate.
Despite his genial manner, Mr. Muller has been remorseless with those inside the company who do not measure up to his standards. Describing the recent departure of one executive, he said, "I fired my colleague who was in charge of asset management, and I didn't do it because he was too successful."
Such plain talk is remarkable in a German banker. It may reflect his years in New York, where he worked in the bank's branch from 1968 to 1973 and again from 1982 to 1986. Mr. Muller's daughter was born in Manhattan, and he still has deep ties there. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, he arranged for 300 relatives of the victims to fly to Germany, where the bank was host to them at a resort in the Bavarian Alps.
Mr. Muller's manner has won him the respect of analysts, even as they downgrade his company's stock.
"He's seen as a lot more sensible than his predecessor, more honest with the market," said David Williams, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. "But the material he's got to work with is not so good."
Before the downturn, Commerzbank topped most lists of merger or acquisition candidates in Germany. Given its raft of problems, it is no longer an obvious target for even a healthier rival, like Deutsche Bank.
"This is not a very expensive company; it would be a short lunch for Deutsche Bank," said Mark Hoge, an analyst at Bank of America Securities in London. "But Commerzbank doesn't have any profitable businesses. There's no anchor for a new owner to fall back on."
Indeed, Commerzbank's very survival has been called into question. Last month, in an e-mail message that was leaked to The Financial Times, a credit analyst at Merrill Lynch in London speculated that the bank had suffered big trading losses from the sharp decline in world stock markets.
Commerzbank denied that it was in crisis, and Merrill Lynch apologized, saying the message was a private communication that had been blown out of proportion. But Mr. Muller has spent much of the last month reassuring customers and shareholders about the creditworthiness of his bank.
Commerzbank has tried to put the affair behind it by thanking its customers for their forbearance in an advertisement this week in German newspapers. Under a photo of a black rubber duck floating in sudsy water, a headline says, "The most dangerous animal in the shark tank is a duck."
Relishing the ad's sly humor, Mr. Muller explained that in German as in French, the word "duck" means an untruth.
He said Commerzbank had about $30 billion in excess liquidity at the time that the bank was rumored to be in a cash squeeze. Reports that the credit derivatives operation had suffered huge losses were also wrong, he said.
Still, the damage had been done. Commerzbank's shares tumbled to 18-year lows, and Standard & Poor's downgraded the bank's debt rating to A- from A, with a negative outlook.
Mr. Muller was stung by the episode, and he complained that the news media and S.&. P. had not given Commerzbank an adequate hearing. But he is not one to shift blame or gild the lily.
Asked whether selling the bank might be the simplest way out of its troubles, Mr. Muller said: "I think we better do something to get a better deal for our shareholders. Let us do those jobs first."

HEADLINE: Global Trade Looking Glass: Can U.S. Have It Both Ways? 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Policies adopted by the Bush administration to advance specific domestic and international goals are undermining the White House's own efforts to open markets through trade's global rule-making body, some foreign officials say.
 In particular, new farm subsidies and other barriers to the American market have led some of America's trading partners to doubt Washington's commitment to free trade, in spite of its ambitious proposals to reduce distortions in world markets. Those doubts, combined with the United States' pursuit of trade agreements outside the World Trade Organization, have also diminished the pre-eminence of the W.T.O., the critics say. That change may impede a crucial round of global trade negotiations begun substantially through American diplomacy last November in Doha, Qatar. 
 "The United States was very supportive of some of the positions that those of us from the developing countries took at Doha," Kofi K. Apraku, Ghana's minister of trade and industry, said in a telephone interview. "What happened at Doha gave us hope that we could work together." 
But the mood has changed in the last year, he added. "There is a lot of concern and a lot of worry in our country about the United States' commitment to carry forward the momentum that was created in Doha," Dr. Apraku said.
In response, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said that all negotiators have to balance domestic concerns with those of their trading partners. "Many countries had to stretch politically and then had to deal with sensitivities back home," he said in an interview earlier this week, "so a pause for repositioning is understandable." Mr. Zoellick added that he was optimistic that the talks would succeed on schedule. "We're not refusing to discuss anything," he said. "I believe we can get the Doha negotiation done by 2005, if key developed and developing countries make the effort."
Chief among Ghana's concerns is the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, generally referred to as the farm bill. The law will protect American farmers from slumps in the business cycle, but critics say it may also encourage farmers to overproduce. That would depress world prices for crops. Ghana does not export all the same crops as the United States, but Dr. Apraku said the bill set a bad precedent.
"It is a major concern for us in Ghana," Dr. Apraku said. "We are a developing country. Agriculture is very important to us." Farming accounts for 36 percent of Ghana's economy and 60 percent of its jobs.
Ghana is not alone. "It is clear that the United States farm bill is not very popular in Canada, either," said Pierre S. Pettigrew, Canada's minister for international trade. "It certainly requires more explanation on the part of the United States."
Experts estimate the farm bill, signed by President Bush last spring, could increase federal spending on agriculture by 70 percent over the next six years, to as much as $180 billion, potentially violating limits for farm support set during the last round of global trade talks, but Mr. Zoellick's office disputed that.
Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the W.T.O., said the increase in subsidies under the farm bill had hampered the new round of global trade talks. "It has created some questions, some doubts in the mind of some countries," he said, "and has sometimes been used to delay some of the proposals."
Dr. Supachai also noted that the talks were behind schedule. Negotiators missed a deadline for submitting a report on trade preferences for poor countries to the W.T.O.'s general council. "When the members missed the July deadline," he said, "the prevailing view of the developing countries was a bit of disappointment -- that they were let down."
Mr. Zoellick said that the deadline had come too soon, since the overall shape of the negotiations -- whether they would apply to tariffs, subsidies, quotas or other items -- was still unclear.
He also said critics were overstating concerns about the farm bill. "The farm bill does nothing in terms of tariffs or market access," he said. "It doesn't change our policy on export subsidies." Additional annual appropriations to subsidize farmers, he asserted, could make the situation problematic.
In addition to complaints about specific policies, some critics have also objected to Mr. Zoellick's simultaneous pursuit of trade pacts with individual countries, with regional bodies like the Free Trade Area of the Americas and with the W.T.O. While that approach ensures against any one set of talks collapsing, diplomats say it also puts some negotiating partners at a disadvantage. Small countries in particular often lack the expertise to engage in three sets of talks, and the comprehensive negotiations at the W.T.O. could be shortchanged.
"The fact that our trade negotiators are so busy with the W.T.O., with the F.T.A.A. and with the bilaterals, causes a problem for all of us, not only for smaller countries," Mr. Pettigrew of Canada said.
The Workers' Party of Brazil, which will soon govern that country's economy, the biggest in South America, plans to make the Free Trade Area of the Americas -- not the W.T.O. -- a top priority. "The schedule is more urgent on that," said Giancarlo Summa, a party spokesman, "and of course there will be much more diplomatic pressure."
The Free Trade Area of the Americas would lower and eliminate tariffs on goods traded among 34 countries on the two continents, and could shape the rules for trade in services and foreign investment.
For Chile, by contrast, a long-awaited bilateral agreement with the United States is "in the front of the road," said Osvaldo Rosales, the country's top trade negotiator.
Though Mr. Rosales asserted that bilateral and regional trade agreements would serve as an important test for American leadership in the W.T.O., he also said that the existence of such pacts could make the negotiations at the W.T.O. more difficult.
Dr. Apraku was even blunter. "These negotiations will reduce the scope of the W.T.O.'s influence," he said. 
Though a proliferation of trade deals could enhance African countries' negotiating skills and influence, it could also deflect attention from the overall effort to improve the living standards of the poorest countries by bringing them more fully into the global trading system.
Mr. Zoellick affirmed the United States' commitment to seeing negotiations through at all levels. He said he intended to complete free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore by the end of this year, and the pan-American and W.T.O. negotiations by the end of President Bush's current term.
Yet worries about populist governments in Argentina and Brazil seem to have made neighboring nations more eager to sign bilateral deals. Panama, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and other countries have approached the United States, Mr. Zoellick said.
"They don't want to be left out," he said.
That suits Mr. Zoellick. "We will work with Brazil because its participation is important," he said, "but if it doesn't work, we've got to have alternatives."
Developing countries have also taken issue with Mr. Zoellick's opinion of the United States' importance to the global trading system.
"Doha wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the United States," he said. "The United States has an added responsibility for the trading and international economic system as a whole," he added later.
Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister of international trade and industry, said that view might be overblown. She predicted that Mr. Zoellick would be "tearing his hair out" if he tried to strong-arm smaller members of the W.T.O. "No one can force anyone to do anything there, least of all the United States," she said. 
Sherman E. Katz, a scholar of trade policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy center here that Mr. Zoellick used to head, said that the United States still provided much of the intellectual energy behind talks on complex issues like intellectual property and trade in services. He concurred, though, with Ms. Aziz's central point.
"We can't throw our economic clout around on the W.T.O. table as much as we used to," he said.
Poorer members of the W.T.O. do not face an easy task. At least 50 issues related to carrying out the last global trade pact -- a primary concern of developing nations -- are on the table to be discussed before the end of this year.
"We are mobilizing ourselves so that we can have some leverage, make some difference, in these meetings," Dr. Apraku said. "We do not want to be marginalized."

HEADLINE: We're Not in Florida Anymore 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The most shocking thing about American politics is how "shocked" we are every time the obvious happens.
 You'd think it would be a no-brainer to call an election in which a popular, barnstorming president is pitted against a leaderless political party whose only coherent message is that the other guys aim to toss the elderly into the street. But almost everyone got it wrong, including the network stars who giddily imagined that deadlock 2000 would repeat itself and Louisiana would become the new Florida, thus allowing them to ruin our Thanksgivings by bloviating from New Orleans for a solid month. History has a way of moving on, even as pundits and politicians alike keep fighting the last war. 
 The Democrats are farcically -- or, if you choose, tragically -- even more mired in the past than the press is. Terry McAuliffe has been fond of saying that defeating Jeb Bush was his top priority this year. The notion that avenging 2000 could be more important than, say, holding onto the Senate into 2004 is so nonsensical that only a party chairman cryogenically entombed in the Clinton-Gore fin de siecle could say it with a straight face. 
This obsession with a lost battle was doomed in any case, and Tuesday brought final proof of "the complete failure of the 'Florida anger' strategy as a motivating force for Democrats," in the words of Byron York of National Review. Not only did Jeb Bush win easily but Democratic turnout in the party's south Florida stronghold was down 17 percent from the 1994 Bush-Lawton Chiles race, despite campaign appearances for Bill McBride by Al Gore, 2000 anger incarnate. The fault this time was not in the chads.
"I'm not sure what we did wrong," Mr. McAuliffe declared on Wednesday, no less clueless in defeat than in anticipating victory. Denial, the first of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages of death and dying, is his party's order of the day. (No. 2, anger, is rapidly yapping at its heels.) Tom Daschle's position is that President Bush drowned out the Democrats by talking about Iraq and North Korea. "We felt we did have the economic plan," he told Paula Zahn on CNN. "We just weren't successful in getting you to cover it."
Nearly every Democratic leader is offering a variation on Dick Gephardt's excuse -- that 9/11 shrouded the election, to the White House's advantage. But if conservatives are rarely more irritating than when they wrap themselves in the flag, liberals are surely at their most annoying when donning the veil of victimhood. The Democrats were not done in by Osama bin Laden or the media or anyone other than themselves. Their intellectual vacuity in this year's campaign was apparent well before 9/11.
It was in May 2001 that the House Democrats issued a cautious energy plan whose cover depicted an all-American family happily washing its S.U.V. It promised that the party would never advocate environmental policies that might jostle "our standard of living." It was in August 2001, as both the economy and George W. Bush's poll numbers were tanking, that Mr. McAuliffe was asked to explain his party's economic plan. "What are the Democrats going to do?" asked Gloria Borger of CBS. "Do you want to repeal this tax cut? Do you want to repeal parts of this tax cut? What?" 
Mr. McAuliffe replied: "I want George Bush . . . when he comes back from vacation, to pull everybody together and put a plan together." A year after 9/11, this non-policy still survived as a major plank in the Democrats' campaign arsenal, with Messrs. Daschle and Gephardt this fall calling for the president to hold a new economic summit.
As the reigning cliche had it, 2002 was the "Seinfeld" election -- an election about nothing. But how could an election in the midst of one war and on the eve of another be about nothing? How could an election at a time of economic torpor be about nothing? Even Jeb Bush, in an arguably Freudian episode of one-upmanship after his victory, said flatly on TV that while Florida was doing well, "the national economy is weak." This election was not about nothing; it's the Democrats who were about nothing. That is hardly the ideal stance from which to fight someone like George W. Bush.
The Bush administration has big ideas. It believes that toppling Saddam Hussein is the slam-dunk gambit that will remake the Arab world to our liking (and Israel's). It has codified a security strategy built on the notion of pre-emptive war. It believes in the partial privatization of Social Security, in rewarding the very wealthiest with a repeal of the estate tax, and in tailoring every conceivable policy, including those governing human, fiscal and environmental health, to the needs of its corporate sponsors. Many Democratic politicians are opposed to these ideas -- or at least to those not supported by Mr. McAuliffe's high-rollers -- but that's not the same as having big ideas of their own.
Foreign policy is a nonstarter with Democrats. At home, we know that they are in favor of "protecting" Social Security and that some of them dream of energy independence, or of universal health insurance in a nation where 41 million people have none at all. But they put forward no serious plans to accomplish such goals, let alone plans specifying a price tag and the means by which to pay the bills. All politics may be local, but the local mimics the national: Bill McBride's star fell when, in a debate with Jeb Bush, he called for mandating smaller public-school class sizes but punted when asked where he might find the billions required to do so.
This lack of seriousness is sometimes matched by a soullessness that all the eulogizing of Paul Wellstone could not obscure. Fear of the N.R.A. led poor Jean Carnahan to invite reporters to watch her shoot skeet. Defending Bob Torricelli, Mr. McAuliffe enthusiastically observed that the controversy over his sleazy gift-grubbing was "creating excitement out there and helping raise more money." 
Two Democratic Senate campaigns a continent apart were marked by gay-baiting. In one of them, Alex Sanders of South Carolina apparently seized on a column I wrote about Rudolph Giuliani in August 2001 to mock the then-mayor's decision to bunk with "two gay men and a Shih Tzu" after he moved out of Gracie Mansion. "Is that South Carolina values?" he pandered in a debate, heedlessly trashing his and his party's record on civil rights.
Mr. Torricelli, Ms. Carnahan and Mr. Sanders are now history. With Mr. Gephardt leaving his leadership position, many Democratic politicians are calling for Mr. McAuliffe's head. Everyone wants "new faces" -- not an easy task for a party whose 11th-hour new faces in this campaign were Frank Lautenberg and Walter Mondale and whose favorite form of ingenue, "new" Kennedys (Andrew Cuomo and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend), went belly-up in the friendly confines of New York and Maryland. The bench is so sparse that Gary Hart's name was tossed around this week. Next up, no doubt: Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter and Mike Dukakis.
Of course there are Democrats who are far less shopworn, but changing the messengers cannot compensate for a lack of message. The Clinton political creed of triangulation, effective in the Gingrich era, no longer works when a triangulating "compassionate conservative" has the White House and can co-opt such Democratic staples as education and prescription drugs. A unified vision composed of actual policies and principles, as opposed to knee-jerk liberal sloganeering, cynical political strategies and anti-Bush whining, is now required. 
Yet Clintonism without Clinton (or even up-to-date takes on Mr. Clinton's best ideas) remains the party's fantasy. This is exemplified not only by a huckster like Mr. McAuliffe but by the relentless search for a telegenic savior, ideally from neither coast, who might magically finesse the difference between the party's liberal base and the American middle (at least until Hillary is ready to run). 
That's the role John Edwards is meant to play, but his timidity to date makes even Al Gore sound like Harry Truman. As for Mr. Gore, he turned up in full sanctimonious lather the day after defeat to instruct Democrats, via Barbara Walters, that they "need to draw clear lines" about their policy differences with Republicans -- a task he utterly failed to accomplish in his own October speech assailing the administration's economic record.
The only truly shocking thing about Tuesday's election is that the Democrats didn't do far worse, or as badly as they deserved. Mr. Bush's high approval ratings notwithstanding, the election numbers reveal a vast opposition to where he is taking this country. But those numbers will not add up until there is an opposition party worthy of the name.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE DEMOCRATS; 
Pelosi Says She's Secured Votes To Be House Democrats' Leader

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Representative Nancy Pelosi said today that she had secured the votes necessary to be elected the new House Democratic leader, putting her in position to become the first woman to head a party in Congress.
 Her chief rival, Martin Frost of Texas, cleared the way when he dropped out of the race early today and endorsed Ms. Pelosi, a liberal from California, after earlier warning that her election could move the party too far to the left. 
 At a news conference at her district headquarters in San Francisco, Ms. Pelosi, 62, said she had at least 105 public commitments from Democratic House members, with more coming in after Mr. Frost's departure from the race. Her office later released a list with 111 names of House Democrats that covered a range of states and ideologies within the party. Both numbers exceed half of the caucus of 208. 
"This race is over," she said of the competition that will formally be decided in a secret ballot next Thursday.
Still, a late entry into the race, Harold E. Ford Jr., a 32-year-old moderate from Tennessee, said he would continue to seek the position. He said he offered a new vision of leadership but would not quantify his support. Many Democrats said he did not have a chance.
Mr. Frost's withdrawal and the apparent coalescing around Ms. Pelosi showed that Democrats were moving quickly to replace the current minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who said he would leave the post after his party failed for the fourth time during his tenure to regain control of the House. 
The apparent selection of Ms. Pelosi, who now holds the No. 2 post, minority whip, produced contrasting views on whether her taking over as leader of the House Democrats would enhance or harm the party's chances in future elections. 
Some Democratic operatives said her unambiguous stances on a number of hot-button issues would provide voters with a clear alternative to the White House at a time when some Democrats were grousing that the party was not doing enough to distinguish itself from the Republicans. In contrast, some Republican strategists said Ms. Pelosi's liberal stances were too far out of step with the country and would alienate many voters. Page A16. 
The election would elevate Ms. Pelosi to a leadership role alongside Senator Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, who said today he would again run for Senate Democratic leader.
Ms. Pelosi, who voted against granting the president authority to take unilateral action against Iraq and has a solidly liberal record on social issues like abortion rights, gay rights, expanded health care and economic programs, wasted no time in challenging Republicans.
"There is no question that the Democratic Party is the party of the public interest," said Ms. Pelosi, who said she intended to make the economy and education among the party's priorities. "A big difference with the Republicans is they are the party of special interest; we have to make that clear to the American people."
She also dismissed the perception that she would allow the party to be tagged as left-leaning. "I don't think they chose me as an outspoken liberal," she said of her colleagues. "I think they chose me as a person who can lead the caucus to victory, as a person who can build coalitions among the various sectors of our caucus."
But Republicans said they were pleased with the selection, saying Ms. Pelosi would provide a stark contrast to President Bush. "She is very liberal," said one top Republican staff member. "She opposed the president on tax cuts, on homeland security, Iraq, welfare reform."
But her supporters said they believed the liberal label would not stick, noting her tenure on the Intelligence Committee, which is enmeshed in security matters. "She is a refreshing woman who has championed progressive causes, yet at the same time she has served with distinction on the Intelligence Committee," said Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, calling the liberal tag a "mischaracterization."
It was expected that Mr. Frost and Ms. Pelosi would engage in a pitched battle to take over from Mr. Gephardt, but the fight was brief as Mr. Frost realized he could not catch Ms. Pelosi. "Martin knows how to count," said one ally, who said Mr. Frost did obtain a substantial number of commitments.
In a letter to Democrats releasing them from their pledges to him, Mr. Frost called Ms. Pelosi "a talented and capable party leader." But, in a reference to his worries about the philosophical tilt of the party, Mr. Frost said he would "continue to be an outspoken advocate for the mainstream, centrist views that will lead us to the majority."
Both Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Frost are veteran campaigners and proven fund-raisers, but several Democrats said they believed the telegenic and personable Ms. Pelosi represents a chance to develop a new image of the party.
Mr. Ford, considered to be a future Democratic star, jumped into the race today after first leaning toward Mr. Frost. "Democrats have to offer something more than 'no, no, no,' " said Mr. Ford, a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition who is trying to become the first black lawmaker to lead a party.
"If you want something different, if you want a change, if you want to lead in a bold and new direction, if you want to aspire to be a better party than we are right now, I say, give my candidacy a chance," he urged his colleagues at a news conference.
But Democrats said the race appeared to be over and that Ms. Pelosi would rise from the No. 2 position to be the chief spokeswoman for House Democrats, responsible for developing the party's position on the many issues before Congress.
First elected to Congress in 1987 in a special election, Ms. Pelosi has been a member of the Appropriations Committee, an assignment she used to steer funding to her home region. She has been an outspoken critic of China on human rights issues and has opposed renewing favored trade status for that country.
She has said that her opposition to the Iraq resolution grew out of her expertise from her work on the Intelligence Committee, which recently completed public hearings into intelligence lapses surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks.
Ms. Pelosi promised today that she was willing to work with the Bush administration and Congressional Republicans on issues on which they agreed.
"But where we do not have our common ground, we must stand our ground," she said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: VOTES IN THE BALANCE; 
Mexico's Influence in Security Council Decision May Help Its Ties With U.S.

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox's decision to support the United States' resolution on Iraq after nudging the Americans toward compromise may produce a double benefit for Mexico. 
 By refusing to support the tougher resolution first proposed by the United States, Mr. Fox has won applause at home for appearing to take a stance against Washington and against a war. And by supporting the final draft of the resolution, he may be able to finally revive his relationship with the United States, which has essentially been frozen since last year's attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
 Diplomats from several nations say Mexico played a small but crucial role in forging the consensus that led to today's unanimous Security Council vote, submitting compromise language eventually adopted by all 15 members. It used its position as an elected member of the Security Council to help ensure that a war with Iraq would be "only valid as a last resort with prior explicit authorization from the Security Council," said its United Nations ambassador, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser.
By sticking to its decision in September to side with France's more cautious position in the internal debate, diplomats say, Mexico helped convince the United States to revise the resolution with an eye toward unanimity.
Speaking today, Mr. Fox said of the unanimous vote: "It strengthens the United Nations, it strengthens multilateralism, and it also strengthens Mexico. I think Mexico had a lot to do with the final outcome."
Mexico's foreign minister, Jorge G. Castaneda, said Mexico acted as a go-between among the permanent members of the Security Council in urging the United States toward a middle ground.
"The French and, to a lesser extent, the Russians felt more comfortable saying they were not doing this alone, but that a country close to the United States, a president known for his ties to President Bush and his pro-American stances, was also standing up for a set of the same principles," Mr. Castaneda said.
This engagement on the world stage marks an end to years of diplomatic detachment. It is a new role for an increasingly globalized Mexico, which is the world's 10th-largest nation, and by far the largest of the 10 countries now holding two-year seats on the Security Council. 
Back in the 20th century, when Mexico had a one-party government, it had a one-dimensional foreign policy that could be summed up in one word: nonintervention. When it engaged other nations, as it did in trying to broker peace during the Central American conflicts of the 1980's, it usually did so in a purely Latin American context.
"Perhaps we were a bit isolated, because we were ashamed about not having reached full democracy," Mr. Fox said. Now, he added, "we have matured enough to go out in the world and take part."
Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, put it more strongly last year, a few weeks before Mexico joined the Security Council: Mexico, he said, has become "a major political force in the world." 
But Mexico recognizes, as do most other nations, that the military, economic and political power of the United States makes the rest of the world look Lilliputian. And the role it played at the United Nations might be interpreted as tying Gulliver down, surrounding the United States with United Nations principles -- rules which, after all, Washington largely wrote when the world body was first formed.
Both sides say the United States and Mexico had no tit-for-tat arrangement in this vote. There was no deal that if Mexico voted with the United States, the Bush administration would begin to back the agreements Mr. Fox is seeking on issues including migration and trade.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Attorney General John Ashcroft and other cabinet members will visit Mexico City later this month for talks on such issues. And hopes are high in Mexico that the United Nations vote will help restart a relationship Mr. Bush once called as important as any to the United States.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE ELECTORATE; 
Some Democratic Losses Linked to White Defections

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY and DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Democrats who are examining some of their most disappointing losses on Tuesday are learning that minority voters turned out in respectable numbers and voted Democratic -- but that the party apparently lost thousands of moderate white voters who supported Bill Clinton and helped elect Southern Democratic governors in 1998 and 2000.
 In the governor's races in South Carolina and Georgia, where Democratic incumbents were defeated, minority turnout met expectations. 
 But Republicans seemed to carry white moderates, according to early Democratic analyses, and turned out unexpectedly high numbers of white conservatives. Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina saw his support among whites drop to an estimated 30 percent, from 40 percent in 1998. 
In Maryland, Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend carried Democratic strongholds in her race for governor but lost to Representative Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. because of strong turnout in predominantly white counties. Mr. Ehrlich had a black running mate, Michael S. Steele, for lieutenant governor. 
In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush turned a close race into a rout largely by winning predominantly white areas where Democratic leaders thought their candidate, Bill McBride, had a chance to compete. 
"I don't think we paid attention to white voters," said Gayle Andrews, a consultant who coordinates advertising and marketing to blacks for the Democrats in Florida and who worked in the McBride campaign.
Of Governor Bush, Ms. Andrews said: "He won overwhelmingly because white folks voted for that man. Black folks didn't vote for that man."
The question of who voted -- and who did not -- is of particular significance for the Democrats' internal fight about which direction to head after their midterm losses. Should the party move left to sharpen its differences with Republicans, or move right in hopes of attracting moderate and independent voters?
Democratic Party officials have not fully analyzed voting from Tuesday, and the decision by Voter News Service not to poll voters leaving the booth has created an absence of the demographic information often used to detect voting trends. Instead, they based their early analyses on independent surveys of voters at the polls and an examination of turnout in crucial counties.
Many Democrats have criticized the national party as failing to offer voters a coherent message or inspire supporters to go to the polls. They also credit President Bush with "nationalizing" the midterm elections by making them a referendum on him and the war against terrorism.
Dick Harpootlian, the Democratic chairman in South Carolina, said Mr. Bush's campaign appearances for Republicans in South Carolina were critical in motivating conservatives and dampening moderates' enthusiasm for Democrats. Mr. Harpootlian said early voting breakdowns suggested that black voters made up 26 percent of the state's overall turnout, a higher figure than in 2000 and in 1998, when Mr. Hodges was elected governor in a mild surprise.
But Mr. Harpootlian said that this year Mr. Hodges nose-dived in popularity with whites. "I think independent white people did not vote," he said. "The folks who turned out were folks who responded to Bush's nationalization of this election."
Even more surprising than the Hodges loss was the defeat of Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia, who had been mentioned as a prospective 2004 vice-presidential candidate. His Republican challenger, Sonny Perdue, defied the polls and won by five percentage points, generating a heavy turnout in largely white rural areas. In Forsyth County, which is 99 percent white, turnout increased to 32,000 on Tuesday from 20,000 in 1998, the last midterm elections. The numbers in largely white Cherokee County, in Atlanta's outer suburbs, jumped to 41,000 this year from 31,000 four years ago.
Tim Phillips, Mr. Barnes's campaign manager, said the governor carried Fulton and DeKalb Counties in metropolitan Atlanta -- both with large black populations -- by 100,000 votes and got about 450,000 votes from blacks statewide, roughly what the campaign had thought it needed.
Mr. Phillips dismissed speculation that Representative Cynthia McKinney's loss in an August primary kept many of her black supporters from voting. "Cynthia McKinney's district turned out," he said. "That backlash notion has no evidence at all."
But, he added, "we did not, and the nationally the Democratic Party did not, have a sufficiently compelling message."
The Democrats' drubbing in Florida is especially embarrassing after the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, predicted that the party would unseat Governor Bush. Many Democratic leaders had been elated when Mr. McBride narrowly defeated former Attorney General Janet Reno in the party's primary because he was thought to be the sort of white moderate who could attract swing voters in the tradition of the state's last Democratic governor, Lawton Chiles. 
But Mr. Bush won by 13 percentage points, and state Democrats are arguing about whom to blame. An analysis of exit polling sponsored by The Miami Herald and The St. Petersburg Times estimated that Mr. McBride got 94 percent of blacks' votes. Black turnout was 43 percent, more than in the 1998 governor's race, but far less than the record 72 percent set in the 2000 presidential election. The same survey put nonblack turnout at 55 percent.
Still, David Bositis, senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, which specializes in issues related to blacks, noted that black voters made up only 11 percent of the electorate -- not enough to have reversed Mr. Bush's 13-point win.
"If McBride was in a real neck-and-neck contest about who was going to be the next governor of Florida, that would be one thing," Mr. Bositis said. "But McBride wasn't. McBride did not generate enough support among white voters to win the election."
Aubrey Jewitt, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida, said Governor Bush's attacks against Mr. McBride on tax issues, coupled with the popularity of his brother the president pushed white moderates to the Republicans.
"Democrats had a tough time attracting swing voters," Mr. Jewitt said, adding, "They have to draw some distinction between what Republicans want and what they want. They have to point out where the Republicans have gone too far right."
Turnout was also pivotal in the two most populous states, California and Texas. In California, a Democratic stronghold, analysts are estimating that only 36 percent of eligible adults voted, a record low. Gov. Gray Davis won re-election even though he trailed his Republican challenger by three percentage points among whites. Turnout among minorities was so low that Mr. Davis won by only five points after polls gave him a double-digit lead among all voters.
In Texas, Democrats built their campaign strategy on drawing record numbers of black and Hispanic voters. The candidate for governor, Tony Sanchez, was Hispanic; the Senate candidate, Ron Kirk, was black. Democrats hoped their presence would bring out minorities while their moderate message would attract white swing voters.
But Republicans dominated. Estimates of Hispanic turnout range from 16 percent to 21 percent of the total, nowhere near enough to counter heavy voting in largely white Republican suburbs. Polls of voters conducted for Gov. Rick Perry showed that he received 72 percent of the white vote; over all, he defeated Mr. Sanchez by 18 points.

A big setback to Democrats was the victory Gov. Jeb Bush enjoyed over Bill McBride, who was thought to appeal to the very people who re-elected Mr. Bush. (Associated Press)

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: UNITED NATIONS; 
SECURITY COUNCIL VOTES, 15-0, FOR TOUGH IRAQ RESOLUTION; BUSH CALLS IT A 'FINAL TEST'

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution today that President Bush called a "final test" of Saddam Hussein's willingness to disarm, saying the Iraqi president's response must be "prompt and unconditional, or he will face the severest consequences."
 "Any act of delay or defiance will be an additional breach of Iraq's international obligations, and a clear signal that the Iraqi regime has once again abandoned the path of voluntary compliance," Mr. Bush said in the White House Rose Garden. 
 The president praised the United Nations for meeting its leadership responsibilities, but he put the Council on notice that the United States would be watching the weapons inspections very closely, and expected a strong and swift response to any Iraqi violation.
"The outcome of the current crisis is already determined: the full disarmament of Iraq will occur," Mr. Bush said. "The only question for the Iraqi regime to decide is how. The United States prefers that Iraq meet its obligations voluntarily, yet we are prepared for the alternative." 
The Iraqi government had no immediate reaction.
The approval of Resolution 1441 by a show of hands of the envoys of all 15 nations on the Council was an unexpected triumph for the Bush administration, eight weeks after the president's opening call to the United Nations, a declaration that made many countries fear a unilateral attack by Washington to topple Mr. Hussein. Changes in the language of the resolution paved the way. Page A10. 
In intensive negotiations that culminated only minutes before the Council session began at 10 a.m. today, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, the only Arab nation on the Council, agreed to vote in favor.
The measure, supported by all the major powers as well as the Arab nations, sent an overwhelmingly clear message to Mr. Hussein.
"Noncompliance is no longer an option," the United States ambassador to the United Nations, John D. Negroponte, said after he cast his vote.
But while the resolution gave the Bush administration powerful new backing for its political confrontation with Mr. Hussein, most Council nations made it clear that they still did not support any rush to war.
"What is most important is that the resolution deflects the direct threat of war, and opens the road to further work in the interest of a diplomatic settlement," said Sergey Lavrov, the ambassador from Russia, the most reluctant of the five permanent, veto-bearing members of the Council.
It was not clear today what horse-trading Washington had done with France, Russia and Mexico, its reluctant allies, to bring them around. But diplomats from several Council nations said the Bush administration had bargained very effectively merely by stepping back from its threats to start immediate war in the Middle East with only a single ally, Britain.
There was no response today from Baghdad, which was officially notified of the resolution by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, at 10:52 a.m. The Iraqi ambassador here, Mohammed Aldouri, said, "Iraq will certainly study the resolution and decide whether we can accept it or not."
Baghdad now has seven days to advise the Council whether it is willing to comply with the resolution.
The Council consensus on the resolution, which was sponsored by the United States and Britain, was achieved through a complex compromise struck in two months of arduous, often exasperating, discussions led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
While the vote was unanimous, the Council delegates articulated differing interpretations of why they supported it, how it could be carried out and how it affected their national prerogatives.
Mr. Negroponte stressed that the resolution confirmed that Iraq has for years been in grave violation, or "material breach," of its disarmament obligations, and that any new violation in the weapons inspections would be "a serious matter."
United States officials said that language gave Washington the legal basis to go to war unilaterally if the Council could not agree how to respond to new violations by Baghdad.
But the American ambassador also extended a specific assurance to France and other doubting nations that the resolution "contains no hidden triggers" and no automatic basis for the use of force. Mr. Negroponte said the United States was committed to coming back to the Council to discuss new Iraqi violations. Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador, echoed that assurance.
To underscore their understanding, China, France and Russia issued a separate statement today insisting that it was up to the United Nations weapons inspectors to report any violations to the Council, and up to the Council to "take a position."
France led the way in insisting that military action could be authorized only in a second stage, after the weapons inspectors did their work and if and when they detected Iraqi violations of the inspections regime.
In the resolution, the Security Council gives Iraq a "final opportunity" to comply with disarmament resolutions and establishes a rigorous regiment of inspections, giving United Nations inspectors immediate access to any site they want in Iraq. The text warns of "serious consequences" if Iraq commits any other violation -- meaning war. But such violations must be reported by the inspectors to the Council, which will meet to decide what to do.
The support of Russia and Syria had remained in doubt as recently as Thursday night.
President Assad shifted his position this morning, minutes before the vote, after receiving telephone calls from Mr. Annan and President Jacques Chirac of France. Mr. Chirac sought to persuade the Syrian leader that the resolution was the last chance to avoid war in the Middle East, French diplomats said.
"War is much less likely if you support the resolution than if you don't," Mr. Chirac told Mr. Assad, a diplomat said.
President Putin, who spoke with President Bush on Thursday morning, was persuaded late that night by the change of two words made in the draft late Thursday afternoon, senior administration officials said. They agreed to change the word "or" to "and" in one paragraph and to say the Council would act to "secure" peace rather than "restore" it in another.
To leaders who had been embroiled for weeks in arguing word by word about the draft, those seemingly minute revisions signaled that Washington and London were serious about returning to the Council before declaring war for another round of talks if the weapons inspectors reported breaches by Iraq.
The Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, called Secretary Powell only this morning to say that Mr. Putin had agreed to come on board, the administration officials said.
China, a permanent Council member that also waited until today to disclose its position, said it wanted to see a peaceful, "comprehensive" settlement in Iraq, including the lifting one day of the tough economic sanctions imposed at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Mexico, a United States neighbor that holds one of 10 nonpermanent seats on the Council, supported the resolution after Mr. Chirac threw his support behind it on Thursday night.
The consensus vote was satisfying to Mr. Annan, who had insisted since the start of the negotiations that a divided decision would be a disaster for the United Nations and for the prospects of peace in the Middle East. "I know that it has not been easy to reach agreement," he said. "But the effort has been well worthwhile. Whenever the Council is united, it sends a very powerful signal."
Mr. Annan urged Iraq "for the sake of its own people, for the sake of world security and world order" to seize the opportunity offered by the resolution. He cautioned that the next phase of the weapons inspections would be "difficult and dangerous," calling it another "time of trial" for the United Nations.
The passage of the resolution was the signal to begin the weapons inspections. The chief United Nations inspector for chemical and biological weapons, Hans Blix, announced that he would travel to Baghdad to begin work on Nov. 19. He will be accompanied by Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief atomic weapons inspector.
Mr. Blix and Mr. ElBaradei will arrive with only a small group of technicians to begin logistics planning for the weapons teams. The first group of about a dozen arms experts will arrive within 7 to 10 days.
Within 30 days, Iraq must present a complete declaration of all its weapons programs. Any omissions or false statements will constitute a new "material breach" that will begin the "serious consequences" threatened in the resolution.
Full scale inspections by both United Nations teams must begin within 45 days. Both weapons chiefs welcomed the enhanced authority the resolution gives them. 
The vote was hailed by leaders in Europe. Mr. Chirac said it "offers a chance for Iraq to disarm in peace." 
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain put it slightly differently. "Saddam must now make his choice," he said. "My message to him is this: Disarm or you face force."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE VOTERS; 
East and West, Voters Explain The Bush Effect

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Ray Hannemann is a Democrat who voted for Al Gore in 2000. But he followed President Bush's advice this week and voted for a Republican, John E. Sununu, for the Senate in New Hampshire and says he is likely to vote for Mr. Bush in 2004.
 "I'm against terrorism, and I agree we have to go after Iraq," said Mr. Hannemann, 56, who unloads delivery trucks at Home Depot. 
 Of the president, he said, "I like his hard nose."
The votes of people like Mr. Hannemann, who lives in a Democratic ward in Manchester, tipped the scales in favor of Mr. Sununu in a close race against Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, the Democrat, and helped Republicans regain control of the Senate.
As President Bush basks in the afterglow of his historic midterm acquisition of one-party rule in Washington, he can hang another pelt on the wall: the newfound support of Democrats like Mr. Hannemann.
Interviews with dozens of voters in New Hampshire, Colorado and Maryland -- three states that experienced close elections on Tuesday -- show that Mr. Bush is enjoying unusually positive feelings from voters in both parties. He has won over many Gore voters and solidified his standing among Republicans.
Granted, hard-core Democrats remained as unhappy with him as they always had been and said they dreaded the prospect of the Republican Party's controlling both houses of Congress and the White House. But virtually no one who was interviewed said they had gone from liking Mr. Bush at the outset of his administration to disliking him now.
Ultimately, Mr. Bush's success seems to stem from what voters describe as a combination of personal appeal and a toughness that increased his stature after the terrorist attacks last year.

Manchester, N.H.
An older industrial city, Manchester has shifted from manufacturing to software and electronics. Its unemployment rate of 4.5 percent is lower than the national average of 5.7 percent. Democrats account for 38 percent of the city's voters, Republicans for 36 percent and the unaffiliated for 25 percent. But Mr. Sununu edged ahead of Ms. Shaheen in the city, an early indication that he would win statewide.
President Bush campaigned in New Hampshire the Friday before Election Day, telling voters, "The people of this state want down-to-earth, plain-speaking members representing them, and that is exactly what John Sununu is."
That down-to-earth quality seems to be exactly what voters like Caren Grady also like about Mr. Bush.
A couple of years ago, her husband went to the Mall of New Hampshire to pick up a sandwich. The place was temporarily blocked by security guards because Barbara Bush, the president's mother, was getting a sandwich there, too.
"They're just like us," Mrs. Grady, 51, owner of a sports memorabilia shop, said. "They're not having something brought in special just for them."
"Their daughters seem to be normal kids, too," Mrs. Grady said of the president's children. "They seem to get in the same kind of little scrapes that all kids do."
Lauren Arute, 25, a financial analyst who was having a drink at the Backroom restaurant, said she voted for Mr. Gore. "But I think he's done a marvelous job," Ms. Arute said of the president. "He's very American -- he goes running and things. I think people can relate to him a lot."
Similarly, her companion, Nick Pringle, 29, an aspiring firefighter, voted for Mr. Gore but now prefers Mr. Bush. "He's handled everything better than I think Gore would have done," Mr. Pringle said. "Bush came out as more of a warrior."
Hard-core Democrats, of course, remain skeptical of the president and are especially worried about what he might do with unchecked control in Washington.
Chuck Meade, 50, a lawyer from Bedford, said over his breakfast at Greg's Place that he was angered by "Bush's willingness to attack countries around the world." He added: "I'm troubled by the Republican Party's arrogance, not respecting the rest of the world's opinions. I'm troubled by the potential judicial appointments. I think this administration is going to establish legal precedents for the next 40 years on the Supreme Court."
Mr. Meade voted for Mr. Gore in 2000 and Ms. Shaheen on Tuesday. He said he was surprised at how well Mr. Bush presented himself after last year's attacks, but not enough to vote for him in 2004.
Other Democrats saw no redeeming qualities to Mr. Bush.
"If you take the war out of the picture, what has he done?" asked Kathleen Kelley-Broder, 31, who sells insurance and was dining at the Backroom with fellow Democratic members of the school board, all of whom had lost re-election. "The economy hasn't improved, and there's still no health care."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE VOTERS; 
Jefferson County, Colo.

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

 BODY:
Jefferson County, which borders Denver, is the quintessential American suburb of urban sprawl with strip malls and a mix of working-class, middle-class and upper-income residents. With a population of 527,056, it is Colorado's second-most-populous county after Denver County and one of the fastest growing.
It has 139,654 Republicans and 102,859 Democrats, and played a vital role in re-electing Senator Wayne Allard, a Republican, over his Democratic challenger, Tom Strickland. The statewide total was 50.9 percent for Mr. Allard to 45.6 percent for Mr. Strickland, virtually the identical margin in Jefferson County. 
 In interviews at Einstein's Bagels, voters who liked President Bush said they admired his strength and integrity. 
 Aimee Didonato, 25, a registered nurse and a Republican who voted for Mr. Allard, said Mr. Bush gave her a sense of security.
"I don't get the sense he would back down to anybody," Ms. Didonato said. "He does what he says and he follows through in everything he does. That's what makes me feel secure that if we go to war with Iraq, he'll come through."
Others were lukewarm toward the president. Cherie Gilbert, 25, a hairdresser and former Democrat, voted for Mr. Allard, saying, "I'm generally happy with Bush." She added: "The economy is not so great, but I don't know if it all falls on his shoulders. Everything is cyclical; it had to come down. But he has more integrity than Clinton."
Integrity mattered also to Holly Bodine, 48, a part-time administrator at a hospital. "Personally and politically, I think Bush has a tremendous amount of integrity," she said. She said she also supported him on Iraq. "I don't want an all-out war," she said, "but I agree that it is necessary to make a pre-emptive strike so it won't happen again."
Democrats were dismissive of the president. Kathleen Krager, 47, a Democrat and transportation engineer, had nothing good to say about Mr. Bush. "Nothing," Ms. Krager said. "He's not a bright man. He's surrounded by power-hungry people looking for a war with Iraq."
Britany Clayton, 23, a recent college graduate looking for a job as a graphic designer, and who voted for Mr. Strickland, said of Mr. Bush: "He makes me nervous. It's not that I don't like him, but some of his ideas are nerve-racking, especially on women's rights issues and tax cuts, a bad idea. I just graduated from college, and he has not made it very easy for people like me to get a job. It's because of the economy. I hold him responsible, very much so."
James Bludworth, 33, a freelance photographer and a Democrat, did not like Mr. Bush at all. "He just scares me as the guy in charge with his finger on the button," Mr. Bludworth said.
His preference?
"I watch 'The West Wing,' and I kind of wish Martin Sheen could be the president," Mr. Bludworth said. "He's so much more thoughtful. I don't have the feeling that the same kind of thoughtfulness is in the Bush White House." MICHAEL JANOFSKY

HEADLINE: Peaches and Herb 

BYLINE:  By Cathy Horyn; Cathy Horyn is the fashion critic of The New York Times.

 BODY:
"Puttering" is much too quaint a word for a woman who bought 70 acres of Connecticut farmland, ordered a Palladian villa to be built amid the Colonial clapboard and laid out a medieval garden complete with 42 varieties of tomatoes. Nor would it describe the woman herself, a no-nonsense fashion designer reared in the Midwest, who one day boarded a Greyhound bus for New York and found her job by scanning the Yellow Pages.
 The plain truth is that Linda Allard, who this fall celebrates 40 years at Ellen Tracy -- the only grown-up job she's ever had -- isn't happy unless her plate is full. And that presents a problem to her husband of two and a half years, Herb Gallen, the founder of Ellen Tracy. "I don't know," he said kind of moodily. "I think she's a little nuts." 
 He dropped the line as calmly as if he were dropping a ball at the 18th tee of his club. I could see the man was a bit of a card. 
Then Allard, playing Pat to his Mike, volleyed one back. "Well, we know that," she said sweetly. "What would you like for breakfast? A piece of peach pie?"
Gallen, who's on a diet, looked wild. "Are you kidding?"
Actually, that's what I was doing up at the Gallen-Allard residence on a Sunday morning right before the opening of the spring 2003 collections. I was there to sample her peach pie. She is known for her culinary skills, whether for baking or serving up a stew for a crowd, and several of my friends swear by her cookbook, "Absolutely Delicious!" (Random House). Of course, I was curious about her house and garden, which includes one of the more enterprising landscape jokes invented: a ha-ha, a stone wall set against the earth, rather than above it, so you think you're viewing a continuous slope. It works along the same principles as an infinity pool. Ha-ha -- watch that drop-off.
Below the wall, Allard has planted apple trees of several varieties; beyond that, for miles, are the rolling hills of western Connecticut. She enlisted her brother David, an architect in Nashville, to design the house. She wanted something at once classical and modern. Inevitably they thought of Palladio. As for her garden, an immaculate riot of late-summer blooms and vegetables, all her leanings are English. "When I'm here, I wake up with the sun," she said. "I don't get here enough, so when I am, I have to get up -- to see what's happening in the garden."
Gallen had poured himself a cup of coffee and had settled into one of the big club chairs in the kitchen when we returned. The kitchen, which opens onto a sun room where Allard does her flower arrangements, was designed to accommodate her many relatives; and since her marriage to Gallen, their combined families. "I have two children, seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren," Gallen noted. "And there's one coming in November. So I have a lot." This room is the hub of the house, whether they're alone or with friends, and Allard can follow the conversation as she cooks.
"I love to entertain in the kitchen," she said.
"Well, you do," he added.
"Then I can cook. Herb watches TV. So we can be together, and I can do my cooking thing. And when friends are here, they'll help cook."
Allard has been up early to bake the pie, using an aunt's recipe for the lard crust (mixed with a little butter), and while she was at it, two kinds of focaccia, some bread sticks and a couple of baguettes. Which Gallen was tucking into, with some berry preserves his wife had made on their last visit.
"I like making homey things," she said. "Baking bread. Making soups and casseroles."
"And she's good," he added.
"Stews. Braised things, like osso buco and lamb shanks."
Gallen looked critically for a moment at his jam-covered baguette. "Linda, are you going to charge me points for this?" he asked, referring to his diet.
"Yep." 
The pie, still warm, was delicious. Buttery, with the freshest peaches. She said: "My aunt told me the secret of making a good pie crust is when you blend the shortening and the flour, just pick up a little crumb, and if it sticks together, you're ready to add the water. If it doesn't stick together, you have to add more shortening."
What being married to Gallen means, among other things, is that Allard can't spend as much time at her house as she would like. "My husband has a beautiful yacht, and in the summer he likes to be on the boat," she said. "So we have a little bit of a conflict. I like to be in my garden, and he likes to be on the water." They spent part of last summer sailing up the Northeast, stopping at Nantucket and Maine. In winter, they go to St. Barts. On the boat, the Mystique, there's a staff to do the cooking. "All Linda does is fight to come up here," Gallen said. "This is beautiful, but the boat is beautiful." He shrugged. "I mean, the boat is just a special thing."
In the fall, Allard spends more time in Connecticut, harvesting, canning tomatoes, pressing apples into cider. "Whatever the reason, she finds one to be up here," Gallen said.
Allard smiled. "He gets so mad at me because I have a hard time sitting still."
Gallen said: "We come up, I sit in the chair, and I watch TV. And I don't see her the whole day. She's working, working, working. And I say that's kind of silly. Why just work when you've reached this point?"
"I guess it's just the way we were brought up."
"Of course, I have nothing to say about it."
Allard laughed. "Well, you have something to say about it. * "
She landed here at 23, straight out of Kent State, near her Ohio home. Her first residence was the Martha Washington hotel. She knocked on doors for a job. "I stopped at Ellen Tracy, maybe with about a thousand other people," she said. "I didn't know anything about the Garment Center. So I looked the names up in the Yellow Pages, and realized they were all in these same buildings. So I just went to the buildings, and started at the top floor."
Gallen had opened Ellen Tracy 13 years earlier, in 1949, as a blouse firm. "I was in the auto supply business," he said, "and came directly to the blouse business. Isn't that normal?"
He was just about to lay out the whole story when Allard asked, "Do you want a piece of pie?"
He shot her a wild look again. "No, thank you. What are going to do, charge me 400 points?"
Anyway, he continued, one thing led to another, and he was in the blouse business, selling to stores along 34th Street. He initially bought the business from an underwear maker called Tranel. That's how he came up with the name Ellen Tracy; he played around with the letters in Tranel.
By the time she knocked on his door, he was well established. "I went into Herb's office," she said. "I had my bag, with all my stuff in it. He looked at my portfolio and said, 'Well, how much money do you want to make?'
"I had been tramping the streets for two weeks and never got even close to that question. I hadn't even thought about it. I didn't have any money left, and I didn't want to call my parents. So, I said, 'Well, I need to make $50 a week.'
"He said: 'Well, I can't hire you for 50, but if you'll take 60, you can have the job.' Little did I realize! I thought he was being really generous. Boy, $60 a week didn't go very far."
Gallen, who recently sold Ellen Tracy to Liz Claiborne for $180 million, laughed. "Well, she stayed at $60 until about two years ago."
It does seem unusual for a designer -- indeed, any person -- to remain in one job for so long. But as Ellen Tracy grew from a blouse concern into a major sportswear brand, with accessories and so forth, it presented new challenges. And, as she said, "it really never occurred to me to leave because I was happy."
They've known each longer than they've been wedded. Maybe that's why their repartee has already mellowed into the quality of an old screwball comedy. Her house, his boat * At one point, as Allard was serving me another helping of pie, Gallen observed that before they were married, they happened to use the same decorator to do their homes.
Thinking they might have economized, I laughed, and said, "Couldn't you two have gotten together earlier?"
"Well, he was married," Allard replied.
Gallen, the old devil, shrugged. "What's so difficult?" 

Peach Pie
(Adapted from Linda Allard's "Absolutely Delicious!")

For the pastry:
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup cold lard (Allard usually uses 3 tablespoons of butter as part of the lard)
1/4 cup ice water.

For the filling:
4 to 6 cups ripe peaches, peeled and sliced
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 to 1 1/4 cups sugar
1/4 cup flour
Bit of freshly grated nutmeg.
1. Mix the flour and the salt. Add the cold shortening in 2-inch pieces. Cut it into the flour until the mixture is crumbly. Squeeze a bit together (if it crumbles, add more shortening).
2. Mix in ice water, a couple of tablespoons at a time, with a fork until the dough sticks together. Pat it together, but do not overhandle.
3. Shape into 2 flattened discs. Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.
4. Mix peaches with lemon juice. Add sugar and flour and mix.
5. Roll out the first pastry disc and place in a 9-inch pie plate. Add filling. Grate nutmeg on top.
6. Roll out second disc. Cut slits in a decorative pattern. Place on top of filling. Wet edges of bottom pastry with cold water. Trim pastry; pinch bottom and top edges together.
7. Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, turn down to 375 degrees and cook until peaches bubble and pastry is golden, about 45 minutes. Serve slightly warm with ice cream.
Yield: 8 servings.

Real Glamour

BYLINE:  By William Norwich 

 BODY:
You're thinking: what mushrooms has he been sauteeing that could possibly induce the notion that there's any real or new glamour in the world today? I know, I know. At press time, there was almost a war on. We're going somewhere in a handbasket, and the giddy, smug, global economic bubble has burst. But the glamour is in the clearing: when the bubble bursts, the air improves. 
 Let me explain. Recently, I went to a marvelous party. The venue and format were new to me. (Sorry, I wasn't attached to a camera crew that night, but you know what the host looks like.) Calvin Klein, Mr. Downtown, gave a small dinner uptown at the Plaza Athenee's Bar Seine, fast becoming Manhattan's equivalent of the Ritz bar in Paris. Instead of an endless cocktail hour, the guests seated themselves at banquettes around various low tables and were served what French foodies call an amuse-bouche, which means, roughly, "amuse the mouth." Think: French tapas. It was like a cocktail party, but you sat and were fed. Nothing, and no one, took you hostage: morsels on small plates, in jolly succession, a bite-size club sandwich followed by a dollop of salmon mousse, then seared tuna, a bay scallop, a bit of filet and a tablespoon of a mousse cake with a dash of mint ice cream. You were free to get up and move about, or stay where you were -- the amuse-bouche followed you. The rugs, the leather floor tiles and the pillows on the banquettes absorbed noise, and you could really hear people chat, and there is so much to talk about these days. The message of the dinner was also the mix; the 50 or so guests ranged in age from 21 to Reinaldo Herrera. Very glamorous, I thought, and I didn't knock anything over or spill on myself. 
 Glamour, like cool, is elusive. Glamour, when misunderstood, enervates rather than enthuses. In a money culture, people who seek glamour are often disappointed. They confuse glamour with privilege. The first time you do something rather fabulous, it has glamour; the second time, if you're lucky enough, it is a privilege. (Good manners, however, are always glamorous.) Your first taste of caviar, first limousine ride, first sip of Champagne, first amuse-bouche, first time in first class * is glamorous. From then on, it is a privilege.
In other words, gratitude. That is the essential ingredient for a new glamour -- and a quality you will hopefully perceive in the articles in this issue, from Bruce Weber's homage to New York and Blossom Dearie, to a chronicle of supper clubs around the country, to Christy Turlington and Marc Jacobs's perfect friendship, among the others happily included.
As the worship of excess evaporates, so too does the tyranny of hip. We all face the same sun now.

 A SECRET HISTORY
OF THE IRA
By Ed Moloney.
Illustrated. 600 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $28.95.
 CAN the hope of the green-white-orange Irish flag -- peace between Catholic and Protestant -- ever be realized? When Ed Moloney, a respected journalist born in England and educated in Northern Ireland, finished "A Secret History of the IRA" earlier this year, the omens looked good. The agreement signed on Good Friday, 1998, with papal blessing and low-key American support, continued a cease-fire by the mainstream Irish Republican Army, and its political ally, Sinn Fein, had joined the power-sharing assembly in Belfast to which Britain had transferred day-to-day government. But the I.R.A. is still holding huge stocks of arms, mostly from Libya and the United States; then, last month, a senior Sinn Fein official was charged with having information likely to be of use to terrorists, reportedly on possible targets for assassination. Britain suspended the Northern Ireland assembly to forestall a walkout by hard-line Protestants. In the worst case, the killing and maiming of 35 years of guerrilla war and savage counterinsurgency resumes and Ireland, north and south, is back at tragic Square 1. 
Moloney, a former Northern editor of The Irish Times and The Sunday Tribune in Dublin, begins his account in the 1960's, when the bitter seeds of the current cycle of Ireland's Troubles were planted and the leadership still dominant on both sides emerged. In his version (which, having covered the same events for The Sunday Times of London, I commend), Northern Ireland's repressive stability was shattered, like that of many another unjust regime, by over-timid attempts at reform. In 1965, with a reasoning that still holds good, the patrician Protestant Northern Irish prime minister, Terence O'Neill, met his Dublin counterpart, Sean Lemass, a veteran of the 1916 Easter Rising, arguing that Catholic acceptance of Northern Ireland was needed to revitalize its economy and that this meant giving Catholics fairer access to jobs and houses. A fiery Protestant fundamentalist, the Rev. Ian Paisley, warned of a sellout to Rome. Seeing their privileges threatened, working-class Protestants formed "loyalist" gangs. In the summer of 1966, loyalists shot a Catholic, Peter Ward, 18, caught in a Protestant pub; a Catholic pedestrian was shot on the street; and an elderly Protestant woman died in a botched bar firebombing -- the first deaths of the present round. Inspired by the American civil rights movement, young students, mostly Catholic, formed their own protest movement, People's Democracy; in 1969, loyalists attacked a movement march, setting off escalating sectarian violence and a Northern Irish government request for British troops.
Welcomed as peacemakers, they soon aroused ancestral memories of long-ago English invasions. Moloney notes that many of the regulars were veterans of counterinsurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Kenya and unthinkingly brought with them colonial perceptions of native treachery. On Aug. 9, 1971, police officers and soldiers arrested 342 people, mostly Catholics, who were interned without charge or trial, many on the strength of outdated intelligence, mistaken identity or village gossip. Some were tortured. Riots broke out all over Northern Ireland. On Jan. 30, 1972, Bloody Sunday, in a bungled attempt to bring the I.R.A. to battle, British paratroopers in Londonderry fatally shot 14 unarmed Catholic civil rights demonstrators, none connected with the I.R.A. The British Embassy in Dublin was burned, and young Catholics flocked to join the terrorists. In 1972, the most violent year of the Troubles, 467 people died. 
The internment of old-line I.R.A. fighters -- Moloney estimates there were no more than 50 still active in Belfast -- cleared the way for younger militants still unknown to the police. The ablest of them, Gerry Adams, was 18 and working in a bar in 1966 when, according to Moloney, he was sworn into Company D of the I.R.A.'s Belfast Brigade, in which his father had been wounded in an action. On both sides the Adamses have deep republican roots (meaning, in Irish terms, they favored the reunification of Ireland at gunpoint if necessary). Adams was brought up in Ballymurphy, an isolated Catholic ghetto on the western edge of Belfast in constant danger of loyalist violence.
Adams, president of Sinn Fein since 1983, has never admitted involvement with the I.R.A., but with his family history this is hard to believe. More surprising, Moloney reports that Adams has never personally "fired a shot in anger against the British or their local allies." Still, he was briefly interned without trial in 1972, again in 1973, and then served three years for trying to escape. In periods of freedom, according to Moloney, Adams rose to command the Belfast Brigade and is credited with introducing Armalite rifles bought with contributions by Irish-Americans to the cause of "Northern Aid." 
Adams shared his time in prison, Moloney reports, with a group of internees devising a new strategy for the I.R.A. Force was still favored to drive the British out but, to achieve something "during our lifetimes," Adams called for a long war that, to retain the essential support of Catholics, meant open political activity as well. In this, Moloney says, lay the germ of the I.R.A.'s acceptance of a cease-fire 20 years later. Most of Moloney's book is devoted to the gradual evolution of this policy: years of nonstop bloodshed, some 3,600 deaths to date, a slow-motion World Trade Center in an area scarcely bigger than Connecticut; of tragicomedy, like the racehorse held by the I.R.A. for ransom, shot while trying to escape; and of stomach-turning cruelty on both sides (the "Shankill Butchers," a Protestant gang who sliced their Catholic victims with cleavers, and the "human bombs," beginning with a Catholic working for the army who was forced by the I.R.A. to drive a car bomb into a base and was then blown up). Moloney names a self-effacing hero, the Rev. Alec Reid, a Redemptorist priest who acted as a tireless go-between, and fills out the roles of other men of peace: the Northern-descended Irish prime minister, Charles Haughey, and the Nobel laureate John Hume, who risked his Catholic support to meet Adams and convey plans for an end to I.R.A. terrorism. 
Through the many and devious policy shifts that led to the 1997 I.R.A. cease-fire, Moloney traces what he calls the "golden thread" of consent implicit in the principles of nonviolence laid down by the mediator, and former United States senator, George J. Mitchell: there are two traditions in Ireland, as the flag acknowledges, and peaceful reunification can be achieved only by negotiation between them, meaning that a majority in Northern Ireland, as well as a majority in the Irish Republic, must first democratically agree. But Ireland also has two traditions of lawless violence, not one; and the terrorists of the loyalist side have not disarmed either, any more than the I.R.A. has -- and neither is likely to give up its weapons while the other side keeps its. A return to the sectarian battles of 1972 onward is still a possibility -- pessimistically, until the current generation of die-hards passes on. 
It takes two to make peace; one side cannot unilaterally cancel the hatreds of 30 violent years. Freelance, unauthorized terrorism by unreconciled I.R.A. and loyalist splinter groups goes on, and while most Catholics support an all-party government in Belfast, the Democratic Unionist Party of Ian Paisley, with his uncompromising watchword "No Surrender!," emphatically does not. Paisley's Unionist Party is attracting more and more Protestant votes, forcing the moderate Ulster Unionist Party to harden its stance against Sinn Fein. On a recent visit to Northern Ireland, I saw heartening economic progress that gives working-class Catholics and Protestants alike a stake in reconciliation; mortgages and machine guns seldom go together. In a telling aside, Moloney reports that Gerry Adams, usually clad these days in politician's suit and tie, dresses down to jeans and T-shirt to meet his old working-class I.R.A. comrades. Moloney throws much new light, though of necessity on only one side, on a far from finished conflict. He's made an important contribution to our understanding just the same.

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SNOW; 
Resorts Seek A Snowball Effect

BYLINE:  By MEG LUKENS NOONAN; MEG LUKENS NOONAN, who lives in New Hampshire, writes frequently about skiing.

 BODY:
THE people who run winter resorts across North America are optimistic that skiers and snowboarders will head to their slopes in record numbers this season, despite persistent worries about war, terrorism and the economy. According to the National Ski Areas Association, they have good reason to anticipate a strong year; last winter, in what was arguably an even less favorable leisure-travel climate, resorts posted their third best season ever with 54.4 million skier and snowboarder visits, down about 5 percent from the 2000-1 total of 57.3 million, the best ever. Last season's tally is even more impressive in light of the fact that snowfall totals were lower than normal in most of the country.
 Visitors were drawn to the ski areas in 2001-2, marketing executives say, in part by the sense that the mountains offer a safe haven, far from the world's ills. This winter, resorts are doing even more to promote the retreat aspect, with an emphasis on spa-style pampering, fine dining and service-oriented details designed to take the hassle out of the ski experience. At the luxurious Beaver Creek Resort in Colorado, for instance, employees have been instructed by management to not merely give directions to guests who ask where to buy lift tickets, but also to escort them to the ticket counter -- and help them decide what ticket to buy. 
 Meanwhile, resort operators are excited by what they see as skiing's resurgence among free-spending teenagers and young adults and are doing all they can to appeal to that market segment. Among some of the youth-oriented enhancements are new state-of-the-art super pipes (long, high-sided half-pipes meant for use by skiers and snowboarders) at Loon and Attitash in New Hampshire, and Sugar Bowl and Kirkwood in California; powerful new outdoor sound systems for music at Steamboat, Durango Mountain Resort and Buttermilk in Colorado and Whistler in British Columbia; greatly expanded terrain parks at Snowbird in Utah and Winter Park in Colorado, and teen centers, like the new one at Smuggler's Notch in Vermont, where kids have access to the Internet and latest video games -- presumably keeping them happily occupied while mom and dad are being packed in therapeutic mud at a nearby spa or taking a snowshoe tour through the pines.
In a further effort to lure young adults, some resorts are casting themselves as party destinations. It is a strategy that, in at least one case, has not gone over well. After receiving complaints, Breckenridge removed from its Web site last month ads that made not-so-subtle drug references to its skiers: "What they crave is the Breckenridge fix. They crave their own snow stash." Crested Butte began a series of more lighthearted ads last month that depict the funky restored mining town as the anti-Vail. One shows a young woman riding a beat-up bike along Crested Butte's main street with a sixpack of beer in her basket. The copy reads: "This is not Vail. You can tell because the party she is going to isn't catered." Vail, meanwhile, is not conceding anything on the hipper-than-thou front. Nicky DeFord, its communications coordinator, says the resort is chasing 13-to-24-year-olds with special packages and events, including the US Freeskiing Open, Feb. 6 to 9, 2003. "This is not their parents' Vail," Ms. DeFord says. Not to be outdone, in Aspen, Buttermilk's expanded Crazy T'rain Park will be the scene of the uber-cool ESPN Winter X Games, Jan. 30 to Feb. 2.
Though major construction and terrain expansion seem to have slowed after a decadelong spending frenzy, there are a few substantial ribbon-cuttings this season, particularly in the Lake Tahoe area. After 20 years of planning, Squaw Valley this summer opened most of the first phase of its $250 million base pedestrian village, which, when completed in three to five years, will bring 600 new lodging units and scores of shops and restaurants to the venerable 1960 Olympic venue. Nearby Heavenly Ski Resort, recently acquired by Vail Resorts, also unveils a portion of its ambitious new base village in November. Kirkwood opens three lodging properties, as well as an already-completed ice rink and a swim and fitness center. At Mammoth Mountain in California, a new 15-passenger gondola that serves as the crucial link between its emerging village and its mountain base area is scheduled to open in February.
In Utah, the Canyons Resort has opened the second part of its mountainside Westgate resort development, with shops, a spa and restaurants. Continuing its village development project, Copper Mountain in Colorado introduces the West Lake Market around Thanksgiving; the complex of shops, restaurants and night spots includes a Russian-themed vodka bar. In June, the 90-room Sky Hotel opened in the former Aspen Club Lodge at the base of Aspen Mountain. 
Opening this month at Beaver Creek is the 237-room ski-in, ski-out Ritz-Carlton Bachelor Gulch, set in a valley just to the west of the resort's main village area. Modeled after the grand log and stone lodges of Western national parks, the hotel has a spa and its own branch of the Beaver Creek Ski School. In February, the private membership Ritz-Carlton Club will open nearby with 54 time-share residences. The new Stratton Mountain Club in Stratton, Vt., offering a deluxe base lodge for members only and a restaurant open to the public for dinner, will open in February. The club is already fully subscribed with 300 member families. 
Skiers and snowboarders will find major terrain expansion at Okemo in Vermont (at Jackson Gore, its fifth skiable peak) and at Aspen Highlands, where 16 new expert runs vein the Highland Bowl. Breckenridge in Colorado has a new high-speed chairlift to 165 acres of intermediate slopes. Sun Peaks in British Columbia opens 600 acres on Mount Morrisey, its third peak. 
Last January, Telluride, in southern Colorado, introduced its huge 733-acre expansion geared largely to intermediate skiers; this season, the resort will have a new lighted "snowdeck" park for what are essentially ski skateboards. Arapahoe Basin, just below Colorado's Continental Divide, will fire up snowmaking guns for the first time on its slopes this season. Park City will open its 2002 Olympic super pipe to the public, as well as a second half-pipe and three new terrain parks. Nearby, Deer Valley will allow skiers to use the punishing Olympic mogul run. In Maine, Sugarloaf has upgraded its glade skiing and Sunday River has added a kids' terrain park.
Several resorts have installed fast, state-of-the-art lifts to replace creaky old ones -- including Whiteface Mountain in New York and Sugarbush in Vermont. Lake Louise in Alberta is getting the Canadian Rockies' first six-passenger chairlift. Jack Frost and Big Boulder in the Poconos have new lifts, all-new rental gear and a tubing park. A new tow lift connects Mary Jane to its mother mountain, Winter Park in Colorado, eliminating an uphill slog to get between the two areas. At Big Sky, in Montana, a new chairlift gives easier access to the resort's north side.
Travel by air should be easier, too, this season. Feeling the pinch of reduced traffic, especially among business travelers, airlines are finding flights into ski towns increasingly attractive. Jackson Hole, Wyo., which is heavily dependent on air travel, will go from two carriers to five, with nonstops from eight cities. Aspen has expanded service as well, with 23 percent more flights than last year: San Francisco becomes its sixth city with nonstop service. Sun Valley, Idaho, has two new nonstop flights to and from Los Angeles and Boise. Crested Butte has a new daily flight into and out of Houston. About 30 minutes from Mont Tremblant in Quebec, investors have transformed a former military base into an international airport and carriers will begin offering a limited number of flights from Toronto and other cities in Ontario into the resort area in December. Taos in New Mexico is getting additional flights from Albuquerque. Meanwhile, Mammoth has received permission for a long-planned expansion of its airport. 
Though the best season-pass deals have expired, there are still some bargains to be found. Loon Mountain offers beginners a free season pass after they buy three beginner ski or snowboard lesson packages. At Taos, lift tickets and lodging will be half-price Dec. 1 to 13. The Big Mountain, in Montana, is selling lift tickets for $25 from Nov. 28 to Dec. 20, and $20 from April 1 to 13, 2003. Killington hopes to lure new skiers and riders with a free one-day lift ticket for anyone who delivers a friend to a beginner lesson. In addition, many resorts offer discounts for hotels, lift tickets, lessons and rental gear when they are booked online -- and are running sophisticated new Web sites.
Still, the sister resorts Boyne Mountain and Boyne Highlands in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan may have taken the most revolutionary step in the industry, dropping lift-ticket prices this winter, from $43 to $39. Most other areas were maintaining or raising their ticket prices, with the nation's biggest resorts flirting with the $70-a-day mark.
Even with the cleverest marketing campaigns and flashiest promotions, though, ski industry officials say the season's success will ultimately depend on what it has always depended on: snow that comes early and often. 
"Skiers are the most committed sports enthusiasts out there," said Bernie Weichsel, president of Ski USA, an international resort marketing group, adding that only a lack of good snow will keep them from pursuing their sport.
And on that front, resorts have reason to be hopeful. Early snow in the Rockies and cold temperatures in the Midwest and East have meant many resorts are planning November openings. Loveland Ski Basin in Colorado became the first area to open for the season on Oct. 17 -- two days ahead of schedule. On Oct. 25, Killington, Vt., opened, and thanks to extensive snowmaking was able to offer top-to-bottom skiing on opening day for the first time.

HEADLINE: An Animal's Place 

BYLINE:  By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author of "The Botany of Desire." His last cover article was about the beef industry.

 BODY:
The first time I opened Peter Singer's "Animal Liberation," I was dining alone at the Palm, trying to enjoy a rib-eye steak cooked medium-rare. If this sounds like a good recipe for cognitive dissonance (if not indigestion), that was sort of the idea. Preposterous as it might seem, to supporters of animal rights, what I was doing was tantamount to reading "Uncle Tom's Cabin" on a plantation in the Deep South in 1852. 
 Singer and the swelling ranks of his followers ask us to imagine a future in which people will look back on my meal, and this steakhouse, as relics of an equally backward age. Eating animals, wearing animals, experimenting on animals, killing animals for sport: all these practices, so resolutely normal to us, will be seen as the barbarities they are, and we will come to view "speciesism" -- a neologism I had encountered before only in jokes -- as a form of discrimination as indefensible as racism or anti-Semitism. 
 Even in 1975, when "Animal Liberation" was first published, Singer, an Australian philosopher now teaching at Princeton, was confident that he had the wind of history at his back. The recent civil rights past was prologue, as one liberation movement followed on the heels of another. Slowly but surely, the white man's circle of moral consideration was expanded to admit first blacks, then women, then homosexuals. In each case, a group once thought to be so different from the prevailing "we" as to be undeserving of civil rights was, after a struggle, admitted to the club. Now it was animals' turn.
That animal liberation is the logical next step in the forward march of moral progress is no longer the fringe idea it was back in 1975. A growing and increasingly influential movement of philosophers, ethicists, law professors and activists are convinced that the great moral struggle of our time will be for the rights of animals. 
So far the movement has scored some of its biggest victories in Europe. Earlier this year, Germany became the first nation to grant animals a constitutional right: the words "and animals" were added to a provision obliging the state to respect and protect the dignity of human beings. The farming of animals for fur was recently banned in England. In several European nations, sows may no longer be confined to crates nor laying hens to "battery cages" -- stacked wired cages so small the birds cannot stretch their wings. The Swiss are amending their laws to change the status of animals from "things" to "beings."
Though animals are still very much "things" in the eyes of American law, change is in the air. Thirty-seven states have recently passed laws making some forms of animal cruelty a crime, 21 of them by ballot initiative. Following protests by activists, McDonald's and Burger King forced significant improvements in the way the U.S. meat industry slaughters animals. Agribusiness and the cosmetics and apparel industries are all struggling to defuse mounting public concerns over animal welfare.
Once thought of as a left-wing concern, the movement now cuts across ideological lines. Perhaps the most eloquent recent plea on behalf of animals, a new book called "Dominion," was written by a former speechwriter for President Bush. And once outlandish ideas are finding their way into mainstream opinion. A recent Zogby poll found that 51 percent of Americans believe that primates are entitled to the same rights as human children.
What is going on here? A certain amount of cultural confusion, for one thing. For at the same time many people seem eager to extend the circle of our moral consideration to animals, in our factory farms and laboratories we are inflicting more suffering on more animals than at any time in history. One by one, science is dismantling our claims to uniqueness as a species, discovering that such things as culture, tool making, language and even possibly self-consciousness are not the exclusive domain of Homo sapiens. Yet most of the animals we kill lead lives organized very much in the spirit of Descartes, who famously claimed that animals were mere machines, incapable of thought or feeling. There's a schizoid quality to our relationship with animals, in which sentiment and brutality exist side by side. Half the dogs in America will receive Christmas presents this year, yet few of us pause to consider the miserable life of the pig -- an animal easily as intelligent as a dog -- that becomes the Christmas ham. 
We tolerate this disconnect because the life of the pig has moved out of view. When's the last time you saw a pig? (Babe doesn't count.) Except for our pets, real animals -- animals living and dying -- no longer figure in our everyday lives. Meat comes from the grocery store, where it is cut and packaged to look as little like parts of animals as possible. The disappearance of animals from our lives has opened a space in which there's no reality check, either on the sentiment or the brutality. This is pretty much where we live now, with respect to animals, and it is a space in which the Peter Singers and Frank Perdues of the world can evidently thrive equally well.
Several years ago, the English critic John Berger wrote an essay, "Why Look at Animals?" in which he suggested that the loss of everyday contact between ourselves and animals -- and specifically the loss of eye contact -- has left us deeply confused about the terms of our relationship to other species. That eye contact, always slightly uncanny, had provided a vivid daily reminder that animals were at once crucially like and unlike us; in their eyes we glimpsed something unmistakably familiar (pain, fear, tenderness) and something irretrievably alien. Upon this paradox people built a relationship in which they felt they could both honor and eat animals without looking away. But that accommodation has pretty much broken down; nowadays, it seems, we either look away or become vegetarians. For my own part, neither option seemed especially appetizing. Which might explain how I found myself reading "Animal Liberation" in a steakhouse.
This is not something I'd recommend if you're determined to continue eating meat. Combining rigorous philosophical argument with journalistic description, "Animal Liberation" is one of those rare books that demand that you either defend the way you live or change it. Because Singer is so skilled in argument, for many readers it is easier to change. His book has converted countless thousands to vegetarianism, and it didn't take long for me to see why: within a few pages, he had succeeded in throwing me on the defensive.
Singer's argument is disarmingly simple and, if you accept its premises, difficult to refute. Take the premise of equality, which most people readily accept. Yet what do we really mean by it? People are not, as a matter of fact, equal at all -- some are smarter than others, better looking, more gifted. "Equality is a moral idea," Singer points out, "not an assertion of fact." The moral idea is that everyone's interests ought to receive equal consideration, regardless of "what abilities they may possess." Fair enough; many philosophers have gone this far. But fewer have taken the next logical step. "If possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit nonhumans for the same purpose?"
This is the nub of Singer's argument, and right around here I began scribbling objections in the margin. But humans differ from animals in morally significant ways. Yes they do, Singer acknowledges, which is why we shouldn't treat pigs and children alike. Equal consideration of interests is not the same as equal treatment, he points out: children have an interest in being educated; pigs, in rooting around in the dirt. But where their interests are the same, the principle of equality demands they receive the same consideration. And the one all-important interest that we share with pigs, as with all sentient creatures, is an interest in avoiding pain. 
Here Singer quotes a famous passage from Jeremy Bentham, the 18th-century utilitarian philosopher, that is the wellspring of the animal rights movement. Bentham was writing in 1789, soon after the French colonies freed black slaves, granting them fundamental rights. "The day may come," he speculates, "when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights." Bentham then asks what characteristic entitles any being to moral consideration. "Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse?" Obviously not, since "a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant." He concludes: "The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"
Bentham here is playing a powerful card philosophers call the "argument from marginal cases," or A.M.C. for short. It goes like this: there are humans -- infants, the severely retarded, the demented -- whose mental function cannot match that of a chimpanzee. Even though these people cannot reciprocate our moral attentions, we nevertheless include them in the circle of our moral consideration. So on what basis do we exclude the chimpanzee? 
Because he's a chimp, I furiously scribbled in the margin, and they're human! For Singer that's not good enough. To exclude the chimp from moral consideration simply because he's not human is no different from excluding the slave simply because he's not white. In the same way we'd call that exclusion racist, the animal rightist contends that it is speciesist to discriminate against the chimpanzee solely because he's not human. 
But the differences between blacks and whites are trivial compared with the differences between my son and a chimp. Singer counters by asking us to imagine a hypothetical society that discriminates against people on the basis of something nontrivial -- say, intelligence. If that scheme offends our sense of equality, then why is the fact that animals lack certain human characteristics any more just as a basis for discrimination? Either we do not owe any justice to the severely retarded, he concludes, or we do owe it to animals with higher capabilities. 
This is where I put down my fork. If I believe in equality, and equality is based on interests rather than characteristics, then either I have to take the interests of the steer I'm eating into account or concede that I am a speciesist. For the time being, I decided to plead guilty as charged. I finished my steak. 
But Singer had planted a troubling notion, and in the days afterward, it grew and grew, watered by the other animal rights thinkers I began reading: the philosophers Tom Regan and James Rachels; the legal theorist Steven M. Wise; the writers Joy Williams and Matthew Scully. I didn't think I minded being a speciesist, but could it be, as several of these writers suggest, that we will someday come to regard speciesism as an evil comparable to racism? Will history someday judge us as harshly as it judges the Germans who went about their ordinary lives in the shadow of Treblinka? Precisely that question was recently posed by J.M. Coetzee, the South African novelist, in a lecture delivered at Princeton; he answered it in the affirmative. If animal rightists are right, "a crime of stupefying proportions" (in Coetzee's words) is going on all around us every day, just beneath our notice. 
It's an idea almost impossible to entertain seriously, much less to accept, and in the weeks following my restaurant face-off between Singer and the steak, I found myself marshaling whatever mental power I could muster to try to refute it. Yet Singer and his allies managed to trump almost all my objections. 
My first line of defense was obvious. Animals kill one another all the time. Why treat animals more ethically than they treat one another? (Ben Franklin tried this one long before me: during a fishing trip, he wondered, "If you eat one another, I don't see why we may not eat you." He admits, however, that the rationale didn't occur to him until the fish were in the frying pan, smelling "admirably well." The advantage of being a "reasonable creature," Franklin remarks, is that you can find a reason for whatever you want to do.) To the "they do it, too" defense, the animal rightist has a devastating reply: do you really want to base your morality on the natural order? Murder and rape are natural, too. Besides, humans don't need to kill other creatures in order to survive; animals do. (Though if my cat, Otis, is any guide, animals sometimes kill for sheer pleasure.) 
This suggests another defense. Wouldn't life in the wild be worse for these farm animals? "Defenders of slavery imposed on black Africans often made a similar point," Singer retorts. "The life of freedom is to be preferred." 
But domesticated animals can't survive in the wild; in fact, without us they wouldn't exist at all. Or as one 19th-century political philosopher put it, "The pig has a stronger interest than anyone in the demand for bacon. If all the world were Jewish, there would be no pigs at all." But it turns out that this would be fine by the animal rightists: for if pigs don't exist, they can't be wronged.
Animals on factory farms have never known any other life. Singer replies that "animals feel a need to exercise, stretch their limbs or wings, groom themselves and turn around, whether or not they have ever lived in conditions that permit this." The measure of their suffering is not their prior experiences but the unremitting daily frustration of their instincts.
O.K., the suffering of animals is a legitimate problem, but the world is full of problems, and surely human problems must come first! Sounds good, and yet all the animal people are asking me to do is to stop eating meat and wearing animal furs and hides. There's no reason I can't devote myself to solving humankind's problems while being a vegetarian who wears synthetics.
But doesn't the fact that we could choose to forgo meat for moral reasons point to a crucial moral difference between animals and humans? As Kant pointed out, the human being is the only moral animal, the only one even capable of entertaining a concept of "rights." What's wrong with reserving moral consideration for those able to reciprocate it? Right here is where you run smack into the A.M.C.: the moral status of the retarded, the insane, the infant and the Alzheimer's patient. Such "marginal cases," in the detestable argot of modern moral philosophy, cannot participate in moral decision making any more than a monkey can, yet we nevertheless grant them rights. 
That's right, I respond, for the simple reason that they're one of us. And all of us have been, and will probably once again be, marginal cases ourselves. What's more, these people have fathers and mothers, daughters and sons, which makes our interest in their welfare deeper than our interest in the welfare of even the most brilliant ape. 
Alas, none of these arguments evade the charge of speciesism; the racist, too, claims that it's natural to give special consideration to one's own kind. A utilitarian like Singer would agree, however, that the feelings of relatives do count for something. Yet the principle of equal consideration of interests demands that, given the choice between performing a painful medical experiment on a severely retarded orphan and on a normal ape, we must sacrifice the child. Why? Because the ape has a greater capacity for pain.
Here in a nutshell is the problem with the A.M.C.: it can be used to help the animals, but just as often it winds up hurting the marginal cases. Giving up our speciesism will bring us to a moral cliff from which we may not be prepared to jump, even when logic is pushing us. 
And yet this isn't the moral choice I am being asked to make. (Too bad; it would be so much easier!) In everyday life, the choice is not between babies and chimps but between the pork and the tofu. Even if we reject the "hard utilitarianism" of a Peter Singer, there remains the question of whether we owe animals that can feel pain any moral consideration, and this seems impossible to deny. And if we do owe them moral consideration, how can we justify eating them?
This is why killing animals for meat (and clothing) poses the most difficult animal rights challenge. In the case of animal testing, all but the most radical animal rightists are willing to balance the human benefit against the cost to the animals. That's because the unique qualities of human consciousness carry weight in the utilitarian calculus: human pain counts for more than that of a mouse, since our pain is amplified by emotions like dread; similarly, our deaths are worse than an animal's because we understand what death is in a way they don't. So the argument over animal testing is really in the details: is this particular procedure or test really necessary to save human lives? (Very often it's not, in which case we probably shouldn't do it.) But if humans no longer need to eat meat or wear skins, then what exactly are we putting on the human side of the scale to outweigh the interests of the animal? 
I suspect that this is finally why the animal people managed to throw me on the defensive. It's one thing to choose between the chimp and the retarded child or to accept the sacrifice of all those pigs surgeons practiced on to develop heart-bypass surgery. But what happens when the choice is between "a lifetime of suffering for a nonhuman animal and the gastronomic preference of a human being?" You look away -- or you stop eating animals. And if you don't want to do either? Then you have to try to determine if the animals you're eating have really endured "a lifetime of suffering."
Whether our interest in eating animals outweighs their interest in not being eaten (assuming for the moment that is their interest) turns on the vexed question of animal suffering. Vexed, because it is impossible to know what really goes on in the mind of a cow or a pig or even an ape. Strictly speaking, this is true of other humans, too, but since humans are all basically wired the same way, we have excellent reason to assume that other people's experience of pain feels much like our own. Can we say that about animals? Yes and no. 
I have yet to find anyone who still subscribes to Descartes's belief that animals cannot feel pain because they lack a soul. The general consensus among scientists and philosophers is that when it comes to pain, the higher animals are wired much like we are for the same evolutionary reasons, so we should take the writhings of the kicked dog at face value. Indeed, the very premise of a great deal of animal testing -- the reason it has value -- is that animals' experience of physical and even some psychological pain closely resembles our own. Otherwise, why would cosmetics testers drip chemicals into the eyes of rabbits to see if they sting? Why would researchers study head trauma by traumatizing chimpanzee heads? Why would psychologists attempt to induce depression and "learned helplessness" in dogs by exposing them to ceaseless random patterns of electrical shock? 
That said, it can be argued that human pain differs from animal pain by an order of magnitude. This qualitative difference is largely the result of our possession of language and, by virtue of language, an ability to have thoughts about thoughts and to imagine alternatives to our current reality. The philosopher Daniel C. Dennett suggests that we would do well to draw a distinction between pain, which a great many animals experience, and suffering, which depends on a degree of self-consciousness only a few animals appear to command. Suffering in this view is not just lots of pain but pain intensified by human emotions like loss, sadness, worry, regret, self-pity, shame, humiliation and dread.
Consider castration. No one would deny the procedure is painful to animals, yet animals appear to get over it in a way humans do not. (Some rhesus monkeys competing for mates will bite off a rival's testicle; the very next day the victim may be observed mating, seemingly little the worse for wear.) Surely the suffering of a man able to comprehend the full implications of castration, to anticipate the event and contemplate its aftermath, represents an agony of another order. 
By the same token, however, language and all that comes with it can also make certain kinds of pain more bearable. A trip to the dentist would be a torment for an ape that couldn't be made to understand the purpose and duration of the procedure. 
As humans contemplating the pain and suffering of animals, we do need to guard against projecting on to them what the same experience would feel like to us. Watching a steer force-marched up the ramp to the kill-floor door, as I have done, I need to remind myself that this is not Sean Penn in "Dead Man Walking," that in a bovine brain the concept of nonexistence is blissfully absent. "If we fail to find suffering in the animal lives we can see," Dennett writes in "Kinds of Minds," "we can rest assured there is no invisible suffering somewhere in their brains. If we find suffering, we will recognize it without difficulty." 
Which brings us -- reluctantly, necessarily -- to the American factory farm, the place where all such distinctions turn to dust. It's not easy to draw lines between pain and suffering in a modern egg or confinement hog operation. These are places where the subtleties of moral philosophy and animal cognition mean less than nothing, where everything we've learned about animals at least since Darwin has been simply . . . set aside. To visit a modern CAFO (Confined Animal Feeding Operation) is to enter a world that, for all its technological sophistication, is still designed according to Cartesian principles: animals are machines incapable of feeling pain. Since no thinking person can possibly believe this any more, industrial animal agriculture depends on a suspension of disbelief on the part of the people who operate it and a willingness to avert your eyes on the part of everyone else.
From everything I've read, egg and hog operations are the worst. Beef cattle in America at least still live outdoors, albeit standing ankle deep in their own waste eating a diet that makes them sick. And broiler chickens, although they do get their beaks snipped off with a hot knife to keep them from cannibalizing one another under the stress of their confinement, at least don't spend their eight-week lives in cages too small to ever stretch a wing. That fate is reserved for the American laying hen, who passes her brief span piled together with a half-dozen other hens in a wire cage whose floor a single page of this magazine could carpet. Every natural instinct of this animal is thwarted, leading to a range of behavioral "vices" that can include cannibalizing her cagemates and rubbing her body against the wire mesh until it is featherless and bleeding. Pain? Suffering? Madness? The operative suspension of disbelief depends on more neutral descriptors, like "vices" and "stress." Whatever you want to call what's going on in those cages, the 10 percent or so of hens that can't bear it and simply die is built into the cost of production. And when the output of the others begins to ebb, the hens will be "force-molted" -- starved of food and water and light for several days in order to stimulate a final bout of egg laying before their life's work is done.
Simply reciting these facts, most of which are drawn from poultry-trade magazines, makes me sound like one of those animal people, doesn't it? I don't mean to, but this is what can happen when . . . you look. It certainly wasn't my intention to ruin anyone's breakfast. But now that I probably have spoiled the eggs, I do want to say one thing about the bacon, mention a single practice (by no means the worst) in modern hog production that points to the compound madness of an impeccable industrial logic. 
Piglets in confinement operations are weaned from their mothers 10 days after birth (compared with 13 weeks in nature) because they gain weight faster on their hormone- and antibiotic-fortified feed. This premature weaning leaves the pigs with a lifelong craving to suck and chew, a desire they gratify in confinement by biting the tail of the animal in front of them. A normal pig would fight off his molester, but a demoralized pig has stopped caring. "Learned helplessness" is the psychological term, and it's not uncommon in confinement operations, where tens of thousands of hogs spend their entire lives ignorant of sunshine or earth or straw, crowded together beneath a metal roof upon metal slats suspended over a manure pit. So it's not surprising that an animal as sensitive and intelligent as a pig would get depressed, and a depressed pig will allow his tail to be chewed on to the point of infection. Sick pigs, being underperforming "production units," are clubbed to death on the spot. The U.S.D.A.'s recommended solution to the problem is called "tail docking." Using a pair of pliers (and no anesthetic), most but not all of the tail is snipped off. Why the little stump? Because the whole point of the exercise is not to remove the object of tail-biting so much as to render it more sensitive. Now, a bite on the tail is so painful that even the most demoralized pig will mount a struggle to avoid it. 
Much of this description is drawn from "Dominion," Matthew Scully's recent book in which he offers a harrowing description of a North Carolina hog operation. Scully, a Christian conservative, has no patience for lefty rights talk, arguing instead that while God did give man "dominion" over animals ("Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you"), he also admonished us to show them mercy. "We are called to treat them with kindness, not because they have rights or power or some claim to equality but . . . because they stand unequal and powerless before us." 
Scully calls the contemporary factory farm "our own worst nightmare" and, to his credit, doesn't shrink from naming the root cause of this evil: unfettered capitalism. (Perhaps this explains why he resigned from the Bush administration just before his book's publication.) A tension has always existed between the capitalist imperative to maximize efficiency and the moral imperatives of religion or community, which have historically served as a counterweight to the moral blindness of the market. This is one of "the cultural contradictions of capitalism" -- the tendency of the economic impulse to erode the moral underpinnings of society. Mercy toward animals is one such casualty.
More than any other institution, the American industrial animal farm offers a nightmarish glimpse of what capitalism can look like in the absence of moral or regulatory constraint. Here in these places life itself is redefined -- as protein production -- and with it suffering. That venerable word becomes "stress," an economic problem in search of a cost-effective solution, like tail-docking or beak-clipping or, in the industry's latest plan, by simply engineering the "stress gene" out of pigs and chickens. "Our own worst nightmare" such a place may well be; it is also real life for the billions of animals unlucky enough to have been born beneath these grim steel roofs, into the brief, pitiless life of a "production unit" in the days before the suffering gene was found.
Vegetarianism doesn't seem an unreasonable response to such an evil. Who would want to be made complicit in the agony of these animals by eating them? You want to throw something against the walls of those infernal sheds, whether it's the Bible, a new constitutional right or a whole platoon of animal rightists bent on breaking in and liberating the inmates. In the shadow of these factory farms, Coetzee's notion of a "stupefying crime" doesn't seem far-fetched at all.
But before you swear off meat entirely, let me describe a very different sort of animal farm. It is typical of nothing, and yet its very existence puts the whole moral question of animal agriculture in a different light. Polyface Farm occupies 550 acres of rolling grassland and forest in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Here, Joel Salatin and his family raise six different food animals -- cattle, pigs, chickens, rabbits, turkeys and sheep -- in an intricate dance of symbiosis designed to allow each species, in Salatin's words, "to fully express its physiological distinctiveness." 
What this means in practice is that Salatin's chickens live like chickens; his cows, like cows; pigs, pigs. As in nature, where birds tend to follow herbivores, once Salatin's cows have finished grazing a pasture, he moves them out and tows in his "eggmobile," a portable chicken coop that houses several hundred laying hens -- roughly the natural size of a flock. The hens fan out over the pasture, eating the short grass and picking insect larvae out of the cowpats -- all the while spreading the cow manure and eliminating the farm's parasite problem. A diet of grubs and grass makes for exceptionally tasty eggs and contented chickens, and their nitrogenous manure feeds the pasture. A few weeks later, the chickens move out, and the sheep come in, dining on the lush new growth, as well as on the weed species (nettles, nightshade) that the cattle and chickens won't touch. 
Meanwhile, the pigs are in the barn turning the compost. All winter long, while the cattle were indoors, Salatin layered their manure with straw, wood chips -- and corn. By March, this steaming compost layer cake stands three feet high, and the pigs, whose powerful snouts can sniff out and retrieve the fermented corn at the bottom, get to spend a few happy weeks rooting through the pile, aerating it as they work. All you can see of these pigs, intently nosing out the tasty alcoholic morsels, are their upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails churning the air. The finished compost will go to feed the grass; the grass, the cattle; the cattle, the chickens; and eventually all of these animals will feed us. 
I thought a lot about vegetarianism and animal rights during the day I spent on Joel Salatin's extraordinary farm. So much of what I'd read, so much of what I'd accepted, looked very different from here. To many animal rightists, even Polyface Farm is a death camp. But to look at these animals is to see this for the sentimental conceit it is. In the same way that we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and here I was seeing it in abundance.
For any animal, happiness seems to consist in the opportunity to express its creaturely character -- its essential pigness or wolfness or chickenness. Aristotle speaks of each creature's "characteristic form of life." For domesticated species, the good life, if we can call it that, cannot be achieved apart from humans -- apart from our farms and, therefore, our meat eating. This, it seems to me, is where animal rightists betray a profound ignorance about the workings of nature. To think of domestication as a form of enslavement or even exploitation is to misconstrue the whole relationship, to project a human idea of power onto what is, in fact, an instance of mutualism between species. Domestication is an evolutionary, rather than a political, development. It is certainly not a regime humans imposed on animals some 10,000 years ago. 
Rather, domestication happened when a small handful of especially opportunistic species discovered through Darwinian trial and error that they were more likely to survive and prosper in an alliance with humans than on their own. Humans provided the animals with food and protection, in exchange for which the animals provided the humans their milk and eggs and -- yes -- their flesh. Both parties were transformed by the relationship: animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves (evolution tends to edit out unneeded traits), and the humans gave up their hunter-gatherer ways for the settled life of agriculturists. (Humans changed biologically, too, evolving such new traits as a tolerance for lactose as adults.) 
From the animals' point of view, the bargain with humanity has been a great success, at least until our own time. Cows, pigs, dogs, cats and chickens have thrived, while their wild ancestors have languished. (There are 10,000 wolves in North America, 50,000,000 dogs.) Nor does their loss of autonomy seem to trouble these creatures. It is wrong, the rightists say, to treat animals as "means" rather than "ends," yet the happiness of a working animal like the dog consists precisely in serving as a "means." Liberation is the last thing such a creature wants. To say of one of Joel Salatin's caged chickens that "the life of freedom is to be preferred" betrays an ignorance about chicken preferences -- which on this farm are heavily focused on not getting their heads bitten off by weasels. 
But haven't these chickens simply traded one predator for another -- weasels for humans? True enough, and for the chickens this is probably not a bad deal. For brief as it is, the life expectancy of a farm animal would be considerably briefer in the world beyond the pasture fence or chicken coop. A sheep farmer told me that a bear will eat a lactating ewe alive, starting with her udders. "As a rule," he explained, "animals don't get 'good deaths' surrounded by their loved ones." 
The very existence of predation -- animals eating animals -- is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in animal rights circles. "It must be admitted," Singer writes, "that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problem for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it." Some animal rightists train their dogs and cats to become vegetarians. (Note: cats will require nutritional supplements to stay healthy.) Matthew Scully calls predation "the intrinsic evil in nature's design . . . among the hardest of all things to fathom." Really? A deep Puritan streak pervades animal rights activists, an abiding discomfort not only with our animality, but with the animals' animality too. 
However it may appear to us, predation is not a matter of morality or politics; it, also, is a matter of symbiosis. Hard as the wolf may be on the deer he eats, the herd depends on him for its well-being; without predators to cull the herd, deer overrun their habitat and starve. In many places, human hunters have taken over the predator's ecological role. Chickens also depend for their continued well-being on their human predators -- not individual chickens, but chickens as a species. The surest way to achieve the extinction of the chicken would be to grant chickens a "right to life."
Yet here's the rub: the animal rightist is not concerned with species, only individuals. Tom Regan, author of "The Case for Animal Rights," bluntly asserts that because "species are not individuals . . . the rights view does not recognize the moral rights of species to anything, including survival." Singer concurs, insisting that only sentient individuals have interests. But surely a species can have interests -- in its survival, say -- just as a nation or community or a corporation can. The animal rights movement's exclusive concern with individual animals makes perfect sense given its roots in a culture of liberal individualism, but does it make any sense in nature? 
In 1611 Juan da Goma (aka Juan the Disoriented) made accidental landfall on Wrightson Island, a six-square-mile rock in the Indian Ocean. The island's sole distinction is as the only known home of the Arcania tree and the bird that nests in it, the Wrightson giant sea sparrow. Da Goma and his crew stayed a week, much of that time spent in a failed bid to recapture the ship's escaped goat -- who happened to be pregnant. Nearly four centuries later, Wrightson Island is home to 380 goats that have consumed virtually every scrap of vegetation in their reach. The youngest Arcania tree on the island is more than 300 years old, and only 52 sea sparrows remain. In the animal rights view, any one of those goats have at least as much right to life as the last Wrightson sparrow on earth, and the trees, because they are not sentient, warrant no moral consideration whatsoever. (In the mid-80's a British environmental group set out to shoot the goats, but was forced to cancel the expedition after the Mammal Liberation Front bombed its offices.)
The story of Wrightson Island (recounted by the biologist David Ehrenfeld in "Beginning Again") suggests at the very least that a human morality based on individual rights makes for an awkward fit when applied to the natural world. This should come as no surprise: morality is an artifact of human culture, devised to help us negotiate social relations. It's very good for that. But just as we recognize that nature doesn't provide an adequate guide for human social conduct, isn't it anthropocentric to assume that our moral system offers an adequate guide for nature? We may require a different set of ethics to guide our dealings with the natural world, one as well suited to the particular needs of plants and animals and habitats (where sentience counts for little) as rights suit us humans today. 
To contemplate such questions from the vantage of a farm is to appreciate just how parochial and urban an ideology animals rights really is. It could thrive only in a world where people have lost contact with the natural world, where animals no longer pose a threat to us and human mastery of nature seems absolute. "In our normal life," Singer writes, "there is no serious clash of interests between human and nonhuman animals." Such a statement assumes a decidedly urbanized "normal life," one that certainly no farmer would recognize. 
The farmer would point out that even vegans have a "serious clash of interests" with other animals. The grain that the vegan eats is harvested with a combine that shreds field mice, while the farmer's tractor crushes woodchucks in their burrows, and his pesticides drop songbirds from the sky. Steve Davis, an animal scientist at Oregon State University, has estimated that if America were to adopt a strictly vegetarian diet, the total number of animals killed every year would actually increase, as animal pasture gave way to row crops. Davis contends that if our goal is to kill as few animals as possible, then people should eat the largest possible animal that can live on the least intensively cultivated land: grass-fed beef for everybody. It would appear that killing animals is unavoidable no matter what we choose to eat.
When I talked to Joel Salatin about the vegetarian utopia, he pointed out that it would also condemn him and his neighbors to importing their food from distant places, since the Shenandoah Valley receives too little rainfall to grow many row crops. Much the same would hold true where I live, in New England. We get plenty of rain, but the hilliness of the land has dictated an agriculture based on animals since the time of the Pilgrims. The world is full of places where the best, if not the only, way to obtain food from the land is by grazing animals on it -- especially ruminants, which alone can transform grass into protein and whose presence can actually improve the health of the land. 
The vegetarian utopia would make us even more dependent than we already are on an industrialized national food chain. That food chain would in turn be even more dependent than it already is on fossil fuels and chemical fertilizer, since food would need to travel farther and manure would be in short supply. Indeed, it is doubtful that you can build a more sustainable agriculture without animals to cycle nutrients and support local food production. If our concern is for the health of nature -- rather than, say, the internal consistency of our moral code or the condition of our souls -- then eating animals may sometimes be the most ethical thing to do. 
There is, too, the fact that we humans have been eating animals as long as we have lived on this earth. Humans may not need to eat meat in order to survive, yet doing so is part of our evolutionary heritage, reflected in the design of our teeth and the structure of our digestion. Eating meat helped make us what we are, in a social and biological sense. Under the pressure of the hunt, the human brain grew in size and complexity, and around the fire where the meat was cooked, human culture first flourished. Granting rights to animals may lift us up from the brutal world of predation, but it will entail the sacrifice of part of our identity -- our own animality. 
Surely this is one of the odder paradoxes of animal rights doctrine. It asks us to recognize all that we share with animals and then demands that we act toward them in a most unanimalistic way. Whether or not this is a good idea, we should at least acknowledge that our desire to eat meat is not a trivial matter, no mere "gastronomic preference." We might as well call sex -- also now technically unnecessary -- a mere "recreational preference." Whatever else it is, our meat eating is something very deep indeed. 
Are any of these good enough reasons to eat animals? I'm mindful of Ben Franklin's definition of the reasonable creature as one who can come up with reasons for whatever he wants to do. So I decided I would track down Peter Singer and ask him what he thought. In an e-mail message, I described Polyface and asked him about the implications for his position of the Good Farm -- one where animals got to live according to their nature and to all appearances did not suffer. 
"I agree with you that it is better for these animals to have lived and died than not to have lived at all," Singer wrote back. Since the utilitarian is concerned exclusively with the sum of happiness and suffering and the slaughter of an animal that doesn't comprehend that death need not involve suffering, the Good Farm adds to the total of animal happiness, provided you replace the slaughtered animal with a new one. However, he added, this line of thinking doesn't obviate the wrongness of killing an animal that "has a sense of its own existence over time and can have preferences for its own future." In other words, it's O.K. to eat the chicken, but he's not so sure about the pig. Yet, he wrote, "I would not be sufficiently confident of my arguments to condemn someone who purchased meat from one of these farms." 
Singer went on to express serious doubts that such farms could be practical on a large scale, since the pressures of the marketplace will lead their owners to cut costs and corners at the expense of the animals. He suggested, too, that killing animals is not conducive to treating them with respect. Also, since humanely raised food will be more expensive, only the well-to-do can afford morally defensible animal protein. These are important considerations, but they don't alter my essential point: what's wrong with animal agriculture -- with eating animals -- is the practice, not the principle. 
What this suggests to me is that people who care should be working not for animal rights but animal welfare -- to ensure that farm animals don't suffer and that their deaths are swift and painless. In fact, the decent-life-merciful-death line is how Jeremy Bentham justified his own meat eating. Yes, the philosophical father of animal rights was himself a carnivore. In a passage rather less frequently quoted by animal rightists, Bentham defended eating animals on the grounds that "we are the better for it, and they are never the worse. . . . The death they suffer in our hands commonly is, and always may be, a speedier and, by that means, a less painful one than that which would await them in the inevitable course of nature." 
My guess is that Bentham never looked too closely at what happens in a slaughterhouse, but the argument suggests that, in theory at least, a utilitarian can justify the killing of humanely treated animals -- for meat or, presumably, for clothing. (Though leather and fur pose distinct moral problems. Leather is a byproduct of raising domestic animals for food, which can be done humanely. However, furs are usually made from wild animals that die brutal deaths -- usually in leg-hold traps -- and since most fur species aren't domesticated, raising them on farms isn't necessarily more humane.) But whether the issue is food or fur or hunting, what should concern us is the suffering, not the killing. All of which I was feeling pretty good about -- until I remembered that utilitarians can also justify killing retarded orphans. Killing just isn't the problem for them that it is for other people, including me.
During my visit to Polyface Farm, I asked Salatin where his animals were slaughtered. He does the chickens and rabbits right on the farm, and would do the cattle, pigs and sheep there too if only the U.S.D.A. would let him. Salatin showed me the open-air abattoir he built behind the farmhouse -- a sort of outdoor kitchen on a concrete slab, with stainless-steel sinks, scalding tanks, a feather-plucking machine and metal cones to hold the birds upside down while they're being bled. Processing chickens is not a pleasant job, but Salatin insists on doing it himself because he's convinced he can do it more humanely and cleanly than any processing plant. He slaughters every other Saturday through the summer. Anyone's welcome to watch. 
I asked Salatin how he could bring himself to kill a chicken. 
"People have a soul; animals don't," he said. "It's a bedrock belief of mine." Salatin is a devout Christian. "Unlike us, animals are not created in God's image, so when they die, they just die." 
The notion that only in modern times have people grown uneasy about killing animals is a flattering conceit. Taking a life is momentous, and people have been working to justify the slaughter of animals for thousands of years. Religion and especially ritual has played a crucial part in helping us reckon the moral costs. Native Americans and other hunter-gathers would give thanks to their prey for giving up its life so the eater might live (sort of like saying grace). Many cultures have offered sacrificial animals to the gods, perhaps as a way to convince themselves that it was the gods' desires that demanded the slaughter, not their own. In ancient Greece, the priests responsible for the slaughter (priests! -- now we entrust the job to minimum-wage workers) would sprinkle holy water on the sacrificial animal's brow. The beast would promptly shake its head, and this was taken as a sign of assent. Slaughter doesn't necessarily preclude respect. For all these people, it was the ceremony that allowed them to look, then to eat.
Apart from a few surviving religious practices, we no longer have any rituals governing the slaughter or eating of animals, which perhaps helps to explain why we find ourselves where we do, feeling that our only choice is to either look away or give up meat. Frank Perdue is happy to serve the first customer; Peter Singer, the second. 
Until my visit to Polyface Farm, I had assumed these were the only two options. But on Salatin's farm, the eye contact between people and animals whose loss John Berger mourned is still a fact of life -- and of death, for neither the lives nor the deaths of these animals have been secreted behind steel walls. "Food with a face," Salatin likes to call what he's selling, a slogan that probably scares off some customers. People see very different things when they look into the eyes of a pig or a chicken or a steer -- a being without a soul, a "subject of a life" entitled to rights, a link in a food chain, a vessel for pain and pleasure, a tasty lunch. But figuring out what we do think, and what we can eat, might begin with the looking. 
We certainly won't philosophize our way to an answer. Salatin told me the story of a man who showed up at the farm one Saturday morning. When Salatin noticed a PETA bumper sticker on the man's car, he figured he was in for it. But the man had a different agenda. He explained that after 16 years as a vegetarian, he had decided that the only way he could ever eat meat again was if he killed the animal himself. He had come to look.
"Ten minutes later we were in the processing shed with a chicken," Salatin recalled. "He slit the bird's throat and watched it die. He saw that the animal did not look at him accusingly, didn't do a Disney double take. The animal had been treated with respect when it was alive, and he saw that it could also have a respectful death -- that it wasn't being treated as a pile of protoplasm." 
Salatin's open-air abattoir is a morally powerful idea. Someone slaughtering a chicken in a place where he can be watched is apt to do it scrupulously, with consideration for the animal as well as for the eater. This is going to sound quixotic, but maybe all we need to do to redeem industrial animal agriculture in this country is to pass a law requiring that the steel and concrete walls of the CAFO's and slaughterhouses be replaced with . . . glass. If there's any new "right" we need to establish, maybe it's this one: the right to look. 
No doubt the sight of some of these places would turn many people into vegetarians. Many others would look elsewhere for their meat, to farmers like Salatin. There are more of them than I would have imagined. Despite the relentless consolidation of the American meat industry, there has been a revival of small farms where animals still live their "characteristic form of life." I'm thinking of the ranches where cattle still spend their lives on grass, the poultry farms where chickens still go outside and the hog farms where pigs live as they did 50 years ago -- in contact with the sun, the earth and the gaze of a farmer.
For my own part, I've discovered that if you're willing to make the effort, it's entirely possible to limit the meat you eat to nonindustrial animals. I'm tempted to think that we need a new dietary category, to go with the vegan and lactovegetarian and piscatorian. I don't have a catchy name for it yet (humanocarnivore?), but this is the only sort of meat eating I feel comfortable with these days. I've become the sort of shopper who looks for labels indicating that his meat and eggs have been humanely grown (the American Humane Association's new "Free Farmed" label seems to be catching on), who visits the farms where his chicken and pork come from and who asks kinky-sounding questions about touring slaughterhouses. I've actually found a couple of small processing plants willing to let a customer onto the kill floor, including one, in Cannon Falls, Minn., with a glass abattoir.
The industrialization -- and dehumanization -- of American animal farming is a relatively new, evitable and local phenomenon: no other country raises and slaughters its food animals quite as intensively or as brutally as we do. Were the walls of our meat industry to become transparent, literally or even figuratively, we would not long continue to do it this way. Tail-docking and sow crates and beak-clipping would disappear overnight, and the days of slaughtering 400 head of cattle an hour would come to an end. For who could stand the sight? Yes, meat would get more expensive. We'd probably eat less of it, too, but maybe when we did eat animals, we'd eat them with the consciousness, ceremony and respect they deserve.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 10 about animal rights referred erroneously to an island in the Indian Ocean and to events there involving goats and endangered giant sea sparrows that could possibly lead to the killing of goats by environmental groups. Wrightson Island does not exist; both the island and the events are hypothetical figments from a book (also mentioned in the article), "Beginning Again," by David Ehrenfeld. No giant sea sparrow is known to be endangered by the eating habits of goats.

The Social Graces As a Business Tool

BYLINE:  By TANYA MOHN 

 BODY:
AT a formal dinner a couple of years ago, Dr. David C. Jones, the president and chief executive of the InCharge Institute, a credit counseling company in Orlando, Fla., was appalled at the table manners of several of his senior managers.
 "They took bread and dipped it in the soup," he said. "I was very embarrassed by that." 
 Soon, InCharge made etiquette classes mandatory for all executives. And last week, 16 of them completed their training at the company's second etiquette seminar, organized by the Protocol School of Palm Beach. That brought InCharge's total number of graduates to 45.
"It's well worth the investment -- it pays back in spades," Dr. Jones said.
He has learned a few things at the classes himself. For important business lunches and dinners, he now arrives early at the restaurant and pays for the meal in advance rather than signing the credit-card bill in front of everybody.
Jacqueline Whitmore, the founder of the Protocol School, says that her business etiquette programs have grown by 50 percent during the last few years. Other etiquette experts report a similar resurgence, which they attribute to several factors: the global economy's demands on executives to be sensitive to foreign cultures, the decline in human interaction in the high-tech workplace and the social ineptitude of younger managers who grew up in households where proper manners were not encouraged.
In Ms. Whitmore's one-day sessions, participants learn about many etiquette topics, from the right way to enter a room to the dying art of hand-written notes: "An e-mail is just not going to cut it," she said. (Another new-technology mistake is gabbing on a cellphone during a business lunch.)
She also teaches how to handle silverware, how to make a toast, how to cope with spilling wine and how to play the roles of host and guest of honor.
To be sure, some people who go through the training are skeptical.
"I'm 38 years old; I think I know how to use a fork," said Beth Viney, a senior account executive at TDS Telecom in Madison, Wis., which has put sales and service managers and executives through Ms. Whitmore's program. "Do I really need to sit for eight hours when I could be out generating revenues?"
Even so, she acknowledges that because of the course she took in September, she now knows that she is supposed to sit down and get up at the right side of her chair at a formal luncheon. And she has memorized the rules for shaking hands: extend your hand with the thumb up, clasp the other person's entire palm, give two or three pumps from the elbow, avoiding both the painful "bone crusher" and the off-putting "wet fish" moves, and look at the person directly in the eyes, never below the chin. She has also abandoned her old "Midwest scoop-and-shovel" eating style, she says.
"I hope I will project a more polished image to customers," she said.
WENDY LANG, a manager of corporate events at the Dana Corporation in Toledo, Ohio, enrolled in a business etiquette class to help her adjust to the corporate world after working in the more laid-back nonprofit sector. "When I stepped into corporate America," she said, "it was just a different mind-set."
She began reading about etiquette and recently completed a course with Ms. Whitmore, learning the art of introductions (the person with a lesser title is presented to a person with a higher rank or title) and how to accept a business card (give it respect; do not just glance at it and stick it in your pocket).
"These are all skills we all think we have, but do not," Ms. Lang said. "It's not an option; it's a necessity."
Ms. Lang subscribes to Executive Advantage, the newsletter put out by Letitia Baldrige, the manners expert who was Jacqueline Kennedy's chief of staff in the White House, and says office colleagues clamor for it when she is finished.
When "Letitia Baldrige's New Complete Guide to Executive Manners" (Scribner) was originally published in 1980, "heads of corporations said, 'We don't need this,' " Ms. Baldrige recalled, adding that they were embarrassed to discuss it.
Today, she said, "C.E.O.'s are well aware of problems; they have lost business as a result." 
Some business schools, including Florida International University's Chapman Graduate School of Business and North Carolina Central University's School of Business, have made etiquette training a part of the curriculum. Alinda Lewris, the chief executive of the International Association of Protocol Consultants, says the business etiquette industry has had huge growth.
Statistics are hard to come by, but Dorothea Johnson, the founder of the Protocol School of Washington, who has been in the manners business for more than 40 years and by her count has trained more than 50,000 people, says there is no question that the business has expanded.
"I have never seen anything like the hunger there is today," she said. "I'm hearing more and more from top executives that the people skills are very important, in many cases more important than the technical skills."
YET most young executives are technology whizzes with abysmal social skills, she said. That is unfortunate, she added, because correct behavior can land a deal.
Much of her focus today is on training more instructors, as more companies use in-house protocol officers. Wendy Jones, a senior manager for external relations at Boeing, is one of five employees who has completed Ms. Johnson's professional course.
"The opportunity for blunder is great," Ms. Jones said. "Try telling a 45-year-old man he is using the wrong fork, or to stop blowing his nose in a napkin, or to tell ladies not to put lipstick on at the table. It has to be worked into very delicately."

Making Good on a Promise of New Listeners

BYLINE:  By Anthony Tommasini

 BODY:
GEORGE STEEL, the executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University, is passionate on the subject of enticing new audiences into the concert hall. And unlike most of his counterparts at American orchestras, opera companies and chamber ensembles, who just talk about it, Mr. Steel has actually done it.
 In fairness, the 700-seat Miller Theater is rather easier to fill than the 2,700-seat Avery Fisher Hall, and the fact that it is on a university campus doesn't hurt. Still, Mr. Steel, 35, is onto something. His programming is rooted in his conviction that young people naturally inclined to new films and new pop groups will similarly be drawn to contemporary concert music. 
 Under his leadership, since 1998, the Miller Theater has become a hotbed of modern fare: not just novelty events, like a Dec. 13 program of songs by the British rock band Radiohead transcribed for solo piano and performed by Christopher O'Riley, but formidable programs, like the recent marathon of Elliott Carter's five string quartets, astoundingly complex and difficult works performed with exciting authority by the Pacifica String Quartet. Yet the hall was nearly filled, and fresh-faced young people who would have fit right in at CBGB were everywhere.
The theater was completely sold out for an earlier concert of works by David Lang, who has built a following as a founding director of the hip Bang on a Can enterprise. But even a program of works by Lee Hyla, a powerfully original Boston-based composer without much recognition in New York, drew a fair-sized audience a few nights later.
Mr. Steel's belief in the drawing power of contemporary music contradicts what most consultants seem to be telling beleaguered American orchestras, where executives, long rattled by the graying of classical music audiences, are now grappling with the dismal economy as well. Yet it's not just the timid programming of most mainstream ensembles that is counterproductive, Mr. Steel asserts.
"The very way all music is typically presented," he said recently, "gives the idea that a long mandatory preparation period is required, during which you have to ingest a collected canon of works before you may listen to something you've found on your own." This "superhigh threshold," he said, turns away potential concertgoers.
In addition, he said, we are still recovering from a lot of "dissembling about contemporary music" during the 60's and 70's. Faced with audiences that found much modern music tuneless, dissonant and incomprehensible, composers and presenters argued that such perceptions would change with sufficient preparation and exposure.
"It's much better to be honest," Mr. Steel explained, "to say, 'Wow, this stuff really is raucous, pointy and gnarly.' " When you tell people something that accords with what they hear, he added, "they feel permission to hear it however they do." Mr. Steel points to listeners at the Miller Theater who seem overjoyed to be part of a concert where "everyone is at the same starting point."
Art museums figured this out long ago. As a college student, I knew next to nothing about Abstract Expressionism. Yet I was drawn to a Willem de Kooning retrospective in New York that somehow seemed cool. I remember being confounded, moved, stirred up and altogether fascinated by what I saw. Why shouldn't new audiences be encouraged to have the same range of reactions to a concert of Carter or the violinist Jennifer Koh's "New York Hardcore" program at the Miller on Dec. 5?
Trying to account for the attractiveness of Mr. Steel's programming to new audiences, I've come to think that amplification plays a role. Say what you will, electronics are increasingly common in all contemporary music. Rock fans settle in comfortably when they see a stageful of loudspeakers at the Miller Theater.
Call me retro, but I would be sorry if these new listeners grew to expect amplification every time they entered a concert hall. Already, too many composers just flick on the amplifiers out of habit. Mr. Lang's program, for example, ended with "The Passing Measures," a slow, subdued and intentionally static work, essentially a shimmering consonant chord sustained for 45 minutes while quiet inner motifs dart about. The stage was crowded with instrumentalists and vocalists making the softest possible sounds. Yet all the performers were amplified, the idea being to draw listeners closely into the act of producing quiet music. But even discreet amplification thrusts sound outward. I kept imagining how much more contemplative the music would have been had Mr. Lang pulled the plug on the sound system and forced his audience to lean in and focus.
I should add that Mr. Steel doesn't really buy my theory that amplification is an inducement to young listeners, though he maintains that the crucial relationship between a performance and a performance space is often taken for granted by concert presenters. He is fascinated to see how Pierre Boulez's "Repons," which was designed to surround the audience with live electronics that combine instrumental and synthetic sounds, will fare at Carnegie Hall in March. The plan is to cover the floor seats with a platform and turn the hall into a makeshift electronic music studio.
Alas, on that night Mr. Steel will be conducting Bach's Mass in B minor with the Vox Vocal Ensemble, which he directs, at St. Paul's Chapel on the Columbia campus. Early music is his other passion. Ever heard of Robert Parsons? He was a Tudor composer, shockingly neglected today, according to Mr. Steel. Parsons has also managed to draw young audiences to concerts of his choral works at Columbia. As I said, George Steel is onto something.

HEADLINE: A New Platform for the New Poets 

BYLINE:  By JON PARELES

 BODY:
"I DON'T know anything about Broadway," says Russell Simmons, the hip-hop mogul and C.E.O. of Rush Communications, as he waves a visitor into the Longacre Theater.
 It's time for the last run-through before New York previews begin of "Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam on Broadway." Dressed in white Phat Farm Classic running shoes, ripped patchwork jeans, orange sweater and a baseball cap he keeps turning backward, he doesn't look like a theater V.I.P. He is getting his Broadway education on the job -- as the show's lead producer. 
 While Mr. Simmons settles into a back-row seat, a disc jockey, Tendaji, plays bits of rhythm-and-blues and hip-hop and warms up the few spectators like a club disc jockey, promising "the dopest poets of our generation." 
Soon, nine poets muster onstage to make terse mission statements. "I wanna raise poems like my kids/Keep them from jail bids,/ Pessimism and negativity," says Black Ice, an African-American from Philadelphia. 
"I wanna be read, loved, memorized,/ I wanna be a poem that changes lives," says Suheir Hammad, a Palestinian-American from Brooklyn.
"I want all poems to be about me," says Beau Sia, a Chinese-American from Oklahoma City.
From there, each poet steps forward for solo recitations and a few group poems. The performance is in the words and in the way they can stir up an audience or create a rapt silence. It was polished in a six-week San Francisco run this summer. "The audiences that we have had so far are always surprised by where the show takes them," Ms. Hammad said. "You laugh and you're challenged and you're angered and you're uplifted, and you don't often get that in two hours in a theater." 
"Def Poetry Jam" brings to Broadway both the ancient traditions of bards and griots and the more recent resurgence of spoken-word performance, which was spurred by the rhymes of hip-hop and has taken on its own momentum since the 1980's. Poets have turned into performers, reciting work that can be adamantly political, deeply personal, funny and unflinching, often in quick succession. For the first time on Broadway, poetry with hip-hop roots is at centerstage. 
Writing poetry may once have been the outlet for a few sensitive high school students. But now, Mr. Simmons believes, it is a majority pursuit. "If I'm in a high school in the ghetto right now," he says, "and I ask, 'Who writes poetry?,' or 'How many of you have a book of rhymes?,' 80 percent of the class raises their hands."
Mr. Simmons has made a career of transforming urban oral traditions into mainstream entertainment. "I don't pretend to discover ideas," he said. "By the time I get hold of something, it's already hot. I bring it to HBO, or Hollywood, or records, and it may be the first time that people have heard it outside of the core, but these people are already cultural heroes in their community. What feels good to me is pretty commercial by the time I like it, and I believe poetry's time has come." 
He does have a way of getting the outside world to pay attention. He started out managing the Queens hip-hop group Run-D.M.C.; his brother Joey Simmons is the rapper Run. He started the Def Jam label, which put out albums by L. L. Cool J., Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys, and in the mid-1990's he began producing "Russell Simmons's Def Comedy Jam" for HBO, giving national exposure to Martin Lawrence, Bernie Mac, Cedric the Entertainer and other African-American comics.
As the 1990's ended, Mr. Simmons grew interested in the spoken-word performers who were making guest appearances on hip-hop albums and working a national circuit of cafes, colleges and competitions called poetry slams. With the director Stan Lathan, who was the executive producer of "Def Comedy Jam" on television, he began pitching HBO on a poetry series, and at the end of 2001, "Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry" found an enthusiastic audience in a late-night slot. The Broadway version, which Mr. Lathan is also directing, includes some of the HBO series' most vivid performers.
While other Broadway theaters are filled with "Les Miserables," revivals of old musicals and revues based on familiar songs, "Def Poetry Jam" is up to the minute. Run-D.M.C.'s disc jockey, Jam Master Jay (Jason Mizell), was murdered on Oct. 30 as previews for "Def Poetry Jam" began. Within a day, Black Ice and the Jamaican poet Staceyann Chin began collaborating on a poem about the shooting and other untimely deaths. It will very likely be part of the show by the time it officially opens on Thursday. "This show is not going to be engraved in stone," Mr. Lathan said. "The poems are constantly being updated." 
He added: "There are so many shows I've seen, not just in theater but even more in television, that start out with the hook 'This is telling it like it is,' " Mr. Lathan said. "But in the translation from the original concept to the stage or the screen it gets diluted. With the poets, my philosophy is, 'Let's put it up there, let's find the best people to perform it and let's get out of their way.' " 
The poets are all in their 20's and early 30's. "We want to open this up to the traditional theater audience," Ms. Hammad said. "They may be worried that they don't relate to the hip-hop generation, but they're raising the hip-hop generation." (Ticket prices after the opening will range from $25 to $65.)
The performers also include Mayda Del Valle, from Chicago; Georgia Me, from Atlanta; Poetri, from Michigan; Steve Colman, from New Jersey; and Lemon, from Brooklyn. "Poets who have been writing and performing for most of their lives have not had this opportunity," Ms. Hammad said. "We're responsible to our craft and our peers and to America, to show them that this is what poets have been doing since Walt Whitman, working and experiencing and incorporating different forms of American English."
Mr. Simmons insisted that the diversity of the lineup was accidental, a matter of choosing the best performers for the show. But the poets are not shy about ethnic and sexual roles, whether it's Ms. Chin describing herself as a "lipstick lesbian" or Mr. Sia promising an "Asian invasion": "You asked for a global economy/ Well so sorry/ If it blows up in your face . . . " 
Some of the poets are college graduates; others are self-taught. Black Ice recorded a consciousness-raising hip-hop single when he was 16 and earned a living for 10 years as a barber while writing poetry. "That was my college years, working in the barbershop," he said. "Because that gave me perspective on what I would have to do to create some change, to create some conversation about change. My performance pieces are like sermons. I don't consider myself a poet, I'm a vessel. God uses me to get messages through that he needs to get to people."
"Def Poetry Jam" is loosely organized into four segments: identity, memories, love and a final message. In the course of the performance, the poets address stereotypes, love, music, politics, family, food, money and the meaning of America. Poetri denounces Krispy Kreme donuts as a plot "started to keep the black man down and round"; Lemon and Ms. Valle share a tribute to Tito Puente. Georgia Me talks back to an abusive lover; Mr. Colman indicts right-wing power as the real "terrorist threat." 
It has been a generation since a Broadway production revolved around poetry. In 1976, Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/ When the Rainbow Is Enuf" moved uptown from the Public Theater. "For Colored Girls" was called a "choreopoem," with actresses performing Ms. Shange's tough-minded monologues about women's lives. It introduced Broadway audiences to a rhetorical style that drew on gospel oratory, jazz and raw street talk, and its repercussions can be heard on recent albums by Jill Scott (a singer as well as a performing poet), Saul Williams and Ursula Rucker. (In 1995, the poet Reg E. Gaines wrote the text for "Bring In da Noise/ Bring In da Funk," though his contribution was upstaged by dance and music.) 
The difference between "For Colored Girls" and "Def Poetry Jam" is that this time the performers are speaking their own words. "I try to keep it as spontaneous as possible," Mr. Lathan said. "We try not to overrehearse. The key is that the poets come out and there's honesty. They try to convey what they felt as they wrote the poem and what it does to them now." 
They're not exactly introverts. In the hip-hop era, poetry has found a place on the stage as well as the page. Poetry slams began in Chicago in the 1980's as mock-Olympics for poetry, and soon turned serious, with local teams and national championships. As each poet delivered one poem per round, slams worked like radio or MTV; if the current act wasn't entertaining, the next would be on in minutes.
New York's magnet for poetry performance was the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which Bob Holman opened in the East Village in 1989. Most of the "Def Poetry Jam" poets have appeared on its small stage. "It was just at the moment when multiculturalism was picking up steam as an academic subject," said Mr. Holman, who now runs the Bowery Poetry Club. "You could study it in schools and read about it or go down to the cafe and live it."
The Lollapalooza Festival of alternative rock included a stage for spoken-word performers, and in 1993, MTV produced a segment of its "Unplugged" series featuring poets. Mr. Sia was a teenager in Oklahoma City when he saw the MTV show and decided to try poetry. When Mr. Sia moved to New York City, Mr. Holman said, he came to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe with 400 pages of his own poetry. "There are still poets who come out of the ether with 400-page manuscripts," Mr. Holman said. "But with the slams, there are more that have two or three that are crowd pleasers, and they can ride them."
In "Def Poetry Jam," the delivery can be conversational or declamatory, motor-mouthed or calmly intense. The poets use the cadences of rapping, Jamaican toasting, preaching and comedy. They buttonhole the audience, all but demanding a response. It's a style that most of the performers have honed on the slam circuit, where the competition is "tooth and nail," Mr. Sia said. 
"The way the eye reads the page and the ear hears the words is such a different thing," Mr. Sia added. "It's not about the line breaks, it's about being coherent and being understood." 
Part of the process of creating "Def Poetry Jam on Broadway" was to turn competitors into an ensemble and to make a place for intimate poems as well as show-stoppers, said Mr. Lathan: "They had to learn that it wasn't about outdoing the guy before you. We wanted to keep this thing as a journey and not a race."
Black Ice said: "My performance has shot up so much since we've been a team. Some people like competition, but my mission in this lifetime is to spread the truth. And when we have a competition of truth, it makes no sense that my truth is truer than yours. Truth can't be conquered, it can only be built upon. And we're dropping truth."

Excerpts from "Def Poetry Jam."
Money
By Poetri

My Money has been acting funny lately
All I ever did was love her!
Maybe too much!
Cause now it's like we ain't cool no more. . . .
I haven't seen Money in months
I got more than a hunch she's playing me
Trying to make me jealous,
Hanging out with other fellas
Always in some other brother's pocket!
I try and tell her those other guys
are just using her!
"They just using you Money!!!"
She don't wanna hear me
She won't even return my phone calls!
She won't go to the movies with me
She won't even go get nothing to eat!
And you know a brother can't eat . . . without Money!

And These Are Only Some
Of the Things I Believe
By Staceyann Chin

Imagination is the bridge between
the things we know for sure
and the things we need to believe
When our world becomes unbearable
But in this world of schoolboy bullets, biological warfare and kiddie porn --
it takes guts to believe in any God
so I practice on believing in the smaller things
till I am able to make room for the rest
I begin with believing there's a Santa Claus
Except I believe St. Nicholas is a holiday
transvestite
And I believe in monsters lurking under the bed
because they give our children something
to conquer, before the world begins to conquer them . . .

HEADLINE: NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND; 
On the F List

BYLINE:  By Abby Goodnough; Abby Goodnough covers education for The Times.

DATELINE: Elmira, N.Y. 

 BODY:
I DON'T remember much about my middle school years. There was the intricate way we folded notes before tossing them to each other across a classroom; the ice scraper I made in shop class; the talent show in which my friends and I danced to the theme from "Fame" and (deservedly, in retrospect) got booed. Though I cannot dredge up a single memory about academics, I always thought I had gotten a sound enough education. 
 But there it was, on the list of 487 failing schools that New York State released in September: Ernie Davis Middle School, Elmira -- my own school, where almost everyone in my upstate hometown enrolled without a second thought. 
 As an education reporter, I had written many a story about these lists of shame and the dismal New York City schools that dominated them. To be fair, the list that Ernie Davis landed on is different from the annual state list of "schools under registration review," whose test scores are so consistently awful that they are under threat of being closed. This list was mandated by No Child Left Behind, the new federal act that requires states to cite not only the worst-performing schools but also those with high levels of poverty and disappointing scores that have not met improvement targets over several years. My school fell into that less onerous category. 
Still, the news was bad. How could Ernie Davis have fallen so far since 1983? Elmira, a city of 33,000 in the middle of the state's border with Pennsylvania, had many educated, middle-class residents who cared about the quality of its schools. But Elmira was economically depressed even in my youth; like other upstate cities, it had lost manufacturing jobs and residents and would continue to do so after my family left in 1992. 
Now, on a rainy morning this past October, it seemed even more faded. More downtown stores were shuttered; others looked as if they had the same dusty merchandise in their windows as when I was 13 and trolled them for Journey records and Izod shirts. The Elmira 1-2-3 had gasped its last cinematic breath in September.
Worse, the Arthur W. Booth Elementary School, where I tried to read every book in the library from the second through the sixth grade, is to close because of dropping enrollment. It looked melancholy as I drove past, its playground scarred and its dark red window casings like drooping eyelids.
Ernie Davis Middle School -- named after the late Heisman Trophy winner, who grew up in Elmira in the 1950's -- is in one of the poorest parts of town, next to a housing project that looks quaint compared with the behemoth complexes that surround many schools in New York City. It serves 800 students -- about 175 more than in my day, but only because sixth graders now attend along with seventh and eighth graders.
About 25 percent of the students are black, most of the rest are white. But poverty in Elmira has always crossed racial lines: 40 percent of Ernie Davis students qualify for the free-lunch program, a larger number than when I attended.
From the outside, Ernie Davis looked the same: fortresslike with dull, sand-colored brick. But through the heavy doors, everything seemed bright. The hallways were not as dingy; the lighting no longer gave off a greenish-yellow cast. The school had been renovated about five years ago, and the inside was pleasantly unrecognizable.
Christopher Spezialetti, who has been the principal for just over a year, gamely welcomed me. Over his desk hung a picture of Mark Twain -- who wrote parts of Huckleberry Finn in Elmira, by the way -- with his quote, "I never let my schooling interfere with my education." What might the officials who monitor failing schools think of that?
Mr. Spezialetti came up through the ranks in Elmira, working at three other schools before coming to Davis in July 2001. An astounding 40 percent of Davis's teachers left that summer, many from my era and ready to retire. The exodus worked well for Mr. Spezialetti, allowing him to handpick several dozen new teachers and, in his words, "build my own team." As it happened, the school's eighth-grade test scores rose sharply his first year, by 9 percentage points in math and 14 in reading.
"It was the previous three years that got us on the list," he said wryly. Under No Child Left Behind, schools that had large numbers of students who failed high-stakes tests in 1999, 2000 and 2001 and did not make adequate yearly progress, as determined by the state, were put on the list. Ernie Davis's recent progress will not get it off; it just missed its target on the reading test in 2002 and will have to show even steeper improvement in each of the next two years.
I asked Mr. Spezialetti and Laura Sherwood, the district superintendent, how my school had ended up on the list. 
New York State introduced tough new tests for fourth and eighth graders in 1999 as part of a drive to set and enforce higher academic standards. Well over half of the state's students failed the tests that year, and while performance has improved, hundreds of schools are still struggling to get their students over the significantly raised bar.
Middle school scores have been especially low, and educators have offered a number of possible reasons: a shortage of qualified math teachers, the difficulty of teaching students who are struggling with the turbulence of early adolescence, a reluctance to adjust curriculums and teaching methods to the rigorous new standards.
Ernie Davis has wrestled with the last problem in particular. For decades, Ms. Sherwood said, its staff embraced the "private practice" approach to teaching.
"Teachers taught what they thought was important, so alignment of curriculum and testing got to be a big problem," she said. "The days of teachers being able to choose their loved areas of study and teach them in isolation are over."
Another problem, Mr. Spezialetti said, was the tendency to emphasize memorization of facts instead of the higher-level thinking and writing skills that the new state tests measure. 
At that, I did start to recall having to copy boring outlines off the blackboard day after day and memorizing dates, names, literary terms and periodic table symbols. No wonder it was all a blur.
I also began remembering how Ernie Davis students had been divided into two tracks: high-achieving students like me -- most white and upper middle class -- were "Regents track," meaning we took more rigorous courses that prepared us for the college-preparatory Regents exams. But most students, including just about all the minorities, took "local" courses that led to the far less demanding Regents Competency Tests. We honors students referred to our classmates as "locals," as if predicting they would never make it out of Elmira and into the big, exciting world that we could not wait to make our mark on.
"We used to say, 'Ten percent of our students are not succeeding; that's not too bad,"' Mr. Spezialetti said. "Now those 10 percent are being put under a microscope. The focus now is on every single child."
The news that Ernie Davis had landed on the ignominious list came just a day before school started in September. When Mr. Spezialetti told the staff, "It was really hard for them to swallow," he said. The No Child Left Behind Act requires "schools in need of improvement," as most on the list are known, to inform parents of their status and give them the option of transferring their children to a higher-performing school.
A local talk-radio host slammed Ernie Davis on his show that week, calling the school terrible and urging parents to yank their children out. But not a single student has transferred to Elmira's other choice, Broadway Middle School. In fact, parents called that week to pledge support and vent about unreasonably high standards. Several wanted to start a letter-writing campaign to the governor. Mr. Spezialetti talked them out of it.
Schools on the list have to develop a detailed improvement plan by December, and Mr. Spezialetti is on the case. He is breaking down the test data into "itty-bitty pieces" to see what kinds of questions stumped students and which children need the most help. He has discovered, for example, that students who spend all three years at Ernie Davis do much better than the many who parachute in from other schools in seventh or eighth grade.
Special-education and black students have disproportionately low scores, and Mr. Spezialetti is trying to give them extra help too. Until recently, test results were not broken down by race, and special-education students did not take standardized tests at all, so many schools let these groups languish.
In every subject, the curriculum is now focused like a laser beam on the skills measured by the eighth-grade tests. On every classroom wall, posters broadcast test-taking tips like TS-SS-C to remind students that expository writing samples should include a topic sentence; supporting sentences that use facts, examples and details; and a conclusion. Language arts teachers are coaching math and science teachers on how to strengthen writing skills with word problems and lab reports. Students are even nudged to ask and answer questions in complete sentences to better prepare for the short-answer and essay questions on the state reading test.
To improve performance on multiple-choice questions, Ernie Davis is experimenting with active reading, in which students underline, make notes and even draw pictures by words or phrases they find confusing or important. The main idea is to improve reading comprehension, a section of the test that the students struggle with.
Brenda Baker, who started teaching English at the school 14 years ago, now spends much of her time helping teachers in various subjects strengthen their students' test-taking skills. Having to focus so intensely on tests frustrates her.
"I eat, sleep and drink that baby," she said of the reading exam, which eighth graders take in January. 
Mary Ellen Tuttle, a science teacher, said she realized just how test- and standards-oriented the curriculum had become when a seventh grader preparing to write a lab report asked, "Is this expository writing or is this narrative writing?"
Popping into classes, I found the opposite of what I anticipated: there was a lot of energy in the rooms; teachers seemed dead serious about preparing students for the state tests, and students appeared eager to soak up the test skills and strategies that have become the emphasis of most lessons.
While Mr. Spezialetti believes Ernie Davis will come off the list in the next few years, he worries about variables that are beyond his control. Because of the floundering economy, many more new students enrolled than usual this year, including some who could no longer afford Catholic school and others whose families had moved to Elmira to live with relatives. Some of those students will need lots of extra help preparing for the tests.
Mr. Spezialetti also worries that the test questions might be more difficult this year, the scoring tougher. Regardless, it will be a little harder for Ernie Davis students to get over the bar this year, since the improvement target set by the state will be a little higher.
"I'm not sure we can move as fast as the state wants us to," Mr. Spezialetti said.
SHOULD they have to? I was torn. Ernie Davis had defied my expectations; it seemed to be providing a better education in 2002 than in 1983. A lot of the credit goes to the state for ratcheting up standards, dropping its two-track system and requiring all students to pass the rigorous Regents exams.
But mostly on its own initiative, the school has created opportunities that were woefully absent before: after-school and weekend tutoring; a "character club" for students with good grades, attendance and attitude; even regular field trips. The school has divided its students and teachers into teams that stay together all year, providing a far more intimate environment than I had experienced and improving every child's chances of getting special attention. 
Yet the test-taking tips posted everywhere and Mr. Spezialetti's piles of data suggest a single-minded mission. Surely there was less time now to linger over great short stories, write poems, embark on creative history projects or goof around with showy science experiments, the kind where the teacher blows something up and the students gleefully applaud. 
There weren't nearly enough of those inspiring, memorable lessons in my day, but with expectations rising so sharply, creativity and intellectual debate should be prized.
As I drove off, my thoughts returned to the Mark Twain poster above Mr. Spezialetti's desk. Suddenly, its presence made a lot of sense.

HEADLINE: The Other One 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN; Jodi Wilgoren is Midwest bureau chief of The Times.

DATELINE: Iowa City 

 BODY:
Which of the following statements is not true about the ACT, the college admissions exam that has been the SAT's quiet competitor for nearly half a century?
 a. More colleges and universities accept ACT scores than SAT scores. 
 b. The overhaul of the SAT currently under way will make it more like the ACT.
c. The ACT was invented by a member of the College Board, the organization that runs the SAT.
d. The ACT predicts success in college based on intelligence and innate ability. 
The answer is d. Since its debut in 1959, the ACT Assessment -- formerly known as the American College Testing Program -- has emphasized achievement over aptitude. Questions on the three-hour, four-part test are drawn from high school curriculums, not general knowledge, designed to test how much students have learned rather than how smart they are. There are no trick answers.
"We really believe that tag line that we have: education for life's transitions," ACT's chief executive, Richard L. Ferguson, said over lunch in the humble cafeteria of the company's headquarters here in the heartland. "Assessment ought to have a real-life meaning for individuals. The assessment is part of a process. It's not an endpoint."
This should be the golden moment for the ACT. 
Over the last decade, its style of standards-based testing has become ubiquitous in kindergarten through 12th grade, amid a strong national consensus that such assessments are crucial to prepare students for college. Two states, Illinois and Colorado, have recently made the ACT mandatory for all high school juniors, and seven others have adopted the company's 8th- and 10th-grade exams, which are modeled on the ACT and intended to get younger students focused on, and ready for, college. More than 1.1 million of last spring's graduating seniors took the ACT, not too far off the 1.27 million who took the SAT.
In February 2001, when Richard C. Atkinson, president of the University of California system, raised serious questions about the reliability and fairness of the aptitude-based SAT, his speech sounded much like one given decades earlier by ACT's founder, E.F. Lindquist. In response, the College Board announced plans last May to revamp the SAT by 2005, ditching its trademark verbal analogies in favor of short critical reading passages, adding more advanced math problems -- in short, remaking itself in the image of its lesser-known, less-controversial counterpart.
But it remains unclear how the convergence of the two competing exams will affect the smaller, softer stepsister, which is dominant in the large state universities of the country's midsection and South, yet scarce among elite private institutions and on the coasts. 
The ACT has long been like Pepsi to the SAT's Coke, Avis to its Hertz -- for some in the college admissions game, the SAT is Kleenex, the other test the brand whose name you often forget. After decades as the anti-SAT, the ACT -- which is more popular now among students and schools than ever before -- may face a new challenge in distinguishing itself as the differences between the two tests disappear.
"The mystery is, why doesn't everybody use the ACT?" asked Nicholas Lemann, author of "The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy" (1999), the definitive book on the SAT. "If the College Board had decided to go the route of resistance" when Dr. Atkinson threatened to drop the SAT I reasoning test, he said, "then there would have been much more opportunity for ACT. Since they went the route of accommodation and adjustment, there's less opportunity." 
If the SAT is copying the ACT's testing tactics, executives here in Iowa City are, at the same time, mimicking the aggressive marketing strategies of the Manhattan-based College Board. ACT has quadrupled its output of news releases and begun a syndicated column about preparing for college that is carried in some 50 newspapers. It has sent representatives to hundreds of high school workshops in the crucial state of California and to national business and school-board conferences, armed with posters outlining how each point on the ACT corresponds with a specific curriculum standard. Since 1998 ACT employees have spent a day at 272 of its top client colleges for "service reviews," intended to help administrators better use the test data. The wonks on the organization's board have been replaced with high-profile names in education, including Richard W. Riley, former secretary of education, and Roy Romer, superintendent of schools in Los Angeles.
"Imitation is not always the sincerest form of flattery," admitted Mr. Ferguson, a professorial statistician who lacks the sound-bite expertise of his counterpart at the College Board, Gaston Caperton, the former governor of West Virginia. "Making the SAT more like the ACT? The real thing is where I come from. Now it's up to me to show how much more we represent."
Mr. Caperton dismisses any suggestion that the SAT is turning into its rival, pointing out that ACT announced plans for an optional writing segment after the College Board unveiled similar blueprints; the board was also first in deciding to stop flagging scores of disabled students who get extra test time. "We are the leader and we are the innovator," he said. "That's the history of the ACT: they see what we do and then they follow behind."
ACT'S dens of anonymous cubicles sit on a quiet campus just off Interstate 80, 232 miles west of Chicago. It is far both physically and psychologically from the ivy-covered ivory towers that dominate the higher education debate, and also from the media swirl of New York and California. 
Dr. Lindquist, who died in 1978, was a professor of education at the University of Iowa down the road. Before the ACT, he invented the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, still one of the premier standardized assessments for grade schoolers, and its high school version, the Iowa Tests of Educational Development; he also helped create the original high school equivalency exam, the G.E.D. Next came a machine known as Mark I, which quickly scanned bubble sheets, counting 50,000 right answers in a second -- and doing in a week what it had taken 60 women to do in six.
The College Board was among the early users of Professor Lindquist's Mark I for what was then called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, an I.Q. type of exam first given in 1926 to help the Ivy League and other top-tier institutions filter the best and brightest from their piles of wealthy, well-educated applicants. 
In 1958, Dr. Lindquist, a member of the College Board, urged his colleagues to develop a test for the legions of less selective universities overwhelmed by the postwar expansion in applicants, a test of broad competencies, not of memorization, gauging mastery of curriculum, not God-given mind capacities. "The examination must make him feel he has earned the right to go to college by his own efforts, not that he is entitled to college admission because of his innate abilities or aptitudes, regardless of what he has done in high school," Dr. Lindquist said at a testing conference at the time. "The examination must be regarded by him as an achievement test or as a test of his acquired or developed abilities. The tasks constituting the examination must therefore obviously correspond to recognized high school learning experiences."
When his proposal was rejected by the College Board, Dr. Lindquist decided to create his own alternative. He partnered with Ted McCarrel, Iowa's dean of admissions, who helped persuade his counterparts at other state institutions to drop the entrance exams they had developed on their own in favor of the ACT. On Nov. 7, 1959 -- 33 years after the advent of the SAT -- 75,406 students took the first ACT test. 
The exam cost $3 then; today it is $25 (the SAT is $26). The company had six full-time employees; now it has 1,150. In 1970, 49 percent of those who took the test were women and 80 percent white. Today, 56 percent are women and 69 percent white. 
The biggest shift in the exam itself came in 1989, when the two reading tests, in social sciences and natural sciences, were replaced with today's more general reading section and a science section; math got a little harder, partly in response to engineering schools that wanted to better discern among high-level applicants. Many items in the English portion, though, could have appeared in any of the last 43 years.
As with the SAT, teachers and college professors from around the country write the items. The content, however, is guided by a national curriculum survey that ACT has conducted every three or four years since 1976, asking some 15,000 teachers in grades 7 through 12, and a similar number of professors, to rank the relative importance of skills in their subjects.
"The assessment has changed as the curriculum has changed: it's not a revolution, it's an evolution," said Donald J. Carstensen, vice president for educational services at ACT. "Probably more important is the change that's occurred in the educational environment. It is fashionable to be thinking about assessment as a measure of achievement."
Though the ACT and SAT were born of contrasting philosophies and to serve starkly different markets, they are now, in large measure, seen as interchangeable. The most virulent test-haters tend to have far less venom for the ACT than the SAT, but they deride both for being weak predictors of success in college. Research shows that each is about 25 percent effective in predicting success in college (high school grades are a better tool).
"At their roots they're quite different; in the reality they're not all that different," said Bob Schaeffer of the group FairTest in Cambridge, Mass. "It is still a one-shot test. It's all multiple choice; it's largely factual regurgitation. No test can measure creativity, perseverance, capability to overcome obstacles. It measures how well you've mastered the particular set of skills and knowledge that are on the test."
AT the Kaplan test prep center in downtown Chicago, seven high school students chewed on No. 2 pencils as they practiced strategies for conquering the ACT. One of the very first things they learn is that there are no penalties for wrong answers -- unlike on the SAT, which is designed so that if someone guessed on every item, right answers would be canceled out by wrong ones, for a score of zero.
"If you can eliminate any of the wrong answers on the test," explained the Kaplan teacher, Jim Holcomb, "you're going to do a much better job and improve your test scores dramatically."
The English section has 75 grammar, punctuation and writing-style items to complete in 45 minutes. Kaplan's rule: Read until you have enough information to select the best answer. The Kaplan method: Predict the answer before looking at the options; eliminate answers you know are wrong; plug in the remaining choices; select the best one.
For math, with 60 algebra, geometry and simple trigonometry items in 60 minutes, Kaplan offers "four questions for problem solving": What do I want to know? What do I know already? What can I do with what I know already? Is that what I want to know (am I done)?
The funny thing about taking a test-prep class for the ACT is that everyone involved with the test, including Kaplan test-preppers, pretty much agrees that the best way to prepare for it, besides taking practice exams to get familiar with the directions, is to study hard in school. 
"It's like a high school exam, where it mostly tests did you learn what you were supposed to learn -- every question is designed to see whether a student paid attention in high school," explained Eirik Johnson, who has taught ACT and SAT courses at Kaplan in Chicago for 24 years. "Ordinary high school teachers could probably help students prepare for the ACT. I doubt most high school teachers could help students prepare for the SAT in a meaningful way, because most high school teachers aren't very good critical thinkers."
Kaplan is a bit stingy with its figures but does allow that the ACT accounts for about 10 percent of its business nationally, mostly in the central region of Chicago and six Midwestern states (where it is 52 percent of the total) and the Great Lakes region of five Midwestern states (28 percent). There has been a recent boom, though: ACT business is up 35 percent nationwide this year over last; SAT business has increased 11 percent.
Of the seven students -- five seniors, two juniors -- in Mr. Holcomb's class, only one planned to take both the SAT and the ACT: Lanelle Lanton, who said, "I'd just rather have it so colleges can look at both." Jose Rivera, the lone man in the class, was there to try to raise his score from a 16 to the 18 he needs to play Division I baseball, or even the 21 required for an athletic scholarship. Others had taken the ACT as juniors under the new state requirement but hoped to increase their scores by 7 or 8 points before applying to colleges this fall. 
"It'll pay off once I get a good job," said Ms. Lanton, 16, whose first choice is Tennessee State University. "You get into a good college, the better chance you have of getting a good job." Iffath Hussain, 17, said that "it depends on the person as well -- if you're strong in English and math, you'd take the SAT," whereas the ACT allows people to strut their science knowledge, too. Martina Smith, 16, said that "if you attend public school, you may not be as prepared for the SAT."
"We learn more about the ACT rather than the SAT," she explained. "In class, we're taught we have to prepare for the ACT."
A map showing where the two tests are most prevalent looks a lot like the red-and-blue map showing Republican (ACT) and Democratic (SAT) electoral votes. A student in New England may never have heard of the ACT, while one growing up in Illinois would be unlikely to consider taking anything else. This geographic pattern began with the tests' founding but has been twisted by quirks of history, like the adoption of the SAT in the 60's to determine certain scholarships in California (now, the committee accepts either test). 
It is largely about context -- and habit. Mr. Lemann suggests it is "the phenomenon economists call path dependence."
"Once you start doing things in any particular way," he said, "and then many, many millions of people and institutions get accustomed to dealing with whatever way that is, then the cost of change becomes incredibly high. That explains the persistence of things like the typewriter keyboard layout that make absolutely no rational sense."
Ninety-one institutions do not accept SAT scores, including several campuses of the University of Wisconsin and private Christian institutions like Bob Jones University. Far fewer, 11, say no to ACT scores -- notably Wake Forest in North Carolina, the California Institute of Technology and two campuses of the City University of New York (Baruch and Staten Island). "Wake Forest has always used the SAT I as the required test and has rarely had complaints from students," Martha Allman, director of admissions, wrote in an e-mail message about why her institution would not consider ACT scores. "We have been satisfied through the years with use of the SAT as one factor in our process and currently have no plans to change our testing policy."
Harvard College, too, has been using the SAT for generations -- it was mandatory for applicants starting in 1935. About 10 years ago, with an eye toward attracting students from public high schools in the heartland who were typically underrepresented, Harvard decided to accept the ACT as well. Marlyn McGrath Lewis, its director of admissions, said that 1 in 5 of last year's 19,609 applicants submitted ACT scores, but a third to a half of those offered SAT scores as well. "The ACT is a good test, and we know how to use it," Ms. McGrath Lewis said. "We don't admit people on the basis of tests anyway."
IN a conference room at its Iowa City headquarters, three ACT vice presidents were going over a PowerPoint presentation for a national business conference. The odd thing was, college entrance exams barely came up. Instead, Cynthia Board Schmeiser, head of the development division, was focused on what she calls the "readiness crisis."
Forty percent of college-bound students are not taking enough core courses. Half need remedial English or math when they get to campus. A third of freshmen don't make it to sophomore year. Less than half get their degrees.
"We do have to help kids be more prepared, that is driving a lot of what we do -- getting to kids earlier," Dr. Schmeiser said. "If we get kids in the right courses it can make a difference. If we can make those courses better it can make a difference. Our priorities are to help every kid to get ready and be ready for what they want to do when they walk out of high school."
For years -- well, decades -- ACT struggled to persuade institutions to accept its scores. Now its focus is on helping colleges and universities better use the data ACT provides, for course placement and to more fully know their applicants through ACT's student surveys.
More recently, though, ACT has focused on younger students with an assessment system incorporating a test for 8th graders (called Explore) and for 10th graders (Plan). Taking these earlier versions of the ACT -- not unlike the PSAT, which is used to determine National Merit Scholarships -- enables students to find gaps in their education early on and fill them while there is still time. 
Last year, about 833,000 students took the 10th-grade test, which was introduced in 1986, and 480,000 took the eighth-grade test, which was started in 1991.
ACT officials point to states like Oklahoma, where the assessment package was adopted in 1993 and nearly 90,000 students now take one of the tests. During that time, the state's average ACT score rose from 19.5 to 20.5; the percentage of seniors headed to college increased to 49 percent in 2001 from 32 percent in 1987, while the number of students at the state's universities needing remediation dropped and graduation rates increased. 
For ACT, California is the next -- and most important -- frontier, if only because of its size: 40,744 of the state's seniors took the ACT last year, while 161,975 took the SAT (compare that to Iowa, ACT's home state, where nearly every college-bound senior takes the test -- 23,805 last year, compared with 1,764 SAT takers). About 27 percent of applicants to the University of California over the last four years have taken both the SAT and the ACT, assuming one or the other test would better display their talents, or that the combination would somehow offer a fuller portrait. But just 1.4 percent submitted only ACT scores, while 71 percent offered just SAT's. 
When Dr. Atkinson made his landmark speech last year calling for achievement rather than aptitude tests, many at ACT were gleeful. But they grew frustrated when, instead of simply embracing the ACT, the University of California worked with the College Board to reengineer its offering. ACT also moved quickly to add an optional writing test -- the new SAT will have a required essay portion -- so it could compete in California. 
"We should be having tests that are aligned with our expectations, that's a lot of what's behind our going after content-driven exams," said Barbara Sawrey, chairwoman of the University of California board that develops policy on admissions. "We want students to have choice, we don't want to be in the position to say, 'This is the one and only test."'
While the ACT is driven by high school curriculum, Mr. Caperton said, the new SAT will test "college success skills" -- critical thinking through reading, writing and arithmetic. The College Board also offers the SAT II subject tests, which go in depth on a narrow curriculum area like chemistry or American history.
"What do they have that compares with Advanced Placement?" Mr. Caperton said. "What do they have that compares with our 22 subject-matter tests? ACT is basically a test that looks at how well somebody has done in high school. That's different than what the SAT is." As for aptitude, he said: "We've moved away from that, but we haven't moved away from looking at one's ability to think and reason."
With the new SAT, the debate on aptitude versus achievement will dissipate, if not die, leaving ACT to reposition its argument against Brand X. 
Mr. Ferguson is quick to point out the remaining differences: SAT still has no science test. Writing as an option will save students who don't need it time and money. The ACT, now, has more experience at this kind of testing than its older competitor.
"The ACT stays intact, we've got all the research and all the data behind it," he said over a bowl of lightning chili, an egg salad sandwich and a half pint of skim milk in the ACT cafeteria. "And we have all these support systems in place that weren't developed in a year or two to respond to a requirement but were developed over decades. We're not making it up now."
The question is whether people on the faraway coasts hear him.

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
'American Icon'
While most artists evolve, moving from one style or concept to another, Will Barnet's journey through social realism, abstraction and figurative works produced works so different from each other that they could have been done by several artists, all of them displaying consummate skill and a gift for engaging one's undivided attention.
 Mr. Barnet, 91, has won numerous awards in the United States and abroad and has been a teacher and mentor to generations of students at the Art Students League, Yale, Cornell and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. 
 "Will Barnet: An American Icon," an exhibition of 23 paintings, etchings and lithographs is being presented at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield through next Sunday. 
The works are mainly portraits of friends and family from the 1970's through the 1990's; there are two from the 1940's, including a drypoint self-portrait resurrected from plates that were wrapped in newspaper and discovered in a closet. Visiting hours are Monday through Thursday from noon to 5 p.m.; today and next Sunday from noon to 4 p.m.
Information: (203) 365-7650.

Chamber Music Concert
A 16th-century work titled "Magnificat Quinti Toni" by the Italian composer Andrea Rota will be presented in an arrangement for 12 brass instruments when Yale's Chamber Music Society gives a concert of early Renaissance and modern music for organ, brass and percussion Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Battell Chapel. Yale faculty members and the Yale Brass Ensemble will also play works by Hovannes, Dupre, Gabrielli and Frescobaldi, among others. Tickets are $12, students $6.
Information: (203) 432-4158. 

Global Warming
Bill McKibben, a visiting scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College in Vermont, has written numerous books on environmental subjects. He is best known for "The End of Nature," a book about global warming that has been translated into 20 languages and is in a 10th anniversary printing.
Mr. McKibben will present two lectures this week. On Thursday at 4 p.m. he will speak on "Crossing Thresholds: The Environment as Moral Challenge" at the Dodd Research Center on the UConn campus in Storrs. Admission is free. Information: (860) 486-4500. 
On Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. he will be the keynote speaker at the 22nd annual economic conference of the Tunxis Community College Foundation and Advisory Board at the Hartford Marriott in Farmington. His subject will be "The Connection Between Environmental Policies and Economic Prosperity." Admission is by a tax-deductible donation to student scholarships.
Reservations: (860) 679-9526. 

'Pleasures of Collecting'
The Bruce Museum in Greenwich has scheduled several programs in conjunction with its "Pleasures of Collecting" exhibition.
Today from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. a panel discussion by a group of art dealers will shed light on collecting art in the current volatile market. They include Richard L. Feigen of Richard L. Feigen & Company, Philippe Alexandre of Alexandre Gallery and Polly Sartori of Sotheby's 19th-century European paintings department.
An hourlong film titled "Van Gogh in Arles: In a Brilliant Light" will be shown Wednesday at 10:30 a.m., followed by coffee and discussion. Admission to both programs is free with museum admission of $5, $4 for older adults. Reservations: (203) 869-0376.

Art and Justice
The murder trial and execution some 75 years ago of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, avowed anarchists, generated explosive political protests around the world and inspired a flood of art in every discipline. One example was Ben Shahn's series of paintings and prints on the subject, which is on view in an exhibition called "Justice on Trial: Ben Shahn's Case for Sacco and Vanzetti" at the Yale Art Gallery through Dec. 29.
Several related programs were organized in connection with the exhibition, including Thursday at 4 p.m. when a conversation about Sacco and Vanzetti and the Italian-American Community will be led by Patricia Klindienst, a writer and Neil Thomas Proto, lawyer and adjunct professor at Georgetown University's School of Public Policy. 
A guided tour of the exhibition and screening of "In Search of History: The True Story of Sacco and Vanzetti," produced by the History Channel and A & E television will follow the discussion. Admission is free.
Information: (203) 432-0600.

Facelift for Warner Theater
In 1931, the Warner Theater in Torrington was opened as an 1,800-seat Art Deco movie palace by the Warner Brothers Studio, described as "Connecticut's most beautiful theater." The theater was badly damaged when the Naugatuck River overflowed in 1955. The studio repaired and reopened it but federal mandates at the time required that the studios divest themselves of their theaters and it was sold. The nonprofit Northwest Connecticut Association for the Arts raised $132,000 to buy it in 1980 and reopen it as a performing arts center in 1983.
An extensive face-lift has been in progress since last summer, and on Saturday at 6:30 p.m the ribbon will be cut for yet another reopening with Linda Eder, a Broadway star, as the headliner at 8 p.m. 
Information: (860) 489-7180.

Larson's Farm Lives
A farm built in 1825 once thrived for generations where New Milford High School now stands on Route 7. The farm inspired Lorraine Ryan to create "Larson's Farm Trilogy," three paintings reproduced in limited edition prints as a record of life in Connecticut as it used to be.
Components of the trilogy: "Larson's Farm Market," "Chores Done on Larson's Farm" and "The Larson's Farmhouse" will be part of a three-day show called "Connecticut Artists at Woodbury's Old Town Hall," containing the work of nearly three dozen award-winning artists and craftsmen. Organized by Fine Line Gallery in Woodbury, the show's hours are Friday from noon to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Information: (203) 266-0110.

Open House for Artists
Today is the last day of the Stamford Loft Artists Association's open house.
From 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., the public is invited to tour the studios, talk to the painters, sculptors, ceramicists, photographers, printmakers and collagists, among others. The building, which once housed the Yale and Towne Lock company, is at 737 Canal Street, one block south of Exit 8 of I-95. Information: (203) 323-4153. ELEANOR CHARLES

School Projects Are Designed for Use by the Public

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE 

 BODY:
AS school districts update aging facilities, more school buildings are being designed for use both by students and the public. 
 "The walls between school and community are crumbling everywhere," said Philip Cicero, superintendent of the Center Moriches Union Free School District in Suffolk County, which is constructing a new library media center designed for access by its residents. "We are working collaboratively and sharing resources," he said. "That mentality was not there 20 years ago." 
 The collaboration has come about as districts attempt to take full advantage of costly construction projects, according to Charles Szuberla, coordinator of facilities management and information services for the New York State Education Department. 
"Over the past 10 years, the buildings have gotten larger to provide additional services," he said. "Construction has involved a fairly significant investment, so people want to know the buildings are being used more than just eight hours a day. Districts are anxious that if they made the investment in capital construction, they would like to have the community feel they had a part in that investment." 
Although the number of capital projects approved in Nassau and Suffolk's 129 school districts decreased to 478 in the 2001-2 school year from 485 the previous year, the total project costs increased by more than 38 percent, to $969.6 million from $699.1 million, according to the state's office of facilities planning. 
About 25 percent of the projects approved in Nassau in the 2001-2 school year were new buildings or additions, while in Suffolk, where there is more land for expansion, the percentage was more than 50 percent.
In the town of Brookhaven, the Longwood School District, which covers three communities and 53 square miles, has undertaken a $107 million project that includes major additions to its high school and middle school. New multipurpose rooms and gymnasiums have been designed to play a dual role -- for students and the public, said Joseph Medina, the director of facilities. The areas that will be used by the public are being placed so they can be sealed off and served either by a separate entrance or through the school's main entrance. 
A short distance to the west, the Sachem School District, which has 15,000 students, is building a second middle school and high school as part of a $228 million project. All parts of the building are being designed so that they can be open for public use during nonschool hours, including swimming pools, classrooms with computers and the home economics kitchens, said Bruce Singer, the assistant superintendent. The district looks at the new construction as "more opportunities for more people," he said. 
The Center Moriches and East Williston school districts have each planned library-media centers as separate buildings attached to the school and designed to be open to the public after school hours. 
"This is a new approach to design in addressing usability by the public and has come up in other districts as they see themselves serving the public on many levels," said Paul Anderson, an architect at the Spector Group of North Hills, which is the architect for both districts. "The key is to design a function so they don't have to open the whole building," he said. 
In such designs, public areas and bathrooms are located strategically so they are accessible while other areas not in use are blocked off, thus saving on maintenance and security costs, he said.
THE two school districts had different needs in planning their media centers, said Michael Spector, the principal at the Spector Group.
Center Moriches, a suburban community with a periphery of farmland, is midway between Montauk and the Nassau-Queens border. It is "like a school in the Midwest," Mr. Spector said. "It is the icon of the community, where people congregate on a Saturday night." 
The East Williston high school -- called the Wheatley School -- is in the village of Old Westbury, which lacks a public library. There is a total enrollment of 1,758 students in the East Williston district. It serves the village of East Williston, which has 5,000 residents, and parts of the surrounding villages of Old Westbury, Mineola, Albertson, Roslyn Heights and East Hills.
A proposition approved by voters in 2000 included $17.8 million for additions, including media centers, to the district's three schools. The high school's 5,000-square-foot media center, which was completed in September, cost $1,265,000. 
There are plans to open the high school's center to the public some time in the future, said Carolyn Harris, the district's superintendent.
"We felt that in this particular community because there is no public library available to the people of Old Westbury, the media center would be part of a vision to learn together," she said. "It would be wonderful to have an intergenerational program, with students helping older people with technology."
The fan-shaped media center building is attached at its narrowest point to the school's lobby. Students will enter through a main passageway in the school, which is gated where it meets the lobby when school is not in session. The lobby is adjacent to the school's main entrance, through which the public could enter.
Besides the traditional racks of books and reading areas, the high-tech center includes 75 ports for plugging in laptop computers and 37 permanent computer stations.
The futuristic design of the center's steel, aluminum and glass exterior is echoed in the glass wall of the school's entry, which soars at an angle from 15 to 27 feet high. The exterior and the curved lines of the center's widest edge distinguish it from the plain, straight-lined main building. 
The center's straight tinted green glass side wall, which faces south, has a sunscreen, made of horizontal strips of aluminum that are similar to a Venetian blind, but permanently kept at a 45-degree angle to filter the sunlight. 
The reading area borders the interior of this wall and the screens allow for natural, yet usable, light and also prevent glare on the computer screens, according to Michael Mannetta, the project's designer. 
In Center Moriches, the concept of opening a school to the public is not new, said Dr. Cicero, whose district has 1,390 students. "We make all our facilities available to the public," he said. 
He said the publicity about opening the media center for residents' use "had to have helped" in persuading residents to approve the $23.6 million bond issue, which included construction of a 5,700-square-foot media center with a separate public entrance for use after school hours. The center is expected to be completed by September 2003.
Although Center Moriches has its own public library, the school's library-media center will supplement what is in the community, Dr. Cicero said.
As part of the project, the district is building a new 30,000-square-foot middle school, which is to be attached to the existing high school. 
Aside from the middle school, the rest of the project, which includes a new cafeteria and gymnasium in the high school, involved "taking existing space and changing the functions," said Mr. Anderson, who is the project designer. 
The 4,500-square-foot former cafeteria "with its 16-foot ceiling and large space lent itself to a media center because it was nicely proportioned, centrally located, and sits at the front of the building for easy public access," he said.
About 1,200 square feet will be added to the former cafeteria in creating the new center. It will include a bank of 22 computer stations, 12 laptop computer ports, reading and study areas. 
A separate entrance for the public will be built about 25 feet away from the school's main entrance. Students would get to the media center from an inside doorway during school hours.
Adjacent to the vestibule of the public entrance, which will contain a skylight, will be a 250-square-foot conference room and a 125-square-foot work room. A prominent curved 2,000-square-foot glass window will be part of the media center's facade "to announce its presence to the public," Mr. Anderson said. "It will say, 'This is our media center; come on in.' "

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: In Worldwide Survey of Retail Rates; 
Fifth Ave. Rents Are the Highest

 BODY:
New York's retail Gold Coast -- Fifth Avenue between 52nd and 58th Streets and East 57th Street to Madison Avenue -- has retained its position as the most expensive place in the world for a store, according to a recent survey by Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and real estate services company.
 Rents in the area averaged about $700 a square foot annually, as of the end of June. 
The highest rent outside the United States was $577 a square foot along the Champs-Elysees in Paris, followed by Causeway Bay in Hong Kong, where the rents average $500 a square foot, and Oxford Street in London, where the rents average $434 a square foot. 
 In the United States, the fastest rising retail rents were along Madison Avenue, with rents averaging $650 a square foot in June 2002, a 25 percent increase from the average in June 2001.
"Despite the events of 9/11 and the slowing of the economy," said David M. Gialanella, Cushman's executive vice president for national retail services, "the top New York retail areas have experienced improved fortunes in 2002." In secondary areas in the city there is less demand, but while asking rents have not gone down, neither have they increased, he said.
Worldwide, the greatest growth in retail rents was in downtown Kuwait City, with an increase of 180 percent because of the opening of Western-style malls.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Downtown Newark; 
Calculating Impact Of Proposed Arena

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
CONSTRUCTION of a professional sports arena in downtown Newark -- which became more likely last month when the city secured funds to finance a major portion of construction -- would be "like the third leg being put on a stool," said the veteran broker Dudley D. Ryan of Trammel Crow.
 "Business development, cultural development and now entertainment development -- all set the platform for residential development and a true 24-7 city," in Mr. Ryan's view. While each aspect of redevelopment has come slowly and only after tremendous effort, each is necessary for completing the revival of the sprawling metropolis decimated by race riots 35 years ago, he said. 
 Mr. Ryan said he had sold or leased more than 2 million square feet in downtown Newark over the past decade and is currently marketing space in the proposed 100,000-square-foot Riverfront Two office tower, for which the foundation was laid 15 years ago, but then covered with a parking deck. Over the years, Mr. Ryan said, he has become steeped in the city's development history. 
Mr. Ryan said there were efforts to begin rebuilding downtown immediately after the 1967 disturbances. By 1971, the 26-story Gateway One office tower opened next to Pennsylvania Station, its construction having been partly financed by federal grant money. A couple of years later, the Gateway Two building was completed. 
It was not until the mid-80's, though, that office building construction really got rolling again, Mr. Ryan noted. Then, four major buildings went up in rapid succession: the third and fourth buildings in the Gateway complex, One Newark Center and the Legal Center building, all near Penn Station.
More than another decade passed before another significant development occurred, Mr. Ryan said. In 1997, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center was built on the fringe of the central business district, transforming one of Newark's most decrepit and dangerous neighborhoods.
"Now, there is another lag," he said, "until the Devils-Nets arena is built and operating, somewhere around '05 or '10."
There are still some nonbelievers when it comes to the arena, which Mayor Sharpe James has pushed unrelentingly for five years. Its prospects have hit more high and low moments than any Beethoven symphony resounding through the halls at the Performing Arts Center. But many Newark real estate market specialists -- Mr. Ryan among them -- are convinced it will happen.
Last month, Mr. James negotiated a long-term lease with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for use of Newark's seaports and Newark Liberty International Airport, thereby securing a large part of the financing for the arena. Part of the lease proceeds will go to balance Newark's budget, but $165 million is to be set aside for the proposed $355 million 18,500-seat arena to be built right next to the Penn Station and the Gateway complex. 
The city would borrow another $35 million through bonding to pay for infrastructure improvements and to finish the process of assembling the 40-acre site using its powers of condemnation.
Mayor James says he is confident that a deal can be struck with the Yankees-Nets organization to invest $140 million to provide a new home for both the New Jersey Nets basketball team and the New Jersey Devils hockey team. That still leaves the parties $15 million short of covering the cost of the arena. And the deal with the Yankees-Nets has not yet been completed.
BUT many downtown real estate specialists, like Jon Mikula of the commercial mortgage brokerage Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, describe it as a "done deal." Mr. Mikula's firm has arranged financing for some of the major buildings that have changed hands in the past few years downtown and is currently handling the refinancing of 744 Broad Street -- a block from the proposed arena -- for Cogswell Realty.
"I think Newark is a very good market," Mr. Mikula said. "The prospect of the arena takes my opinion to a whole new level."
Richard Charles at Insignia/ESG agreed that the arena would be built and that it would have a major positive impact on the central business district and the city as a whole. "Newark still carries the burden of perceptions that are more than three decades old," he said. With the Performing Arts Center, he added, "there were a lot of naysayers who said it would never get built, and no one will show up. Then, when it opened, people said, 'Wow! This is Newark?' They were shocked."
Mr. Charles said the arena would aim a limelight on what Newark is really like now, through television coverage of sporting events and by drawing more people into the city who have never been there or have not been there in a long time. Mr. Charles and other market specialists talked of how Newark is still not on many big companies' lists of acceptable addresses for offices.
"The arena will change that," he said, "not right now, but fast forward a year or three from now and there will be a host of speculators buying up properties all around the arena and extending south."
Bryn Cinque, a first vice president at GVA Williams, said he was aware of several deals that companies are ready to make in Newark when it becomes certain the arena will be built. "One is for a sports entertainment project," Mr. Cinque said, "and the developers are considering a build-to-suit of 200,000 to 250,000 square feet.
"I also know of several large financial institutions considering large deals in Newark based on the arena," he said, "with the belief it will bring a great deal more traffic to downtown streets and help the city become an acceptable address for a lot more companies."
Richard F. X. Johnson, the senior vice president for development at the Matrix Development Company, which owns the Legal Center at One Riverfront Plaza, said there is ample evidence things are headed in that direction. He cited Cogswell's recent purchase of the entire "Hahne's block" -- a group of buildings between Market Street and the Rutgers-Newark campus -- after the New Newark Foundation's mixed-use redevelopment plan fell apart.
"The arena is simply another vote 'yes' for the continuing renaissance of Newark," Mr. Johnson said. He also said the improvements to roads and utilities that are part of the arena plan would be extremely valuable to Newark's comeback. 
"The arena will help solidify the infrastructure base," he said, "and it will have a ripple impact. It's going to generate hotel demand, office demand, retail demand. This is a city with a daytime population of 650,000 and a residential population of 270,000. The arena will allow Newark to capture its share of the 380,000 people who come in every day and leave right after work."
Mr. Johnson said Matrix had done a "walking study" that shows how quickly and easily people would be able to get to the stadium from their office buildings or Penn Station. From the Legal Center, it is an 8 or 10 minute walk, he said, depending on the chosen route, to the arena site. From Penn Station, it takes 6 to 8 minutes to walk to the stadium site.
Matrix acquired the Legal Center building at the end of last year, and it has been fully occupied since then. The Newark market in general has been tight, Mr. Johnson said, noting that the vacancy rate has stayed well under 10 percent and that bidding was extremely heavy last summer on the landmark Gateway One building, which was ultimately acquired by the Advance Realty Group of Bedminster.
Now, several large leases are expiring and the vacancy rate is expected to shoot up temporarily, Mr. Johnson said, but he predicted the space would be absorbed within a couple of years.
Jeffrey Greenberg, who with his brother Steven Greenberg, heads the Heritage Management Company, said it had not been very difficult to lease space at 550 Broad Street, which the company purchased a year ago, when it was 50 percent vacant. Fleet Bank had vacated 75,000 square feet at the time of the purchase. "We've leased 100,000 square feet in small blocks," Mr. Greenberg said. "The building is now 85 percent occupied."
Mr. Greenberg's building is three blocks from the proposed arena site and thus, he said, would derive less direct benefit from arena construction than will the Gateway Center and other buildings clustered around Penn Station. Currently, he said, rents around the station run in the low $30's per square foot annually, while his building commands rent in the low $20's per square feet.
"My feeling is the city doesn't need the arena to revive," Mr. Greenberg said, "but the arena is coming because the city has already made the strides forward to become a 24-hour community.
"That being said," he added, "the arena is going to be a great complement and amenity."
Jack Fatigati, a senior vice president with the Garibaldi Group, said he thinks there are other potential projects that would have a much greater and more lasting impact than an arena.
"Let's build a river walk," Mr. Fatigati said, "and generate a transformation like that beside the Hudson River, from 42nd street to Chelsea Pier" in Manhattan. He added, "The goal is a livable city, not just a workable city, and I think you have to ask the question: why put up an arena -- another destination people will go inside, stay a few hours and then leave?"
"I happen to love Newark," the broker said. "I think it is underestimated and underrated, but I'm not sure an arena is what it needs. If you look at any world-class city, there is a walkable river. The Passaic is not the Seine, or even the Hudson, but we are working on it.
"I don't think the arena will make us world class."

HEADLINE: Insurance Employees Learn to Pack Light 

BYLINE:  By ABIGAIL SULLIVAN MOORE 

 BODY:
WHEN someone gets laid off at one of the major insurers here, employees call it "getting voted off the island," a reference to the television show "Survivor," in which competence often has little to do with a contestant's ability to stay on the island.
 "They also say, 'They put your torch out,' " said Timothy T. Gilchrist of Canton, a survivor of layoffs at Aetna, the Cigna Corporation and Value Health. 
 Survivor jokes aside, the layoffs, including those announced by Aetna in late September, are a reminder that the local insurance industry is not quite what it used to be.
Since 1989, the number of insurance industry jobs in the Greater Hartford area has shrunk about 10 percent, from an estimated 54,480 jobs to about 49,000 today, said John Tirinzonie, state labor economist for the Connecticut Labor Department.
With most of the job losses occurring in the early 1990's as insurers changed the way they did business, the collapse of the commercial real estate market and high state business taxes, the Hartford area's economy is "still struggling to find its voice," said Fred V. Carstensen, director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis at the University of Connecticut. 
While the Hartford economy has gradually begun to diversify, "it doesn't yet have the set of policies, initiatives and companies that promise long-term success," he said.
Meanwhile, the people who have worked for the insurers for much of their lives are struggling, too. Many have been able to stay in the area only by engaging in a high-stakes employment hopscotch as they jump from company to company with each insurer downsizing.
Local employment experts said the trend is likely to get worse with the nation's weakening economy. Aetna, the world's second-largest health insurer, announced in September plans to cut 2,750 jobs, 317 of them in Hartford, from its work force during the next year in an effort to become more competitive and position itself for profitable growth, said Fred Laberge, an Aetna spokesman. It is not ruling out future cuts, he said.
"There are individuals here who are willing to compromise on their job specifications and responsibilities," said Roger Abate, a vice president and managing director at People Management Northeast, a career transition and executive search firm in Avon. "They are willing to look for a job a notch down to increase their possibilities and stay in the area."
Unable to find positions locally, other people are making tough "executive commutes" to New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia, spending weeknights away from home, he said. "Some are starting their own businesses.
"There's a great resistance to uprooting the whole family," Mr. Abate said, also noting the appeal of the Hartford area's school systems.
Karla Hammond, a vice president at People Management, said some employees have been caught in a revolving door for years. "It's not uncommon to see someone here downsized out of companies three times in five years through no fault of their own," she said. 
Ann Gruden of Vernon who was first laid off with a severance package in 1984 after 20 years at Aetna, said: "A lot people have skipped around. I kept saying, 'Whom haven't I worked for?" '
Since then, Ms. Gruden's employers have included a pharmaceutical association, a temporary agency, the Hartford, and then Cigna. 
When Cigna sold its life and annuity business to the Lincoln National Corporation in 1998, "they bought me, too" Ms. Gruden said. But, earlier this year Lincoln laid off Ms. Gruden. She is now a consultant.
"I used to joke that I never left my desk in nine months and was in three different companies," said Bruce G. Whitney of West Hartford when the Travelers health care operations merged with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to form Metrahealth in 1995; shortly after, that company was bought by United Healthcare. In 1998, United Healthcare laid off Mr. Whitney.
"Looking back it was the best thing that ever happened to me," he said. "I was working myself to death. I was scared and nervous. I had a young family and a house."
Three months later, Mr. Whitney, also an ex-Aetna employee, landed his current position in health care economics at Cigna. 
"The first week at Cigna, I saw someone I shared a cube with at Aetna in 1985," he said. "More and more, I walk down the halls at Cigna and I see people that I worked with at United Healthcare." 
It was not always this way. Some people, of course, switched companies in search of opportunity, but, in the past, most people tended to stay put.
"You stayed forever," said Tony Drapelick, the managing director of the Hartford office of DBM, an international human resources consulting firm. "Twelve years ago, the people who came through our doors were all long-term employees. It hit them quite hard." 
Throughout the 60's, 70's and early 80's, a maternal culture ruled Hartford's old-guard insurers. "There was a sense that you were hired into a family and became part of the family," Ms. Gruden said.
Mr. Gilchrist, who started at Aetna in 1990, said: "I remember being told by my boss after my first year, 'You're really working out.' You'll have a job for life.' " 
A short time later, however, Mr. Gilchrist's marketing job became a nonstaff consulting position. After consulting for Aetna and Value Health, a specialty managed health care and insurance company in Avon, Mr. Gilchrist moved full time to Value Health in 1994.
"I worked from 8 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. for the first five months, plus weekends," he said.
But Value Health was sold in 1997. "Twenty days later we were laid off matter-of-factly and as a group," Mr. Gilchrist said.
Months later, Mr. Gilchrist was rehired to direct Internet activities for Aetna, where he worked until 2000. Then, as Aetna prepared to sell its financial and international business to ING Group NV, "I began to look for another job," Mr. Gilchrist said. Ultimately, he wound up at Cigna. 
Because of a department reshuffling on Mr. Gilchrist's first day at Cigna, "I was demoted," he said. "My ID card was still hot in my pocket."
Eighteen months later, he said, "I got laid off the day I got back from my honeymoon." Before calling his bride with the bad news, he lined up some consulting work with a friend.
Not surprisingly, many employees' attitudes have changed toward their employers and job prospects. 
"People don't see loyalty as they did years ago," Ms. Hammond said. 
Mr. Drapelick said that younger employees seem to understand that it is just a job.
When they are laid off, "they have much less anger, much less disappointment," he said. "That doesn't mean some aren't disappointed. There's an understanding that these things happen. No one says today Mother Aetna promised me a job."
Employment experts also speak of their clients' determination to balance their work and their personal life.
"I decided a long time ago from my own work perspective that I wanted to strike a balance between the community that we live in and the work that we would be doing," said Michael E. Rawlins of Glastonbury, who was laid off three times at Aetna, once on the same day as his wife, during the early 90's.
Now a director at Mass Mutual, Mr. Rawlins speaks warmly about Aetna. Some layoffs were necessary, he said. "They always treated me fairly," he added.
Being laid off has not changed Mr. Whitney's attitude toward his work. "The company provides me with a job and I owe them to do the best I can in that job," he said.
As for Mr. Gilchrist, he is now a very optimistic senior vice president of operations at Integrated Loan Services, a Rocky Hill company that provides research and document processing services for companies that make loans.
"There's a lot of integrity there," he said.

Softness in Fairfield's $2 Million Home Market

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
SALES of houses at the highest end of the Fairfield County market in Greenwich, Darien, New Canaan and Westport have flourished in the past three years, but now, many brokers say, the market for homes selling for $2 million and above is softening.
 Houses at $500,000 and below are moving briskly, however, keeping inventory tight in that price range. At the high end, though, listings are increasing as sellers try to cash in before interest rates rise and prices fall further. 
"The tremendous amount of negative news is delaying people from buying homes," said Russell Pruner, owner of the Greenwich brokerage that bears his name. "In September of 2001 we represented 9 houses over $4 million for sale all over town; in September of 2002 we had 35 houses over $4 million. Now houses are coming on the market at an accelerated rate. We have 146 homes over $4 million, and through the first nine months of this year we put only 53 of them under contract, many with price reductions." 
Marjorie Rowe, owner and president of Preferred Properties, a Greenwich-based company that deals only in the top of the market, said: "We normally have a very active market within Greenwich, for people moving up to bigger homes." Typically, half of all sales are to people who are already residents of the town, she said, "but it's nothing like that now. A lot of people here are in the brokerage business -- they don't know when the pink slip might come. They're treading water."
Greenwich historically is affected less dramatically by economic cycles than other Connecticut towns, and recent figures seem to bear out this fact. Statistics from the chief operating officer of Preferred Properties, William Burke, showed the company's sales of homes with prices of at least $1 million was 139 in the third quarter of this year compared with 137 in the corresponding quarter of 2001 and 127 in 2000. Four homes priced over $6.5 million were sold in the third quarter of 2001; six homes at that price level were sold this year. 
Around the county, home sales have generally been strong so far this year. In Greenwich, Fairfield, Westport, Darien and most other towns in the county, sales of properties selling for more than $1 million are higher than the levels of the previous two years.
Still, brokers representing some high-end sellers who have had their homes on the market since early 2002 have watched buyers walk away after concluding that the house was not worth the price.
One Westport seller offered her 6,200-square-foot house on an acre for $5.8 million in January. Built in 1999 and loaded with desirable features, it has four bedrooms, five full baths and three half baths, a media theater, family room, flat screen televisions and built-in audio throughout the house, an office, exercise room, a long covered porch overlooking the Saugatuck River and a deepwater dock that can accommodate a 35-foot boat. 
W E had offers," she said, requesting that her name not be used, "but one backed out, another hesitated to go to contract. Finally a third was willing to close early, for $3.925 million." The transaction was completed on Oct. 30. 
"People want to get their money out now," said Dee Cohen of Prudential Connecticut Realty, who was a co-broker on the property with Miriam Luck. "They know that come Thanksgiving the house will just sit for months."
Michael Murray, the manager at Prudential in Westport, said: "There are about 120 homes from $1.5 million to over $3 million on the market here, but we've only had 34 transactions. People are not paying top dollar; consumer confidence is down. When a house lingers for four to six months, people who have a legitimate reason for selling -- not just testing the market -- get realistic, so we've been experiencing price reductions of $300,000 and $400,000, or 10 to 15 percent."
Gino Kelly, owner of Kelly Associates in Darien, has also had numerous price reductions in the $3 million and above range, from 5 to 10 percent, "but reduced from euphoric levels," he said, "not unlike prices they traded at in the past. There just are not as many people out to buy a $5 million house." He is representing the owners of a $9.8 million property, on the market since May, reduced by $700,000 from $10.5 million."
Cautious buyers can also affect custom home building. A Greenwich couple engaged a builder to plan a large house not to exceed $6.5 million, but "the builder's projections went far beyond the expectations of the buyers," said Barry Hawkins, the buyers' lawyer, "and the deal crashed. My fee and the architect's fee were paid, but the house never got built."
While some high-end buyers pay cash, more of them are taking loans, making down payments of $500,000 to $1 million. "The loan-to-value ratios are not what you'd see at the lower price levels," said Todd Martin, chief economist at Peoples Bank, "where a buyer puts down 10 percent on a $400,000 house. If prices fall, they are going to fall more on the expensive homes, so the lower the loan-to-value ratio, the better for the bank." Most of the bank's mortgage loans are jumbos, from $300,700 up.
In May of 2000, he noted, when the 30-year fixed rate was 8.5 percent, the monthly payment on a $500,000 mortgage was $3,840. When rates hit 5.99 percent early last month, that same mortgage cost $2,994 a month, and the $3,800 payment could have supported another $153,000 worth of loan. At the recent level of 6.29 percent, the monthly payment is $3,124.
"We were very busy with loans hitting all-time highs," Mr. Martin said, "but that's simmered down as rates have risen."
Last year a flurry of new construction on the Norwalk waterfront resulted in eight sales of $1.8 million to $3.4 million; this year homes priced from $1.7 million to $7.3 million were among 18 high-end sales, including some in the Rowayton section, said Carol Ann Falasco of Coldwell Banker. But they took an average of 151 days to sell this year, compared with 33 days last year. Price reductions have varied from $50,000 to hundreds of thousands, she said, while some properties sold at list.
In New Canaan, anything over $2.5 million sold within 100 days six months ago, said Paul Bruenich, president of William Pitt Inc. "Now it's 200 days. There's a lot of new construction, but prices are flat with downward pressure, and inventories are starting to build."
ACCORDING to Carolyn and David Klemm, owners of Klemm Real Estate in Washington, Litchfield County, people looking to join the A-list of county residents, which already includes Henry Kissinger, Dustin Hoffman, Frank McCourt, Mia Farrow, William Styron, Kevin Bacon, Michael J. Fox, Jim Dine, Skitch and Ruth Henderson, Richard Widmark and Ivan Lendl, by buying a second home there should do so now.
Nine prime properties pictured in a recent company advertisement had been reduced by $150,000 to $750,000, including a 10-room house on 6 acres, reduced to $995,000 from $1.2 million; and an estate on 47 acres, with a guesthouse, caretaker's cottage and pond, originally listed at $5.5 million and now priced at $4,750,000.
The Klemms specialize in high-end properties. "Our customers aren't relocation people or daily commuters," Mrs. Klemm said, "but our business has been affected by corporate troubles, the stock market and unemployment. Sellers are beginning to price their houses more realistically. The seller's market is over."
Because of the county's reliance on a second home market, Liddy Adams of Prudential Litchfield, noted: "The farther away from New York, the sooner activity and prices drop. You don't see ads saying 'won't last' any more. Even summer rentals sat empty this year or rented for only one month." 
William Raveis, owner of William Raveis Real Estate, which has its headquarters in the town of Shelton, expects Fairfield County to continue to be high priced and maxed out in terms of land and traffic, with construction limited by town ordinances against teardowns.
"But corporations continue to move into the state," he said. "UBS Warburg moved in 3,000 people -- a lot of young guys making $200,000 to $300,000 a year, able to buy their first homes in the $600,000 to $1 million range. Cities that were not acceptable in the past," he noted, "may benefit. Maybe Bridgeport will become a corporate headquarters, or Waterbury. New London has land, and since Pfizer moved in, it's a hot spot."
"Prices in Fairfield remain high because of the demand from New York people with tremendous incomes," he continued. "If salaries and bonuses on Wall Street were adjusted down to meet the hue and cry to do that, it would have an impact on the ability to purchase expensive homes. So would interest rates moving up to 8 percent."

HEADLINE: As Diesel Goes Up, Businesses Say Prices May Follow 

BYLINE:  By JEFF HOLTZ 

 BODY:
JIM PALMER hopes an increase in the cost to pumping fuel into his trucks does not result in a rise in the cost of pouring milk at the table.
 Mr. Palmer, fleet manager for Guida's Milk and Ice Cream, which deploys 115 trucks from four Connecticut locations, said the recent 44 percent increase in Connecticut's diesel fuel tax would cost his company an additional $60,000 a year and could force Guida's to raise prices within the next six months. 
 "We've been able to hold the line on our product pricing, but we don't know that we can do it indefinitely," he said. "We hoping that the tax is repealed soon so that we won't have to impact our customers." 
Michael McGuffie, the owner of New England Bark Mulch and Playground Surfacing in Winsted, has already increased his prices by more than 5 percent to make up for the added cost of running 30 trucks.
"Nobody has enough margin in their business nowadays not to pass it on," he said. "It just isn't there."
The diesel tax increase was agreed to in a special session of the State Legislature in June, which was held to rework the budget in the face of a growing deficit.
Chris Cooper, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said recently that the increase "was a product of bi-partisan negotiations between the governor and General Assembly."
Mr. Cooper said the eight-cent hike enabled Connecticut's diesel tax to remain competitive with that of neighboring states.
"Some difficult decisions had to be made based on the state's fiscal situation," Mr. Cooper said. "Over the past eight years, the governor cut taxes in the state by $2 billion dollars, and every family and every business enjoyed the benefits of those tax cuts. But after seven years of budget surplus, we face some lean times. Clearly, the choices before the Legislature and the governor were not easy ones, and this is an example of that."
But many in the business community said the increased tax, which went into effect Aug. 1, is escalating the costs of goods and services and damaging the state's economy.
Michael J. Riley, president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, a lobbying group of 1,200 companies, said the state's 30-cent total per gallon tax on diesel fuel was not competitive with places like Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New Jersey, whose numbers are closer to 20 cents.
Mr. Riley said the increase was keeping many interstate truckers from filling up in Connecticut.
"When a truck stops in Connecticut, it spends more money here by the driver buying food, or getting repairs, or picking up supplies, or going to the movies, or staying at a motel," Mr. Riley said. "All those economic activities generate revenue to Connecticut businesses and tax revenue to the state."
One state official, Marc S. Ryan, said the tax increase was partly designed to cut down on interstate truck traffic in Connecticut. Mr. Ryan, the state's budget director, said the hope is that there will be decreased truck congestion on the highways and lead to savings on road maintenance and repairs.
"We felt this tax was the least harmful to the economy," he said. "There are a lot of states doing all types of tax increases, and we think this one has a relatively modest impact."
Gerard Barrieau Jr., the president of Barrieau Moving and Storage in Hartford, which primarily moves families within the state and around the country, has passed on a 4-percent fuel surcharge to his customers because of the higher diesel tax, which he calls "discriminatory and counterproductive to doing any kind of positive business in Connecticut." 
He said he believed the politicians should have split a smaller increase between diesel and gas.
"Not that many trucking companies vote, compared to the number of people who drive automobiles who vote, and it's an election year," Mr. Barrieau said. "This is pure politics."
State Representative Andrea L. Stillman, vice chairwoman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said the diesel tax increase came at the recommendation of the governor. She added that it was too early to tell whether the increase will have a significant impact on prices.
"I don't think it's a very big increase," she said. "I think there are increases in other costs of goods and services that might increase prices over all. I don't think it's strictly Connecticut that could be impacted, if at all."
But Carroll J. Hughes, a lobbyist for the refuse hauling industry, said the schools, restaurants, apartment complexes and municipalities serviced by the five large companies in the Hartford area that he represents would soon be seeing an increase in the cost of trash removal.
Mr. Hughes said his clients' vehicles are more reliant on diesel fuel because of frequent stops and compaction systems.
"They had just increased their prices about four weeks before the tax was imposed because of the major tonage charge that was passed on by the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority to try to pay off the Enron losses," he said, referring to the $220 million dollars in state funds loaned to Enron by the authority. "So they basically felt uncomfortable about sending out another increase so soon.
"They will be passing it on, but it probably won't happen for another month or two." 
Some legislators said they did not agree with the diesel tax increase, but were in favor of the overall budget. Some said they will review the performance of the tax in the next legislative session.
"This wasn't an issue that came up in a cavalier fashion," said Moira K. Lyons, the speaker of the House. "As with everything, we will be having a larger shortfall moving forward in the new year, and at that point we are going to be looking at everything. We clearly will be looking at this tax to see if it has had a negative impact on business, and if it has not been the revenue provider that we thought."
In the meantime, homeowners using oil heat are already seeing the cost of heat go up, said Jim Vitali, the president of Tuxis Ohr's Fuel in Meriden.
"Unfortunately, in the oil business, the prices fluctuate so much on a daily basis, they may not see it specifically associated with it, but it's there," he said. "Unfortunately, it can be blamed on some world crisis than on this diesel fuel increase."

HEADLINE: Hard to Shake Labels: Disabled and Jobless 

BYLINE:  By MAGGIE JACKSON

 BODY:
Cathy Sam has been looking for a secretarial job for more than a year, and sometimes, even though she lands an interview, she literally cannot get in the door. Ms. Sam, who has cerebral palsy, can be interviewed only at companies that can accommodate her wheelchair.
 "When they call, I have to make sure to tell them I have a disability," Ms. Sam said as she waited in line to enter a job fair in Manhattan last week for people with disabilities. "Sometimes they're not accessible, and I can't do the interview." 
 The city's job market is bleak for many people, but for those with disabilities, the picture is especially discouraging. Although some companies are doing more to recruit and accommodate them, the disabled face particularly daunting obstacles, notably employers' skittishness about hiring them and, in a weakened economy, stiffening competition for scarce openings from highly skilled rivals without physical impairments.
For some, the frustration of a fruitless search for work is reaching near despair. Many people with disabilities consider themselves an overlooked minority, whose status has improved only marginally since the signing of the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act. The law prohibits discrimination against disabled people and mandates that most employers make "reasonable" accommodations for them.
While definitions of disability vary, about 20 percent of Americans age 21 to 64 -- or 30 million people -- have a disability, according to the latest census data. Of those, 57 percent were employed nationwide in 2000, while just over half of disabled people age 21 to 64 were employed in the New York metropolitan region, the census data showed.
More recent data for New York is unavailable, but anecdotal reports from disabled job seekers and from the nonprofit and governmental groups that help them point to a worsening market.
"People with disabilities have been left out of the whole employment process, even back in the 1990's when the economy was booming," said Jeffrey Klare, an organizer of the Disability Career Expo last Tuesday and chief executive of Equality Staffing, which specializes in placing people with disabilities.
"We're not looking for charity," he said, "we're looking for opportunities."
The stigma of having a disability is so strong that many with "invisible" impairments, like mental illnesses, try to keep their condition secret while job hunting. "You tell them everything but that," said Burdy Jean-Louis who was found to have schizophrenia at age 16.
The job fair at the New Yorker Hotel drew about 800 job seekers who dropped off their resumes and questioned representatives from more than 30 corporations, nonprofits and government agencies, including Microsoft, HSBC Bank USA, Pitney Bowes, I.B.M., the Customs Service and the National Security Agency. Seeing-eye dogs and their owners squeezed past sign-language users and people in wheelchairs.
But for all the welcoming atmosphere, many could not shake an ingrained suspicion that the event might be mostly window dressing. "You guys are going to look over these resumes, aren't you?" one participant demanded of Monica Reed, a consultant representing Bristol-Myers Squibb. Ms. Reed said yes, but suggested looking for jobs posted on the company Web site.
Such skepticism was voiced repeatedly by the job-seekers. "The concern for them is, are these companies here to hire, or is this just a dog and pony show?" Mr. Klare said. He timed the fair to follow National Disability Employment Awareness Month in October.
Jose Goico, who has a visual impairment, said interviewers were dubious when he applied for work in bulk duplicating, although he held such a job at the New York City Department of Environmental Protection for eight years. He has done temporary work and taken courses since being laid off in 1997. "I've gone to a lot of job interviews, and they're always concerned about how I'm going to do it," Mr. Goico said, shifting a white cane so he could hand in a resume. 
Still, in the last decade, many companies have taken steps to help, partly because of the federal disabilities law and partly because the business case for a diversified work force is gaining acceptance. More than 80 percent of companies have made their sites accessible to the disabled and 60 percent have modified equipment to accommodate them, according to a study in 2000 by researchers at Cornell. And half of American companies and 60 percent of large corporations questioned in a 1999 survey of 813 companies by the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., said they actively recruited people with disabilities.
In recent years, for example, I.B.M. named 35 line managers nationwide to help their division interview, hire and accommodate people with impairments. The company also visits college agencies for the disabled, not just job fairs, when visiting campuses.
"We've moved away from the moral obligation to do something right, to the strategic necessity to do this," said Jim Sinocchi, a wheelchair-user who is I.B.M.'s director for diversity communications and a chairman of its executive task force on people with disabilities. 
Nationwide, the job market for some disabled people has improved in the last decade. The employment rate of disabled people age 18 to 64 who say they can work rose to 56 percent in 2000 from 46 percent in 1986, according to the National Organization on Disability in Washington. But for some, that is scant comfort. "People have the legal protection to work and have many outlets and resources to get work, yet there's a strong culture of discrimination," said Brewster Thackeray, a spokesman for the nonprofit group.
Advocates for the disabled also say they are at greater risk of being laid off, sometimes because they have less seniority than their colleagues and sometimes because of their spotty job histories. In New York, the market is tough in the custodial, mailroom and retail sectors, but better in nonprofit and hospitality fields, agencies report.
"We placed people in the spring and summer, and they are getting laid off," said Susan Jouard, director for community relations for Fedcap Rehabilitation Services, the city's largest nonprofit group that trains people with disabilities for entry-level jobs. Fedcap placed 44 people in the private sector in the first nine months of 2002, compared with 54 people in the year-earlier period.
"It's harder to find a permanent job, harder to get your foot in the door," Ms. Jouard said. "They're not on a level playing field with the other candidates out there."

HEADLINE: Farmer Moves Cheese Back To Grass Roots 

BYLINE:  By MARGE PERRY 

DATELINE: VERNON 

 BODY:
JONATHAN WHITE loves mold. His face lights up when he talks about the humidity and temperature under which his three favorite strains of mold flourish, and his background as a cheese maker and a scientist is evident. 
 But in the next breath, he sounds more like a theologian. 
 "There is a magic to the alchemy of converting milk to cheese," Mr. White said. "We coax a process that would happen innocently in nature, and it is like re-enacting creation. When I watch my cheeses in the later stages in the ripening room, it's like making babies." 
It is the combination of science and philosophy that impassion Mr. White, a Hoboken native, in his newest venture, Bobolink Dairy, a 200-acre farm in Vernon. He established Bobolink shortly after leaving Egg Farm Dairy, an award-winning cheesemaking company that he founded in 1993 in Peekskill, N.Y. At Bobolink, he goes further back in the cheese-making process. This time, he starts with raising his own cows.
"I know milk from cows who graze in pastures rather than feeding on grain in the barn makes better-tasting cheese," Mr. White said while working in his kitchen. "And I want to create a model for sustainable farming. I want to show farmers that cheese making can help liberate them from the bad economics of American industrialized farming. And this life, on the farm, is just better for my family."
As if on cue, his wife and partner, Nina, comes into the room just as the first of a stream of friends nudges up to the kitchen table, piled high with bags from the nearby farmers' market in Warwick, N.Y., wine glasses, freshly baked breads, vases overflowing with fresh-cut flowers, plates and short lengths of 1-inch steel pipe. 
All the while, Mr. White, 46, hops up and down from the crowded table, tending still more breads in his large commercial oven, sauteing the famous black dirt garlic grown in this region to make pasta sauce for the children, tossing rosy chops of grass-fed veal with more of the garlic and sel gris -- and never losing his train of thought.
"Cheese making in the United States has been industrialized from the start," he said. "Truth is, the industrialized raw milk market turns dairy farmers into serfs, slaving away to barely earn enough money to feed their families. But the old dairy farming story is, you might lose a penny a pound, but you'll make it up in volume." 
Mr. White believes that by showing farmers how to go back to raising cows in pastures, rather than confining them in barns, he can help increase the farmers' profits. Grazing cows produce less milk than confined cows, but at substantially less cost, he said. In his model for making a grazing dairy farm successful, Bobolink naturally produces cheese. "And, of course, grazing cows produce superior milk, and you can taste the difference in the cheese," he said, smiling broadly.
His newly arrived cows -- "pregnant teenage redheads," he said with boyish glee -- will not produce milk until January, so the cheeses he is selling now are made on an Amish farm in Lancaster, Pa., under his tutelage, then ripened in one of two Bobolink ripening rooms. It is during the ripening process, as they develop their moldy rind, that the cheeses are imbued with the complexity and depth of flavor for which Mr. White became known at Egg Dairy Farm. 
Mr. White bartered for the Amish cheeses, as he barters for much of what his family eats. He taught the Amish farmers how to make mold-ripened cheese, and in return he takes a portion of the cheeses to ripen and sell on his farm. The Amish farmers, for their part, taught Mr. White how to raise cows that graze freely on grass pastures and hay.
The kinship of cheese to cows led seamlessly to raising chickens. The neighbors and associates to whom Mr. White offered knowledge and a seat at his table led to the addition of sheep in his pastures (he taught the sheep breeder to make cheese in exchange for 12 of the animals) and horses in his stable (from a neighboring farm) as well as ham on his table (cured by his Amish collaborators) and advice, when he needs it, on matters like growing the ideal grazing grass for cows.
Philosophical and economic reasons aside, cheese made from cows that are allowed to graze freely on pastures, rather than confined in a barn and fed grain from a silo, does taste different. The difference is also apparent by the smell in the ripening rooms. Most Bobolink cheeses are ripened no more than 90 days, and the herbaceous aroma is evident early in the process.
As quickly as the pungent smell hits the nose, the eyes adjust to the dim lighting and a muted rainbow of golden, turquoise and garnet growth on the cheeses appears. Like boys before they grow whiskers, the less-aged cheeses have barely a hint of fuzz, while the mature blocks have a dense growth of more deeply colored fur covering their surfaces.
Mr. White carefully wipes the soft mold from a wheel of his Frolic cheese. Frolic, the Amish word for a neighborly collaboration like a barn raising, is a good word to describe many of Mr. White's endeavors both on his farm and off. 
On a personal level, farm life allows the Whites' three children -- Jacob, 9; Tobias, 11; and Paula, 14 -- to flourish. Jacob is autistic, and is especially peaceful in the company of cows and when baking bread, his parents said. "The physical release of getting the kids outdoors gets them integrated the way nothing else can," Nina White said. "They love being in a lot of open space, of having a lot of room to function." The Whites believe that farm work can lead to more fulfilling and productive roles for developmentally challenged men and women, and they say they hope to start an internship program on the farm toward that end. 
This may seem a bit too idealistic a picture of life in a bygone era, but at the heart of it all is a 21st-century businessman. 
"The Internet is great -- I can be a global village cheese maker," Mr. White said. "I'm not using distributors and not offering credit to retailers. I keep it simple and there's no hassle about getting paid. It's a quality-of-life thing for my family, and I want to show other farmers they can produce high-quality, economically and ecologically sustainable products. And I do plan on paying for college! I may not get rich and retire tomorrow, but I'll make a decent living."
The Whites' retail shop on the farm at 42 Meadowburn Road in Vernon is open every Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Additional holiday hours and more information on visiting Bobolink or ordering products online are on its Web site, www.cowsoutside.com. The shop sells Bobolink cheeses ($15 a pound) and wood-fired hearth breads ($2.50 to 3.50 a pound) and smoked salmon from Perona Farms ($22 a pound), which Mr. White carries, he said, to "support my habit."

HEADLINE: New Curbs on Predatory Loans 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
GEORGE POPE doesn't read well.
 Mr. Pope, 62, a disabled former tool and die maker, has lived in the same wood-frame home on Farmers Boulevard in Southeast Queens since he was 6 years old. Now he is facing foreclosure. 
 A mortgage broker knocked on his door in 1998 and persuaded Mr. Pope to take out a refinance loan with monthly payments of $535. Mr. Pope lives on $558 a month in Supplemental Security Income. 
"Not being able to read," he said, "I got a loan that was predatory and I didn't know it."
Had Mr. Pope signed the same loan papers after April 3, 2003, he would not be in danger of losing his home. That is when a new New York State law -- praised by advocates as a pioneering step against predatory lending -- goes into effect.
The New York law "is a watershed event in the national movement toward predatory lending legislation," said George W. McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation who monitors foreclosures across the country.
Sarah Ludwig, executive director of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, a fair-credit access organization based in Manhattan, said: "It's a huge victory for New Yorkers because, for the first time, this state has strong protections for borrowers against some of the worst abusive practices. It puts New York among a handful of states that have addressed this problem through comprehensive legislation."
Most of the laws either passed or pending in that handful of states -- including a strong version awaiting a vote in the New Jersey Senate -- start by specifying what constitutes a "high cost" mortgage. They do that by setting a threshold on the annual percentage rate that the borrower pays, or on the level of points and fees added onto the principal.
High-cost loans can be perfectly legal. But they become illegal if the lenders engage in certain practices that the laws, in varying ways, proscribe as predatory -- including, for instance, loan flipping, balloon payments or, most important, not certifying that the borrower can afford the payments.
A bill following that basic approach, but with provisions that both advocates of legislation and banking officials say would be among the toughest in the nation, was recently passed by the New York City Council. It was vetoed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who objected to several provisions. But Council officials say they have enough votes to override the veto.
For Assemblywoman Aurelia Greene, who as chairwoman of the New York State Assembly Banks Committee was the lead sponsor of the new state law, "it ranks as one of my greatest accomplishments because it represents such a large cadre of citizens across the state." Ms. Greene, a Bronx Democrat, said her committee had gathered data on "large numbers of people losing their homes upstate, so it's not just the city."
"What really motivated me," she said, "was a moment three years ago when we held hearings. A 90-year-old woman testified that she was about to be evicted. She was deliberately duped."
Predatory lending is the dark seam of the otherwise legitimate and necessary subprime mortgage industry that has expanded exponentially over the last decade, serving borrowers with bad or merely blemished credit histories. But as the subprime market has surged, so, too, has predatory lending.
The New York law, signed by Gov. George E. Pataki on Oct. 3, follows much the same footprints as legislation passed in recent years by North Carolina, Georgia and California -- measures that go further, in differing ways, than federal regulations prohibiting predatory practices.
And while Connecticut passed a law last year that, in the estimation of several advocates, did not advance the federal regulations, the New Jersey Assembly overwhelmingly approved a strong bill in June that is now being debated by the State Senate, and which Gov. James E. McGreevey has publicly supported. "It's unpredictable what the Senate may do," said the bill's chief sponsor, Assemblyman Matt Ahearn, a Democrat from Fair Lawn, "particularly since there's a 20-20 tie in the Senate."
In New York City, on Oct. 23, Mayor Bloomberg vetoed a bill, passed 44 to 5 by the City Council, that in one significant way -- a stricter version of a legal concept called "assignee liability" -- would have gone further than any other legislation in the nation.
Under assignee liability, a victim of predatory practices has legal recourse not only against the lender who originated the loan, but also against financial institutions in the so-called secondary market. That is, any financial entity that bought shares in what are called "bundles" of securitized mortgages -- and that includes the biggest financial houses on Wall Street. (The victim could sue for damages or to have the loan entirely reformulated.)
The City Council bill, however, takes assignee liability even further: barring the city from doing business with any entity that originates predatory loans or buys them as part of a bundle. And Council Speaker Gifford A. Miller, its chief sponsor, says he has the 34 votes needed to override the veto.
As Ms. Ludwig, the credit-access advocate, put it: "What's significant is that the city would be saying that no municipal dollars will go to any financial institution engaging in abusive lending practices, with potentially huge implications if you think about how much money gets invested by the city's pension funds and all the contracts the city undertakes."
The secondary market in securitized mortgage bundles, Ms. Ludwig added, "ensures a steady reinfusion of cash to the lenders so they can continue the cycle."
Representatives of major financial institutions contend, however, that the City Council's assignee liability provision would damage the availability of mortgages to the vast majority of subprime borrowers. Michael Williams, vice president for legislative affairs for the Bond Market Association, said, "Because our members would weigh the tradeoff between participating in the subprime market or the municipal market, there will be a retraction in the availability of credit." The association represents the city's major bond underwriters, including Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.

Delinquent Borrowers
Subprime Loans Rise; Foreclosures Surge
The movement to prohibit predatory lending is a reaction to the surge in subprime lending for both home purchases and refinancings -- and a parallel explosion in foreclosures.
Between 1993 and 2000, according to data collected by the Federal Reserve, the proportion of subprime loans jumped from 2 percent of the national mortgage market to 13.4 percent. In the refinance segment alone, subprime loans bounded to 25.3 percent of the entire refinance market in 2000. 
And since 1993, foreclosures have risen by 68 percent, with actions against subprime borrowers far outpacing those against prime-market borrowers.
Citing the Federal Reserve data, Dr. McCarthy at the Ford Foundation pointed out that in 1993 there were 6.9 million loans originated in the entire mortgage market, of which 126,000 were subprime. By 2000, when a total of 7.8 million loans were made, 1.1 million were subprime. "The prime market had no growth, while the subprime market increased by a magnitude of 7," Dr. McCarthy said.
"Importantly," he continued, "while foreclosures in the prime market have fallen since 1993, foreclosures in the subprime market were high enough to push the overall market to all-time highs for foreclosures." In 1993, there were 401,000 foreclosures in the entire market. This year, based on projections by the Mortgage Bankers Association, there will be 677,000 foreclosures -- a 68 percent jump. "And that includes a 20 percent drop for foreclosures in the prime market, taken separately," Dr. McCarthy said.

Fraudulent Practices
Targets: Refinancers, First-Time Buyers
Given the two segments of the market -- home purchase and refinance -- predatory lending essentially takes two forms.
In the home-purchase category it is, particularly, first-time buyers seeking loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration who are targeted. Typically, real estate brokers, acting as "one-stop shops," buy rundown properties for low prices, often at foreclosure auctions, and "flip" them at higher prices. They hire contractors to perform cosmetic repairs, then tell fledgling buyers that no inspection is needed.
The brokers employ appraisers who intentionally overstate the value of the properties. They provide a lawyer for the buyer at the closing, when the borrower signs a thick stack of documents. And in qualifying the mortgage, they often falsify the buyer's income -- attesting to, perhaps, rent from nonexistent tenants -- to secure an F.H.A.-backed loan.
"Let's say the property is worth $150,000," said Josh Zinner, coordinator of the Foreclosure Prevention Project at South Brooklyn Legal Services. "The loan won't be for that amount; it will be for the over-appraised amount, say $225,000." 
"The borrower ends up with a property in lousy shape, often with significant structural defects," Mr. Zinner continued, "and with an unaffordable mortgage covering far more than the value of the property."
When the buyer almost inevitably goes into default for nonpayment -- or, perhaps, cannot afford a second loan to pay for repairs -- the lender forecloses. And after the foreclosure auction, the lender will be reimbursed through the F.H.A. insurance for the full over-appraised value.
Most predatory practices, however, involve a refinance loan in which brokers or fraudulent home-repair contractors, acting as bird dogs for lenders, go door to door in poor neighborhoods.
They target people who bought at a low price, or an older person on a fixed income who may have purchased in the 1950's or 60's, and whose property values have climbed significantly.
"The typical borrower is equity rich but cash poor," said Ms. Ludwig of the neighborhood advocacy project, "and, therefore, these loans are unaffordable. People end up jeopardizing their most valuable asset and, sometimes, their only real asset -- the home."
The house may need a new roof. But the repair contract will add other items -- a remodeled bathroom, perhaps -- leveraging the borrower into a higher-cost loan. "At that stage, the broker takes over, refers the loan to a lender, adds broker's fees onto the principal," Mr. Zinner said. "These fees often bear little relation to the value of services provided." The fees are labeled as points -- a term used in most borrowings to describe loan costs beyond the interest rate -- with each point representing 1 percent of the principal.
Often, refinance loans are packed with unsecured debt, perhaps from high-interest-rate credit cards, again jacking up the principal. And while the interest rate may be lower when that debt is folded in, the home is now at risk as the loan's collateral.

Victims of Predators
Minority Borrowers Are Often Exploited
Loan terms that are beneficial for prime mortgages are likely to be predatory in the subprime market. Balloon payments, for example, may be appropriate for a co-op that plans to restructure its underlying mortgage after a certain period, or for the home buyer who is moving in a few years. (With balloon payments, lower interest is paid for, perhaps, five years, but then the entire principal comes due.)
But in a predatory scenario, while a balloon loan seems affordable at first because monthly payments tend to be low, many borrowers are shocked when the entire principal comes due and -- unable to pay it -- they are served with a foreclosure notice.
"And that is used by brokers and lenders to insure that the homeowner will need to refinance, yet again, to avoid foreclosure," Ms. Ludwig said, "while the broker and lender hit the cash register again, collecting more points, more fees, stripping out more equity and putting the borrower in a new loan that yet again does not benefit -- typically -- her."
The burden falls disproportionately on African-Americans. 
In 1999, the Department of Housing and Urban Development conducted a study, "The Unequal Burden: Income and Racial Disparities in Subprime Lending," which found that upper-income African-American homeowners across the nation were twice as likely to hold subprime loans as low-income white homeowners. In the New York area, high-income African-Americans were four times as likely as low-income whites to have subprime loans.
Not surprisingly, it is the uninformed who are most preyed upon. In 1999, Dr. McCarthy said, Fannie Mae, the federally chartered mortgage purchase corporation, analyzed its portfolio and found that half of its subprime borrowers should have been in the prime market, paying lower interest rates and fees.

New York State
When a Loan Becomes Predatory
The new New York State law takes several steps to protect the uninformed -- including, significantly, prohibiting any mortgage a borrower cannot afford.
The law defines a loan as high cost, though not necessarily predatory, in two ways. First, if it carries an annual percentage rate that is higher than 8 percentage points above the prevailing rate for a Treasury bond that matures over the same period. (The annual percentage rate is not just the interest rate, but the actual annual cost once points and fees are factored in.)
A mortgage is also high cost, the law says, if the points and fees exceed 5 percent of the principal. A $100,000 loan, for example, would be designated as high cost if $5,000 in points and fees were added on.
High-cost loans become illegal, the law says, if they employ certain predatory practices or don't meet certain requirements:
*No loan can be made "without due regard to repayment ability," determined by "independent verification" of the borrower's income, assets and debts.
*Loan flipping -- refinancing a loan without "tangible net benefit" to the borrower -- is prohibited. "Sometimes borrowers have loans flipped four, five times and are left with no equity as points and fees strip out the value of their homes," Ms. Ludwig said.
*Balloon payments -- defined as "a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments" -- are prohibited within the first 15 years of the loan.
*Lenders are required to provide borrowers with a list of HUD-certified mortgage counselors.
*Under assignee liability, a borrower may take legal action against either the originator of the loan or against any entity that subsequently bought a securitized bundle including the predatory mortgage -- potentially leading to a refund of all points and fees or reformulation of the entire loan. And for the first time, a borrower can raise violations of the law as a defense against foreclosure.
George Pope, the disabled tool and die maker from Queens, might have been protected by the new state law.
Mr. Pope underwent cardiac catheterization this past Monday at Elmhurst Hospital Center after his fifth heart attack since Sept. 3, 1993, the day fire gutted the home he has lived in for 56 years -- a house for which the original mortgage had long before been fully paid.
Mr. Zinner of the foreclosure prevention project said Mr. Pope had first been victimized by insurance adjusters and home-repair contractors who left the fire-damaged house with serious code violations -- and Mr. Pope still under a mountain of debt to pay for the repairs.
In 1998, Mr. Pope took out one loan to finance that debt. Soon after, another broker talked him into flipping. "He took out a $58,467 loan to refinance the loan he had taken out only five months previously," Mr. Zinner said. "He was getting Supplemental Security Income of $558 a month, and the new payments were $535 a month."
"They told me the second loan was going to pay off the first one," Mr. Pope said. "I didn't understand what that meant."
Between the broker's fee, the origination fee and something called a yield spread premium, the points on the new loan came to 6.3 percent. The yield spread premium "is a payment from a lender to the broker in exchange for bringing the loan in at a higher interest than the borrower otherwise would have qualified for," Mr. Zinner said. "In this case the broker was already receiving a fee financed out of the proceeds of the loan, raising the principal. So the broker's getting paid two ways here."
"Although this loan was very abusive," Mr. Zinner continued, "it did not violate federal or state law as it existed at the time the loan was made."
To stave off a foreclosure sale scheduled for last September, Mr. Pope filed for bankruptcy, which is pending, and asked for legal assistance from the foreclosure prevention project. Of the lenders, he said, "They took my dream and ran with it."

New York City
A Strict Measure Causes Debate
The New York City Council bill that Mayor Bloomberg vetoed -- but could come up for an override vote on Nov. 20 -- would set even stricter thresholds than the state law for what constitutes a high-cost loan: an annual percentage rate of 6 percentage points, rather than 8 percentage points, above the comparable Treasury bond; and points and fees that are no more than 4 percent, rather than 5 percent, of the overall loan amount.
"We believe New Yorkers don't want their government doing business with people involved in predatory lending," Speaker Miller said. "We also know that a lot of banks and securities firms that do business with the city are good actors and are not engaged in these practices."
"But some may have affiliates or are tangentially involved in these practices," the speaker continued, "and we want to give them a chance to cure those practices without dragging their names through the mud." The bill calls for the city comptroller to confidentially approach a financial entity that has knowingly or unknowingly participated in predatory lending and give it an opportunity to remedy the problem. Ultimately, the comptroller could bar that entity from municipal business for three years.
Bertha Lewis, executive director of New York Acorn, an organization that has stridently lobbied for predatory lending legislation, believes the mayor "should be proud to sign this law, because New York City could say it only does business with companies that set the highest standards."
But in his veto message, Mayor Bloomberg called the bill defective, saying, "It would enact legal requirements that conflict with, and would be pre-empted by, those established elsewhere in state law."
And while not directly addressing the financial impact of the bill's assignee liability provision, the mayor wrote that "it proposes a lengthy and administratively burdensome scheme that prohibits the city from doing business with financial institutions that either engage in such practices themselves or have investments that include loans that were obtained through such practices."
That, he said, "would curtail the executive powers of the mayor by injecting the comptroller into the city's contracting process and into enforcement and implementation of the law."
Michael P. Smith, president of the New York State Bankers Association, said that if the City Council bill became law, it had the potential to restrict the availability of credit in the subprime market. "We have city legislation where the thresholds are well below the state level," Mr. Smith said. "There is a reluctance on the part of many banks to make loans over the thresholds, thereby shrinking the high-cost market."
There is, however, some indication that predatory lending legislation might not shrink the market.
In July, at his company's request, Kenneth Posner, a mortgage analyst at Morgan Stanley, conducted a nationwide survey of 280 managers of companies that offer subprime loans, including some at major lenders like Household Finance and CitiFinancial. Pointing out that the findings are not specific to any state, Mr. Posner said the study found "that 84 percent of our respondents thought changed lending practices were having a neutral to positive impact on volume" -- the number of loans originated. And, he said, the branch managers expected volume to increase by about 35 percent this year over last.
"Thirty percent of the branch managers, in fact, saw the standards as good for business by improving borrower confidence," Mr. Posner said. "Enhanced disclosures are making borrowers feel more comfortable about the lending process."

HEADLINE: The Rules in New Jersey and Connecticut 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
WHILE Connecticut passed a law a year ago that virtually mirrors federal predatory-lending statutes -- and, therefore, in the opinion of consumer advocates, did not advance the protection of potential victims -- a stronger bill was passed, 61 to 7, by the New Jersey Assembly on June 13 and is now being debated by the Senate.
 "Our state's bill certainly is one of the strongest in the country," said Ken Zimmerman, executive director of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, an advocacy group. "It takes the legitimate interests of both victims and responsible, mainstream lenders into account." 
 The New Jersey bill defines a "high cost," mortgage as one that carries an annual percentage rate higher than 8 percentage points above the prevailing rate for a comparable Treasury bond, or points and fees that exceed 5 percent of the principal.
The loan becomes predatory if it does not meet certain requirements, or if the lender engages in certain practices. Among the requirements, a lender must accurately certify a borrower's ability to repay the loan. A borrower may not finance more than 2 percent of the principal for points and fees, either by making the points and fees part of the loan's principal or by paying them with a separate loan. If points and fees are financed, rather than being paid up front, the borrower must receive counseling from a credible third party.
The bill also includes an "assignee liability" provision, under which, if the loan violates the law, a borrower can seek legal redress against a lender or a financial entity that has purchased the mortgage. The law's provisions also can be used as a defense against foreclosure.
For the bill's chief sponsor, Assemblyman Matt Ahearn, Democrat of Fair Lawn, the assignee liability provision "is key."
"The bank advocates say we are abrogating hundreds of years of common law," Mr. Ahearn said. "But when business people deal with each other, they're on equal footing. When it's a consumer, particularly senior citizens, dealing with a slick lender, the balance of negotiating power swings far to the side of the lender."
The Connecticut law reflects the less stringent requirements of the federal Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, which was enacted in 1994. It defines a loan as high cost if its annual percentage rate exceeds a comparable Treasury bond by 10 percentage points, or if its points and fees are more than 8 percent of the principal.
The Connecticut law prohibits, among other things, balloon payments on loans with terms of less than seven years and extending a loan to someone if the monthly payment exceeds 50 percent of the borrower's monthly gross income. It contains a limited assignee-liability provision.

HEADLINE: Goodbye Rat Race, Hello Road Race 

BYLINE:  By NANCY HAGGERTY 

 BODY:
TWELVE years ago, Don Fink didn't know how to swim.
 That is somewhat amazing, considering that Mr. Fink, 44, a resident of Short Hills, is now a full-time triathlete and coach. 
 Equally noteworthy is that just two years ago, he spent most of his time running from meeting to meeting as Citibank's managing director for private banking in the mid-Atlantic states.
Today Mr. Fink, who was named to last year's Inside Triathlon and USA Triathlon All-American teams, has become one of the world's best triathletes in his age group. 
He took his first steps in that direction many years ago, racing cousins on the sand of the Jersey Shore. He was fast. Success made for enjoyment.
In his junior high school years, his parents would rise to find footprints in the snow leading from their Scotch Plains home. Mr. Fink would get up at 4 a.m. to run every day, believing, as he still does, that regular training leads to improvement bit by bit.
"When I look back, I don't remember anyone teaching this to me, but it's how I've approached it every day," he said. He trains 10 to 30 hours a week 
But Mr. Fink did not spend 30-plus years working to become an international athlete. While attending Lehigh University on a partial track and cross-country scholarship, he quit competitive running because of injuries. After graduating in 1980 with a degree in finance and economics, he ran only to bolster his tennis game. He was highly competitive on the court, but most of his energies were directed toward his banking career.
It wasn't until he married in 1990 that Mr. Fink became interested in triathlons. He started swimming and biking simply because his wife, Melanie, did.
Everything changed after he entered a sprint triathlon (a half-mile swim, three-mile run and 15-mile bike effort) in 1991.
"The fact I didn't do that well made it sort of intriguing to me," he said. Improvement then became a "sort of fun project."
He and his wife were soon spending vacations at triathlon camps or working individually with top coaches. Before and after work, he would train, rising at 4 a.m., as he had in junior high, to put in two to three hours.
"Time went by very quickly,"' Mr. Fink said. "The years just flew by. I had such a demanding job and hobby that a five- or six-year period seemed like a week."
His training, heavy on aerobic development that included constant monitoring of his heart rate, started leading to achievements. In 1997, he became the national 35-to-39-year-old division Long Course (half-triathlon) champion. 
In what free time he had, he found himself writing training plans for friends who were impressed by his results.
In 1998, at the Ironman Triathlon World Championship, the arduous competition in Hawaii that involves a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike course and a 26.2-mile run, Mr. Fink finished second in his age group and in the top 20 over all. Then, in 1999, he was the first American finisher of any age in the 1999 Ironman European Championship.
But he wasn't satisfied.
"I'd leave a meeting, fly to Germany and run a race, and then fly back the next day," Mr. Fink said. "This was an interesting journey I found myself on, and I wanted to enjoy it more."
So, he left Citibank in spring 2000 on a leave of absence. He has not gone back.
Instead, Mr. Fink, whose costly travel is covered by both national and local business sponsors, is competing at the highest levels and making his living by coaching. A small part of that is a twice-weekly swim class at the Y in Bridgewater. Most of the people who take the class are triathletes. 
"One of the neat things in my life, and it hits me once in a while while on the deck, is the thought that 12 years ago I didn't know how to swim," Mr. Fink said. 
Most of his coaching is by Internet and phone. He oversees 50 triathletes and 30 runners in the United States, Canada and Europe, and he has a long waiting list of potential clients.
"I'm convinced people all have a secret life they want to live," he said. "But it's tough and risky to take that step. I truly believe anybody can make a living at their passion. All that's needed is a little guts. A lot of people with a lot of money are real miserable. I wake up every morning and I'm real excited."
Mr. Fink, who hasn't closed the door on returning to the financial world (he is often glued to the business news on television when training indoors), said his typical client was 30 to 55 years old, married with children and had a demanding professional life.
"It's the most exciting thing in the world," he said. "I'll be at the finish line and see their kids and I can't help but think their lives will change as a result of seeing their father or mother take on an impossible challenge and succeed."
Mr. Fink doesn't coach young professional "elites who have all day to train," because he doesn't find that interesting or challenging.
But that doesn't mean his athletes are not successful.
Kathleen Hughes, 44, of Columbus, Ohio, became a world champion last year, winning the Hawaiian Ironman in the 40-to-44 age group for women. 
Ms. Hughes, the mother of two, said Mr. Fink had played a huge part in her victory. She is a 15-year triathlete who has trained with him for two years. They keep in constant e-mail contact and talk by phone every couple of weeks.
"Other coaches are more cookie-cutter," she said, noting that he adapted her training schedule to her personal life. "He's very interested in you and what your plans are. He's doing this for the passion of the sport."
A New Jersey client, Jeff Liccardi of Warren, agreed.
Mr. Liccardi, 42, didn't know how to swim when he signed up for Mr. Fink's Bridgewater class two years ago. He was also a slow runner, averaging 11-minute miles over short distances. But last year he did his first marathon in 3:15. This year he finished in the middle of the pack in Ironman USA in Lake Placid, N.Y., which attracted more than 1,500 entrants, more than 20 coached by Mr. Fink.
"He was happier when I finished than I was," said Mr. Liccardi, a father of three who owns auto dealerships in New Jersey. 
"He's the most genuine person," he added. "Obviously he's not doing this for the money. He had a great job. I know a lot of successful people. A lot of people don't love their work, but it pays good money. He has the passion to help people. It takes a lot of courage to do that. Most people are afraid to branch out in a different direction. They want to stay in their comfort zone. That's another reason why I respect him."
Mr. Fink's career change struck a nerve with Richard Haig Jr., 39, of Bridgewater, who owns a security and fire alarm company and has been coached by Mr. Fink for a year and a half.
Several months ago, Mr. Haig, the father of two girls, started a sideline business, FeMaleRacing.com, on multisport training.
Without Mr. Fink, Mr. Haig said he wouldn't be placing in triathlons and might not even be doing them. He said he "absolutely would not have the confidence to go into coaching and look at it as a future career."
In addition to expanding his new business, Mr. Haig, who has completed three Ironman-distance triathlons, finishing third by age bracket in the C.E.O. Challenge division at Lake Placid, plans to do the big event in Hawaii.
The time frame is important because he wants to compete for his father, who has cancer.
"There's no question in my mind that we'll get there, and I mean we, because I couldn't do it without him," he said of Mr. Fink.
Mr. Haig quoted Mr. Fink as saying: "At 35, 40 or 45, you can get better every year for 10 years. It's about training."
"How can you argue with him?" he asked. "He's done it." 
Mr. Fink's goal is to break nine hours at an Ironman (his best time to date is 9:03). He is one of only 35 people chosen to compete this month in the Ultra-Man World Championship in Hawaii. The three-day event makes Ironman races look like light training, with a combined 6.2 miles of swimming, 261 miles of biking and 52 miles of running.
"You always want to push beyond and find something that scares you a little bit," Mr. Fink said.
"It's amazing to think that what I loved at 12 I love at 44, and even more," he added. "Sometimes I wake up and say, 'How'd I get here?' "

HEADLINE: A Taste for the Future 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN KURTZ 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
ASIAN pulled-pork spring rolls aren't what 17-year-old Tyeneara Thompson normally has for breakfast. But this isn't a normal day for Tyeneara, a senior at Montgomery Academy here. It's day one of an internship at Maize, one of the city's sleekest restaurants, and for the next three hours Tyeneara will be swapping books and paper for an education of another kind.
 Her project of the morning? Fifty spring rolls, which must be filled and tightly wrapped so they won't burst in the fryer. Halfway through her first roll, she sees filling poking through the won-ton wrapper, so she unfolds it and starts again, hands growing sticky with pork and egg wash. 
 At her side, the executive chef, Doug Gough, notices her frustration. 
"You can do it," he said. "It's like making a burrito."
For the next six weeks, Mr. Gough will be both coach and cheering section, alternately instructing her in the high-octane ways of the professional kitchen and encouraging her when the pressure seems too much. 
People would pay good money for this kind of one-on-one with a chef. But more is at stake than bragging rights. When Tyeneara graduates from high school next spring, she will do so with three years of culinary training, and her sights will be set not on college but on a full-time job. 
While the goal may seem odd to some, it's right on target for students at Montgomery, a public high school for about 230 special-education students that offers a mix of academic and occupational training. Newark is planning to go further, with an ambitious school-to-career program that promises informational speakers, job shadows, mentoring and internships for all 10,000 public high school students in the city. 
"Over the next three to four years, we'll be redesigning all of the high schools," said Jerry Bruno, director of school to careers and college initiative for the Newark public schools. "Our hope is that students will get the knowledge and experience they need to make wise career choices."
Sharde Smith, 17, is also interning at Maize this fall. But unlike Tyeneara, Sharde spends her mornings in the front of the house, trailing the hostess, waiters and waitresses and learning the finer points of restaurant etiquette. Although it's not as exciting as being in the kitchen, she says she welcomes the opportunity. 
"It is hard work but I like it," said Sharde, also a Montgomery senior, whose experience has reinforced her desire to own a restaurant, a dream she's had since she was 13. "I like being on my feet, I like parties, I like serving people."
That special-education students can get such real-world experiences is exciting for Rich Kazanjian, department chairman for vocational education at Montgomery Academy. 
"It's great for their confidence," he said. "Having had the exposure to a restaurant of this level, they won't be intimidated when they move on to other things." 
In the next few years, Montgomery hopes greatly to expand the number of internship opportunities available to seniors in food service, as well as other career tracks. The goal is to rotate the food-service students through a variety of positions and a range of settings, from mom-and-pop establishments to restaurants like Maize.
"We do everything we can to ease their school-to-work transition," said Mr. Kazanjian, a former restaurant owner who ran the school's culinary program for 12 years. "But most of our attention is focused on the kitchen." Then we realized that there are plenty of employment opportunities in the front of the house.' 
According to the National Restaurant Association, the food service industry is the leading private-sector employer in the country. And the number of hospitality-industry jobs is projected to increase by nearly two million from 1998 to 2008, with 115,000 in management positions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
With so many openings, restaurants are always on the lookout for qualified employees. Maize is no exception. 
"When the restaurant first opened, we had a lot of difficulty getting help," recalled Stephanie Voulgaris, the owner. "There are good people, but we had trouble getting them to come from New York to Newark."
In July 2000, after just two months in business, Ms. Voulgaris became convinced that the solution to her staffing problem lay all around her in the community of Newark.
Discussions with the school district began, and nearly two years later, in April 2002, the first three interns walked through her door. 
In only one week, "you could see the transformation" in the students, said Ms. Voulgaris, who personally oversaw the activities of the two front-of-the-house interns. "But there was a lot of work to do, so I asked if they could come back." 
Everyone agreed, which explains how Tyeneara, Sharde and Tanisha Brown, another Montgomery senior, returned to Maize for another six-week internship this fall. Ultimately, Ms. Voulgaris hopes that some of the interns will return to her restaurant for permanent jobs.
The restaurant's rationale for investing in an internship program is not unusual, according to Katherine Hughes, senior research associate with the Institute on Education and the Economy at Teachers College, Columbia University. During seven years of research for a coming book on work-based learning, Ms. Hughes identified several reasons companies take interns. 
"Some companies, mostly trades, do it because they have trouble getting employees"' she said. "Others do it for philanthropic reasons." 
But even if they "might have gotten their arm twisted in the beginning," she added, "they find it perks everyone up to have a young person around."
After an hour and a half in the kitchen, one of Maize's young interns is finally getting the hang of rolling and wrapping. Rows of spring rolls, 50 in all, lie on a baking sheet ready for the fryer. Tyeneara breathes a sigh of relief. A demanding job, but such is life in the kitchen. 
"It's very hard work, but it's a hard business," she said. "It's a great experience and it will help me when I get my own restaurant."
But right now there's no time for talking. It's 11:52 a.m. and a box of shiitake mushrooms is waiting.

Suddenly, State Universities Have More Allure

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
GROWING up, Jeni R. Mattingly never placed the University of Maryland, her state's leading public institution, at the top of her college shopping list. To her and many of her classmates at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, the university's campus in College Park was too big, too close to home and a bit short on cachet.
 Nevertheless, as the college application season heats up, the university figures prominently in the thinking of Ms. Mattingly, 17, and many of her peers. "Everyone I know is applying," she said, with finances being a chief consideration even in a prosperous Washington suburb like Bethesda. 
 Ms. Mattingly says that she is hoping to avoid a large debt burden after graduation and that she wants to be able to travel during summer vacations. Other students cite stock market reverses and the sluggish economy as reasons many of them, and their parents, are looking to taxpayers to pick up much of the bill for college. 
Students have plenty to cope with in applying to colleges, from filling out myriad forms, writing essays and asking for recommendation letters. On top of that came the report last month from the College Board that tuition at four-year public institutions was up 9.6 percent from last year, more than six times the inflation rate. That followed a 7.7 percent jump last year. For private colleges, the increases were 5.8 percent this year and 6.4 percent last year.
The increases mainly reflected constriction in state budgets caused by the economic downturn. "As tax revenues decline, public colleges have searched for other sources of funding and for many, that has led to tuition increases," said Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board.
Despite the sharp increase, tuition at state-supported colleges in the United States averages $4,081 a year, just 22 percent of the $18,273 average for private institutions. There seems little danger that this mainstay of affordable college education -- for the last 30 years nearly 80 percent of the country's students have been enrolled in tax-supported institutions -- is edging out of broad financial reach.
"Even though they raised the price," said Ms. Mattingly of Maryland's increase of 6.2 percent this year, "it's still really, really low."
Maryland's tuition and mandatory fees, excluding room and board, for in-state students total $5,670 this year -- comparable to those for many other big public universities. But that total is still much less than the average of $25,000 a year, excluding room and board, for Ms. Mattingly's other four options, all private institutions: Mount Holyoke, Bennington and Kalamazoo Colleges and New York University.
The increasing appeal of public institutions is showing up in a surge of inquiries and campus visits. For example, Rutgers, the leading New Jersey state university, says applications for next year are running nearly triple the year-ago pace, while Saturday campus tours have nearly doubled, forcing the school to scramble for extra buses and guides.
Upper-income families, in particular, are more likely to look at state institutions than they did just a few years ago, said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, an association of colleges and universities. In part, this may be a backlash against the pricing strategy of private colleges, which generally has been to raise tuition enough to extract maximum revenue from those who can afford it and to offer enough aid to attract those who cannot. High tuition -- now more than $28,000 a year at many elite private schools -- is often taken as a sign of quality and, not incidentally to some, it provides some snob appeal.
The sluggish economy and a post-Sept. 11 desire to stay closer to home are among the reasons for the rising interest in public schools. But the trend also reflects ever-keener competition for places in top-notch private institutions.
For their part, several states, including Indiana, Georgia and Connecticut, have made themselves more attractive by establishing honors colleges within their universities that allow top students a free or nearly free financial ride. The idea is to prevent their best students from being recruited by other states and to enhance national reputations, said Howard Greene, an education consultant from Westport, Conn., and the author of many books about colleges. "These are some of the best bargains around," Mr. Greene said.
OTHER signs of public universities' growing appeal are the huge premiums that the more prestigious ones -- sometimes referred to as "public Ivies" -- command from out-of-state students. While out-of-staters typically pay two to two and a half times the tuition and fees charged to residents, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor charges $23,738, or three times as much as for state residents, while the University of Virginia charges $19,805, more than four times as much. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where in-state tuition is $3,856, outsiders pay $15,140.
In some cases, out-of-state students may eventually be able to establish residency, to qualify for the lower in-state tuition. Each state has its own requirements, though many will demand proof that a student has had permanent ties for at least a year. Evidence of such links may include registering to vote, getting a driver's license or paying income tax.
Of course, price is only part of any proper calculation of value when choosing a college. A student must "fit" the school in terms of many variables, including departmental and overall academic distinction, social life and the makeup of the student body, because students may learn as much from their peers as from their teachers. Some criteria are hard to judge. A school may have a star-studded faculty, for example, but how much of it is available to undergraduates?
Still, price can be legitimately decisive, particularly if a student intends a career in a relatively low-paying field in which it would be hard to pay off heavy debts. 
While degrees from Ivy League and other expensive private schools still open many doors to the job market, the upper reaches of corporate, scientific and public life are full of graduates of public schools. "The old-school-tie effect is nowhere near what it once was," Mr. Greene said.
Many corporate recruiters seem to care little. "I haven't noticed a distinct difference," said Dawn Towe, a recruiter for the Target Corporation. In fact, she said she finds that private-college students often harbor "unrealistic expectations" about their ability to rise quickly in retailing, where they may not have held even summer jobs.
"They want to be in charge of marketing" almost from the outset, Ms. Towe said. 
Not surprisingly, the greater interest in public colleges has helped them become more selective, too. That means admissions are no longer almost automatic at many schools. What's more, it is often harder to get all the courses needed for graduation in the standard four years. About half the graduates at 100 public colleges covered by a recent Kiplinger's magazine survey took longer than that.
Then there's the issue of financial aid. Families, especially those wrestling with college finance for the first time, may overlook one important factor as they compare costs: that private institutions can provide more aid in the form of grants, scholarships, loans and campus jobs than public schools. About 75 percent of students attending private colleges and universities receive some type of financial aid, compared with about 60 percent of students at public schools, according to the College Board. It said that a record $90 billion was available in financial aid during the 2001-02 academic year, with increases in grants, used more often by private schools, surpassing loans for the second consecutive year. 
"The public sees the posted price, which is dramatically higher" at private schools, said Mr. Hartle of the American Council on Education. "We don't do a very good job of telling people what it's actually going to cost."
TRADITIONALLY, most private schools make admittance decisions on a need-blind basis, without regard to the ability to pay. They then make it financially feasible for students they want. Amherst College, for example, lists a cost of $35,690 for tuition, room and board. But 47 percent of students have been determined to have financial need, with the average annual aid package worth $24,229, according to the U.S. News and World Report annual survey published this year. While 47 percent of students at Amherst graduate with debt, the average amount is a fairly manageable $12,270. Federal tax credits and various tax-advantaged prepayment plans can lighten the burden further.
Even well-to-do families often qualify for aid. "People are surprised to learn that a $100,000 income often qualifies" if, say, there are big medical bills or more than one sibling in college at the same time, Mr. Greene explained.
In fact, as lesser private schools engage in an increasingly fierce price war to fill seats, even elite private schools that are flooded with applicants use their big endowments to offer hefty subsidies to enroll students they desire most.
Public universities, with their lower prices, not only have smaller aid budgets but are also chary about helping out-of-staters. Budget cuts have been severe, suggesting that prices will continue to rise faster than at private institutions.
The best strategy for students, said Peter Warchal, a counselor at Exeter High School in Pennsylvania, is to apply to a "dream" school, to a couple where the chances of getting in are 50-50 and a "safety valve," all with little regard for whether they are public or private. After all, he said, the net price gap is often bridgeable, with financial aid.
Still, Jeni Mattingly will be crunching the numbers. "What it's going to come down to" next month, when many applications are due, she said, "is which school will give me the most for my money."

(Susana Raab for The New York Times) Chart: "In Search of Bargains in Education"Despite recent increases in tuition and fees, four-year public institutions still cost much less than private ones. Over all, a majority of undergraduates are paying less than $5,000 a year in those costs.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROOKLYN HEIGHTS; 
Packs of Rival Dog Walkers Circle One Another and Growl

BYLINE:  By JON HART 

 BODY:
On a recent Sunday at the Hillside Dog Park in Brooklyn Heights, a Dane, a pit bull and half a dozen other dogs skirmished harmoniously on the fenced-in, sloping, three-acre expanse as their walkers looked on. 
 The playful and serene scene, on a site sandwiched between the Jehovah's Witnesses Watchtower and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, disguises the bitter rivalries among the local self-employed dog walkers. 
 "Superficially, everyone gets along," said Jessica Johnson, a professional dog walker, as she watched over a Great Dane. "But there are concealed animosities." 
Indeed, dog walking in the vicinity of the popular dog run, which attracts dog lovers from throughout the city, has become a cutthroat business in which walkers can earn from $600 a week up to more than $100,000 a year. In this weak economy, dog walkers are watching both their charges and their backs. At Hillside, back-stabbing and bickering has sullied what was not long ago a vocation for slackers. 
"It got too competitive and too nasty," said Ms. Johnson, who is quitting after two years to attend pharmacy school. "One person went around saying that one walker's dogs were biting other dogs on the dog run. It hurt the walker's feeling, and it hurt her reputation."
One dog walker, Jennifer Bauch, fought back. When she learned that a rival was disparaging her, she confronted the offender in a tight elevator. 
"I told her that I was going to get a restraining order and that she was not going to able to work in my building," recalled Ms. Bauch, who became well known in Brooklyn Heights after she organized a memorial service for a deceased dog lover three years ago. 
Nor have all the tiffs been behind closed doors. One walker aired her grievance at a local movie house. "It was loud enough to be embarrassing," Ms. Bauch said. "This walker said, 'Thanks for stealing my pooch.' "
Ms. Bauch, a lawyer, epitomizes the new breed of walker: an ambitious, animal-loving entrepreneur. She turned to her current occupation after her dot-com employer went out of business two years ago. 
"People think it's a paper route, but I take it very seriously," said Ms. Bauch, a Marisa Tomei look-alike who works as many as 16 hours a day. When she's not singing out greetings to everyone from Montague Street panhandlers to Muffet Jones, president of the Hillside dog run, she is passing out business cards to anyone who, as she puts it, "even glances at a can of dog food in the supermarket." 
Upon request, she serenades her clients with operatic arias. Last Christmas, she presented them with framed pictures of their precious pets. While others struggle, Ms. Bauch picks and chooses her clients. 
"She dumped me," Elizabeth Lippman said. "I was horrified." Ms. Lippman is a freelance photographer whose irregular schedule did not jibe with Ms. Bauch's. Ms. Bauch often refers clients to her protege, a part-time bouncer, but she acknowledges that her competitive juices are still flowing. "When I see someone walking a new poodle," she said, "I'm hit with tinges of jealousy." JON HART

An article in the Neighborhood Report pages last Sunday about dog walkers in Brooklyn Heights misstated the new career of Jessica Johnson, who is giving up that occupation. She is studying to become an emergency medical technician, not a pharmacist.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
For Banks, Fed's Cut Isn't as Good As It Looks

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
SINCE the start of last year, the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates a dozen times, including the half-point reduction last week. But bank shares have fallen.
 Robert Albertson, a principal and chief strategist at Sandler O'Neill, a New York investment bank, took some time out from a banking conference in Boston last week to talk about the money business. Following are excerpts from the conversation. 

Q. The number of problem loans jumped in the third quarter. Are there many more to come?

A. We are approaching the peak of the nonperforming loan cycle. Telecom is not over, and the energy trading companies are the other shoe left to drop. They are facing a massive liquidity crisis because the capital markets are closed to them. You are going to see some sizable nonperformers in the fourth quarter. But we are through the vast bulk of the problem, presuming we don't dive back into recession.

Q. With interest rates so low, is it a great time to be a lender?

A. No, it is not a great time to be a lender. And I cannot fathom how this recent drop in rates will help the economy, other than psychologically. Banks can't lower their funding costs any further. There will be a margin squeeze here. It's not enough to eliminate a good earnings year, but it will crimp it. But banks don't make that much money on loans. They make money on deposits, and their ability to raise deposits.
Most bank investors hope for lower rates, but they have never got it quite right. Lower rates are not a panacea. They are a drag.

Q. What is the state of loan demand?

A. Loan demand is not picking up yet, although a handful of banks, most recently Bank of America, are saying they are seeing some signs of firming in commercial lending. But it will not take much to spark a commercial lending upswing. The corporate sector is not flush with cash. They want to borrow and need to borrow.

Q. Why are you upbeat about bank and brokerage stocks?

A. Valuations are at the very low end of absolute price-to-earnings ratios, the condition of the industry is extraordinarily sound, and no one ever sees the end of the business loan cycle ahead of time. I want to invest where the damage seems worst at the moment, which is in the corporate banks and the big investment banks.

Q. Do you like J. P. Morgan Chase stock?

A. J. P. Morgan is selling at a market capitalization of about $41 billion. Their consumer bank alone is worth that as a stand-alone entity. So the remaining 70 percent of the organization is being valued at zero. Yet in various areas of commercial and investment banking, it ranks between No. 1 and No. 7, globally. This clearly cannot be worth zero. So the value is extraordinary. Some people are worried about whether the dividend will get cut. It's safe this quarter. But the stock is trading as if the dividend has already been cut.

Q. Will the banks be hurt by lawsuits from disasters like Enron and WorldCom?

A. I am always worried until the regulatory side is tamped down. Once that is done, I don't get that worried about civil claims and damage claims because they usually take a decade to get settled. It took an awful long time to get there in the tobacco industry. This is not the tobacco industry. I find it hard to believe that these things will be more than a first-class nuisance.

Q. Which other stocks do you favor?

A. We are extremely emphatic about Citigroup and Bank of America. My favorite brokerage stock has always been Lehman Brothers.
FleetBoston and North Fork Bancorporation are two smaller ones. And we like a lot of midcap names, particularly in the Southeast. Names in this group include Huntington Bancshares, Gold Banc, Sovran Bank, WSFS Financial Group and First Tennessee National. 

Q. Which stocks would you avoid?

A. Some of the banks that did well for people in more uncertain times, like Wells Fargo, are probably approaching fair value. And it is too soon to be looking at asset managers like Charles Schwab. Those stocks will lag a move in the market by three to six months because right now the retail investor is on the sidelines.

Q. What would worry you about the group?

A. Two things would make me worried. Terrorism is the first, if it impacted the consumer before the economy starts to recover. A lack of a fiscal package from Washington is the second. There has been an overreliance on monetary policy. The Fed's ability to help the economy ended almost a year ago, when it cut rates for the 11th time. We should have begun experiencing the benefit of the rate cuts last year. We did not. Presumably, with the shift in Congress, we have better odds than ever on the fiscal side.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A SleeperOf a Statistic Could Lead An Awakening

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHAT was the most important economic news of last week?
 * The Republican sweep in the midterm elections? 
 * The half-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve?
* Word that productivity growth accelerated to an annual rate of 4 percent in the third quarter? 
The election results unquestionably marked a turning point in Washington. President Bush's success in helping Republicans gain control of the Senate and hang on to the House will almost certainly lead to a conservative tilt in economic policy.
The White House is sure to press Congress to make last year's 10-year tax cut permanent. And many Republicans on Capitol Hill want to join the administration in passing a new package of investor tax cuts. In the long run, Republican control could lead to serious consideration of adding private investment accounts to Social Security and rewriting the entire tax code.
The Fed's decision to expend a big chunk of its remaining monetary ammunition also will have important ramifications. Its rate cut, bigger than most analysts and investors expected, suggests a deeper degree of concern within the central bank about the economy's prospects than Alan Greenspan and his colleagues have let on in public.
It also shows that the Fed is following the prescription presented earlier this year in a staff study about how to conduct monetary policy when rates are approaching zero and there are risks of deflation. The study suggested that it would be a mistake to be timid about rate cuts just because there would not be much room to reduce them further.
While Fed officials discount the possibility of Japanese-style deflation afflicting the United States, their willingness to cut their benchmark federal funds target rate to 1.25 percent from 1.75 percent signals a desire to be absolutely sure the economy does not sink into a deflationary bog.
Understandably, the new report on productivity did not generate the headlines given to the election and the Fed. But it arguably means more to the economic outlook in the long run, and maybe in the short run, than the changes in the political landscape or the Fed's willingness to empty its holster.
The 4 percent annual growth rate in productivity in the third quarter brought the annual rate over the past year to a remarkable 5.3 percent. That is the best performance in nearly two decades.
Most immediately, the production surge implies that companies can eke out better profits even if sales growth remains stagnant or low. Better profits, in turn, could support the recent rally in stock prices, easing the pain of anyone with a 401(k) plan and encouraging companies to begin increasing their capital spending. The lack of capital investment by businesses has been the most persistent problem afflicting the economy.
On the negative side, new efficiencies mean that companies can delay hiring new workers even when sales turn up. So the likelihood of a recovery without new jobs is increasing.
THE effects of strong productivity growth would be even more pronounced in the long run. Productivity is the crucial component in determining the economy's capacity to expand without igniting inflation.
Economists define the economy's long-term sustainable growth rate as the growth in the labor force, which is running around 1 percent a year and is likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future, plus the growth rate of productivity. From the early 1970's into the mid-1990's, productivity was around 1.5 percent. So the economy's speed limit was thought to be about 2.5 percent annual growth.
During the second half of the last decade, productivity rose to 2.5 percent. Though no one expects the current 5.3 percent annual rate to last long, it could well settle at a pace above 2.5 percent. The economic speed limit would then be 3.5 percent or higher.
The implications would be substantial. Unemployment, now 5.7 percent, could fall back toward the 4 percent level. Wages could increase without diminishing corporate profits. Government revenues could swell without increasing tax rates, making it easier for the nation to address problems like assuring the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
Mr. Greenspan, who thinks companies are just starting to make the most of technology in learning to produce more for less, singled out strong productivity gains last week in reassuring the nation about the economic outlook. But it is doubtful that many, if any, candidates spent time during the campaign talking with voters about output per hour. Productivity may not be a campaign slogan, but it is likely to do more to help politicians meet their economic promises than just about any other factor.

HEADLINE: E Pluribus Unum at the Dance 

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
IF the easiest thing in the world is nailing Miami Beach in a couple of well-worn cliches -- model/waitress, for instance; Versace mansion; perma-tanned oldsters -- it is much tougher getting at the truth about this complicated sand spit reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean, a place where reality is better thought of in the plural, a fact never clearer than at the annual homecoming dance of Miami Beach Senior High School. 
 All season throughout the country, high school students have been dressing themselves up for an annual dinner-dance that smacks of Andy Hardy anachronism in the age of Eminem. They have been choosing themes, building crepe-paper arches, staging fund-raising car-wash drives, buying streamers, ordering centerpieces and worrying about the right thing to wear. They have been participating in what seems an inevitable rite of passage for young Americans, until you step back and consider where some of these Americans started their lives. 
 "We're a mutt," Lavina Gangwani, the school's activities director, said last Saturday at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Miami. Ms. Gangwani was alluding to a student population that may set the national bar for multicultural representation, with students who come from 65 countries and speak 24 languages, a majority of them, it is worth pointing out, first-generation Americans. 
"We have Hispanics, African-Americans, South Americans, Europeans, a large Jewish population, obviously, a lot of Asians and even Islamic students," Ms. Gangwani said. 
The principal, Dr. Jeanne Friedman, said, "We have the children of multimillionaires coming to this school," referring to a small group that lives in the gated island enclaves scattered throughout Biscayne Bay. "But we also have students living in cars." That is why it was easy for someone standing in a ballroom of the Hyatt Regency to feel that there are times when the clearest symbol for the American dream might be a little black dress. 
The homecoming theme was the 1950's, as interpreted half a century later after numerous viewings of "Grease." The music was a mixture of mainstream hip-hop, salsa and merengue, played by a man who refers to himself as D. J. Lazaro. A ticket of $40 bought a dinner of chicken fingers and bite-size pizzas and what menus called "a lavish dessert display." 
The flexible dress code prohibited denim but otherwise left the students latitude to dress according to their own ideas of high style. Consequently, some young women wore voluminous crinolined infanta dresses reminiscent of quinceanera parties, the celebrations given in Hispanic communities for 15-year-old girls. Some wore dresses of bootlegged designer logo fabrics commissioned from local seamstresses. Some wore $300 Britney Spears dresses, custom-ordered two months in advance from shops in the Bal Harbour Mall. And some wore thigh-high dresses with plunging backs, of a sort that a certain mediagenic Latino superstar has built her career around.
"J. Lo inspired me a lot because she's sexy but at the same time simple," said Amy Rodriguez, whose fawn-color minidress had deep cutouts and a plunging back. "I wanted something different," she said, "with a little bit showing, but not too much." Pausing to adjust her lace-up platform sandals, Ms. Rodriguez added, "It's still a school."
In modeling herself after Ms. Lopez, Ms. Rodriguez was an anomaly. The lessons of assimilation are subtle, and most of the young women who turned out, among a student body that is 69 percent Hispanic, had chosen dresses sedate enough for a Westchester country club. 
"I was looking for a dress that was not too big," meaning bouffant, and simple shoes, Jessica Del Rio explained, referring to the tasteful jet-beaded sheath she had bought at a store near Calle Ocho, the downtown Cuban commercial strip, and the high-heeled sandals that were a J. C. Penney find. 
"Homecoming is not supposed to be all out," said Ms. Del Rio's escort, Jair Del Rio, a Beach High graduate, whose low-key corduroy Nautica shirt and suede Hush Puppies were a far cry, stylistically, from the zoot suit with patent leather shoes and cane that he wore to last year's prom. "I was tired of the same old tux," Mr. Del Rio explained.
As Ms. Del Rio talked, a natty junior walked past, and someone whistled. 
"Who made the suit?" Mr. Del Rio asked.
"I'll tell you the first name, and you tell me the rest," the young man said. There was a pause and then this word: "Giorgio."
"Head to toe?" Mr. Del Rio asked.
"Almost," the young man replied.
There are rules to employ when preparing for a homecoming dance, as in all important undertakings, Katherine Perez, 17, said. Ms. Perez's own outfit testified to determined shopping and, not coincidentally, could pass muster at Vogue. 
"Rule 1," Ms. Perez said, and it is one observed by many of the students, who began shopping for homecoming in August, "is give yourself enough time in advance." Rule 2 is "don't shop at the mall next to school." Rule 3 is "shop online and shop sales." 
Ms. Perez's platform sandals originally cost $50. She waited until they were marked down 20 percent. Her vest halter top and tweed skirt with a patchwork hem were both bought on EWindsor.com. "I definitely didn't want a prom dress," said Ms. Perez, who also said she stayed away from silks and satins and all black and white. The entire outfit had cost just under $100, running-around money by some standards, but a lavish expenditure in a room where many people had managed to dress up on a budget a third that size. 
There was, for instance, a young woman at the dance in a $300 stretch lace dress bought by her mother at the Bal Harbour Mall, and another whose entire outfit had cost $21, money her mother earned as a janitor there. (Of the 2,560 students at the high school, 82 percent are from an economic category referred to as low-moderate income.)
Looking around the dance floor, said Dr. Friedman, the school's principal, one surveyed a microcosm that took in everything from the "future Robert Rubins of the world" (Mr. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, is an alumnus) to people who may be criminals. What seemed an undifferentiated, rump-shaking mass on the dance floor was actually something more compelling and precise. Less than a century ago, Miami Beach was a sleepy backwater, where racial restrictions were written into law. Now it is the jittery boomtown that anyone who wants to know the demographic, political and cultural future of America had better consult. 
"The microcosm is right there on that dance floor," Dr. Friedman said. It is not a reality that everyone in America is eager to embrace. But that, she said, is all right. "We all have to share the highways with everybody," the principal added, as she glided onto the dance floor. "Sooner or later you'd better learn how to understand."

HEADLINE: Business; 
A Bet on Credit Cards Becomes Messy at Sears

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
WASHING machines, work clothes, power tools and patio furniture. Sears, Roebuck built a rock-solid, if unexciting, image over the years by emphasizing such practical products. Americans shopped at Sears for what they truly needed, and out of that, the company has forged a $41 billion business, not only from selling the merchandise but also from helping to make the purchases possible. 
 About 60 million Americans hold Sears credit cards, and credit provides 60 percent of the company's profits -- far more than at any other retailer. To Wall Street, in fact, the credit business often overshadows what happens inside the stores. 
 But last month, the credit business -- which is the third-most-profitable credit card operation anywhere -- was rocked by the abrupt departure of Kevin T. Keleghan, the executive who ran it for three years. Ten days later, Sears said it would set aside an additional $222 million to cover unpaid credit card debt in the third quarter, driving down its share price 32 percent the day of the announcement. 
Sears's chairman and chief executive, Alan J. Lacy, tried to contain the damage, calling credit a cyclical business and attributing much of the trouble to Mr. Keleghan and to losses from the retailer's gold MasterCard. But this crisis, the third to erupt in the credit division in five years, has left some investors and analysts wondering whether the eagerness to expand on the credit front -- an eagerness mirrored in some of its newer, younger rivals -- is the best attitude for Sears, a 116-year-old retailer.
Mr. Lacy contends, without offering specifics, that the dismissal was justified. "Kevin did something that was unacceptable in the third quarter," he said last week. "He was not forthcoming about what was happening in his business. There are some details I will not share. My statement that I had lost confidence in his credibility is an accurate statement, and it's as nice as I can phrase it."
Mr. Keleghan did not return telephone messages left at his home in Lake Forest, Ill., and a Sears spokeswoman would not provide the name of his lawyer or any other representative.
The troubles come at an especially sensitive time for Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., a Chicago suburb. After several comeback attempts on the retailing side, the company is battling competitors like Target and Kohl's, which offer brand-name products at discount prices in stores that Sears is openly trying to imitate.
About a year ago, Sears embarked on a broad program to overhaul its stores and make them more appealing to the kinds of customers who buy its refrigerators, ranges, plasma TV's and other high-priced products. That effort includes the $1.9 billion purchase of Lands' End in May and the introduction of an apparel line called Covington -- moves that some analysts worry will alienate the traditional Sears shopper.
The grueling competition, however, continues -- at a time when consumer confidence is weak. Many shoppers, nervous about their job security, their investments and the prospect of war, are spending only when they think they have to. Sears shares, which closed on Friday at $24.03, are fetching less than they did just after the terrorist attacks last year and less than half the $59 price reached last spring.
"We think Sears has lost its retail identity, leaving it ill equipped to win much market share," Rozilyn Bryant, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, wrote in a note to investors late last month. "Given a flawed retail strategy and a credit portfolio that's beginning to resemble Pandora's box, we'd avoid the shares unless they fell to $10 to $12."
IN an interview last week, Mr. Lacy said such consternation was out of step with reality. The company's changes on the retail side are moving ahead as planned, he said, and the credit unit's rough patch will be only temporary. "We're a strong company with substantial profit and substantial cash flow," he said. "We've worked through these things before, and we'll work through them again."
The credit division is expected to produce more than $1 billion in profits this year, Mr. Lacy said. Last year, it generated $1.53 billion in profits, up just 1 percent from 2000, according to the Nilson Report, which tracks the credit industry. The credit unit includes Sears credit card accounts as well as about 25 million gold MasterCard accounts. Keeping it profitable requires skilled balancing of risk and reward, experts say, and in a volatile economy, risk can be difficult to gauge.
Before moving to the top job at Sears two years ago, Mr. Lacy headed the credit division. Considering that, some analysts wonder why he did not have a better sense of the problems on the credit side.
When Mr. Keleghan's dismissal was announced on Oct. 7, Sears held a conference call and assured analysts and investors that all was well. Just 10 days later, the increase in bad debt was revealed, and "it was, 'Whoa, a whole new world out there,' " said Deborah Weinswig, a retail analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
Mr. Lacy's first task, she said, should be to restore investor confidence. "Everyone's been shaken," she said. "The nature of what happened is important, but there was also this false sense of security."
Mr. Lacy says that part of what happened was tied to the cyclical nature of credit cards, and that Sears's troubles with customer delinquencies in 1997 and 1998 were "driven by record personal bankruptcies in America." The company's top credit-card customers, he added, had been "picked off" by banks offering Visa cards or MasterCards with low initial interest rates. Then a wave of bankruptcies hit, leaving Sears with defaulting customers in what Mr. Lacy called "a surprise." 
At the same time, Sears was under investigation for its tactics toward people who declared personal bankruptcy. Across the country, Sears collected money owed by cardholders without notifying the judges presiding over their cases, so people whose debt had been officially erased were still paying their Sears bills. The practice came to light in early 1997, and Sears management, headed by Arthur C. Martinez, negotiated for nearly two years before reaching a settlement that included a guilty plea by the company as well as $475 million in fines and restitution.
A little more than two years ago, Sears decided to fight fire with fire. It introduced its own gold MasterCard, persuading 23 million of the 60 million Sears cardholders to switch. The card offered check-writing and a chance to transfer existing balances to the MasterCard. Sears also started a direct-mail program, signing up two million new MasterCard customers. The direct-mail customers "have not turned out to produce the kind of profitability we wanted," Mr. Lacy said, while there have also been payment defaults among MasterCard holders who previously had Sears cards.
Sears has become the world's No. 2 MasterCard issuer, according to the Nilson Report. "The Sears credit unit has delivered profits that any credit card issuer would be delighted to have as their own," said David Robertson, the publisher of the report. "Over the last few years, analysts have come to view Sears as a credit card company that has a retail arm. It hasn't led the market on the retail side in a long, long time."
At one investment firm, Sanford C. Bernstein, analysts from the financial services sector and the retail sector will team up to study Sears's performance, starting this month.
Mr. Keleghan, who was an executive at American Express and AT&T's Universal card unit before arriving at Sears, guided the creation of the company's MasterCard program. He appears to have been admired by his peers in the credit card industry, some of whom say they have trouble comprehending the reasons Mr. Lacy gave for his dismissal. 
"It doesn't compute," said Paul Kahn, general manager of the Group Advantage Service Corporation, who oversaw Mr. Keleghan when both worked on the AT&T Universal card in the early 1990's. "He is boringly honest," he said, adding that "there is no way" he would have allowed trouble to build. 
In any case, the Sears MasterCard program has run into difficulty. Its accounts cover 37 percent of Sears's $31 billion receivables portfolio, and some of those cardholders were not paying their bills, leading to heftier "chargeoffs" -- the industry term for uncollected bills -- despite Sears's unusually generous policy of not declaring a chargeoff until eight months have passed without payment. Most card companies do so at six months. 
Mr. Lacy said that Sears, while tightening some requirements for its MasterCard, would not change the eight-month rule. "We're focused on economics," he said. In those two extra months, he added, "people have a chance to get a job, a chance to restore their financial health." 
That is one of the many differences between Sears and its rivals. At Target, about 15 percent of pretax profit comes from the credit division, a spokeswoman said, and that may grow as high as 23 or 24 percent in the next few years.
In Minneapolis, its home base, Target has built a separate campus to house its Target financial division and is making a sustained pitch to move its best Target cardholders to its Target Visa card. The card includes a "smart chip" that records information about purchases, which Target's information network can use to distribute coupons to cardholders and otherwise manage sales.
Unlike Sears, Target does not allow cardholders to transfer balances from other cards to its Visa, said Cathy Wright, a Target spokeswoman, and they are not given check-writing privileges. About eight million Visa cards have been issued since the program began in 2000, she said, with about two-thirds of those selected from the ranks of former Target cardholders. The company would not disclose how many Target cardholders it still has.
For the Visa card, no direct-mail applications were solicited, and only the top-performing Target cardholders were offered the card, she added. Interest rates range from 9.9 percent to 18.9 percent, depending on a shopper's credit profile.
Chargeoffs occur after six months, and Target's reserve for bad debt is $450 million this year, up from $261 million last year. The growth represents the increase in cardholders, she said. "Our delinquency and chargeoff rates are what we expected," she said. 
Kohl's, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, offers its own card, not a Visa card or MasterCard, said Susan Henderson, a spokeswoman. Chargeoffs occur after six months, and the allowance for bad debt increased last year to $41.3 million from $22.7 million, she said, because of "customer bankruptcies and delinquent accounts due to the economic environment in fiscal 2001." According to Sanford C. Bernstein, the investment analysts, the credit division's profits fell 4 percent last year because of bankruptcies and delinquencies. At the same time, "credit sales have been increasing faster than overall sales."
SOME analysts have expressed concern that beyond generous chargeoff terms, Sears offers other deals -- like zero percent financing and no payments for 12 months -- that make its credit situation more difficult to read. The promotions help drive sales of big-ticket products, particularly appliances, but the worry is that they do not reflect the full amount of outstanding debt on the company's books. 
Mr. Lacy, however, says such deals are necessary to do business today. "Zero percent financing promotions have become an important part of retailing," he said. And he offers an alternative view of the effect of such financing. "Our delinquency rate would be higher if you took out those zero percent balances," he said. "Our chargeoff rate would be higher. And therefore our return on assets would be higher. We're typically No. 1 or No. 2 in return on assets." 
He says his job is not in jeopardy, despite the problems of the last few weeks. "We very purposefully set out on an ambitious agenda to reposition and restructure the business," he said. "The organization has worked very hard to implement those changes." All along, he said, the goal was to fix the parts of Sears that were broken, on the retail side, while expanding the parts that weren't, like the credit division. 
"I guess you could say we've added to the list of things to do," Mr. Lacy said.

Dollars and Euros: A Look Beyond the Parity Line

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A DOLLAR is now worth less than a euro, and currency analysts say it has even further to fall. They predict that American tourists may be paying $1.05 for a euro next summer, and $1.10 at the end of 2003.
 If that view is right, Americans invested in stocks or bonds in Europe would enjoy a welcome windfall. The dollar's 12.2 percent decline against the euro this year has already been very good to them, reducing losses in stocks and increasing gains in bonds when these performances are translated back into dollars. 
 But investors should not accept the forecast as a fait accompli, because a further fall in the dollar depends on continuing weakness of the American economy. The dollar fell to below parity with the euro last Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, and some traders and investors apparently viewed the Fed's move as a sign of more months of slow growth. The dollar finished the week at $1.01 to the euro, almost a three-year low. 
A growth surprise, however, could give the dollar a boost. And the Fed's aggressive half-point rate cut makes it more likely that the economy could spurt ahead faster than expected next year.
The dollar also fell to parity with the euro in July but then rallied, confounding predictions of further declines.
Stephen S. Smith, who manages a $2.5 billion global bond portfolio at Brandywine Asset Management, said he decided in July to hedge his European bond portfolio against a dollar rally. Now he is preparing to drop that hedge and benefit from a falling dollar if the American currency slips a little lower. "We may give way to a weaker dollar and a stronger euro next year," he said.
What is strange about the dollar's fall -- and why it could reverse -- is that investors are not buying euros because the economic outlook on the Continent is better than it is in the United States. In fact, the 2003 forecast for the 12-country euro zone shows slower growth than in the American economy.
Instead, the dollar is being undermined by disappointment in American performance. "I never see anyone buying the euro because they are excited by the prospects for euro growth," said Lara Rhame, senior foreign exchange economist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "It is just they have found a reason to sell the dollar." 
Both Ms. Rhame and James McCormick, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Lehman Brothers, said disenchantment with the dollar is centered on forecasts that the American economy will grow about 2.5 percent next year. That is below what economists call the potential growth rate -- the fastest pace at which the economy can expand without creating inflationary pressures. Because workers' productivity is high, the rate of potential growth is 3 percent to 3.5 percent, these analysts said.
The other drag on the dollar, Mr. McCormick said, is the huge size of the American current account deficit, which could reach a record $500 billion this year. When the economy is perking along and foreigners like the stock market, the American economy can attract the investment it needs to cover this deficit.
Now, Mr. McCormick said, the dollar is under significant pressure because the economy "is growing under potential, and that means it is going to be hard to attract the capital to fund the current account deficit." When foreign capital is scarce, interest rates will rise and the dollar will fall to attract more foreign investment.
BUT both Ms. Rhame and Mr. McCormick have caveats, so it may be riskier than it looks to jump into funds promising additional gains from a fall in the dollar, as well as from picking the right stocks or bonds.
Ms. Rhame is expecting a 10 percent decline in the dollar in 2003, but she said that "if we return to potential growth next year, the euro is not going to rally."
Mr. McCormick expects the dollar to fall to a range of $1.05 to $1.10 to the euro in the next six to nine months. But, he added, "if the United States economy can surprise on the upside and get back to potential in 2003, we should get back to the parity range" on the dollar. That is where it is right now.

HEADLINE: Between a Paw and a Sharp Place 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
TO give the economy a lift, the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates by half a point, more than most analysts predicted, to their lowest level in more than 40 years.
 Voters unexpectedly give business-friendly Republicans control of both Congress and the White House for just the second time since Dwight D. Eisenhower was president. 
 And stocks fall.
Huh?
Predicting the market is always tough. But the last year has been especially maddening. After holding its own in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was brought low earlier this year by accounting scandals and worry about economic weakness. Then, in October, traditionally the worst month for stocks, the market rallied. The S.& P. 500 tacked on nearly 9 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 800 points, almost 11 percent. 
But last week, the rally stalled. After rising on Wednesday in the wake of the Fed's rate cut and the Republican takeover, the S.& P. 500 fell by more than 3 percent over the next two days.
So what's next? Are these declines just a blip? Did the market really bottom out at the beginning of October? Or is the rally a hiccup? Four times since March 2001, stocks have gained more than 10 percent. Each of the first three times, the rally fizzled and the market wound up lower than it was before.
Unfortunately, those questions have no easy answer. Risks of war, terrorism and more accounting scandals have compounded the usual economic and political uncertainties.
Looking at the same set of statistics, economists and strategists can plausibly argue that the United States will post solid growth next year, or fall back into recession. Though it increases the odds of business-friendly legislation, including limitations on lawsuits and jury awards, the Republican takeover of the Senate also raises the chances of a tax cut whose benefits would go mainly to the very wealthy, with uncertain economic benefits.
Wall Street cannot even agree on what corporate earnings are. Optimistic strategists look at the S.& P. 500's "operating earnings," which factor out one-time restructuring charges and other expenses that companies have persuaded analysts should not be counted against them. On that basis, the S.& P. 500 is expected to earn roughly $48 a share in 2003.
If that calculation is right, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500, based on expected future earnings, is about 19, and stocks are more reasonably valued than they have been since 1994. Stocks look especially attractive relative to 10-year government notes, which are paying 3.85 percent, the lowest rate in more than a generation.
But skeptics argue that investors need to look at reported earnings after charges; on that basis, earnings this year will be closer to $30 a share. By that measure, the S.& P. 500 is trading at a P/E ratio of 30, far above its historical average. By other measures, stocks are also quite expensive; the dividend yield on the S.& P. 500 is only 1.8 percent, well below its historical norm.
The threat of terrorism and the potential for war with Iraq, meanwhile, lurk in the background. Few analysts expect a prolonged war, but any war is still expected to cost $50 billion to $100 billion, a price tag that will probably have to be borne by the United States. And what will happen to Iraq if and when its leader, Saddam Hussein, is ousted is far from clear.
The risks of future terrorist strikes are unknowable. Even small attacks in the United States could damage consumer confidence and put the economy in a tailspin; some analysts said auto sales fell so far in October partly because people in the Washington area were worried about being shot by the sniper on exposed car lots. An attack on the scale of Sept. 11 would rock the markets and the economy.
There is no consensus on the market's direction, so here are three of the most plausible scenarios, ranging from sad to happy.

Gloom and Doom
Consumer spending has been the brightest spot in the American economy this year. But market bears worry that consumers have become far too dependent on easy credit, a trend that cannot last.
With housing prices rising and mortgage rates low, many homeowners have repeatedly refinanced their homes, taking on more debt each time and spending the proceeds. That refinancing boom, along with a surge in zero-interest car loans, has left consumer debt at a record high. Eventually, consumers will have to pull back, said Steven H. East, the chief economist at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Company, a regional investment bank based in Arlington, Va.
"Consumers have too much debt," he said. "Even debt at zero percent is debt you have to pay back. And corporations have too much debt."
With economic growth anemic and a strong dollar keeping imports cheap, Mr. East expects the United States to avoid deflation only narrowly over the next few years. He and others predict that inflation will be only 1.25 percent in 2003.
But investors have not yet accepted that when inflation is low, corporate earnings tend to grow very slowly, Mr. East said. In the long run, profits grow about 7 percent a year, and inflation represents about half of that increase, he said. But with inflation so low, companies will struggle to generate that level of profit growth. So, relative to bonds, Mr. East said, stocks are not as cheap as they appear.
"A real challenge for the equity market is to come to grips with a lower rate of inflation and nominal earnings growth," Mr. East said. "You have very low Treasury yields mainly because inflation is very low, and because inflation is very low, you can't value earnings as you have in the past."
Mr. East would not offer a specific target for the S.& P. 500. But he said he did not believe the index should trade above its historical average of 16 times profits, even with interest rates so low. For the S.& P. 500 to reach that level, it would have to fall to 800, near the lows it set in July and early October.
Zachary Karabell, a senior economic analyst at Fred Alger Management in New York, is almost as pessimistic. He figures that economic growth in the United States and worldwide will probably sputter for at least the next year. "It wouldn't take much to have a double-dip" recession, he said. "What's going to lead companies to really think more aggressively about new spending?"
With the economic outlook cloudy, Mr. Karabell does not see particularly cheap stocks anywhere. Although he does not expect a major decline, he does not see reasons to buy now, either.
"We're in this kind of chugging-along phase," he said, "and there is absolutely nothing on the horizon that suggests we're going to break out on the upside."

The Worst Is Over
Charles Pradilla, the chief investment strategist at SG Cowen, is slightly less glum.
"I don't think we're still in a recession," Mr. Pradilla said. "I think we're in an anemic recovery." He puts the odds that the economy will slide back into recession as high as 20 percent. Even so, he expects stocks to rise moderately over the next year. "I think the bear market is over," he said. "We've been in this bear market a long time. We've done our time in stir."
Mr. Pradilla argues that stock prices have fallen far enough that valuations are now reasonable. And after two years of deferring capital spending, companies will have to increase spending next year on information technology and software, as well as other big projects, he said. The revival in spending will help profits at technology companies, which remain a very important part of the market, he said.
Further, accounting standards have improved after the scandals this year, Mr. Pradilla said. With executives now required to certify their companies' financial results and the Securities and Exchange Commission aggressively bringing enforcement actions, companies will now be more careful. Over time, he said, investors will grow more comfortable that corporate profits are real.
"You put all that together, it doesn't mean you've got a great bull market, but this is what you need to end a bear market," he said. He predicts that the S.& P. 500 will rise about 6 percent by year-end, to 950 -- and to 1,065 by the end of 2003. The increase will be slow but broad, with no single sector dominating the gains, Mr. Pradilla said.
"There are no themes -- there is no Internet, no telecom convergence," he said. "It'll amaze people by being completely unthematic."
Steve Oristaglio, the co-head of investments at Putnam Investments in Boston, which manages $250 billion, offers a similar forecast, for similar reasons. Like Mr. Pradilla, he expects capital spending to recover. Computer and software prices "have come down, equipment has been fully depreciated, and more powerful equipment is out there," Mr. Oristaglio said. "Productivity will continue to surprise on the upside, and that will give corporations the confidence to continue to have a rise in fixed business investment."
In addition, Mr. Oristaglio said he expects profits to recover solidly next year. After two years of job cuts, companies are running leaner and more efficiently than they were at the peak of the boom, so any increase in sales will have a big impact on profits, he said.
The threat of deflation is overstated, he added; with the Federal Reserve pumping money into the economy, inflation will begin to pick up in 2003, hurting bonds and helping stocks. Buoyed by higher profits and solid productivity and economic growth, the S.& P. 500 should reach 1,050 to 1,100 by the end of 2003, Mr. Oristaglio said.
The best-performing stocks will probably be those companies whose fortunes are closely tied to overall economic growth, he said. He especially likes retailers and financial companies.
Tobias M. Levkovich, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said investors had not yet accounted for the fact that Republican control of Congress could significantly benefit major industries. The biggest gainers, he said, will probably be financial and insurance companies, drug makers and manufacturing stocks that face large exposure to asbestos claims. Even if big limitations on asbestos lawsuits are not passed, businesses in general will gain from a more conservative federal judiciary, he said.
"We do know one thing, and that is that Bush is going to get a lot of his judicial appointees through," Mr. Levkovich said. He figures that the S.& P. 500 will reach 1,000 at the end of this year and 1,075 by the end of 2003.

Don't Worry, Be Happy
If the S.& P. 500 does reach 1,075 in the next 14 months, it will have gained 20 percent, a very healthy return.
But Wall Street's most upbeat strategists expect even more. Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs, who made her name in the late 1990's for her consistently bullish, and accurate, predictions -- though she did not predict the downturn -- said the index would hit 1,150 as early as next November, a gain of more than 28 percent.
Corporate balance sheets are in surprisingly good shape, with companies easily able to service their debt, and productivity continues to rise strongly, Ms. Cohen said. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that productivity grew at an annualized rate of 4 percent in the third quarter.
"We have the world's most productive workers, best-trained and best-educated workers," Ms. Cohen said. "We also have a corporate sector that is in pretty good position."
The bears are overestimating other risks, Ms. Cohen said. The risk of Japanese-style deflation is minimal, because the American banking system is much stronger than its counterpart in Japan. And concerns about corporate accounting, although real, are overblown, Ms. Cohen said.
"S.& P. 500 companies have already made accounting adjustments of more than $200 billion in the last four quarters," she said. "The data now are much cleaner than they've been in a long time."

HEADLINE: Investing; 
A Head Wind for Apartment-Building Trusts

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH HARRIS 

 BODY:
LOW interest rates have been a bonanza for homeowners, but they have hurt investors in real estate investment trusts that own apartment buildings.
 Through Thursday, shares of apartment-building trusts have fallen 8.5 percent this year, underperforming the overall market for real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, which have risen by 1.1 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. 
 David M. Lee, manager of the $114 million T. Rowe Price Real Estate mutual fund, said he sees the current weakness of apartment-building REIT's as a buying opportunity and has been increasing his holdings.
REIT's trade in the same way as stocks. They own and operate income-producing real estate and are required to pay most of their annual income as dividends. 
For REIT's that focus on apartment buildings, low interest rates have been a problem because they have made home ownership more affordable. That reduces demand among renters. Roughly 68 percent of American families own homes, up from 64 percent in 1994, according to Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm in Newport Beach, Calif. 
"We are at record levels of single-home ownership and I'm not sure that trend or head wind can get substantially worse," Mr. Lee said. 
Vacancies in apartment buildings, meanwhile, have risen to 10.5 percent this year, from 9 percent at the beginning of 2001, according to Torto Wheaton Research, based in Boston. "Single-family housing is eating everybody's lunch," said David Shulman, managing director and senior REIT analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Low interest rates have also stimulated construction of apartment buildings, even though demand for apartments has tapered off. "The demand for apartments in 2001 was negative for the first time ever," said Lee Schalop, a real estate securities analyst at Banc of America Securities. "Not only is single family getting all the new households, but it is taking the old ones, too."
Robert W. Gadsden, manager of Alpine Realty Income and Growth, a mutual fund, said apartment-building REIT's were not likely to perform well in the short term: "None of these issues are abating -- interest rates are low, jobs are being cut, new supply continues -- we really need to see the economy improve."
Mr. Lee said he believes that the sector will rebound gradually after the economy improves. As of the end of September, his biggest holdings of apartment-building REIT's included Equity Residential, based in Chicago, and AvalonBay Communities, based in Alexandria, Va.
Timothy J. Pire, managing director at Heitman Real Estate Securities and co-manager of the $100 million PBHG REIT mutual fund, prefers apartment-building REIT's geared to middle-income residents. "The middle of the market apartments rent more by necessity, and you probably won't lose them to the single-family homes," Mr. Pire said. 
A favorite is United Dominion Realty Trust, based in Richmond, Va. It holds a national portfolio of middle-income properties, with some exposure to Washington, a market that he said had held up better than many regions during the downturn.
On the other hand, several analysts said they were concerned about REIT's with holdings in the Southeast, particularly in Atlanta. Mr. Shulman cited Post Properties, based in Atlanta, and Gables Residential Trust, based in Boca Raton, Fla. Declining occupancy and rents have depressed Post's funds from operations, a commonly used measure of REIT financial strength, he said. The company said last week that its funds from operations dropped by 27.5 percent in the third quarter, versus the period last year. Mr. Gadsden said Post's shares, down 29.9 percent this year, are trading well below book value, making them attractive. 
Last week, Gables reported a 10 percent increase in funds from operations for the third quarter, versus the period a year earlier. Marvin R. Banks Jr., the chief financial officer of Gables, said its properties are diversified. Houston, the site of its largest holdings, has been a strong market this year, he said, with rents up more than 5 percent. He added that rentals to corporate customers and revenue from management of apartments not owned by Gables have been strong. 
Still, Mr. Shulman said that he is concerned that Southern markets will not have a speedy recovery and that Gables may need to finance its dividends by selling properties. 
Mr. Banks said that even if some short-term factors were troubling, long-term trends favored the sector. Through 2020, census estimates show that the number of new renters will surge as baby boomers' children hit their peak renting years, he said. 
"During the last 12 months, we've been at this low point that has coincided with a recession and low mortgage rates, so if your holding period is three months, REIT's are not where you should be, but if it's 12 months or beyond, it's a safe bet," Mr. Banks said.

HEADLINE: Falling From Grace, Often to theA-List 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
FOR anyone in the private sector, the rise and very public fall of Harvey L. Pitt as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission would appear to be a career-stopping performance. Mr. Pitt had earned a stellar reputation in Washington as a securities lawyer with ample blue-chip corporate ties. Then, after a stormy 15 months laden with missteps, he made an election-night resignation that appeared as if he wanted to sneak out of town while no one was looking.
 Who would hire someone who failed so publicly, who was excoriated by the same business publications that once sang his praises? 
 But if history is any indication, the outlook for Mr. Pitt may not be so bleak. Many in business -- as well as old Washington hands -- who have had their names tarnished and reputations sullied have discovered that there is life in the private sector after public disgrace, and a potentially profitable one at that. 
Members of Congress who have resigned or who have been forced out are making money as lobbyists for Fortune 500 companies. Wall Street executives who went to the White House and were caught up in the Clinton scandal machine have bounced back, more successful and richer than ever. Cabinet secretaries and other politicians whose lurid sexcapades were grist for the tabloids are active in major corporations. Even nannygate dust-ups that scuttled cabinet appointments in both the Clinton administration and the first Bush administration are now distant memories for the businesswomen involved.
Just last Thursday night, at a glittery black-tie dinner in New York sponsored by the Aspen Institute, a study group, talk turned to Mr. Pitt. During predinner cocktails, one prominent New York lawyer said Mr. Pitt had a promising future, made even stronger by his S.E.C. tenure and the insights he picked up there.
"Harvey Pitt is going to be the hottest ticket coming out of Washington," said the lawyer, Robert A. Profusek, a partner at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, sipping from his drink. "I know his phone is ringing off the hook with law firms trying to hire him. He's an excellent lawyer, and a lot of people think he is a victim. People don't look at him here the way they do in Washington. I also think, from his point of view, he's going to want to prove that he is not damaged goods."
Others may disagree. In fact, there is no clear picture of life after a public tumble; the future is often determined by what caused the fall, like simple poor performance and a political tin ear, as in the case of Mr. Pitt, or more serious mistakes, as in the cases of disgraced politicians and executives who faced criminal charges. A person's network of contacts is also a factor, not to mention sheer likability.
Even professional headhunters have a hard time divining that line.
"Life diminishes when you go to Washington and you stumble," said E. Pendleton James, a senior adviser at Whitehead Mann, an executive recruitment firm, and a former head of personnel in the Reagan White House. "There is a diminution in the value of your acumen to corporate America. But, having said that, it depends on how one falls or fails."
In dozens and dozens of cases, Americans have been a forgiving lot. The half-life of a scandal can be short, redemption can be swift and the main lingering effect of a public downfall is often the celebrity it brings.
"Washington has a long and honored history of forgiving and forgetting when it comes to getting knocked around in public positions," said Kenneth A. Gross, a partner in the Washington office of Skadden Arps Meagher Slate & Flom, who has represented many prominent politicians. "Short of being actually convicted, after a period of time in which there is some delicacy on the issue, all that people remember is that you are famous. Then they want you at all the A-list cocktail parties."
That may shock some people, who believe that malfeasance or mistakes in public service should not be overlooked so easily, let alone rewarded. They bemoan the cavalier way in which people are often welcomed back with open arms and minimal consequences.
Of course, Mr. Pitt, or anyone else in his position, is unlikely to receive an invitation to rejoin an administration. Washington is too much the fishbowl for that. 
"The vetting process for top government jobs is getting extremely complicated," said James J. Albertine, president of the American League of Lobbyists. "You are talking about basically standing naked in front of the world and having every blemish you ever dealt with shown to the world. And that increases the higher the job is. It's becoming a real issue because no one is perfect and even if they are a perfect person, they often get killed by the scrutiny anyway."
But the private sector often shrugs off Washington's scandals and bungling.
The Clinton scandals caught two prominent Wall Streeters, who incurred only minor bruises. One was Roger C. Altman, who was forced to resign as deputy Treasury secretary in 1994 amid a cloud of criticism over his inaccurate testimony in Congressional hearings about the Whitewater scandal. After leaving Washington, Mr. Altman founded Evercore Partners, a boutique investment bank that had no trouble lining up clients like CBS, Dow Jones, NBC and AOL Time Warner. And though Mr. Altman cited the news media as a cause of his problems, Evercore later bought American Media Inc., publisher of The National Enquirer, the splashy tabloid. 
Mr. Altman declined to be interviewed.
The other big Wall Streeter was Bernard W. Nussbaum, a veteran corporate lawyer, who resigned as the Clinton White House counsel after questions were raised about his role in Whitewater. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing.
"Life hereafter is fine," said Mr. Nussbaum, who returned to his desk as a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz. By the accounts of many who know Mr. Nussbaum, his business has only grown since leaving Washington. Mr. Nussbaum, too, agrees that memories are short when it comes to Washington headlines.
"People get driven out over public relations things," he said. "Things are twisted to make them seem egregious when it is really nothing. That is why other areas around the country are not like Washington. People in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco are sophisticated" and quickly forget, he added. 
OBVIOUSLY, executives flame out within the corporate world, as well, sometimes almost as publicly. The last year has produced a bumper crop of chief executives who have been charged with running afoul of the law. And hardly anyone expects the likes of Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of ImClone Systems, L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief of Tyco International, or Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron -- all indicted -- to find jobs in public companies anytime soon, if ever. 
Albert J. Dunlap, the former chief of Sunbeam who was despised by many and nicknamed Chainsaw Al for his slash-and-burn treatment of employees, is probably equally unemployable.
Still, corporate America has often been forgiving of its own. Several executives who have left in disgrace, even after civil charges, have been rehabilitated. After a time in purgatory, when they set themselves up as consultants or investors, people like John H. Gutfreund, the former chairman of Salomon Brothers who was forced out after failing to inform the authorities about illegal bidding at the firm, and Lawrence Kudlow, who had worked as chief economist at Bear, Stearns and in economic posts in Washington before his troubles with illegal drugs were revealed, have rebounded. Mr. Gutfreund now works as senior managing partner at C. E. Unterberg, Towbin, while Mr. Kudlow is co-host of "Kudlow & Cramer" on CNBC.
Who knows what will happen to Martha Stewart over the long haul? It's unclear whether her legal problems will force her out or taint her brand. 
Though incompetence or disagreement with management have also caused the public fall of many top executives, oddly their fate is less predictable. Jacques A. Nasser, forced out of the top post at Ford Motor in October 2001, by the Ford family, has yet to land a new job. Nor has Jill E. Barad, who was drummed out of Mattel's top job, nor Robert W. Pittman of AOL Time Warner.
In fact, some of these executives may be treated more harshly by their brethen than those who have tripped up in the capital. "There is more understanding for someone who has stumbled in Washington than for someone who has taken a company and driven it downhill," said Gerard R. Roche, senior chairman at Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search firm. 
UNLIKE Mr. Pitt and other public servants, most of these ousted executives can find comfort in their overstuffed golden handshakes, which can run into the tens of millions; they don't need to work. But Washington awards a trump card -- lasting access to power. Many corporations are willing to overlook an ethical lapse or a subpar performance and put those with Washington expertise on their boards, to use them as lobbyists or to make them partners in business deals.
Consider Robert L. Livingston, a Louisiana Republican who was on the verge of becoming the House speaker but who resigned from Congress in 1998 after confessing to adultery. Today, he is one of Washington's most sought-after lobbyists, heading the Livingston Group, which took in $3 million in 2000, the most recent data available, with a client roster that has included General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Oracle and 44 others.
"I was almost speaker of the House and I could have been if I had chosen to stay," Mr. Livingston said. "I was in demand then, and I've been in demand ever since I've left."
The same is true for Bob Packwood, a Republican from Oregon who resigned in disgrace in 1995 after an ethics committee unanimously found he had forced himself on nearly two dozen women in his office, including a 17-year old intern. Mr. Packwood reported lobbying income of $1.4 million in 2000 and his client list includes Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and Verizon Communications.
"It takes a while," Mr. Packwood said. Reflecting on the process, he added: "In the real world, they're not going to touch you if you go about moaning and complaining. But if you just go about your life, the real world is pretty forgiving."
So forgiving, in fact, that former Representative Dan Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat who served time in prison for misuse of public funds (he was later pardoned by President Clinton), was even appointed to a corporate board. His opinions on tax issues -- drawn from his long tenure as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee -- appear on the op-ed pages of major newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal.
Last year, when Mr. Rostenkowski was named to the board of American Ecology, a radioactive- and hazardous waste services company, where he served until last April. In announcing Mr. Rostenkowski's selection, the company made it clear that it was looking to capitalize on his connections in the capital.
"We look forward to Mr. Rostenkowski's contributions based on his 36 years of outstanding Congressional service," said Jack K. Lemley, the company's chief executive at the time. "His knowledge and expertise is particularly valuable to American Ecology's efforts to further penetrate the expanding federal government services market." 
Henry G. Cisneros, a former Clinton cabinet secretary, pleaded guilty in 1999 to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about payments to a former mistress, but he has decidedly recovered from charges that could have resulted in a 90-year prison term. 
First, Mr. Cisneros became president and chief operating officer at Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language television broadcaster. In August, he formed a partnership with the Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation, one of the largest homebuilders in the United States, to develop low-cost housing in San Antonio.
Many other examples date from earlier years.
Tony Coelho, who resigned from Congress in 1989 over a controversial junk-bond investment, has made millions as a businessman and even returned to politics when Al Gore hired him to be his campaign chairman before the 2000 election. After resurrecting himself with a brief stint on Wall Street, Mr. Coelho has held positions on 11 corporate boards, the most prominent being Kistler Aerospace.
Michael K. Deaver, who was chief of staff in the Reagan White House, is now one of Washington's most powerful public relations executives; he heads the Washington office of Edelman Public Relations. His conviction on felony perjury charges in 1987 for lying to Congress and to a federal grand jury, and a suspended prison sentence, matter not at all.
Michael P. Castine, who also worked in the Reagan inner circle and is now a managing partner in TMP Worldwide, an executive recruiting firm, recalls the day he brought an old friend -- one caught up in a Washington scandal -- to the Senate dining room. "Six or seven senators of both parties came up to him," Mr. Castine recalled. "Rather than avoiding him, they embraced him." The man simply had too much influence and too many connections to ignore. 
Of course, someone who is tainted, yet has successfully regained footing as a lobbyist or by starting a business, hasn't necessarily gained full redemption. Cracking A-list corporate boards is a taller order, and is likely to be even more so now that the spate of corporate scandals has made all boards more sensitive to public opinion.
"With the enormous scrutiny taking place, corporations only want people who are squeaky clean on their board," said Mr. Roche, the executive recruiter. "It used to be that boards could wink at some of these folks. Not any more. And if you want to put someone on the audit committee, they've got to be up for sainthood. We do work for the AT&T's and the Alcoas of the world. They are not looking for the Bob Packwoods."
Some people applaud the trend. Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, bemoans America's forgetfulness about transgressions by public officials. "They have a public trust, and if they violate it, they should be on the hook," he said. "It's a privilege and a magnificent opportunity to serve the public in these important positions. If they can't cut the mustard, then goodbye."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 14, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Money & Business on Sunday described the careers of officials and executives after they were fired or forced to resign. It said the corporate world was sometimes less forgiving than the political one. The article cited, as examples of those who had yet to land jobs, Jacques A. Nasser, former chief executive of Ford; Jill E. Barad, former chief of Mattel; and Robert W. Pittman, former chief executive of America Online.
Although the article also said that many such executives do not need jobs, the three should have been invited to comment. On Monday Mr. Nasser said he was joining Bank One's leveraged buyout arm. Mr. Pittman said through a spokeswoman for AOL Time Warner that he was not seeking a job at this time. Although messages were left with Mattel and other organizations with which Ms. Barad is or has been associated, she did not return telephone calls this week.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Party of the Rich; 
China's Congress of Crony Capitalists

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
AFTER a 20-year transition, the world's last major left-wing dictatorship, the Communist Party of China, has transformed itself. It is now, arguably, the world's last major right-wing dictatorship.
 With the convening of the 16th Congress in its 81-year history, the party is rewriting its constitution to declare that it represents "advanced forces" -- capitalists -- as much as workers and peasants. Rich people have begun joining the party. A few may be invited to join its policy-making Central Committee. 
 This is China's baldest acknowledgment since veering from orthodox socialism in the late 1970's that it will make workers and peasants fend for themselves. Dictatorship of the proletariat has failed. So the party is giving plutocracy a chance.
Jiang Zemin, the Communist Party chief who plans to retire after the Congress adjourns, has buried the last real pretenses of socialism. "All legitimate income, from work or not, should be protected," he told the party Congress on Friday. 
The old China defended the working class against the capital class. In the new China, Mr. Jiang said, "the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country are identical."
This new strategy marks a calculated gamble to "keep up with the times," as Mr. Jiang said repeatedly, by mimicking capitalist-oriented authoritarian regimes, like the old South Korea, Taiwan and Chile. The fact that those countries have long since become democracies does not disturb party officials. They argue that the transition took 30 years in South Korea and Taiwan. China has just begun.
IT could work -- at least for a time. China's output is on track to grow 8 percent this year, faster than any other big economy, and private business has become the leading force for growth. In fact, the state-run companies that once dominated here now make up, by many calculations, only a third of economic output.
Foreigners have invested more money in China so far this year than anywhere else, including the United States. All that money is flowing because the party has used its near-absolute power to create favorable conditions for capitalists. 
Companies setting up factories in Guangdong or Shanghai can employ workers from the hinterlands, often paying them less than $100 a month for 12-hour days. Migrant laborers can stay in cities only so long as their employers need them; without urban residence permits, they have no local rights. The government does not allow independent unions. There is no collective bargaining.
Corporate tax rates are low. Rich people have only begun to pay income tax. Much of what the government does collect in taxes it uses to build roads, high-speed trains, telecommunications networks and air and shipping ports -- tens of billions of dollars spent each year to support the infrastructure of commerce. It has also indulged in vanity projects, like a new $600 million headquarters for China Central Television and the grandiose Shanghai and Beijing opera houses, all designed by well-known Western architects.
Among wealthy nations, the United States is considered stingy when it comes to social benefits and health care spending. But by percentage of its economy, China makes the United States look profligate. In other words, it does not make rich people share their wealth. The gap between rich and poor has grown almost as fast as overall income, meaning that inequality is increasing nearly in lock step with the country's development.
Such statistics alarm some old-school party members and outspoken intellectuals. Bao Tong, a former top-level government official who lost his post after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, wrote a scathing letter criticizing Mr. Jiang's plans to embrace capitalists. "It implies that it is now time for the party to admit the unspoken truth and formally declare that it has become China's party for the rich and the powerful," he wrote.
Other critics say that opening the party to businessmen will delay a needed political reckoning. "The economic elite love money, not democracy," wrote Kang Xiaoguang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Such views could be widespread, but it is hard to tell, since Mr. Jiang has closed the main leftist academic journals where criticism of his policies was being expressed, including the one that published Mr. Kang's essay.
Mr. Jiang would not agree that his party has abandoned the poor. China, he argues, is still in the "primary stage of socialism." Later on, contradictions between the working and capitalist classes may become acute and the poor will vanquish the rich. But not in the primary stage, which could last 100 years. Capitalism has to blossom before it can be uprooted. It might be called trickle-down Marxism.
The risk of such thinking, some critics say, is that China may aim to recreate the dictatorships of South Korea and Taiwan and miss, becoming Marcos's Philippines or Suharto's Indonesia instead. Those two countries also tried to combine capitalist economies with strongman rule, but were felled by economic stagnation and corruption.
To avoid such a calamity, China should do less for the elite and more to create a populous middle class, said Cui Zhiyuan, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is currently a visiting scholar at the National University of Singapore. 
Professer Cui said the test will be whether China's new leadership, led by the largely unknown Hu Jintao, a longtime party apparatchik, spreads the country's emerging wealth. It needs to spend more on rural health care, to subsidize the poor western regions, to retrain workers fired by failing state companies and to improve education.
He cites one statistic to support his case: to encourage exports of manufactured goods, China now gives up more money each year in export tax credits than it spends on all social welfare programs combined.
"You over-privilege one sector like that at the expense of all the others," Professor Cui said. "Unless China can create a real middle class, it will be just another capitalist dictatorship."
He may be right, but China's Communist Party seems unable to escape the paradox of its continued existence. It has entered the 53rd year of uninterrupted rule, and has 66 million members. But in the party's careerist tradition, many new members are successful capitalists who joined -- became Communists -- to help themselves make more money.
Communism, then, has become crony capitalism. The party is betting that this shift will help it create enough jobs to employ the millions of urban unemployed, as well as millions more among China's vast, impoverished rural population, many of whom are seeking better lives by moving to the cities and industrial zones. 
If this plan works, power will remain entirely with the Communist Party. It's a vision of China's future than appears to include everything but democracy.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Big Plans, No Cash; 
The Education Election

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
WHILE political analysts saw the elections as a show of support for the Bush administration, there was another clear message in the balloting: voters still care about education. 
 In state after state, while other ballot initiatives failed, voters showed strong support for smaller classes, afterschool programs, college scholarships, school construction and universal preschool, even when the price tag was daunting and there was no clear source for the money. 
 "No question, voters are high on education," said Julie Bell, education program director at the National Conference of State Legislatures. "The programs that passed, like class-size reduction and preschool in Florida and afterschool in California, they're big-ticket items, but they're also intuitively appealing. Parents say: 'Yeah, smaller classes make sense. Yeah, preschool makes sense. Yeah, I like the concept of merit scholarships.' " 
In flush years, state legislators eagerly expanded such programs, she said, but as the economy faltered, they pulled back to protect the basic education budget. 
"Voters considering an appealing program don't have to be as cautious, because they don't decide where the money will come from, and what else will have to be cut," Ms. Bell said. "It's going to be fascinating to watch. I have no idea where the legislatures are going to find the money." 
The most striking example of education's voter appeal was probably Florida, where Gov. Jeb Bush won a handy victory -- but so did Amendment 9, the class-size reduction referendum he campaigned against. 
All fall, Governor Bush argued that the amendment, the most restrictive in the nation, would cost $27 billion over eight years, so much it would force tax increases and "blot out the sun." In October, he was even recorded, unawares, saying he had "devious plans" to block the plan if it passed. 
Post election, he has offered no specifics on where he will find the money to limit classes to 18 students from kindergarten to third grade, 22 from fourth through eighth grade and 25 in high school, not to mention paying to make free preschool available to every 4-year-old in the state, as another successful initiative requires. 
Florida ranks near the bottom among states in per-capita education spending, graduation rates and SAT scores, and increasingly, as Florida's school-age population has exploded, parents have found their children in huge classes, sometimes meeting in gym bleachers, auditorium balconies, teacher's lounges or the portable classrooms sprouting next to school buildings. 
Considerable research shows that students do better in small classes. For many parents, it is simply an article of faith that when teachers can give more time to each student, greater academic achievement will follow. 
But there are real concerns about how the class-size amendment will play out. Finding $27 billion -- if it does end up costing that much -- is no easy task in a state whose annual budget is only about twice that. Then, too, there are concerns that requiring so much spending on class-size reduction will block raises for teachers, making it harder to attract good candidates -- and whether hiring thousands of new teachers to fill thousands of new classrooms will flood the schools with unqualified teachers. 
"They've really put themselves up against a wall," said Michael Griffith, policy analyst at the Education Commission of the States. "Usually, when this kind of initiative is passed, they create some funding source, like a lottery. But Florida's isn't tied to any funding mechanism, and they didn't ensure that the state had to keep up its same spending on education, so they'll probably have to shift old education money over to class-size reduction." 
A larger question, nationwide, is just how big the education slice of the state-budget pie should become, at a time when, Mr. Griffith said, education is already the largest piece. 
Right now, it seems, education reigns supreme. In Michigan, for example, voters rejected a measure that would have taken revenues from the state's tobacco settlement away from its merit scholarships, and given them to health care.
TENNESSEE, meanwhile, lifted its ban on gambling, opening the way for a lottery whose proceeds would likely go toward financial aid to college students. 
California voters, too, were generous to education. Even though the state has a $24 billion budget deficit, voters approved the largest bond issue in state history -- $13 billion for school construction -- and passed Proposition 49, the Arnold Schwarzenegger-sponsored measure for tutoring and afterschool programs. 
"It's all well-intended, and we know all these programs can work, but if you don't have enough money, you're going to have to cut something else that's really vital," said Mr. Griffith. "Do you want larger classes and no band or sports, so you can pay for after-school activities? I didn't hear those questions raised during the campaign, but they should have been."

HEADLINE: China's Chameleon Communists 

 BODY:
Behind the scripted spectacle of their weeklong party congress, China's Communists are trying to do something remarkable. They are seeking to anoint leaders and select a message that will maintain a Leninist monopoly on power in a China that long ago abandoned the last vestiges of Communist economics and ideology. Americans, like most Chinese, can watch these events only passively from the outside. But people everywhere have a stake in how smooth a transition this emerging power can make to the post-Communist era. 
 The congress will make a visible effort to attract the loyalty of a rising entrepreneurial class. New membership rules permit billionaire businessmen to become card-carrying Communists. Some of these will now be elevated to party offices. The congress will also sanctify the "three represents" formula associated with its outgoing leader, Jiang Zemin. The doctrine stands Marxism on its head by proclaiming the Communist Party's duty to represent not only workers and peasants but also the capitalist class. Delegates will also choose the new Central Committee, which will formally designate the next generation of party leaders. 
 Whether this congress prepares a successful leap to the future will not be known right away. One requirement, surely, is a clean generational succession in which old leaders, for the first time in China's modern history, voluntarily yield power. That prospect has now been clouded by Mr. Jiang's last-minute maneuvering to retain the kind of behind-the-scenes clout Deng Xiaoping wielded long after his official retirement. Unclear lines of authority and a new leadership weakened at the start are not what China needs. What it does need is a decisive attack on rampant corruption. Graft has eroded the party's moral authority and sparked violent discontent among those who feel bypassed by China's recent economic growth.
Ultimately, there can be no smooth transition without a loosening of the party's repressive political grip. Democracy, the natural complement to China's emerging market economy, is disturbingly absent from Beijing's current agenda. The defeat of party reformers before the Tiananmen Square crackdown has made political liberalization an unmentionable subject in Chinese leadership circles. That silence makes a mockery of the Jiang doctrine. China's 1.3 billion people cannot remain excluded from discussions of their future.

Portfolio manager, Zacks Investment Management

BOOK: "Irrational Exuberance" by Robert J. Shiller (2000)

WHY: "In order to understand the Internet bubble, it helps to understand the reasons behind the last great market crash. What Shiller found was the main reason given by portfolio managers for selling billions of dollars worth of stock at what turned out to be all-time lows was that prices were falling.
 The basic message of the book is that the market is as much driven by rational thought as by mass psychology. As a result, you should always be careful of following the crowd."

BOOK: "Hope's Road" by Joseph P. Kazickas (1999)

WHY "Lithuania was closed off by the Iron Curtain for 50 years. Thousands of Lithuanians were shipped to Siberia. Thousands escaped to the west. Joseph Kazickas, a Lithuanian-American who was influential in helping Lithuania as it regained its independence, shares his story. Like Kazickas, my parents were forced to leave Lithuania during World War II. This book is helping me realize how my parent's Lithuanian-rooted values and traditions have been a foundation for my life and how I can attempt to pass them on to my 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter."

HEADLINE: Jobless, Not Partying 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It was extremely distressing to read "Partying Like It's 1999" (Oct. 20) and learning that many financial-sector unemployed, with considerable assets, also receive $405 a week unemployment benefits, which they consider "pocket money," and spend their time partying and on worldwide vacations. 
 A vast majority of unemployed New Yorkers no longer receive any benefits and struggle daily just to survive as the much-needed 13-week extension of benefits remains stalled in Congress. 
I unfortunately speak from experience. I have spent 25 years in New York City tourism, a sector severely impacted by 9/11. I did receive disaster assistance for the self-employed, for which I am grateful, but payments ceased in June. Without the kindness of neighbors, friends and local merchants I don't know how I would have survived to date and haven't a clue how to survive until next spring without the urgently needed extension.

HEADLINE: San Jose Journal; 
Rooting for Rain And for Relief From Feral Pigs

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 9 

 BODY:
It has been raining cats and dogs here for two days, and people here are glad. Maybe this means it will finally stop raining pigs.
 "The hope is that the pigs will head back to the hills," said Lindsey Wolf, who lives in California Maison, a condominium development at the south end of town. "Now that we have rain, people are waiting it out and hoping for the best." 
 For the last few months, the condominiums and nearby neighborhoods have been under siege by marauding wild pigs. Hungry and thirsty pigs that walk miles for a meal. Huge pigs that outweigh many of the people who live here. Abundant bands of pigs that enjoy nothing more than gouging the succulent lawns and, when stuffed, making more pigs.
"The grass is torn up 100 feet from my front door," Ms. Wolf said. "There is a big gravel area to the side, but they are not interested in that at all. They go right for the lawn."
San Jose is not your average pig town. The capital of Silicon Valley, it has an international airport, a convention center and a new downtown development, Santana Row, which opened the other day with a Gucci store and apartments that are reported to rent for as much as $15,000 a month.
Almost everyone who cares about the city's reputation is fed up with pig talk. "It is not something we will answer questions about," said a spokeswoman for Compass Management Group, the property managers for California Maison.
But San Jose is also one of those cities that look and act something like amoebas, taking new shapes and consuming almost everything in their way. The city and its suburbs in Santa Clara County have crept toward the ranches and scruffy slopes to the east, territory that state wildlife officials say was staked out long ago by the pigs.
"The wild pigs are worse this year than in the past, but the problem is common," said Lt. Dave Fox, a warden with the State Department of Fish and Game. "There are subdivisions and homes where there used to be farms and ranches. Santa Clara County happens to be the hot spot. Next year it will be somewhere else."
As these things go in California, the pigs have a long history here. Some of their ancestors were the barnyard variety, arriving with prospectors in the 1840's and 50's. (Though most ended up on a spit, some made a run for it.) Another bloodline can be traced to Russian wild boars, which were introduced for hunting on some big ranches, including those owned by William Randolph Hearst, in the 1920's and 30's.
"There was interbreeding, and now we have these pigs in almost every county in California," Lieutenant Fox said.
A short drive from San Jose, at Joseph D. Grant County Park, the pigs are fixtures in the grasslands and along hiking trails. Ms. Wolf, the condominium resident, says she happened upon two sows with 23 piglets in a hike at the park in the spring. 
"The babies, oh my God, they are cute," she said. "They look like little striped watermelons. The bigger ones, well, you have to like pigs to think they are cute. The first time I saw the male boars, I thought they were heifers. They are so big I thought they were some breed of small cow."
No one can say for sure, but it is believed the incursion of the pigs into San Jose is a result in part of the unusually dry summer and fall. Before this week's storms, the last recorded rainfall in San Jose was on May 21. The dryness apparently bothered oak trees, which dropped fewer acorns, normally an autumn staple for the pigs.
Tom Pederson, an assistant chief of law enforcement for the State Department of Fish and Game, said the pigs were hardy and, when necessary, traveled long distances for a decent meal. Supper usually amounts to grubs and earthworms, but, pigs being pigs, it can extend to include just about anything they find in the dirt.
The pigs generally show up after dark at California Maison. Though usually content to eat and run, they have been known to chase the occasional unsuspecting resident.
Lieutenant Fox says there has been a pig population explosion in the last 10 years as development has crowded out agriculture. In the old days, farmers and ranchers would keep the pigs in check by shooting them. The meat was even donated to soup kitchens. 
Now there is little hunting in Santa Clara County, and the health authorities prohibit serving meat that is not federally inspected.
"Generally, there isn't enough hunting pressure on these pigs in urban areas," Lieutenant Fox said. "Where there is a lot of hunting pressure, we don't have these problems. They have such a reproduction potential that they, more than deer, can get out of hand real quickly."
A miniature pig-trapping industry developed, but with thousands of the animals roaming the hills, no one believes that is a lasting solution. In the past, when trappers attracted public attention, animal welfare advocates rallied to the pigs' defense. (Te captured pigs were ending up in dog food.) The trapping of 4,000 pigs on Santa Cruz Island off Southern California recently began, but only after four years of planning.
So almost everyone in San Jose is counting on the heavens for some pig relief. By late today, the skies had responded nicely with more than an inch of rain, with an equally dismal forecast until Sunday.
"Once there is something to eat somewhere else, hopefully they will go," Ms. Wolf said. "I guess we will find out in a few weeks."

HEADLINE: Tiny Bird vs. Ski Slopes, With the State in the Middle 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, N.Y., Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Across most of the big-business, big-resort ski industry, from the Tiffany-tinged aeries of Aspen to the sunny slopes of Stowe, the tale of the Bicknell's thrush would likely have a familiar ring to it. Environmentalists and resort owners would stake out the usual positions and say the usual things about bottom lines versus biodiversity, and private gain versus public good. 
 Here at Whiteface Mountain, not far from Lake Placid, the environmental cliches do not work. This ski resort is owned by the people of New York and operated by a state-chartered agency called the Olympic Regional Development Authority. It is one of only a handful of government-owned ski resorts in the nation. The goal is not profit, but economic development, in a remote and snowy corner of the Adirondacks where livelihoods rise and fall on the vagaries of the tourist dollar. 
 And that has put the Bicknell's thrush at the center of some strangely conflicted agendas. One arm of New York State, through the Olympic Authority, contends that the resort must expand significantly over the next few years, offering new trails and amenities -- including a fancy mountaintop restaurant -- if it is to keep from faltering and falling behind its corporate competitors. Another mandate, expressed through state conservation law, requires New York to protect mountaintop bird nesting areas, like the fir forests where the elusive nut-brown thrush returns every spring from its winters in the Caribbean.
"The state knows what it must do," said William Cooke, the director of government relations at Audubon New York. "If this comes down to a choice between improving ski area trails or protecting these birds, I don't see where the state can put in the trails, knowing that it would put birds over the edge."
A spokesman for the Olympic Authority, Sandy Caligiore, said the state also knows it must continue to build up Whiteface and Gore Mountain -- the other ski resort it owns here in the Adirondacks -- or lose market share, and thus the jobs that the State Legislature has ordered it to create.
"To be competitive, we have to put money into snowmaking and grooming and all those things that bring people here," he said.
The Whiteface expansion would require the removal of about 55,000 trees from the summit and slopes of Little Whiteface Mountain, a process that could begin as early as next year, pending approval by the Adirondack Park Agency, which governs development in Adirondack Park. 
Bird experts say that while the Bicknell's thrush is not endangered, its habitat is. In the northeastern United States, they say, acid rain hurts both the trees where the bird nests and the snails it eats. In the islands of the Caribbean, especially places like Haiti, development pressures and poverty have destroyed many of its wintering grounds.
And for the Bicknell's thrush, they say, habitat is everything. Like many migratory species -- and human visitors to the Adirondacks for that matter -- the birds return year after year to the same mountaintop. If the terrain is transformed, the birds might adapt and find nests elsewhere, the experts say, or they might not nest at all. The Olympic Authority's own consultants, on the other hand, say that based on research conducted in Vermont and elsewhere, thinning the trees here would in fact improve thrush habitat. Environmentalists have not expressed serious concerns about other species on Little Whiteface. 
But this is the storied Adirondacks, the ultimate high ground of environmentalism in New York, and that too makes everything different about the battle of the Bicknell's. Protecting the Adirondacks became state business a century ago, with a constitutional amendment that the lands here, with certain exceptions, remain forever wild. 
It is the nagging question of those exceptions -- in the language that governs development at Whiteface, the "appurtenances" required for skiing -- that define the battleground over the Bicknell's thrush.
"Skiing is an anomaly in a protected forest, and that makes every exception important," said Michael G. DiNunzio, the director of research and education at the Adirondack Council, a conservation group. "I'm afraid the Bicknell's thrush could be nickel and dimed to death."
Environmentalists say that fighting a state-owned ski resort can be both harder and easier than battling a private land owner. When a local conservation group called New York Rivers United questioned Whiteface officials recently about water use from the west branch of the Ausable River, for example, the group simply filed a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act. That is not something a private corporation would have to comply with.
Other environmentalists say they fear that the Olympic Authority might be allowed to do things that a private company could not, precisely because of its government status. 
The proposed summit restaurant and lodge, for example, would be visible for miles in many directions. Private developers have mostly been barred from building anything that would spoil the wilderness effect that backpackers and nature lovers come here to seek.
Mr. Cooke at Audubon New York said that he remained optimistic, because New York's bird conservation rules have tended to work well, and because he believes the state will have to follow those rules.
Mr. Caligiore at the Olympic Authority said the question of impact on the Bicknell's thrush would be "revisited."

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
Small Tribe's Cry: Give Us a Casino, or Give Us Your Backyard

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn. 

 BODY:
IT would be so much easier if we could just blame the Indians.
 After all, it is the proposal by the Golden Hill Paugussetts for a casino in Bridgeport that is driving Connecticut even crazier about traffic. It is highlighting, again, economic dysfunction in Bridgeport. And class tensions in mostly affluent Fairfield County. And historic mistreatment of Indians. And the curious settlement of old wrongs with new slot machines. And . . . 
 "I find it very difficult to believe that our nation is allowing a separate nation within our county," a Fairfield real estate agent, Joan Neiley, said after a Chamber of Commerce lunch on Wednesday about the casino. "How can that be? Someone is asleep at the wheel."
Surely that's precisely what some Paugussett real estate broker said circa 1640 upon seeing the first Saab arriving from New Amsterdam.
Of all the proposed (or threatened) Indian casinos in New York and Connecticut, perhaps none carries as much history and unfinished business as this one about 50 miles north of New York City.
A historical plaque in City Hall explains the root of the controversy: "The site of Bridgeport was owned by the Pequonnock or Golden Hill band of the Paugussett Indian tribe."
The tribe now claims 350 members, and its only remaining original property is a log house on a quarter-acre lot near a residential development in Trumbull. A sign calls it Connecticut's "oldest continuing reservation." And surely its smallest.
The tribe, led by a former social worker, Chief Quiet Hawk, and backed by a big development company, expects a decision next month on its second try for the federal recognition it needs to open a casino and entertainment emporium. If the tribe is denied a casino, the chief said, it will go to court seeking payment for 750,000 acres that it claims was stolen, which includes many fancy Fairfield County addresses.
Translation: let us try to be rich like you, or we'll try to make you poor like us. "If we're turned down," the chief warns, "the tribe will be very angry."
It's not just Indians who have been rubbed raw. At the Chamber of Commerce lunch at the Patterson Club in Fairfield, 150 people nodded as Jeff Benedict, head of a statewide Alliance Against Casino Expansion, described Connecticut as "under the gun." He made a strong case that casinos offer mostly low-paying jobs and weaken surrounding economies. And adding cars to the chronically clogged Connecticut Turnpike is like force-feeding cheeseburgers to a heart patient.
The Chamber's president, Mark Hawkins, said area businesses could lose employees to the casino. "It's a tight labor market as it is," he said.
No one at the Patterson Club wanted to pit poor Bridgeport against the rest of robust Fairfield County. "They have nothing against Bridgeport," Mr. Hawkins said. "They want it to survive, even thrive."
THOSE warm wishes were hardly solace to the 200 union workers and neighborhood leaders who rallied for the casino the next day in Bridgeport's desolate East End, eager for jobs and gambling revenues that the Indians promise the city.
Bridgeport's unemployment rate is almost twice the state average, and its property tax rate is at least twice that of nearby suburbs. It has a minor league ballpark and an arena, but a long-planned waterfront development has produced little but land clearing. Also, Mayor Joseph P. Ganim is scheduled to be tried on federal corruption charges in January.
Paugussetts aside, many in Bridgeport feel like a forgotten tribe.
Through intermarriage, most Paugussetts are black, and some people have intertwined the fate of the Indians with the treatment of all minorities. The state N.A.A.C.P. recently called them "fellow sufferers of indignity and discrimination."
With at least six tribes looking to operate casinos in Connecticut, most politicians oppose them. That includes Gov. John G. Rowland, even though the ailing state budget relies on slot machine revenues from Connecticut's two casinos. Few here have forgotten that in the mid-1990's, the governor supported gambling in Bridgeport when, among others, casino moguls like Steve Wynn and that one-man Tribe of Trump nosed around the city.
"This is a shift of power," said Charles Tisdale, a long-serving civic leader and adviser to the tribe. "This is an urban tribe. I grew up with the brothers in the ghetto."
So is the tribe to blame for the casino? Hardly, Chief Quiet Hawk said. "I don't like gambling," he said.
But federal law allows it for Indians, he said. And the forgotten tribe that Bridgeport has become needs something big. "If you give me ITT," the chief said, "I'll take that."

HEADLINE: North Korea Told It Must Dismantle Nuclear Arms Project Promptly 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
The United States, Japan and South Korea called on North Korea today to dismantle its nuclear weapons development program in a "prompt and verifiable manner."
 At a meeting here, the three allies also pledged to seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis caused by North Korea's recent admission that it had been secretly developing nuclear weapons, in violation of a number of international agreements. 
 "North Korea can benefit from greater participation as a member of the international community, but that participation rests on North Korea's prompt and verifiable dismantling of its nuclear weapons programs," said a joint statement issued after the meeting.
However, diplomats here said the discussions, which were held at the assistant foreign minister level, had failed to achieve a consensus on whether to punish North Korea for having broken its commitments or how to do it. 
The meeting today comes amid an intense flurry of consultations leading up to a meeting scheduled for Thursday in New York of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, or KEDO, an international consortium that has been building two light-water nuclear reactors for North Korea as part of an agreement with the country that obliges it to surrender its nuclear materials.
Among the three allies, the United States has been pushing for the hardest line, with the Bush administration saying it has no interest in talking further with North Korea until it complies with the nuclear weapons agreements it recently acknowledged violating. 
Douglas J. Feith, under secretary of defense for policy, said this week that there was a "fundamental disagreement" between the United States and South Korea over how to deal with the North's nuclear program. In pointed comments to reporters after meeting with Japanese officials here on Friday, Mr. Feith said "there should be a penalty, not a reward" for North Korea's behavior.
Some administration officials are believed to favor the suspension of oil deliveries to North Korea that the United States provides as part of the Agreed Framework, the 1994 commitment by the North not to produce nuclear weapons that led to the start of the power plant construction.
Under the consortium's division of labor, South Korea agreed to provide the nuclear cores for North Korea's new reactors, which are believed to be less prone to weapons proliferation than North Korea's own reactors, which are now under international surveillance. Japan, meanwhile, has committed itself to providing much of the financing.
"It is important to deepen our understanding of each other's positions,"Japan's foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, said in a statement on Friday. 
But despite routine comments emphasizing their common ground, each of the United States' main allies in the region has displayed serious reluctance to support any hard-line approach to North Korea.
South Korea's departing president, Kim Dae Jung, has staked his legacy on reconciliation with the North and has resisted the American approach by pressing on with a series of economic cooperation agreements with North Korea at a time when Washington is calling for more pressure.
Indeed, South Korea announced new agreements with North Korea on cross-border cooperation today while the meeting in Tokyo was under way. "Inter-Korean relations are on a path toward reconciliation and peace, even though they are affected by 'turns and twists,' " Mr. Kim said.
Japan, for its part, is locked in talks to normalize relations with the North. Although Japan has said North Korea must comply with its nuclear commitments before new economic cooperation begins, security issues have been trumped here by the drama over the fate of five Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
The five are now visiting Japan for the first time since then and their every move is recorded by television crews. Japanese diplomats appear more eager to persuade North Korea to allow the children and spouses of the five to join their relatives here, rather than risk a diplomatic rupture by backing harsh penalities related to the nuclear weapons issue. 
North Korea, mindful of the intense Japanese attention to the kidnapping victims, warned Japan on Friday that if it pressed the nuclear issue it would destroy any progress made so far in normalization talks.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about a call by the United States, Japan and South Korea for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program misstated a comment by Douglas J. Feith, the United States under secretary of defense for policy, about the views of the United States and South Korea on how to deal with the North's program. He said, "I wouldn't say that there is a fundamental disagreement" between them. He did not say there was a fundamental disagreement.

HEADLINE: COVER STORY; 
A Man of Convictions and Contradictions

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

 BODY:
THE most startling moment in a new two-part documentary about Jimmy Carter comes in a postscript. "I don't have any doubt in my own mind that if I had devoted four more years to the Israeli-Palestinian relationship," Mr. Carter says blandly in an interview shown after the first segment, "we may very well have avoided the conflict and the suffering that has taken place since then."
 That blinkered self-confidence -- arching over his own political disgrace, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, the assassination of Anwar Sadat and a host of other impediments to peace not resolved by the 1978 Camp David Accords -- is a leitmotif of "Jimmy Carter," the 12th presidential biography produced as part of the "American Experience" series by WGBH in Boston. 
 In the interview, with the Georgia Public Broadcasting Service, Mr. Carter outlines his legacy as a statesman to Gwen Ifill, the host of the PBS program "Washington Week." But in the documentary itself, the team of historians, journalists and former aides who reflect on Mr. Carter's star-crossed presidency are more absorbed by his inner contradictions. Those contradictions help explain how this puzzling leader won lasting esteem and the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize two decades after his defeat in one of the biggest landslides in presidential history.
 President Carter was dealt awful cards by history: the energy crisis, the hostage-taking in Iran, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. His own character flaws, however, sealed his fate.
 "What makes him complex is that he's got that kind of hubris and arrogance and also this Christian humbleness," Douglas Brinkley, a Carter biographer, says in the documentary. "That's the battle he is constantly finding himself in."
 "Jimmy Carter," written, produced and directed by Adriana Bosch, a producer at WGBH, was completed in September just a few weeks before the Nobel committee in Oslo announced Mr. Carter's prize, but it is nonetheless timely. The filmmakers took a long look at Mr. Carter's post-presidential years, examining his lonely return to Plains, Ga., in early 1981 and his decision to focus his attention on poverty and human rights through the Carter Center at Emory University in Atlanta. His post-presidential deeds include building housing for the poor through the volunteer organization Habitat for Humanity, monitoring election fraud in Panama and campaigning to combat river blindness in Africa.
 Almost two-thirds of all Americans were born before 1976 and have some recollection of the Carter years. Ms. Bosch, a Cuban emigre, has more familiarity than most. In 1984 she was finishing a Ph.D. on Mr. Carter's foreign policy in Nicaragua (she concluded that his noninterventionist policy helped cement the Sandinista regime) when she was hired as a researcher at WGBH. She worked on many biographies -- Ulysses S. Grant, Winston Churchill -- but a proposal to do a piece on Mr. Carter in 1993 was scratched. It seemed too soon.
 "If we had done it then, we would have missed Haiti, North Korea and Iraq, all the things that helped him win the Nobel Prize," Ms. Bosch said. She said the documentary gave her a better appreciation of Mr. Carter than she had when studying his foreign policy in Central America.
 Scenes of Mr. Carter in Cuba last May playing softball with Fidel Castro and calling for an end to the United States embargo, in labored Spanish, demonstrate his convictions and also the willful self-righteousness that has irritated his successors in the Oval Office, Democratic and Republican.
 That willingness to breach former-president etiquette and criticize American policy while traveling abroad was one of many reasons Mr. Carter and Bill Clinton did not get along. It was also one of the factors that led the Norwegian judges to select Mr. Carter for this year's prize; the jury chairman told reporters that Mr. Carter's prize was meant as a rebuke to President Bush and his policy in Iraq, insulting both Mr. Bush and Mr. Carter. (In the first part of the interview, Mr. Carter disregards the slight, repeating what he said at the time of the controversy: other judges had disagreed with the chairman.)
 Mr. Carter's image as a decent but vacillating leader out of his depth in the White House is undermined by biographical material that reveals the confidence, stubborn certainty and relentless ambition that got him to Washington. It spans his determination to attend the Naval Academy in Annapolis and his tenure as governor of Georgia, where he rode roughshod over the State Legislature. His victory in 1976, however, is repeatedly described as a "miracle."
 Ms. Bosch and her team dug up lots of old films, from scratchy home movies of the Carters as a young Navy couple to Sadat in a white leisure suit preparing to storm out of Camp David. Television images of bygone periods can evoke nostalgia. But even at a distance of a quarter century, there is not much in that era to get misty over.
 There was the post-Watergate euphoria of watching Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter wave off their inaugural limousine to walk hand in hand down Pennsylvania Avenue. Within a year, economic recession, the Burt Lance banking scandal and a scattered agenda had eroded public confidence in Mr. Carter, the Bible-carrying peanut farmer who had promised a government as "compassionate as the American people."
 In the documentary, Hendrik Hertzberg, a New Yorker writer who served as Mr. Carter's White House speech writer, puts it rather ruefully: "Jimmy Carter was exactly what the American people always say they want."
 The so-called "malaise speech" in 1979, at the height of the energy crisis, in which a preachy Mr. Carter appeared to blame Americans for their woes, is almost as painful to watch now as it was then.
 "You cannot be but awed by his determination and his will," Ms. Bosch said. "Getting from that hole in the wall that is Plains to the White House was a great accomplishment. But to go from a failed presidency to the Nobel Peace Prize was an even greater one. Believe me, he was nobody when he got back to Plains."

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 11-10-02: ECONOMICS OF OIL; 
Where the Oil Is

BYLINE:  By Noam Scheiber

 BODY:
There have been few more encouraging developments in the war on terror than a statement Vladimir Putin made in Germany about six weeks ago. "In case of regional conflicts breaking out, Russia is prepared to supply more oil," the Russian president announced. "And I say this loud and clear."
 Today the United States imports roughly half the oil it uses, and one quarter of its total imports comes from the Persian Gulf. It goes without saying that easing our dependency on Middle Eastern oil producers could greatly simplify our foreign policy. The question is whether it's possible. 
 At first glance the signs are encouraging. Russia now produces seven million barrels of oil per day, second in the world only to Saudi Arabia. The Caspian republics to its south -- mainly Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan -- already produce two million barrels per day and have at various points been hailed as the "next Persian Gulf." Together the three former Soviet states could be producing 13 million barrels per day by 2010. Elsewhere, capacity in Latin America is expected to grow by three million barrels per day over the next decade -- as much as the United States currently imports from any one country. And technological advances are making it cost-effective to extract oil off the coast of West Africa and the Gulf Coast of the United States and to refine oil in Canada and Venezuela that was until recently unusable. West African production alone could rise by from 4.3 million to 6.8 million barrels per day over the next 10 years.
But the optimism quickly fades upon closer examination. For starters, much of the newly extracted oil will simply replace declining output from existing fields. Norway is now the second-largest non-OPEC exporter of oil in the world, but earlier this year its oil ministry announced that the country's oil production had begun to decline, a drop-off that will reach 5 percent by 2005. Oil production in the United Kingdom, which currently outstrips that of Iraq, hit its peak three years ago. Production in Mexico, the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States (behind Canada, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela), is poised to peak in the next five years. Many analysts predict that overall non-OPEC production will begin to decline some time this decade, even after all the new supply is brought online. 
And even the sources of rising production aren't without problems. Much of Russia's vast reserves lie in Siberia, where the country's primitive pipeline infrastructure makes shipping a nightmare. Russia is currently able to export less than half the oil it produces. But that still puts it years ahead of its Caspian neighbors -- whose reserves most analysts concede have been massively overhyped anyway. In Nigeria -- which today accounts for 8 percent of oil imports to the United States and has the proven reserves to produce one-third more oil by 2007 -- more than 20 raids by militants depressed oil production by 5 percent in 2000. And Colombia, once a top exporter to the United States, until very recently suffered such frequent guerrilla attacks on its 500-mile oil pipeline -- five bombings a day at the peak -- that it had to petition the United States for $100 million in "counterinsurgency" aid to keep a major oil company from fleeing.
True, advances in drilling technology have made it financially feasible to extract oil from ocean depths of 5,000 to 10,000 feet, opening up fields off the coast of West Africa and Florida that would be more safely insulated from sabotage. But extracting oil from deep in the ocean is still much more expensive than extracting it from the ground. Most estimates suggest Saudi oil could be profitably sold for between $2 and $5 per barrel. By contrast, according to Steve Andrews, an independent energy analyst, deepwater oil must fetch a price of $14 to $16 per barrel before drilling becomes profitable. Likewise for oil extracted from tar sands in Canada and certain areas in Venezuela; that oil is so heavy and viscous that the refining costs were once prohibitive. 
And yet the biggest obstacle to freeing ourselves from Middle Eastern oil has nothing to do with politics or chemistry or engineering. It has to do with an iron law of economics. Oil, after all, trades in a globalized market. As such, its price is determined by the interaction of global supply and global demand. And since any large producer can affect the oil supply, any large producer can affect oil prices. Which is to say, as long as the Persian Gulf states' 600 billion-plus barrels of proven reserves (262 billion in Saudi Arabia alone) give them control over the vast majority of the world's discovered oil -- and few now believe there are any major oil "provinces" still waiting to be found -- no amount of help from Vladimir Putin will solve our problem.

HEADLINE: The Doctor Is Involved 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
DR. ANTHONY MAZZARELLI is not your usual customer at Sandy's, a cramped, kitschy place the size of a small railway car that serves breakfast at all hours on the western fringe of residential Center City Philadelphia.
 "I come here every morning, just because," Dr. Mazzarelli said, wedged into one of Sandy's back booths. "Many times, there is a 50-year-old guy and an 80-year-old guy and we just trade stories. This is the kind of place where you find out what people really think." 
 It is surprising that Dr. Mazzarelli has even the barest moment to eat breakfast, let alone chat with his elders. At 27, he has the kind of packed resume that might make even the most manic workaholic breathless just reading it. It ought to be enough that he is in the last year of a six-year program at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Camden and the University of Pennsylvania that is allowing him to get law and medical degrees together. At the same time, he is also getting a master's degree in bioethics at Penn. 
Oh, yes, and then there is his internship with Michael Smerconish, a Philadelphia radio talk-show host, and the summer associate's job that Dr. Mazzarelli recently finished with the prestigious Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter. And the class on medical ethics at Drexel University that he began teaching after the original instructor bowed out. And, in his spare hours, his habit of sending production notes and story ideas to the producers of the NBC-TV drama "E.R.," where he served as a medical adviser in the summer of 2001.
But all that is secondary to the focus of his nascent career.
"My passion is Camden," he said. "Of the cities in the United States, it is arguably the poorest. I've had the privilege of going to medical school there and learning from my patients about their lives. It is important to help revive the city."
Dr. Mazzarelli is going back to Camden next year, after finishing his degrees, for a residency in emergency medicine at Cooper Hospital. Until then he will be visiting the city often to check up on the clinic he started as a medical student in 2000, the Healthcare Outreach Project, a student-run clinic designed to give primary medical care at no cost to those without insurance. 
The clinic is the spur that gained Dr. Mazzarelli his latest honor, being named by the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce as one of its 10 Outstanding Young Americans for 2002. In the past, this award -- given to "the best, brightest, and most inspirational leaders America has to offer" -- has gone to folks like Bill Clinton, John F. Kennedy, Arthur Ashe, Bill Bradley and Christopher Reeve.
Dr. Mazzarelli's mentors believe he belongs in that company.
"If we want the ideal physician, the physician leader, the commitment to community and commitment to patients, Anthony is that model," said Dr. Paul R. Mehne, the associate dean at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. "He is the renaissance medical student. Everything he does is a learning experience. He gets everyone around him excited about whatever he does."
Dr. Mazzarelli shrugged off a suggestion that his crammed schedule was unusual.
"My work is all connected," he said. "It's not as if I am doing carpentry. Everyone in modern society is busy."
But he does acknowledge being proud of the Healthcare Outreach Project.
"We saw a need, as did everyone, and thought we, as medical students, could address it," he said. "Many people said, 'Oh, you'll never be able to set that up.' But we just didn't take that seriously."
The clinic is open four hours a week to patients who drop in. In addition, Dr. Mazzarelli and his fellow students persuaded specialists on staff at Robert Wood Johnson to donate time for some follow-up care. The medications come from a grant from Pfizer, the big drug company, and the Association of American Medical Colleges. Dr. Mazzarelli said that this year, every second- and third-year medical student at Robert Wood Johnson is giving two weeks of time to the project.
"I am now merely an adviser, making sure those people who gave us promises in the beginning will keep up with them," he said. "It is the foundation of what good medical care should be."
Dr. Mazzarelli grew up about 10 miles north of Camden, in the middle-class suburb of Cinnaminson. Both his grandfather and his father were chiropractors, and he was fascinated by medicine from a young age. He was a soccer and track star in high school and went to Washington and Lee University in Virginia, where he was captain of both the soccer and track teams while still making Phi Beta Kappa and graduating summa cum laude in biology.
He is clearly not the shy type. And he revels in his multimedia life. He got the e-mail address of an "E.R." producer and persuaded the fellow to let him come to the set as an unpaid intern in the summer of 2001.
"It may be good or bad, but more people get their information about medicine from places like 'E.R.' than anywhere else," Dr. Mazzarelli said. "I wanted to make sure it was presented correctly."
Though "E.R." forbids him to disclose exactly what he has told the producers about specifics on the set, he said that, in general, he suggests nuances about medicine to make sure the shows do not look foolish. He has appeared in the background of a couple of scenes. The producers said he even inspired a minor character last season: a woman, majoring in both law and medicine, who ended up as a patient in the emergency room.
"Anthony is really interested in medical ethics, and that includes communicating to the public," said Dr. David Magnus, the graduate studies director at Penn's Center for Bioethics, where Dr. Mazzarelli is getting his master's degree. "We have to reach out on many issues and be on TV and in the newspapers to make people aware of ethical problems. He is really savvy about that."
Mr. Smerconish has given Dr. Mazzarelli a lot of leeway in researching topics for his radio talk show on WCAU-AM, occasionally putting him on the air as an expert.
"Take the smallpox vaccination issue -- he was the perfect person to talk about it," said Mr. Smerconish, who also sometimes relies on Dr. Mazzarelli's research for commentaries that he does for KYW-AM, the all-news radio station in Philadelphia, and a column he writes for The Philadelphia Daily News.
"His biggest problem after his residency will be figuring out what to do," Mr. Smerconish said. "He could be in law, in medicine or in media or perhaps all three. He's going places, but he's not someone who offends. That is his greatest strength."
Dr. Mehne at Robert Wood Johnson said he was ecstatic that Dr. Mazzarelli was coming back to Camden to do his residency, saying that he could really have gone anywhere. But Dr. Mazzarelli said there was really no choice.
"I would love to be part of the solution of bringing Camden back," said Dr. Mazzarelli, who has been appointed to the Camden Committee for Emergency Preparedness and Public Health. 
"My fiancee and I have talked about buying a place and moving to Camden," he said, knowing that most other successful doctors would not relish living in one of the most impoverished cities in the country. "Otherwise, I'm just like everyone else who only talks a good game."

HEADLINE: The Truck Stops Here 

BYLINE:  By MARC FERRIS 

 BODY:
WHEN Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg halted New York City's plastic and glass recycling last summer, he disrupted routines that had taken years to establish. "It still feels weird throwing away glass jars," said Chris Kelly, a Manhattan resident. "Now I have to think about the garbage again."
 The confusion rippled into the suburbs. "I got a lot of calls," said Mari Anne Gallagher, program administrator at the recycling unit of the Westchester County Department of Environmental Facilities. "Everyone thought all of recycling was halted, especially in the southern part of the county. I still hear it: 'Isn't our recycling suspended?' " 
 No, it is not. 
Westchester has been able to manage its refuse as well as it has in large part because of the way it has handled recycling and reuse. 
So far Westchester has avoided New York City's refuse woes -- because planning and capital expenditures over the last 20 years have provided at least a temporary cushion against the vagaries of the garbage market. The collection, sorting and disposal of municipal solid waste, including household garbage and recyclables, hazardous materials and bulk goods, occur within the county's borders largely under county auspices. New York City, which closed the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island in 2001, is dependent on contractors to truck its refuse out of state, at substantial cost to taxpayers. 
"We've pointed to Westchester as an example of how to conduct a successful recycling program," said Laura Haight, senior environmental associate with the New York Public Interest Research Group in Albany. "New York City has certain collection problems that the county doesn't have regarding high rises, but Westchester's investment in its recycling facility cuts processing costs and it lets them do a better job of marketing their material." 
But Westchester's success doesn't mean the county is worry free when it comes to recycling, or waste removal in general.
The county's disposal space is expected to reach capacity in 2009. Siting another ashfill in the county will be almost impossible -- appropriate sites are scarce in this increasingly populous area and no municipality wants one -- and there is no sign that the average 1,000 pounds of household garbage generated last year by every man, woman and child in the county will abate. That's not counting 71,335 tons of municipally collected recyclables or the 324,219 tons of garbage and recyclables collected by private haulers serving local businesses. 
"This is on our radar screen already," said Robert N. Matarazzo, the deputy commissioner of the county's Department of Environmental Facilities, which spent almost $40 million on solid waste in 2001. "Years go by very quickly in this business." 
But garbage rarely generates controversy in Westchester these days because it disappears at bargain prices, and the topic is cloaked in euphemisms. Better to call the final resting place for the county's nonrecyclable household trash the Sprout Brook Disposal Facility than an ash heap. And there are no dumps, only landfills. 
Solutions to the garbage problem have always reflected the short-term cultural orientation that created the situation in the first place. In the horse and buggy days, municipalities took their garbage to open pits scattered around the county or loaded it onto barges, where it was dumped at sea. After World War II, towns built open-pit incinerators, many of which still tower over local public works garages. Schools and apartment buildings fired their own incinerators, too, but the federal Clean Air Act of 1972, along with protests against the particles discharged through the unfiltered smokestacks, shut them down. From 1924 to 1986, most residential waste ended up in the Croton Point Landfill. In 1995, the county spent $50 million to cap it and monitor the leacheate and methane gas. 
THE county reports a 42 percent recycling rate for municipal waste, and every ton diverted to a recycling plant costs $28 to process instead of the $72 it costs to dispose of a ton of trash. New York City hovered around 20 percent, as do Yonkers, Mount Vernon and Pelham Manor. 
The county's requirement that businesses and residents separate their trash for pickup helps boost the county's overall rate. Private carters recycled at the impressive rate of 47 percent. Most of the material they collect -- trash from office buildings and other businesses -- includes a large proportion of paper and cardboard. In 1982, as the Croton dump -- er, facility -- neared its capacity, Westchester legislators created a Refuse Disposal District to coordinate waste removal and pool costs. Thirty-six municipalities joined; seven villages and towns in the northeastern part of the county chose not to participate. In New Castle, North Castle, North Salem, Pound Ridge, Somers, Lewisboro and Bedford, homeowners contract with licensed private haulers. 
Private haulers have attracted considerable scrutiny by the county. Organized in 1999 and modeled after a similar regulatory agency insituted in New York City, the county's Solid Waste Commission now licenses the industry, which had been dominated by organized crime. So far, competition has returned and rates have dropped, said Mr. Hogan. 
The lack of public sanitation departments has not caused problems, although in Lewisboro, recycling can be a sore spot, said Thomas D. Herzog, town supervisor. Private carters are allowed to collect comingled recyclables and separate the loads at a waste transfer station, where the contents of small trucks are loaded onto bigger ones and taken to the next destination. "I have dutifully separated my garbage into bins and watched, from my window, as the truck pulled up and the guy dumped everything into the back," Mr. Herzog said. "When I asked the carters about it, they said, 'Don't worry, we separate everything at the transfer station.' I don't really believe that." 
Private carters would separate recyclables if it were economically viable, but the only material valuable enough to remove from the trash is corrugated cardboard, said John Mazzucco, the county's sole full-time sanitation code enforcement officer. 
"Things do slip through sometimes, but as a whole the system works," he said. "I'm not looking to make guys spend more money, because that's passed to the waste generator. I want to find a way to make it work for both sides." 
New York State passed its recycling law in 1988, which charged counties with the task of developing a recycling program. County legislators responded by spending $20.8 million for an M.R.F. -- known as the "Murf" -- the Daniel P. Thomas Material Recovery Facility in Yonkers, a monument to the function-over-form school of architecture just south of the toll booths on the New York State Thruway across from Home Depot. 
Illustrating the degree to which source-separated recycling has permeated the culture of garbage collection, Irvington recently bought a spiffy new truck with two compartments: one for paper, the other for glass, metal and plastic, which eliminates the need to make two runs. 
Municipalities dump at the Murf free of charge; private haulers are barred (they go to private murfs and transfer stations around the county run by the waste management companies). There, the material is separated, the paper and aluminum are baled, and trucks take them to middlemen around the region. The plant has the capacity to break its product down even further and cater to specialized markets. 
"One paper mill in New Jersey, within 20 miles from here, wants just newsprint, not the glossy inserts," said James J. Hogan III, director of environmental management at the Department of Environmental Facilities. "Marcal wants inserts, junk mail, colored paper and magazines. If it is economically logical, we are prepared to break our material down even further." 
The facility only processes plastics coded 1 or 2 -- detergent jugs, milk containers and soda bottles. Unmarketable crisp plastic, coded 3 to 7, is removed by hand and placed into the garbage stream. Gray cardboard -- cereal boxes and the like -- gets the same treatment.
"I would prefer not to have that come in at all," said Mr. Hogan. "We don't want to downgrade our material." 
Glass, which usually comes in broken, cost $170,000 to process and ship last year, but is accepted at the Murf to encourage broader compliance with the law, said Mr. Hogan. The county also collects household chemicals, computer equipment and tires several times a year at various locations and disposes of them out of the county. White goods, including washing machines and refrigerators collected on bulk pickup days, are sold to scrap metal dealers. 
Yard waste, which constitutes one-third of the waste stream from April through December, represents recycling's next frontier. Responding to a state directive in 2000, the county stopped sending grass clippings, leaves, branches and brush to the incinerator since it was recyclable as compost. As with other recyclables, it will take time for market forces to catch up with the law. 
"Yard waste doesn't yield the tipping fees that food waste does," said John Crockett of Mother Nature's Farms in Carmel, who is exploring how to expand his composting capacity. Mr. Hogan offered him $17 a ton to accept the county's yard waste; private haulers pay him $45 a ton to dump food waste at his plant. It costs $58 a ton for private haulers to "tip," or drop the the waste, at the Peekskill incinerator. 
Mr. Crockett is also concerned about the use of herbicides used to kill crabgrass and dandelions. The county, he said, is "going to have a problem getting rid of yard waste if I can't prove that the finished product is pesticide-free."
"Organic growers are not going to want it," he said. 
Modifying people's behavior represents another obstacle to the economical disposal of yard waste. "Change is hard, especially in the villages, where people are used to a high level of service," said Mayor Brian Monahan of Dobbs Ferry, which stopped picking up grass clippings last year. The village brings other yard waste to the county transfer station in Yonkers under a program initiated by the county to collect leaves and brush and transport it to commercial composting facilities. 
NONRECYCLABLE household trash collected by municipalities within the Refuse Disposal District goes to the huge incinerator in Peekskill. Its smokestack bears as much resemblance to its forebears as a rotary phone does to a cellphone. It is equipped with pollution control devices to reduce, but not remove, mercury and dioxins. 
The Peekskill plant is known as the Resource Recovery Facility, or Resco. Almost as imposing as its neighbor on the Hudson River waterfront, the Indian Point nuclear plant, the enterprise is now jointly operated by the county and Wheelabrator, a subsidiary of Houston-based Waste Management, which also has a contract to run day-to-day operations at the Murf. At the plant the trash is burned at 2,500 degrees and turned into energy, enough to power 53,000 homes when operating at capacity, which is sold mostly to Con Edison. The plant also generates $6 million annually for the coffers of Peekskill as part of the complicated deal allowing it to be situated within the city. 
Inside, huge piles of garbage are lifted by giant cranes, which load the boilers. The plant can only accept household garbage; barred items include construction and demolition debris, industrial or bio-medical waste, hazardous material or appliances, which can jam up the works and cause a pit fire. Though solid waste facilities are frequent NIMBY targets, the people at Crystal Bay caterers thought nothing of opening their business a stone's throw away from a nine-story garbage incinerator.
"Most people don't give it a second thought," said Joanna Orsini, director of sales and marketing. "The property is maintained well and there have been no unusual odors or anything of that nature." 
Burning garbage begets the problem of residue disposal. Thomas B. Maillet, plant manager, says the ash is non-toxic although others question that assertion.
For the past 18 years, trucks filled with garbage ash have shuttled between the incinerator and the Sprout Brook Disposal Facility at the site of a former quarry in Cortlandt near the Putnam County border. The ashfill is predicted to reach capacity when the contract with Wheelabrator runs out in 2009. Costs to transport the ash out of the county would be passed on to taxpayers and consumers, since private haulers also dump refuse at the plant. 
Separated by a thin line of trees, the Sprout Brook winds north of the ashfill and its water is diverted to create a beach. The mountain of ash, mixed with lime and topped by gravel, rises from the Sprout Brook valley to the height of the surrounding ridges. Rainfall leacheate is collected, tested and sent to the Peekskill Water Treatment Facility, downstream from the disposal site. 
Though technologically advanced, the site remains a stopgap, like the solutions of old. Standing atop the pile, which will eventually contain more than two million tons of material, the site manager Mario A. Parise gazed into the distance at a bulldozer grooming the contents of another 30-ton truck in the fourth quadrant, the project's final phase. The barren surroundings look like a moonscape strewn with bits of charred metal. 
"If we could find a way of reusing half of it, say, it would at least cut down our overall intake and buy some time," Mr. Parise said. "But it's always going to be a problem."

The Next Frontier: Leaves and Grass
TWO years ago, James J. Hogan III, the county's recycling czar, gave municipal managers a new headache when he banned organic yard waste from the Peekskill incinerator.
He pledged to develop a program that would centralize the collection and disposal of 134,708 tons of grass clippings, bushes, hedges, leaves and small trees collected by the municipalities in 2001. Private carters collected 59,790 tons. 
The county arranged with the city of Yonkers to open a transfer station for yard waste last year. The county contracts with Waste Management, a private company, which trucks the material to commercial composting sites outside the county and the tip fee, $11 a ton, is subsidized to encourage participation. The program cost the county $468,433 last year, which was offset by selling the capacity at the Peekskill incinerator that would have been filled with yard waste to private haulers at market rates. 
Of the 37 eligible municipalities, 18 are participating, but Mr. Hogan's plan to make the recycling of yard waste as automatic as the collection of paper, glass and plastic is encountering growing pains. Mr. Hogan prefers to persuade rather than to crack down on lax towns and villages; penalties are light as long as a good faith effort is shown. 
Instituting change into garbage collection routines is like turning a battleship around. The market is just catching up to the influx of organic refuse. Municipalities that dispose of their refuse within their borders can cut costs considerably, but finding appropriate sites is not always easy. In remote areas of the county, many homeowners have enough land to start a compost pile or dump leaves and grass without adverse affect. 
"It's really no problem," said Thomas D. Herzog, supervisor of the town of Lewisboro, which is outside the county's disposal district. Some residents pay a private hauler to remove organic waste. In the part of town that has small plots, the town vacuums up the leaves, which are taken to a composting site in town that is rented from a private landowner. 
In lower Westchester, open property is more scarce. In 1996, Scarsdale responded to resident complaints and closed its composting facility, across from the pool, and created ballfields from the reclaimed land. The village used a private carter to dispose of its refuse until it joined the county's consortium last year. Hastings-on-Hudson closed its composting center along the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail in June and is weighing its options. 
The county helped Eastchester, where a horse stable helps mask the composting odors with manure, become self-reliant. 
"Before it all went into the garbage, but we've reduced the rate of removal to half of the cost of waste," said Pete Bonhag, superintendent of highways.
With the county's support, the town's compost site accepts yard waste from the villages of Tuckahoe and Bronxville; town crews turn the pile regularly, creating rich fertilizer. Residents help themselves. 
The policy has fostered other creative partnerships. The public works departments in Rye and Port Chester share equipment and reduce the cost of removing yard waste. Port Chester borrows Rye's wood chipper and uses the chips for landscaping in public parks and sidewalks. Taking the small trees out of the waste stream lowers the city's disposal cost. In turn, Port Chester collects Rye's green waste at a discount and takes it to Yonkers. Amount saved for each city: about $1,200.
"It's a win-win-win situation," said Joe Carlucci, general foreman at the Rye Department of Public Works. "It saves money, it's good for the environment, and we're creating a useful product."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK ABROAD; 
Great White Way? Try Great White North

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
There is no place like New York City -- except maybe Canada. 
Last week, "Rudy!," an unauthorized biographical movie about the city's previous mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, began shooting on the mean streets of Montreal.
 Eh? 
 "I guess they are going to show him watching baseball games at the Skydome or eating pommes frites, rather than eating at Patsy's," Representative Anthony Weiner, a Democrat who represents portions of Brooklyn and Queens, said Wednesday. He was speaking at a rally on the steps of City Hall, where members of the Screen Actors Guild and other film industry unions joined him to call for new federal tax credits to encourage American filmmakers to make their movies at home. 
"Everybody is going to be talking with that weird accent," he added.
"Rudy!," which is scheduled to be shown on USA Network early next year, is based on Wayne Barrett's unauthorized biography of Mr. Giuliani. The movie begins with 9/11, then goes into a series of flashbacks about Mr. Giuliani's private life, trysts and all, and his rise to political power. James Woods stars as the mayor and Penelope Ann Miller plays Donna Hanover, his wife.
"It is unheard of that anything about Rudy Giuliani should be done in Canada," said Jim Hovey, the Eastern regional director of Local 600, the cinematographers' guild.
But, according to USA Network, New York will get at least a cameo role in "Rudy!" "We are paying a premium to do that," a network spokeswoman said, "and we do support any efforts that would make production in the U.S. more economically feasible."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani declined to comment. But a source close to him said, "Shooting this in Montreal will speak to the authenticity."
Authentic or not, Canada is unquestionably, a cheaper place to make movies than New York, and "Rudy!" has struck a new nerve in an old debate.
In 1998, the Canadian government instituted a tax credit, equal to 11 percent of labor costs, to encourage film and video production. Several provinces, including Quebec, offer additional subsidies, which allow United States producers to save 22 percent or more on wages. Throw in a weak Canadian dollar and, voila: money now migrates north like geese in spring.
New York has been hit particularly hard by the change. From 1999 to 2001, feature film spending in the state plummeted to $167 million from $695 million, while spending in Canada rose to $1 billion, up from $413 million. According to some estimates, Canadian subsidies have cost New York nearly 11,000 jobs and $26 million in local tax revenue.
Canadians won't take the blame. 
"Incentives of various forms are used in many jurisdictions, including plenty in the United States," said Peter Lloyd, who heads political and economic relations at the Consulate General of Canada in New York. 
"This company called USA Network should be true to its name and employ people here in the United States of America," Representative Weiner said.

BYLINE:  By LAURA PEDERSEN; Laura Pedersen's novel, "Beginner's Luck," will be published in paperback in January by Ballantine Books.

 BODY:
JENNY EDRINGTON looked warily at the double entree of pan-seared beef tenderloin and braised short ribs. "For some reason," she said, "people with money never cook their meat." Her husband is a hunter, she said, so she "knows what raw flesh looks like." To be safe, she ate around the edges.
 Ms. Edrington, cheerful in a black gown, was in town from Festus, Mo. (pop. 9,660), to attend a benefit for the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation at the New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square. And she had foreseen food-related problems. "I had a snack right before I came," she said, "because rich people don't eat too much." 
 The new New York is a long coach ride from Edith Wharton's old one. Back then, society members remained ensconced in their private clubs, while barkeeps stayed in their bars, scullery maids in their sculleries, and footmen on their feet. 
More than a century of democratization has changed all that. But in the world of benefits in recent years, the "high" has dropped even farther out of high society. 
"It's only since the early 1990's that everything has loosened up," said Pamela Fiori, editor in chief of Town and Country magazine, one of the last great chronicles of the wealthy. Some old-guard cultural events, like the opening-night gala at the Metropolitan Opera, attract a fairly homogeneous crowd. But most "society" benefits now draw people from all different backgrounds. 
Competition for money has powered this change. The long bull market and cutbacks in government money for the arts, medical research and education have fostered enormous growth in philanthropy, with the number of American charities rising by almost three-quarters in the last decade. But then the stock market leveled out, and although giving hasn't decreased, it has not increased as it did in the 90's.
As a result, more and more fund-raisers are jostling for a fairly constant amount of dollars.
To meet the challenge, organizers of charity benefits are courting a wider pool of potential guests. Many charities have also reduced the required donation from $10,000 and $5,000 a plate to $1,000 and even $500. To offer prospective guests from the less-than-lofty classes more of the tastiest bait -- celebrities -- they are asking board members to call in favors or even pay stars an appearance fee. 
New York is a major site of the new, unbuttoned benefit, simply because it is the fund-raising capital of the country. The New York writer Calvin Trillin, a popular master of ceremonies at such evenings because he is so funny, recalls many occasions when the benefit chairman stood to announce that more than $1 million had been raised. "It's almost a nightly occurrence," he said.
New York's philanthropic prominence has helped it adapt quickly to this new, more competitive landscape. "They're the ultimate realistic city," said Barbara Goldsmith, the social historian. "They're quick and creative when it comes to adjusting to changes in climate and economy."
All of which helps explain why Ms. Edrington, a research coordinator at Washington University in St. Louis, was in the grand ballroom of the Marriott Marquis for the Reeve benefit one weekday night earlier this fall. Her experience, and that of other neophyte benefit attendees, suggest that the traditional society benefit may have clinked its last crystal, or, at least, that exclusivity is not what it used to be.
What was Ms. Edrington's final verdict on her meal, which also included a chocolate truffle cake? Given the skill of the comedian who was the night's featured performer, she decided it was a good thing that she didn't overeat. "I was trying to be elegant in my nice clothing," she said, "but was busting a gut laughing at Robin Williams."
OSCAR WILDE once said that with an evening coat and a white tie, anybody, even a stockbroker, could acquire a reputation for being civilized. But formal dress is not necessary these days, as the Reeve affair showed. Although most of the men wore tuxedos, the women were outfitted in everything from evening gowns to standard-issue cocktail dresses and pantsuits. The crowd resembled the city itself, a mix of ethnicities and occupations, interspersed with pockets of business titans and celebrities.
The benefit, billed as a "Magical Evening Celebrating Christopher Reeve's 50th Birthday," drew 1,000 guests. Tickets were $750 a person, or $1,000 for seating near the front, closer to the celebrities. Included in the price of admission was the performance by Mr. Williams, a friend of Mr. Reeve's from Juilliard and the first person to make him laugh after he was paralyzed in 1995 by a spinal cord injury.
Following a cocktail reception, at which waiters in white jackets circulated with trays of Champagne and seafood and filet mignon hors d'oeuvres, guests were ushered into the hotel's grand ballroom. Tall lavender candles and magnificent 16-foot-high flower arrangements dotted 100 starched tablecloths in bright autumnal colors.
Fame may be the biggest draw in the newly democratic world of benefits. This evening was no exception: a dozen celebrities were dangled before the crowd. In addition to Mr. Williams, the roster included Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Barbara Walters, Alan Alda, Kim Cattrell, Richard Belzer, Al Roker and Ron Meyer, president of Universal Studios.
Two high school seniors from Orange County, Calif., Alison King and Katy Carew, had no problem choosing a favorite from that lineup. Alison, in a peach gown, and Katy, in sophisticated black, had traveled 3,000 miles to see Ms. Zeta-Jones, wife of Mr. Douglas and his co-star in the film "Traffic."
"She's so gorgeous," Ms. King said of her idol. "But I wanted to see if the camera really adds 10 pounds." After having a good close look, the verdict was in. "She's so much prettier than she is in the movies," Ms. King said. "If that's possible." 
Nora Ponte of Summit, N.J., wearing a sequined gown, had come in part to see a different idol: Barbara Walters, one of the hosts. "Barbara Walters is an inspiration to all women," said Ms. Ponte, who has two daughters, 12 and 15. "She was the first to do so many things. And now she's older and still enjoying her life and career."
At such events, celebrities are sprinkled among hoi polloi, to spread the wealth, so to speak. And sitting next to fame is even more rewarding than seeing it on a distant dais. Ted Voss, a marketing consultant, was pleased that the guest to his right was the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves. 
Karen Van Essen, who had flown in from Denver, was supposed to have Mr. Alda at her table. The seating plan changed at the last minute, but she still did well. To her right was Richard Belzer, a star of the television show "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit."
"He was very nice," Ms. Van Essen said, "and when he got up, he said that he had to get more popcorn, which I thought was very funny." 
She knew that some people in the room were celebrity-hunting, but she professed herself uncomfortable with such sport. Not so Patrick Rummerfield of O'Fallon, Ill., who bagged a picture of himself with Shauntay Hinton, Miss U.S.A. 
"I'm having the photo blown up and telling all my friends back home what an outrageous time I had," Mr. Rummerfield said.
He kept himself busy asking attractive women to dance, starting at the registration table. Handsome in his black tuxedo, he had a one-of-a-kind opening line based on his hard-fought recovery from the paralysis he sustained in a 1974 car accident: He tells women that he is the world's only fully functioning quadriplegic. 
The celebrity auction that followed the banquet offered guests an additional fix of fame. Prizes included attending a Knicks game with Billy Crystal, for $10,000; lunching with Gwyneth Paltrow and Calvin Klein at Klein's Madison Avenue boutique ($13,500); and a quadruple-header that involved meeting Elton John, visiting the set of "The Sopranos," enjoying a night on the town with a cast member, Joe Pantoliano, and spending a little time with Jason Kidd of the New Jersey Nets after a game with the Knicks ($16,000).
Tansa Mermerci, a Turkish-born jewelry designer who scored her invitation through the Turkish Embassy, came less to see than be seen. Self-promotion fits nicely into these new gatherings, and Ms. Mermerci found the event a good setting to display the jewelry she designs. Some pieces incorporate handmade blue glass beads dotted with black; the beads offer protection against the evil eye, not that she needed any on this festive evening. 
Chie Imai, a Japanese clothing designer, took advantage of the many photographers present to do a little promotion, too. Dressed in a Japanese kimono, she distributed cards announcing the imminent opening on East 59th Street of Chie, her store featuring her fur designs.
As charity benefits extend bigger welcome mats, shtick is a natural, too. Following the real auction, Mr. Williams proceeded to offer his own version, which included World Series tickets to see the Mets (for the optimistic), a two-week vacation anywhere in Saudi Arabia, and $500,000 to see Christopher Reeve raise his hand. Then Mr. Williams segued into a mock press conference, pretending to be Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. "I don't know where, I don't know when, but something very bad is going to happen," he said. "No more questions, please."
NO laughs could completely bridge the gap between the famed and the ordinary, however. When Ms. Edrington met Mr. Williams in person, she said, "he bent over and said, 'What's up,' in this funny voice, and shook my hand. He was just as I imagined he'd be."
But, she continued: "You don't really know what to say. It's not as if you're going to invite a celebrity over to a Sunday barbecue or they're even going to remember you." (Although sometimes they do: Mr. Voss, the guest seated next to Denyce Graves, was the lucky recipient of two pieces of largesse: Ms. Graves gave him house tickets to "Carmen" at the Metropolitan Opera and invited him backstage afterward.)
Ms. Edrington said her only disappointment was that not all the glossy names on the invitation showed up. (Many sent video greetings.) 
"There were a few twinkles here and there, but out of the almost 50 names on the invitation, I expected more stars would be here," she said. "I'd wanted to see Arnold Schwarzenegger, to find out if he's really that big."
Aside from the lightly cooked meat, Ms. Edrington was for the most part pleased with the meal, which was prepared by George McNeill, one of the nation's 55 master chefs. She found the hors d'oeuvres -- shrimp, dim sum, sushi and won tons -- "tasty, trendy and nice to look at." But she was puzzled by the smoked salmon appetizer, which was described on the menu as a combination of rosette and tartar.
"I know I'm just a commoner," she said, "but I saw a lot of other faces saying, 'What is this?' " She also heard forks clanking as they examined it. 
For Ms. Edrington and everyone else, of course, securing money for spinal cord research was the evening's primary purpose. The benefit organizers did well, raising $2 million. "Where else can you raise this kind of money?" said Brian Heir, a physical therapist and native New Yorker.
That sum was raised by guests who had a variety of perspectives. Some had personal connections to the cause. Jeff Leeper, a stock trader from Boulder, Colo., who had learned about the benefit while surfing the Internet, plays polo. He worries about the danger of the sport, especially since Mr. Reeve sustained his injury in an equestrian competition.
Connie Michalik had come from Colorado with her husband, Craig, because she is determined that her son Richard, who was paralyzed in the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School, will someday walk again.
"Christopher Reeve has been so good to us," Ms. Michalik said. "He sent a tape to the hospital and has been a constant source of inspiration." 
Ms. Imai and a friend, Junko Larrabure, have also been inspired by the Reeve Foundation. 
"In Japan, if a handsome and famous actor like Christopher Reeve had been paralyzed, he would be ashamed and seclude himself, and you would never see him again," Ms. Larrabure said. "We are looking for ways to change that and capture the same type of spirituality and inspiration that we feel tonight."
For New Yorkers who want to do good and take advantage of this city's bounty of benefits, the gossip columnist and consummate New Yorker Liz Smith has some advice. 
"You can't go to everything," she said. "The thing to do is pick one organization and become a regular supporter. It's a big town and this is a way to become an important part of one thing. Sure, lots of people go for the wrong reasons, but that's all part of it. The amount of money they raise is the mystical amazing thing about New York." 
Ms. Edrington, who said her heart was in her mouth as her taxi barreled from the airport into Manhattan, had a slightly different take on the mystical amazing thing about New York: 
"I'm surprised that more cars and taxis aren't all banged up with the way you people drive."

HEADLINE: When Options Rise to Top, Guess Who Pays 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
BY proposing last week to make companies deduct the cost of stock options as they would any employee cost, the International Accounting Standards Board may finally be moving the corporate world closer to uniform treatment of this wildly popular and decidedly American form of executive pay. But the debate is not about to stop.
 The board's move, which would make corporate accounting for stock options reflect reality, is already drawing fire from technology company executives and their lobbyists who favor keeping option costs out of corporate profit-and-loss statements. Proponents of the status quo argue that if options must be reported as expenses, companies will no longer dispense them. 
 Some say option grants are the best way to align the interests of executives with those of outside shareholders. Others, like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, contend that if companies stopped dispensing options, rank-and-file workers who receive them would be most hurt.
Now, though, a new and comprehensive academic study soundly disproves both rationales, giving shareholders more reason to reject new pay packages skewed in favor of top managers or not adequately linked to short- and long-term performance.
Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse, professors of human resource management at Rutgers, examined stock option grants and shareholder returns at the 1,500 largest American companies from 1992 to 2001. They found that companies dispensing significantly larger-than-average option grants to their top five executives produced decidedly lower total returns to shareholders over the period than those dispensing far fewer options. 
As for the notion that options are primarily a rank-and-file perquisite -- and that abandoning them would hurt lower-level employees -- the study instead confirmed what many investors have suspected: in recent years, most options have gone to top executives. And that has been true at hundreds of companies, from Campbell Soup and United States Steel to the El Paso Corporation and the Rowan Companies.
Patrick S. McGurn, vice president at Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder advisory service in Rockville, Md., said that the study would fuel a movement among pension fund managers and other institutional investors to start rejecting executive pay packages that pour on the options. 
"I think companies are going to be shocked this season," he said.
Mr. Blasi said his study "strongly suggests that executive excess in stock options did not help total shareholder return over the entire decade.
"The problem," he added, "is not a few bad apples but the entire system of executive compensation which was created by a compromised system of corporate governance."
Carol Bowie, director of governance research services at the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington, says investors have rapidly become wary about stock options. "At the very least, options tended to promote a short-term focus," she said, "and at worst, they promoted fraudulent activity to manipulate earnings."
In their study, the professors looked at how widely companies had distributed options among their employees. Over the 10 years beginning in 1992, the median percentage of options going to the top five executives was 29 percent.
But companies that dispensed significantly more than the median -- like R. R. Donnelley & Sons, which in 1997 handed out 94 percent of all options to its top five executives -- disappointed in two respects. They produced lower overall returns to shareholders than did companies that dispensed less than the median and generally underperformed the overall market as well.
The study is part of the professors' forthcoming book, "In the Company of Owners: The Truth About Stock Options and Why Every Employee Should Have Them," to be published by Basic Books on Jan. 7. They researched and wrote the book with Aaron Bernstein, a senior writer at Business Week.
The professors ranked 1,500 companies according to how much of their options they awarded to their five most senior executives. The 375 that gave the most to their top executives -- more than 40.8 percent of all options -- performed worst, returning 22.5 percent over all to shareholders through 2001. The 375 companies that gave the fewest options to their senior executives -- less than 19 percent -- fared the best, giving investors a 31.3 percent return, on average.
After combing through the data, the professors said they were surprised by the number of companies that chose to hand over their entire annual stock option grant to just five top executives in any given year. According to regulatory filings from 1992 to 2001, an average of 11 companies a year gave all their options to five executives.
Companies that did so in one year during the period studied included Weatherford International, an oil services concern; the Energen Corporation, an energy holding company; and Harvest Natural Resources, an oil driller.
"The assumption that the system is better for everybody by giving most of the pie to the top of the hierarchy is an assumption that is widely accepted by lawyers, accountants, Wall Street investment bankers and even by many academics," Mr. Blasi said. "But when you compare companies against each other, the more you increase the option grant to the top five executives above the mean, the worse your shareholder return gets."
Perhaps in reaction to investor ire about excessive executive compensation during the stock market's fall, no company gave 100 percent of its options to top executives in 2001, and only three gave more than 90 percent. And the median share granted to the top five executives fell to 18.2 percent in 2001, from a high of 28 percent in 1994.
IT is perhaps not surprising that as the stock market climbed throughout the 1990's, more and more companies were giving their top executives larger-than-average option grants. Investors did not seem to mind the transfer of wealth that these option grants represented, maybe because the investors themselves were making money on the stocks.
In 1992, for example, only 375 companies exceeded the average percentage given by companies to their top executives. But that number rose steadily during the decade, to 733 in 1999. The number has since tumbled: last year, 226 companies gave their top executives more than the average grant.
Mr. Kruse, who is also a research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., said his study underscored the need for institutional investors to be vigilant about huge grants.
"While institutional investors are enjoying beating up on executives these days," Mr. Kruse said, "one sad implication of these results is how they actually point the finger at those same institutional investors for leaving corporate governance to the wrong people.
"Anyone who claims there hasn't been a systematic corruption of business as usual using the legal system as a front, compensation consultants as handmaidens and corporate human resources staffs as lackeys doesn't understand what's gone on."

HEADLINE: Talk About Generation Gaps. This One's 38 Million Strong. 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
ONCE every marketer's sweetheart, Generation X is finding itself lost in the shadow of two generational giants. This became clear during a recent speech by Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of the Chrysler Group.
 "The next decade will include the coming of age of the most promising new generation of buyers since the baby boomers," Mr. Zetsche proclaimed to a conference hall full of industry executives, analysts and journalists. 
 On projection screens behind him, a chart appeared with three bars. A tall blue bar on the right side represented the baby boomers -- from 38 to 57 years old and 82 million strong, by Chrysler's calculation. Boomers, Mr. Zetsche's chart said, are motivated by comfort, luxury and safety when they buy a car.
On the chart's left side was a bright orange bar representing millennials, also known as Generation Y, the offspring of the boomers. From 6 to 25 years old, Generation Y numbers about 78 million. They want technological gadgets in their cars and an ability to connect to the Internet on the road, and they are loyal to brands.
In the middle of the chart was a faded gray bar, a short shadow that represented the 38 million members of Generation X, from 26 to 37 years old in Chrysler's analysis. The company hadn't bothered to forecast their tastes at all.
Many businesses define generations by statistical peaks and troughs, though there are different schools of thought on just where one generation starts and another begins. 
A decade ago, youth-obsessed marketers were riveted on Generation X. Television shows and movies explored its trials ("Beverly Hills 90210," "Reality Bites"), while the recording industry poured venture capital into Seattle grunge rock, the signature sound of a generation. The reigning aesthetic, seen in perfumes like cKone and Gap clothes, was unisex and casual. 
But Gen X's time as a marketing darling was short-lived. 
"They go directly from boomers to Y's," said Ann A. Fishman, president of Generational Targeted Marketing, a consulting firm. "The reason is not because of numbers. It's because Generation X is harder to understand."
Neil Howe, a historian who has written on both Gen X and Gen Y (he defines the latter as everyone born since 1982), said Gen X was difficult to target because it never liked being categorized as a troop of goateed slackers in the first place. 
"It's a generation that celebrates its diversity and individuality," he said. "So that's one huge strike against X-er marketing. It's easier to explicitly target millennials than Gen X. They think they have a great future and a special role in the future of this country, because of the way they were raised." 
Boomers, Ms. Fishman said, had a favorable economic and historical ride, and Generation Y is made up of bull-market babies. That makes both groups generally more optimistic and brand loyal, even now. 
X'ers are less so. Yes, they grew up during Ronald Reagan's "morning in America." But they also came of age at a time when corporations downsized, when crack made the drug culture increasingly dangerous, when suddenly sex could kill you. 
As a generation they have trouble trusting network news, the main political parties and many businesses that try to court them, Ms. Fishman says. Some businesses no longer bother.
"Generation X is the first truly tough generation to sell to," said Charlene Stern, a senior vice president at NewGround, a bank services firm with headquarters in Chicago. "They don't give you more than a second to slice through and earn your keep." 
Not every industry is specifically Gen-X-averse. Many companies, like soda makers, are perpetually focused on youth because that's where their consumer base lies. 
For Chrysler, the focus on Gen Y has as much to do with what it sees as an industrywide mishandling of the boomer generation, which turned to foreign brands like Toyota and BMW, as it does with an inability to reach Gen Xers.
"Detroit didn't do a very good job of connecting with the baby boom," said Jeff Bell, marketing chief for Chrysler's Jeep. "When we see this huge group building, Gen Y, we say never again. It's not a slight to Generation X. We do wish to sell products today. But we have to be ready for the next big boom."
Still, said Richard Thau, the president of Third Millennium, a nonpartisan Gen X research organization, giving up on reaching his generation is "like driving around Europe and getting to the border of a country where you don't have a map and turning around because you don't want to find one."
Then again, what does it matter?
"Gen Xers don't drive cars," he added. "We only pedal to work, right?"

HEADLINE: Syrians' Hopes for Freedom Remain Mostly Unfulfilled 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
A lazy fan clicks in the dim neon of his waiting room as Haitham al-Maleh, a lawyer who helped defend the latest crop of political detainees, describes the last time the authorities called him in.
 "They told me in a nice way: 'You are an old man. Better for you to retire,' " he said. Or perhaps, they said, he should relocate to the United States, where he has relatives. "I answered them that my roots are in Damascus," he said. 
 Then came the summons to military court on charges related to his work with the Human Rights Association of Syria, which Mr. Maleh helped establish. Mr. Maleh, who is 71, is charged with belonging to an illegal organization, publishing false news in the association's journal, circulating the publication without permission and causing sectarian divisions.
If convicted in the trial, scheduled for January, Mr. Maleh could be sent to jail, joining 10 other professionals -- including 2 members of Parliament -- who were sentenced earlier this year for advocating wider political freedoms and criticizing the government. 
After President Bashar al-Assad took office two years ago, hope spread that he would create an era of political and economic reforms in what remains a police state. Freewheeling political discussion forums sprang up in the first half of 2001, a moment that came to be known as the Damascus Spring. But hope dampened with the arrests, and now Syria seems to have entered an ambiguous moment. 
The courts followed through with 3- to 10-year sentences for the Syrian 10, as rights groups call them, and now Mr. Maleh and three others are facing charges. Yet there are signs that at least some sense of greater freedoms have taken hold. 
Some Syrians and Westerners living here say that while outright criticism of the government is taboo, people in private groups no longer fear voicing displeasure with the system. A few of the forums have continued. 
On a recent Sunday, several dozen people gathered at a private home in Damascus, according to an account by a Western diplomat. A speaker addressed them, and they discussed the influence of the military on university life, in which students are required to undergo training. The topic was a relatively tame one, and members of Syria's ever-present intelligence forces certainly attended, the diplomat said. Other groups continue to meet as long as they are small, quiet and monitored, rights advocates say. 
In another example, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Damascus University sponsored a symposium two weeks ago on international humanitarian law. One Syrian professor criticized the government for keeping Syria out of the International Criminal Court, according to someone who attended the symposium. During a question-and-answer session, the professor also told students to forgo the anti-Israel diatribes and just ask a question. That would not have happened several years ago, rights advocates say. 
Even the limited opening of the usually closed trial to Syrian and foreign observers was seen as a sign of liberalization. 
The jailings last spring and summer come as Syria seeks an association agreement with the European Union, part of President Assad's strategy to open up the country's markets and improve the economy. Human Rights Watch is calling on the European Union to make the release of the prisoners a condition of an agreement. 
Meanwhile, rumors are circulating about the possibility that some of the men will be released in an amnesty to mark Ramadan, the holy month that began on Wednesday. 
President Assad took other important steps toward opening Syria's tightly controlled society, appointing technocrats to economic positions in government and establishing laws to liberalize the economy. Cellphones and Internet cafes proliferated, but the laws, like allowing private banks, have not been put into effect or are taking hold only slowly. 
President Assad, whose youthful yet stern gaze proliferates in posters and photographs across the city, is even said to have departed from the austere style of his father, Hafez al-Assad, a tough ruler for 30 years until his death in 2000. Stories circulate about the president, who is 37, being seen in restaurants, buying a newspaper, even posing with tourists at historic sites. Even if they are rumors they show that Syrians are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt for good intentions, some Western diplomats say. Indeed, many Syrians say they have a sense that things will be changing some day, if not immediately. 
"He's doing as much as he can in a difficult environment," said a Western aid official with long experience in the region. 
Some suggest that President Assad backed away from political reforms after being caught by surprise by how rapidly they spread, particularly at a time when he was trying to consolidate power.
"The popularity of the forums really took everyone aback," said Virginia Sherry, associate director of the Middle East division for Human Rights Watch. "They really caught on and were multiplying across the country, and obviously that was perceived as too far, too fast by the men in power." 
Others say that crises in the region -- the fallout from Sept. 11, the Palestinian uprising and the Israeli crackdown, and the United States threat to Iraq -- have forced him to put domestic reform on hold. 
Another theory holds that he has been hamstrung by a recalcitrant bureaucracy, a coterie of powerful businessmen and the longtime Baath Party loyalists of his father who surround him. 
"He is not strong enough to put his ideas in practice," Mr. Maleh said. "His father created his staff. Now the picture is the opposite. The staff created him." 
After the charges against him were lodged at the end of July, Mr. Maleh said he left the country for nearly three months but decided to come back to fight the case. "I have to pay the tax for freedom," he said. "I am ready to do it." 
It will not be a new experience. Mr. Maleh said he was first arrested in 1951, at age 20. Above the bulky oriental furniture in his waiting room, framed Koranic verses that he made from tiny beads hang on the walls, the product of the seven years he spent in prison in the 1980's. 
"I have nothing," he said. "I have only this mouth. I can't shut it."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: EDUCATION; 
G.O.P. Foresees Expansion Of Its Themes on Schooling

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Republicans, in control of both houses of Congress after this week's elections, say they do not anticipate major shifts in educational policy, or a review of the signature No Child Left Behind Act adopted last year while Democrats controlled the Senate.
 But they do envision expanding on some of the Republican Party's themes included in the act, particularly an increased emphasis on tracking the success or failure of educational programs through standardized testing. 
 Several major education-related laws covering areas as different as universities and the Head Start preschool program are due for Congressional review next year, and Congressional leaders said this week that they would continue to seek bipartisan consensus on education law.
The "big four," as they are known, the chairmen and ranking Democrats on the Senate and House education committees, have agreed not to reopen the No Child Left Behind Act, even though conservative groups have begun floating the idea informally in the hope of reintroducing school vouchers. 
"It would be foolish to reopen the law," said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the new chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
While Senator Gregg said he did not expect education policy to "radically change," the new balance of power here is likely to mean a shift in priorities. For example, No Child Left Behind already requires states to include the test scores of handicapped students in profiles of a school's success. That insistence on showing results is likely to be reflected when Congress rewrites the special education law early next year. 
The party will also press to extend the accountability approach to college campuses when the Higher Education Act comes up for review next year, said David Schnittger, an aide to Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, who is chairman of the House education committee.
To give the Head Start program a greater role in preparing children to read, Republicans, including President Bush, are likely to propose moving the program from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of Education.
Senator Gregg also said he wants to expand the availability of vouchers for handicapped children, a step Democrats have vowed to fight. Disabled children may attend private schools or programs at taxpayer expense, but only after proving that the services they need are not available at public schools in their district.
Mr. Gregg said he did not consider vouchers for special education students as explosive an issue as those for public school students generally, because a version of "choice," as Republicans refer to vouchers, already exists for handicapped children. The new proposal, first raised by a presidential commission on special education last July, would simply make such vouchers easier to obtain for handicapped students.
"I don't see it as a major break in the process as it already exists, and expansion of it is not a major issue, or should not be seen as a major issue," Senator Gregg said. "I don't think we have to set up a fight over a term which has become a hot button in another area." 
But Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said incorporating vouchers into the special education law would be "very troubling" to Democrats. "It would undermine the bipartisan consensus that we've reached so far," Mr. Manley said."
In recent days, some conservatives have said the No Child Left Behind Act should be reviewed, citing early difficulties in carrying out the law's demands that children attending failing schools be given the option to transfer to better schools in their district.
"I'm sort of hoping they do reopen it," said Chester E. Finn, president of the Fordham Foundation, an education research institute.
Krista Kafer, an education analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said that if Congressional hearings showed that most school districts did not give children in sub-par schools the option to attend better schools, a "correction" could be made to the law that would allow the private sector to step in, thus reviving vouchers. 
But reopening the law could prove politically explosive. 
Already, the Education Department is struggling to reassure states concerned about the vast numbers of schools that are likely to fall short under the new law's formulas for measuring adequate yearly progress. It has stopped referring to these schools as failing schools, and is urging educators and the news media to distinguish between schools that might be lacking in a minor way, and those that have chronic problems. The law, however, makes no such distinction.
In an interview, Education Secretary Rod Paige said he had heard chatter about reopening the law, but knew of no "organized effort" or intention to do so, and would not favor it himself.
"There's been a lot of discussion about the choice that is not included in the bill, but there is an awful lot of choice that is in the bill," Dr. Paige said.
For James Guthrie, an education professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, the larger lesson from this week's election is that education may no longer be as big a priority for President Bush as it once was.
The issues the president highlighted in campaigning for Congressional Republicans mostly involved domestic security, war with Iraq and the economy. Education, Mr. Guthrie predicted, may become little more than a sideshow or bargaining chip in the new political constellation.

PERSON: Nancy Pelosi 

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: Woman in the News; 
Getting Closer to the Top, And Smiling All the Way

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Nancy Pelosi smiles so often, and so blindingly, that she sometimes leaves the impression she has few other emotional expressions. It is an illusion, of course, and one she has used to great effect in becoming the highest-ranking woman in Congressional history.
 She smiled last month when she stood up, alone among the House Democratic leadership, and voted against the resolution authorizing President Bush to use military force in Iraq. She smiled as she bitterly jousted with the House majority leader, Dick Armey, in July, ultimately voting against the Homeland Security Department bill that Mr. Armey and the other Republicans pushed through. 
 She positively beamed on Friday in San Francisco, her hometown, when she announced that she had amassed enough votes to best two male rivals and become the House Democratic leader next week, a summit never before achieved by a woman. Her glee seemed undiminished as she flicked a sharp barb toward Harold E. Ford Jr., a 32-year-old Tennessee congressman who is also seeking the post and who earlier suggested that at 62, Ms. Pelosi represents the past.
"Well, I've been in office eight months," she said, laughing, referring to her service as minority whip. "I guess when you're very young, eight months seems like a long time."
The ability to make merry while reaching for the jugular is an essential characteristic for politicians, and friends say Ms. Pelosi learned it from one of the classic political bosses and characters of an earlier era, Thomas J. D'Alesandro Jr., a congressman, mayor of Baltimore and doler of favors for northeastern Maryland for 40 years.
Known for his straw hats and jokes, Mr. D'Alesandro tempered his New Deal populism with a pragmatic and occasionally ruthless understanding of how to get things done. One of his sons was also a Baltimore mayor in the 1960's, and his daughter changed her name from Nancy D'Alesandro when she married Paul F. Pelosi in 1963, having inherited an enthusiasm for the two-way streets of politics that she never shook off.
"She has always said to me that she learned something important from her father," said Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party, a post Ms. Pelosi held 20 years ago. "No matter how much you disagree with someone, always keep the friendship in your voice. She knows how to be persuasive, and today she showed she could do it better than some of the guys."
Now, if she is chosen to lead her battered party, she will have to keep smiling through two more years of minority status in the House.
Too polite to criticize Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who is stepping down as leader after eight years, she talked Friday about the need to "build on" his record. But she will have to do that construction work from a position considerably to the left of the more centrist Mr. Gephardt. Her critics within the Democratic Party have suggested that she is not mainstream enough to rebuild the party among swing voters, and Republicans publicly lamented her ideology while privately delighting in what they considered an easy target.
"Didn't the Democrats learn anything from the election?" asked Deborah Pryce of Ohio, who as deputy majority whip is the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House. "I think the American people want results, not roadblocks, and Nancy is a roadblock, that's her hallmark. She's a liberal in the true sense of the word."
Ms. Pelosi has disagreed with the Bush administration on its tax cuts, its welfare and health insurance policies and its military goals. But her friends say that the liberal label is too simplistic. She has also joined conservative lawmakers in demanding stronger human rights in China, angering the Communist government there in 1991 by raising a protest banner in Tiananmen Square.
"I have to laugh when people pigeonhole her as a liberal," said Senator Barbara Boxer of California, an old friend who is usually similarly categorized. "What she really is, is a unifier. She is going to find issues, pocketbook issues, health issues, that everyone in the party can rally around. Her goal has always been consensus, not ideology." 
Ms. Pelosi said on Friday that her colleagues did not choose her as their leader because she is an outspoken liberal, but she neglected to mention one of the reasons they did lend their support: her enthusiasm, as expressed in vigorous fund-raising, for their campaigns. She raised more than $7 million during this last election cycle, traveling to more than 30 states to campaign for Democrats and encouraging many freshman candidates over the years. 
Many of those recipients can be expected to repay part of their debt during the leadership vote on Thursday.
She is unquestionably her father's daughter when it comes to her joy in piling up political capital and, as in recent days, spending it to move up the ladder. Two weeks ago, campaign finance watchdogs said she was skirting the election laws by having two political action committees acting independently, and her office was sheepishly forced to shut down one of the PAC's.
For all the criticism about her unabashed leftism, however, she was oddly muted on Friday when it came to outlining bold, non-Republican policy goals -- perhaps an indication of the pragmatism that lies ahead.
Last year she said the Bush administration was taking tax cuts "to a new level of recklessness and irresponsibility," but on Friday she talked more about common ground and respecting the views of others. Economic proposals, she said, should be evaluated by a basic test: "Do they grow the economy?" The test sounded remarkably centrist in tone, and there was no mention of fairness or economic justice.
"Perhaps in his next proposal, there will be something that we can work together on," she said, suddenly sounding more Baltimore than San Francisco in referring to the tax cut plans that President Bush has promised. "I don't think we should outlaw that as a possibility. But I do think that we should have something to say that is positive and not just oppose what the president has to say."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Republicans say they are planning to use their new control of Congress to provide prescription drug benefits to the elderly, while offering tax credits to the uninsured and imposing new limits on damages in medical malpractice cases.
 President Bush, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and Trent Lott, the Senate Republican leader, all said health care legislation would have a high priority in the 108th Congress, which convenes in January. Republican candidates for Congress promised to add drug benefits to Medicare, Mr. Bush made a similar promise two years ago and Democrats have vowed to hold Republicans accountable in the 2004 elections. 
 "There are some issues that I intend to work with the Congress on, and one of them is to get prescription drug benefits to our seniors," Mr. Bush said on Thursday. "That's an important issue. It's an issue that I talked about at every speech."
Republicans said that by taking the initiative on prescription drugs, they could neutralize the Democrats' historic advantage on health care issues and help the president in 2004 in Florida, Pennsylvania and other states with many elderly voters. But the return of federal budget deficits, after four years of surpluses, could sharply limit the generosity of any drug benefits.
John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, said: "The Republicans may not be able to afford everything the public expects, but the option of not acting on prescription drugs would be catastrophic for them. They have clear control of two branches of government. They pledged to act. Now they have to produce."
The House has twice passed Republican bills to offer drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries. The Senate spent more than two weeks on the issue in July and voted on four separate proposals, but all failed.
The biggest source of disagreement is how to balance the roles of government and private industry -- a question that goes to the heart of the two parties' philosophical differences. Democrats favor a larger role for the government, while President Bush and Congressional Republicans would rely heavily on competing private health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers, like Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions, a unit of Merck & Company.
Republicans said the starting point for any measure would be a "tripartisan bill" drafted over the last two years by Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, all Republicans; James E. Jeffords, independent of Vermont; and John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana.
Under the proposal, the government would pay subsidies to private insurers to get them to offer drug coverage with a monthly premium of about $24 and an annual deductible of $250. The standard Medicare insurance policy would cover 50 percent of drug costs up to $3,450 a year; after beneficiaries spent $3,700 of their own money, the government would cover 90 percent of drug costs.
Mr. Grassley, the chief sponsor of the bill, is in line to become chairman of the Finance Committee, and he said he could build a "bipartisan consensus" for the bill in the committee. Mr. Bush and Senate Republican leaders support the measure, which closely resembles the legislation passed by the House.
Republicans said they were considering a plan to include Medicare drug benefits in a bill extending the 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut signed last year by Mr. Bush. If Republicans tried to pass the tax bill by itself, they would provoke a partisan furor. Many Democrats contend that further tax cuts will cripple the government's ability to pay for adequate drug benefits.
Mr. Grassley's proposal would cost $370 billion over 10 years. That is less than half what Democrats want to spend and would cover less than one-fourth of total projected spending on prescription drugs for the elderly, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.
The other items on the Republicans' health agenda are intended to address the rising cost of care and coverage. For two years, Mr. Bush has asked Congress to authorize tax credits for the cost of health insurance bought by people who are not covered by an employer's plan and not eligible for public programs. The president's commitment is reflected in the large amount of money he would devote to this proposal: $89 billion over 10 years.
Many Democrats have balked at tax credits for health insurance. They say the government could cover more people at lower cost by expanding programs like Medicaid, for low-income families. But recently, some have said they are willing to consider tax credits, if the government sets standards for the insurance bought with such assistance.
As a possible model, Republicans cite a provision of the trade bill signed by Mr. Bush in August. The law authorized tax credits equal to 65 percent of the amount paid for health insurance by people who lose their jobs because of increased imports.
Republicans in both houses said they would also push for legislation to cap damage awards in medical malpractice lawsuits. The House passed such a bill in September, 217 to 203, but Senate Democrats have shown no desire to act on it.
President Bush strongly supports the House bill, saying it would slow the rise of malpractice insurance costs for doctors and hospitals. 
The House bill would cap damages for "pain and suffering" at $250,000 and limit punitive damages to $250,000 or twice the amount of economic damages, whichever is greater. Plaintiffs' lawyers oppose the bill, saying it would unfairly limit compensation for the loss of a child or a spouse, or a limb or sight.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE MILITARY; 
WAR PLAN FOR IRAQ CALLS FOR BIG FORCE AND QUICK STRIKES

BYLINE:  This article was reported and written by David E. Sanger, Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush has settled on a war plan for Iraq that would begin with an air campaign shorter than the one for the Persian Gulf war, senior administration officials say. It would feature swift ground actions to seize footholds in the country and strikes to cut off the leadership in Baghdad.
 The plan, approved in recent weeks by Mr. Bush well before the Security Council's unanimous vote on Friday to disarm Iraq, calls for massing 200,000 to 250,000 troops for attack by air, land and sea. The offensive would probably begin with a "rolling start" of substantially fewer forces, Pentagon and military officials say. 
 Mr. Bush, speaking at a news conference on Thursday, did not discuss the secret process for planning a possible war, but he noted that if military action was required to compel Iraq to disarm, the United States and its allies would "move swiftly with force to do the job." He repeated his determination today, saying in his weekly radio address that "Iraq can be certain that the old game of cheat-and-retreat, tolerated at other times, will no longer be tolerated." 
The military plan calls for the quick capture of land within Iraq, which would be used as bases to funnel American forces deeper into the country. That approach is intended to relieve some of the diplomatic pressure created by massing troops and initiating attacks from neighboring nations, including Saudi Arabia.
Under the plan, United States and coalition forces could operate out of such forward bases in northern, western and southern Iraq, building on lessons learned in Afghanistan, where the military seized a similar outpost south of Kandahar.
As the Pentagon puts the finishing touches on a plan of attack, White House and State Department officials are discussing what one senior official called a "seamless transition" from attack to a military occupation of parts of the country. It would include efforts to deliver food to Iraqis and to engage them quickly in planning for economic development and eventual democracy in areas that President Saddam Hussein has terrorized.
Meanwhile, Iraqi scientists and local military officials would be encouraged to reveal the location of hidden stores of weapons of mass destruction, a process Mr. Bush publicly encouraged from the Rose Garden on Friday when he told Iraqis that "by helping the process of disarmament, they help their country."
One senior official, drawing on comparisons with the American occupation of Japan in 1945, said, "Our message will be that the faster we find the weapons and arrest Saddam's guys, the faster they get some normalcy."
Mr. Bush, after several war-planning meetings with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander of American forces in the gulf, has decided that military action in Iraq would be carried out with the large troop levels that General Franks has consistently advocated. Even so, Mr. Bush can still maintain the formal position that no decision has been reached because he has not yet ordered the nation to war.
Even as the United Nations weapons inspectors prepare to fly to Iraq, the American military is moving into a new phase of positioning logistical forces that military officials say are significant indicators of a movement toward war.
The Army is loading tugboats, forklifts and other cargo-handling equipment onto the Tern, a giant cargo ship in Hampton Roads, Va., that is bound for the gulf to prepare ports for the arrival of tanks and other armored equipment.
But the orders to send those heavy ground forces have not been given. "We have a lot of things teed up to go if the big guys decide to send it," said one senior Defense Department official. "But no green lights yet."
Pentagon officials had been awaiting language from the Security Council because the timetable for the inspection process will shape the schedule of troop deployments and, ultimately, the start of any offensive that Mr. Bush may order.
Heavy equipment recently deployed to the gulf region will remain while inspections get underway, officials said. But troops and ships sent for exercises or regular duty might rotate with fresh forces if it appeared that the inspections were moving ahead without obstruction. 
The plan still has some moving parts, senior administration officials said, but it calls for 200,000 to 250,000 troops -- several Army and Marine divisions, aircraft carriers and Air Force wings. The only ally expected to contribute significant ground forces is Britain, with several thousand troops expected to participate.
"There were options within the plan, but there has only been one plan," one military officer said. "They have settled on the bulk of it." But the officer said the war plan maintains flexibility over the final deployment of troops in order to cope with a range of Iraqi responses.
The entire troop total may not necessarily be in the region when the offensive begins. The bulk of the force would probably stand ready in case of battlefield setbacks and be poised to occupy parts of Iraq as soon as resistance ends.
Under the plan, the air campaign would be less than the 43 days of the first gulf war, and probably under a month, military officials said. 
In the opening hours of the air campaign, Navy and Air Force jets, including B-2 bombers carrying 16 one-ton satellite-guided bombs and B-1 bombers carrying 24 of the same weapons, would attack a range of targets from military headquarters to air defenses. Only 9 percent of the weapons dropped in the gulf war were precision-guided; this time, the figure would be well in excess of 60 percent, allowing more effective bombing with fewer total aircraft, officials say.
The campaign would quickly seek to cut off the country's leadership in Baghdad and a few other important command centers in hopes of causing a rapid collapse of the government, officials said.
As in Afghanistan, Special Operations forces would infiltrate Iraq early in the campaign to designate targets, to destroy sites holding weapons of mass destruction, and to seize other objectives to prevent Mr. Hussein from slowing the American assault by flooding the marshes in southern Iraq or igniting the country's vast oil fields, officials said.
Because the United States wants to help transform Iraq quickly into a liberated nation, the air campaign would be carried out to avoid the major destruction of the gulf war. The campaign would try to avoid destroying important city services and alienating the civilian population, and would also encourage Iraqi troops to defect. The targets of a bombing campaign would be the specific pillars of power holding up Iraq's government, like leadership headquarters and Mr. Hussein's sprawling presidential compounds.
"While we would not want to kill many Iraqi soldiers, if they stupidly fight, we will," a senior military official said.
Pentagon officials say the war plan does not envision a clean break between the end of an air campaign and the opening of a ground offensive, as in the first gulf war. Instead, ground operations would be more likely to be woven into the opening stages of the air war, with the aerial bombardment continuing "as long as we find targets," one official said.
The "inside-out" approach of attacking centers of power first aims to capitalize on the American military's ability to strike at long distances and to maneuver forces rapidly to neutralize a large target. One important aim would be to disrupt Mr. Hussein's ability to order the use of weapons of mass destruction. Another would be to wrest control of Baghdad from Iraqi forces without getting bogged down in block-by-block urban warfare.
But Mr. Hussein has proven to be a vicious adversary, and senior administration officials have mounted a campaign to warn Iraq's military commanders that they will be charged with war crimes if they unleash weapons of mass destruction. This week, Mr. Bush hinted at another concern, that the Iraqi government would purposefully sacrifice its population to stain an American military victory with civilian blood.
"The generals in Iraq must understand clearly there will be consequences for their behavior," Mr. Bush said on Thursday. "Should they choose, if force is necessary, to behave in a way that endangers the lives of their own citizens, as well as citizens in the neighborhood, there will be a consequence. They will be held to account."
Mr. Bush did not say so specifically, but veteran analysts of the Iraqi government say Mr. Hussein is preparing thousands of civilian volunteers to fill "martyrs' brigades" and offer up their lives to bombs and advancing troops, even though it is unclear how many would follow through.
Some of those volunteers would hope to slow the American-led offensive by acting as suicide bombers or fighting in neighborhood defense squads, but their true strategic goal would be to generate anti-American feelings in the region.
"There is no consideration about them triumphing over an enemy, but a second definition of victory," said Yossef Bodansky, author of "The High Cost of Peace: How Washington's Middle East Policy Left America Vulnerable to Terrorism." "What Saddam is saying to himself is, 'I'll give them real civilian bodies, real civilian blood on Al Jazeera or CNN.' "
The move to war has already raised concerns of terrorist reprisals in the United States, and senior Pentagon officials say they anticipate a mobilization of the National Guard and Reserves equal to or larger than the 265,000 called to active duty in the first gulf war.
Most of these reserve forces would be assigned to guard sites like military installations, civilian power plants and airports, although some would be assigned to guard bases overseas and certain specialties would be required for the Iraqi offensive. Several units have been notified that they may be summoned to duty as early as January.
In another sign of the total force that may be involved in offensive action and post-war occupation of Iraq, Mr. Rumsfeld has presented the White House with a plan to inoculate as many as 500,000 service members against smallpox. Mr. Bush has not yet decided on the vaccinations, which could have serious, even fatal, side effects for a small percentage of those receiving the vaccine.
The timetable for a war is closely tied to the requirements laid out in the Security Council's resolution and to Mr. Hussein's compliance. The last deadline is Feb. 21, when inspectors are to report their findings to the Security Council. Military planners say the longer nights and moderate weather then are optimal for war.
"The task the international community now faces is to determine what choice Saddam Hussein will make," Mr. Rumsfeld said on Friday, whether he will truly disarm or evade the inspectors.

HEADLINE: Yawning Through the Changing of the Guard 

BYLINE:  By Jianying Zha; Jianying Zha, author of "China Pop: How Soap Operas, Tabloids and Best Sellers Are Transforming a Culture," is a fellow in Asian studies at Rice University.

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 

 BODY:
In a few days, at the closing of the 16th Communist Party Congress, China's new leaders will be announced. But when I recently asked an old high school buddy in Beijing about the coming changes, she sounded incredulous. "The party congress? It doesn't concern us. We're too busy!" 
 Busy? 
 She's been looking for a job since she got laid off last year by the failing state plant where she had worked since 1980; her daughter will face the tough college entrance exam next year, so she's got to take her to tutoring classes; her husband also needs her help because he quit his job as a taxi driver to become a day trader. Not one of her friends, she assured me, is talking about the congress either. 
And it's not just the working class. I was in Beijing from May to August, the period when a succession battle was being fought, supposedly, at the party's beach summit at Beidaihe, and yet of all the Chinese I talked with -- entrepreneurs, clerks, artists, retired party cadres, intellectuals -- no one ever mentioned a word about it. 
That's right: not even the intellectuals. (The professors I know were all preoccupied with putting out academic papers and getting promoted and buying apartments.) The only exception was a friend employed by the official television network. Media control is typically tighter before a big party conference, which he spoke of in the resigned manner of someone complaining about a recurring toothache.
But after all, this is an important conference. A transfer of power is taking place: if all goes well in the next few days, the men who have governed China since the 1989 Tiananmen events, headed by Jiang Zemin, will make way for a new group known as the Fourth Generation. Led by Hu Jintao, 59, whose status as Mr. Jiang's successor was approved by the late Deng Xiaoping, these new leaders, mostly technocrats in their late 50's and 60's, will exercise great power in China in the next five to 10 years. So why the public indifference?
The obvious interpretation is that totalitarianism breeds political apathy. Why care about things you have no say over? That's certainly there, but it's only part of the reason. Chinese used to care a great deal when the big politics were out of their hands. I remember the intense, edgy atmosphere on the street when Mao died in 1976, and the long period of quiet but nervous anticipation before Deng's passing in 1997. 
None of this is evident in the current changing of the guard. Political discussion, when it occasionally occurs in private, often has the light-hearted, irreverent tone of a sitcom. I've heard more sardonic remarks about Mr. Jiang's showy style than I have serious comments on his policies (many didn't think he had any). As for Mr. Hu, the most interesting question about him appears to be whether he really is as uninteresting as he seems: under this utterly bland, meek image, is he shrewdly lying low to surprise us later? 
Lately the government media's clamorous praise for Mr. Jiang's achievements has generated many private jokes in China. (Don't eulogies usually come after a person's death?) But that's about as energetic as things have been. The general attitude toward China's leaders seems to echo Deng's famous motto about cats: Black cat, white cat, whichever catches the mouse is a good cat. So, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, whoever brings in more goods will be alright. People are expecting managers and controllers, not visionaries and poets. And it looks like that's exactly what they are getting. Half the men on the Standing Committee of the Politburo trained as engineers.
Gone is the age of one strongman's rule, but the vision of Deng Xiaoping, China's last strongman, continues to shape the country's direction. Thirteen years after Tiananmen and 10 years after Deng's "southern tour" set the stage for speeding up market reform, the Chinese economy has been booming while Chinese passion for revolution seems all but dissipated. Call it market socialism or authoritarian capitalism, but whatever the name the pace and scale of economic, social transformation has been mind-boggling. 
Yet the mode of party politics has remained frozen: secrecy, propaganda, crackdowns on dissent. What has changed is society, and people's attitude toward politics: they treat secrecy with indifference, propaganda with mockery, crackdowns with resignation. Swept up in the great tide of commercial activities and a lively pop culture, politics has become the dark zone you avoid so that you can lead your real life. Given pressing demands and more attractive options, wouldn't you just as soon forget about those gray suits haggling over their seats in the Politburo? 
And then, there is a general assumption that no politician can turn back the clock. Having entered the World Trade Organization and won the right to host the 2008 Olympics, the country has traveled so far on the course of modernization that whoever is on top will have to be committed to economic growth and further integration into the global community. 
Despite the occasional flare of anger toward America, most Chinese continue to admire the United States and expect the government to maintain good relations between the countries. Most of all, however, they want the government to tackle the increasingly worrisome domestic issues that have been brought on by change: corruption, rising crime, growing inequality, environmental degradation. 
Few, however, expect dramatic political reform. The verdict on Tiananmen will change, certainly, but it will take time. No one will, or can, make the country regress to Maoist politics, but multiparty elections aren't around the corner either. Mr. Hu may push for reform, but I haven't talked to anyone who expects him to turn into China's version of Mikhail Gorbachev. The country will move ahead, but probably incrementally and with many zigzags. 
This sense of realism explains, in part, the general absence of enthusiasm about the current party congress. "Hu should be better than Jiang," a friend in Beijing said grudgingly after I pressed him repeatedly for a political opinion. But that was about all he had to say. Then he started to talk about movies.

Friend or foe? Photonic crystals in uniforms might soon help soldiers at war determine that.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
THESE may be lean economic times, but there is brisk demand for scientists who work on military projects. 
 One project is the $50 million contract the Defense Department gave earlier this year to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The goal is to build a sort of exoskeleton that among other things is supposed to give soldiers superhuman strength, protect them from biological and chemical weapons, and even help heal their injuries. 
 One of the researchers on the case is Yoel Fink, an assistant professor at M.I.T. Using, in part, technology he created, Mr. Fink and his team aim to embroider the supersoldier fighting uniform with polymer threads that -- by selectively reflecting or absorbing different wavelengths of light -- would silently flash an optical bar code. That way, for example, troops wearing specially tuned night-vision goggles would be able to distinguish between foe and friend during a night firefight. 
The supersoldier project, officially known as the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, has special meaning for Mr. Fink, who grew up in Israel and served in the army there. 
"I spent three years of my life in the infantry," said Mr. Fink, who is now 36 years old. "It absolutely hits close to home because I know how vulnerable infantry soldiers are." 
If two recently issued patents are any indication, though, Mr. Fink's ambitions extend beyond the battlefield. 
Last month, Mr. Fink and several colleagues were granted United States Patent 6,463,200 for a fiber that steers light beams efficiently over long distances. The technology is being developed by OmniGuide, a start-up in Cambridge, Mass., that Mr. Fink co-founded and that recently secured $10 million in a second round of financing. 
In August Mr. Fink received a more fundamental patent, Number 6,433,931, which broadly covers the use of certain polymers as photonic crystals -- an innovation that Mr. Fink hopes will one day revolutionize optics the way the semiconductor revolutionized electronics. 
As a tenure-track researcher at M.I.T. whose ideas are the foundation of a start-up company, Mr. Fink now seems a rising star. But when he first arrived at M.I.T. as a graduate student in 1995, he spent nearly a year and a half casting about for a project and a thesis adviser. 
John D. Joannopoulos, a solid-state physicist at M.I.T. and expert on photonic crystals, did not take Mr. Fink into his laboratory. "He basically told me, 'Look, I don't have any positions available,' " Mr. Fink said. 
So when Mr. Fink came up with what he considered a revolutionary idea for building photonic crystals, he instead approached Edwin Thomas, a respected materials scientist at M.I.T. "I went to see him and said, 'I want to talk,' " Mr. Fink recalled. Mr. Thomas said he could not talk because he was on his way to Greece.
Undaunted, Mr. Fink gave Mr. Thomas a copy of Professor Joannopoulos's book, to which Mr. Fink had stuck a yellow sticky note pithily outlining his idea. When he returned Mr. Thomas called Mr. Fink, eager to start working on the idea. Within a few weeks Mr. Fink had financing from the Air Force to pursue it. 
For three months, Mr. Fink, Mr. Thomas and Tim Oyer, an M.I.T. patent lawyer, feverishly laid out a road map for developing the crystal. "We wanted to do with photons what people have been doing for years with electrons -- to manipulate the flow of light in materials," he said. 
Photons are the smallest known units of light, with both particle and wave properties. Photonic crystals allow for the manipulation of light. 
Mr. Fink was by no means the only researcher trying to produce photonic crystals. "What struck me was that there wasn't a very good way to build these crystals," he said. "People were trying to build these structures by modifying semiconductor techniques." 
While other researchers were trying to create photonic crystals by etching into silicon, Mr. Fink proposed a radically different idea: making a photonic crystal out of plastic. 
The plastic he wanted to use was something called a block co-polymer, essentially a plastic made from two different types of polymers. Imagine one polymer as a string of pearls and the other polymer as a string of rubies, both of them loosely strung. Now imagine that when they are dropped into a jar and shaken, they self-entwine and pack themselves into a structure that repeats itself in a specific pattern -- say, two rubies, four pearls, two rubies, four pearls and so on. "This a structure that forms itself," Mr. Fink said. "It doesn't require complicated processing."
In part it is this pattern, as well as the differing reflective qualities of the "rubies" and the "pearls," that gives this crystal such potential, Mr. Fink said. 
Off the battlefield, how might life be different in the future if photonic crystals came to pass? Fashion mavens might leave the house in a turquoise outfit in the morning and retune the same outfit to tangerine when they went out to dinner. Optical communications systems might someday be woven into our clothing, making cellphones and hand-held devices seem like quaint artifacts of the early 21st century. And the innards of computers might rely as much on optics as on electronics. 
Professor Fink has since won over Professor Joannopoulos, who ultimately became his thesis adviser and whom he now considers a mentor. But he acknowledged that though it had been proved experimentally, his self-assembling plastic photonic crystal project was still a long way from reality.
"It's a very beautiful idea," Mr. Fink said. "What's keeping us from flying with it right now is that we need a clever chemist -- which I am not -- to synthesize the polymer." 
Mr. Fink says the first application to come out of his research is likely to be a light-transmitting fiber for a highly secure military communications network for the military. The main patron for his research, after all, is the Defense Department.

HEADLINE: Report Says Artists' Arrival Can Push Out Neighbors 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
New York City's vibrant arts scene is often portrayed as an unalloyed good, economically as well as creatively. But the resistence in many neighborhoods to a large increase in artists looking for places to live is so strong that it is the biggest obstacle to the healthy development of the arts in the city, a study to be released today by a nonpartisan policy research group said.
 The study by the New York-based Center for an Urban Future, a neighborhood-by-neighborhood assessment that looked at the potential of arts and culture to stimulate economic growth, concluded that much of the neighborhood concern was justified because artists' moving into a neighborhood can drive up rents and force out long-term residential and commercial tenants. The paradox is that arts groups drive up the rents and then cannot afford to remain in the neighborhoods whose rejuvenation they spurred in the first place. 
 "Everyone is fearful of the demon of SoHo-ization," said Neil Scott Kleiman, director of the center, which focuses on economic development. 
"You have this Darwinian progression: artists move into a neighborhood, prices tend to go up, and the artists have to move out," he said. "You're seeing it cloud cultural development."
The city's cultural affairs commissioner, Kate D. Levin, disputed the study's main finding about resistance to arts groups. "That may be true in some cases," she said, "but most of the time arts groups are not interlopers, they're essential parts of how neighborhoods grow and define themselves."
"In almost every case I can think of, communities welcome artists because of what they bring to the mix in terms of 24-hour liveliness and the business they bring," she added. "Artists and arts groups are themselves the first victims of gentrification."
The study, which took two years to complete and was commissioned by Deutsche Bank, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Arts and the Rockefeller Foundation, asserted that the city had yet to understand fully the economic value of its cultural industry, which is responsible for more than 150,000 jobs, stimulated by a 52 percent growth rate over the past nine years. 
"While everyone agrees that arts and culture is a pillar of our economy (in fact, no other single industry has stimulated as much economic improvement throughout the five boroughs), the vast majority of us haven't the slightest clue how to define the sector," the report said. "Culture is not just Broadway and Museum Mile, in other words, but thousands of commercial artists, galleries, botanic gardens and zoos citywide." 
It is largely because of the disparate nature of culture in New York, the study said, that city government has failed to address it. "The arts are a scattered, tribal and complex industry, with roots widely dispersed throughout the five boroughs," it said, "and therefore, don't lend themselves easily to a grand 'master plan' from City Hall." 
Mr. Kleiman said the resistance was evident, for example, in Harlem and in in St. George, Staten Island, where an influx of artists -- along with young professionals looking for a less expensive alternative to Manhattan and Brooklyn -- have increased real estate prices. 
"In five of the seven neighborhoods we assessed, concerns about displacement were plainly laid at the feet of cultural development," the report said. 
The seven neighborhoods the study focused on were St. George; Jamaica and Long Island City, Queens; Lower Manhattan; Fort Greene, Brooklyn; Harlem; and the South Bronx. Because of their retail strengths, the report said, Lower Manhattan and Jamaica did not experience the problems that the other neighborhoods did.
"Addressing displacement is the biggest challenge for any community, and very few, if any, have come up with a good response to this crippling issue," the report said. "Any cultural development that drives away longtime residents and artists might benefit property owners in the short term but cannot be considered successful for the community and in the long-term interests of local business."
In a separate analysis conducted for the New York Foundation for the Arts last November, the Center for an Urban Future found that commercial rents in Chelsea, where many galleries have opened, increased by 262 percent from 1996 to 2000. By comparison, Midtown West rents increased by 121 percent during the same period. Rents exempt from controls in emerging arts neighborhoods like Long Island City and Williamsburg increased by more than 100 percent each in a single year, between 2000 and 2001, according to the analysis.
Several groups have attempted to reduce the displacement, the study says, but the city has no strategy for addressing arts groups' space needs, and none of the effective programs that do exist have been developed citywide. 
As examples of places that provide affordable space for arts organizations, the report cited, among others, the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center, which has incorporated artists' studios into its new building on Greenpoint Avenue in North Brooklyn, and the Lower East Side Business Improvement District, which helped start Forward, a boutique on Orchard Street that features the work of four emerging fashion designers and provides marketing and technical assistance.
While the city's 150 economic and community development organizations recognize culture as a financial engine for the city, the report said, few have actively encouraged it as a mainstay of their neighborhoods. 
"This work must move beyond 'feel-good' projects like murals painted by local teens, which might provide an aesthetic or emotional lift to a community but are not nearly comprehensive enough to sustain permanent development," the report said. 
Among the organizations that the report singled out for having encouraged arts development effectively were the Point in the South Bronx, a community development corporation that has created a cultural complex housing dance troupes, graffiti artists and other visual and performing artists in an abandoned factory, and Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, which over the last 30 years has connected cultural organizations with local merchants to promote southeastern Queens.
The study also found that few fund-raising efforts for arts in New York focus on cultural development at the neighborhood level. "As the rest of the nation implements major cultural development strategies to attract tourism dollars and business investments alike, New York has remained buried in the sand; our city has not implemented a similar strategy in over 35 years."

Perfect Storm, Seen Heading For the Budget

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
SOMETIME in the late summer, Abe Lackman began to see that the economy was not cooperating. It should have been rebounding by then, the budget experts had said. It wasn't.
 Mr. Lackman, then the influential secretary of the State Senate Finance Committee, did some calculating and conjured up a fearsome analogy. The Perfect Storm. New York's fiscal future was looking to him like a fiscal version of the book (and movie) about three storm systems all converging at once off the coast of New England in 1991, creating a meteorological nightmare. 
 "The metaphor to the perfect storm is, this incredible strong storm comes out of nowhere, and it comes with an enormous buildup of speed, and it's going to hit state government, New York City, county governments and mass transit, all at once," Mr. Lackman, 54, said in an interview on Friday. "And it's going to hit with a ferocity that has not been witnessed for almost 60 years."
Strong language, especially from Abraham D. Lackman. He is a 24-year veteran of government, never known as a Chicken Little. In fact, to the public, he's not known much at all. The ultimate inside man, a Republican respected by both sides of the aisle, he said he didn't feel it was appropriate to speak publicly when he was a Senate staff member. But a government alumnus since Halloween, he has begun to find his voice.
"I feel pretty strongly on this issue," he said. "I want to alert people to how tough a year it is going to be. If there is one piece of news I am trying to convey, it is that next year is not going to be a normal time. You have to go back 50, 60 years to see a period like this."
It will, he fears, be worse than the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, because that was a crisis in confidence and accounting, not in sharply dropping revenues, and was city-based. The state was healthy. Today, the state, too, is in trouble, relatively in worse shape than the city.
Not that New Yorkers would know much of this if they watched this season's leading candidates for governor, so practiced were they in the budgetary arts of ducking and weaving -- especially on the subject of potential tax increases.
"No comment," Mr. Lackman, the new president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, said of the campaign.
BACK to numbers. Mr. Lackman's analysis shows that for the first time since the early 1940's, at the tail end of the Depression, state revenues are declining two years running. Gov. George E. Pataki's budget advisers see the same trend.
What happened? Mr. Lackman cites a number of reasons, from the impact of Sept. 11 and the national recession to the stock market's decline. He contends, too, that the scandals at Enron and Arthur Andersen hurt the state badly by generating such deep skepticism among investors that mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings declined precipitously -- reducing state income from capital gains taxes.
Also, many wealthy investors are putting their money in real estate instead of the stock market, and that has eaten into state tax collections because the average length of a real estate holding is eight years, compared with eight months for a stock transaction.
The end result, Mr. Lackman predicted, is a budget revenue shortfall of $8 billion to $10 billion next year. The state-financed budget is about $60 billion, but half cannot be cut because it goes to pay for mandates, debt service or binding contracts.
That leaves Mr. Pataki, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, a menu of options, from increasing taxes, fees and state university tuition, to making deep spending cuts. The Albany triumvirate spent most of the state's reserve funds in this year's budget, so they aren't an option. The state could consider selling some of its assets, or leveraging its piece of the tobacco settlement -- several hundred millions of dollars -- through bond sales, as New York City and other states have done.
Why didn't Mr. Pataki and the two leaders see this coming and address the problem earlier, instead of passing a generous budget? "If you look back at the consensus of economists, they were saying we'd have a V-shaped recovery," Mr. Lackman said. "It is very hard to argue against consensus forecasts, especially in an election year." 
It is not too late, he advised. If New Yorkers start paying attention soon, they can try to pick their priorities, influence the elected officials and -- to end on a metaphorical note -- avoid a shipwreck.

HEADLINE: A Missile Shield Appeals to a Worried Japan 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Alarm over North Korea's missile and nuclear weapon programs is pushing Japan toward joining the United States in trying to develop a missile defense program, officials and analysts here say.
 "We should exert efforts to get the program to leave the research phase as soon as possible," Japan's Defense Agency chief, Shigeru Ishiba, told a Parliament committee last week, urging faster work with the United States on a program that uses missiles to intercept other missiles. 
 With parts of Japan only 350 miles away from North Korean territory, many Japanese have recently felt a surge in insecurity. First, North Korea admitted to a visiting American diplomat that it maintains a secret nuclear bomb program. Then, last Tuesday, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman reacted to a breakdown in talks with Japan by saying that North Korea was "reconsidering" the moratorium on missile tests that it adopted after it test-fired a rocket over Japan in 1998. 
"The impact of the news from North Korea has been strong," Masashi Nishihara, president of the National Defense Academy, Japan's interservice military college, said on Friday. "North Korea has reversed its positions. That justifies us to move forward to develop missile defense, and to eventually deploy it."
In a poll conducted a week ago for the liberal daily Asahi Shimbun, 95 percent of 2,068 Japanese respondents surveyed said they were "concerned" about North Korea's nuclear program.
On Friday, Yomiuri Shimbun, a conservative daily, ran a headline that said, "U.S. to Press Japan to Build Missile Shield." But in a briefing for the news media, the reported instrument of pressure, Douglas J. Feith, the under secretary of defense for policy, said there was no need for a heavy sales job.
"You don't have to pressure Japan for Japanese to realize that Japan is facing a serious threat of missile attack," he said, referring to North Korean capabilities. "There are missile arcs that one could draw that clearly cover Japan. That's what makes the missile threat very serious."
The Pentagon says North Korea has about 100 Rodong missiles with a range of about 1,000 miles that are capable of hitting all major Japanese cities. Chinese officials estimated last month that North Korea had at the most five nuclear weapons.
Asahi Shimbun said the United States was moving missile surveillance units to Japan. On Oct. 21, an RC-135S Cobra Ball reconnaissance aircraft equipped for tracking ballistic missiles arrived in Okinawa from the United States, it said. Ten days later, the Invincible, a ship equipped with advanced radar to monitor midrange missiles, visited Okinawa for the first time, it added.
American officials declined to address the reports, saying they do not comment on military operations.
Japan is already conducting research on antimissile technology, which the United States hopes to deploy in 2008. But, wary of provoking China, the long-established nuclear power of Northeast Asia, Japan had planned to delay until 2004 any decision on taking part in field trials. Mr. Ishiba, who took over as Japan's defense minister last month, has pushed for a commitment, though Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has remained noncommittal.
Within Mr. Koizumi's coalition government, a pacifist party, New Komeito, played a central role two weeks ago in winning elections for governing party candidates. New Komeito is reportedly preventing Mr. Koizumi from sending warships to the Arabian Sea to support American military operations.
"Our premise is that North Korea will sincerely implement agreements in the Pyongyang declaration and we want the North to sincerely maintain the declaration," Mr. Koizumi said on Tuesday, referring to the statement that he and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, signed on Sept. 17 in North Korea's capital. The declaration upholds the Korean peninsula as free of nuclear weapons.
Japan now demands that North Korea dismantle its nuclear bomb program before receiving Japanese aid. Japanese officials met recently with Pakistani officials, hoping to learn details of North Korea's technology. Last month The New York Times reported that Pakistan supplied North Korea with nuclear bomb-making equipment. Pakistan has denied the report.
"The final aim of North Korea is to obtain economic aid -- the key thing is money," Shunji Taoka, a defense affairs writer for Asahi Shimbun, said on Friday. Referring to the billions of dollars in aid that Japan has offered North Korea, he added, "Japan's Foreign Ministry has a rare chance to be a major player."
But if forced into a corner, North Korea might resort to a familiar negotiating tactic: provoking a crisis. It might test a new rocket engine, test-fire a new generation rocket or expel International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, Scott Snyder, Korea representative for The Asia Foundation, a United States government-supported group, said. "They will try to use a crisis to escalate things, and they can do it," he said.
A cartoon published here last week showed Kim Jong Il as a panhandler, holding a sign that read, "Will not bomb for food."
Several high-level American officials have been visiting Japan. Last Thursday, it was Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for Pacific and East Asian affairs, met here on Saturday with his Foreign Ministry counterparts from Japan and South Korea. The Kyodo news agency reported today that Mr. Kelly predicted to Japanese officials that next year Congress would stop financing for oil shipments to North Korea.
"Will Japan go nuclear?" Hau Boon Lai, a columnist for The Straits Times of Singapore, asked, echoing regional concerns that Japan is considering building nuclear bombs.
But aversion to nuclear arms runs deep here. Mr. Nishihara of the defense academy said, "I have not seen any arguments that Japan should go nuclear."

PERSON: Selden Rodman 

HEADLINE: Selden Rodman, Writer and Folk Art Advocate, Dies at 93 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Selden Rodman, a polymathic poet, an iconoclastic critic of modern culture, the author of more than 40 books and a tireless promoter of Haitian and other folk art, died on Nov. 2 at a hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 93.
 Mr. Rodman, who lived in Oakland, N.J., played tennis two days before he died, probably cheating as usual, his wife, Carole, said. In 1932, he and a tennis partner defeated Ezra Pound -- one of the many literary giants Mr. Rodman knew in a unique intellectual life. 
 Mr. Rodman encountered, sought out and communed with some of the best known creative people of the 20th century. Born into a monied family in New York, he grew into a rebellious young man and ended up as a famous champion of the Western Hemisphere's folk arts, particularly Haitian paintings, which he called a "crystallization of joy." Intermediate stops included editing one of the most successful anthologies of modern poetry, writing essays and books on travel, and rocking the modern art establishment by branding Abstract Expressionism "the cerebral put-ons of the avant-garde."
Mr. Rodman first received wide attention in the early 1930's when he and a Yale classmate founded The Harkness Hoot, an acidic but celebrated detractor of everything from professors to the school's gothic architecture. Frank Lloyd Wright wrote to applaud when the publication printed pictures of the steel girders underlying the university's new library along with a picture of the finished product. The Hoot called the girders better architecture, much to Wright's delight.
Rushing off to Europe without attending his graduation, Mr. Rodman looked up Pound, as well as James Joyce and Thomas Mann, and ingratiated himself, a lifelong talent. He would later write a book of essays describing his encounters with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Bertrand Russell and Leon Trotsky.
"He could weasel his way in anywhere," said Gary Fountain, an English professor at Ithaca College who is writing Mr. Rodman's biography.
When he returned to New York, Alfred Bingham, a leader of left-wing causes, asked him to become his partner in a new magazine called Common Sense, which criticized the New Deal while remaining anti-Communist. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., in "The Politics of Upheaval," called the magazine the most lively and interesting forum of radical discussion in the country.
Cary Selden Rodman was born in Manhattan on Feb. 19, 1909. His father, an architect, died before the boy was a year old, and he came to regard his mother as overprotective, Mr. Fountain said. But his mother's family fortune, which provided him a trust fund, greatly increased his lifelong freedom of choice.
His sister, Nancy, married Dwight Macdonald, the writer, who used her trust fund to help finance the startup of Partisan Review in the 1930's.
After his return from Europe, Mr. Rodman was introduced to Mr. Bingham, who was looking for a partner for his new magazine. Mr. Bingham wrote on politics and economics; Mr. Rodman handled cultural matters. He also persuaded W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, Theodore Dreiser and Edmund Wilson to contribute articles. The youthful nature of his and Mr. Bingham's radicalism was suggested by an article in The New York Times in 1934 telling of their trying to get diners at the Waldorf-Astoria to leave in support of striking waiters. As they scuffled with house detectives, "Robert Benchley and Dorothy Parker lent strong moral support at a nearby table," The Times said.
Mr. Rodman published his first poetry book, "Mortal Triumph and Other Poems," in 1932. He and Mr. Bingham published "Challenge to the New Deal" in 1935, and in 1938 he published his "New Anthology of Modern Poetry."
The anthology drew immediate attention for including selections not usually considered poetry, including African-American folk songs, light verse, choruses from the experimental theater and Bartolomeo Vanzetti's last plea to the court.
In 1938 Mr. Rodman visited Haiti for the first time and wrote a play about the Haitians' successful slave revolt against the French in 1803. Nelson Rockefeller, as the State Department official responsible for Latin America, delayed his induction into the Army so he could attend the premiere in Port-au-Prince in 1942. Mr. Rockefeller believed the play would foster pro-American feelings.
From 1943 to 1945 Mr. Rodman served in the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime spy agency.
Mr. Rodman's interest in art deepened after the war, and in 1947 he wrote "Horace Pippin, a Negro Painter in America," the first monograph on the artist. He also became co-director of Le Centre d'Art in Port-au-Prince. It was the main exhibition center of the naive, voodoo-inspired art at the time its popularity was blossoming.
Mr. Rodman wrote many travel books as he prowled the Western Hemisphere in search of folk art. In "Mexican Journal," published in 1958, he demonstrated a favorite technique: asking leading personalities remarkably direct questions. For example, he asked the painter Tamayo what he thought of the painter Siqueiros, and vice versa.
Mr. Rodman was married to Eunice Clark, Hilda Clausen and Maia Wojciechowska, the author and onetime matador, all dead. His wife of 40 years, the former Carole Cleaver, who is also a writer, survives him along with his daughters Oriana Rodman and Carla Oschwald, both of Santa Fe, N.M.; his son, Van Nostrand Rodman of Oakland, N.J.; and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Pataki Took Reins of Campaign and Broke the G.O.P. Mold 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
On the campaign trail, Gov. George E. Pataki often feigned ignorance about what his campaign aides were up to. More than once he deflected questions about strategy with the comment, "You'll have to talk to the professionals about that."
 Yet his aides say Mr. Pataki himself was the architect of the overarching strategy that eventually led to his resounding victory last Tuesday in a three-way race. 
 To be sure, there was a small cadre of campaign professionals behind the victory who have been with Mr. Pataki since he first won the governor's race in 1994, led by two of the most successful Republican consultants of their generation, Kieran Mahoney and Arthur Finkelstein. 
But they say it was the governor himself who recognized, after Republicans lost races for the United States Senate in 1998 and 2000, that he needed to expand his party's appeal beyond its traditional base of people who favor lower taxes, tougher criminal penalties and less-intrusive government. 
In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans five to three, and where heavily Democratic New York City is growing while the rest of the state is losing population, Mr. Pataki and his aides realized that the traditional Republican base could deliver only about a third of the vote in a statewide election.
Starting more than two years ago, the governor methodically moved to challenge the Democrats among voters they had taken for granted as firm supporters: union members, environmentalists, homosexuals and Latinos. 
He learned to speak Spanish and took a stand against an unpopular United States naval base in Puerto Rico. He added thousands of acres to state parks, delivered several pieces of legislation making it easier for unions to organize and promised to push an equal rights bill for homosexuals through the Republican Senate. In the last budget, he provided billions to pay for raises for hospital workers and teachers, putting two of the state's largest unions in his debt.
Mr. Pataki also engineered the appointment of Sandy Treadwell to replace William D. Powers, the pugilistic Republican Party chairman who had helped Mr. Pataki defeat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1994. Mr. Treadwell, a moderate who is loyal to the governor, immediately announced that the party's goal was to persuade homosexuals and other minorities to join. In the two years leading up to last week's election, the message coming from the Pataki administration was clear: the state G.O.P. was a big tent and everyone was invited.
"The governor often laments the fact that Republicans often don't show up and then wonder why they don't do well," Mr. Pataki's communications director, Michael McKeon, said. "The days of not showing up and conceding whole communities are over."
Mr. Pataki was also on the road constantly, showing up for every ribbon cutting and economic development announcement he could. Legislative leaders accused him of ignoring his duties in Albany, but the strategy worked in the field, creating the impression he was everywhere, working to help the economy.
At the same time, the governor's campaign got up and running early, long before Mr. Pataki had even announced he would run. Mr. Mahoney hired Adam Stoll, a 28-year-old political prodigy who had worked on both of Mr. Pataki's previous campaigns, as campaign manager in December 2000, just a month after Rick Lazio's loss to Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Senate race. 
By February 2001, the Pataki campaign had researchers tracking every move of both Democrats in the race, Andrew M. Cuomo and H. Carl McCall, as well as digging up material for attacks. That research later provided the grist for some of the most effective ads against Mr. McCall.
The campaign took two other unprecedented actions for a Republican candidate. In March 2002, the governor, in consultation with his campaign team, created Amigos de Pataki, a parallel campaign operation that organized Latino support. The Pataki camp also organized a large volunteer operation, People for Pataki, an unusual effort for a party that often relies more on advertising than shoe leather to win elections. By Election Day, the campaign had 23 offices around the state staffed by thousands of local volunteers.
Mr. Stoll said the campaign took its lead from the governor. "He very much set the direction, and as a campaign we came into place to prepare on a more tactical level to follow up on that," he said.
"We also set out to play deep into Democratic territory," Mr. Stoll said. "We are going to have to play at their 10-yard line. We had to force them to play there or we weren't going to win."
As a practical matter, the Pataki team figured the governor would run strongly in the suburbs but might lose some support in economically struggling counties upstate that had gone for him in 1994 and 1998. The team calculated that if he won 38 percent of the vote in New York City, he would win the race. 
"You need to make substantial inroads among Democrats," Mr. Mahoney said. "It's the political version of the Brezhnev doctrine: What's mine is mine and what's yours we'll talk about."
The governor was involved in major strategic decisions throughout the campaign, but more often than not agreed with the campaign team. That team consisted of Mr. Mahoney, Mr. Finkelstein, Mr. McKeon, Mr. Stoll, and his wife, Lisa Dewald Stoll, who wrote most of the advertisements. Chris Mottola produced the ads. They met every Thursday night to talk strategy.
For the most part, Mr. Pataki conserved his considerable resources -- overall he spent about $55 million -- until after the Democratic primary, though he did fight hard in an unsuccessful effort to win the Independence Party primary and thus knock Tom Golisano off the ballot. Mr. Golisano narrowly won the primary, and spent more than $65 million on advertisements attacking Mr. Pataki.
Mr. McCall won the Democratic primary after Mr. Cuomo unexpectedly dropped out of the race a few days before the election. Mr. McCall began the general election fight with very little money, partly because of what he spent on the primary contest. Polls showed he was well-liked but not well-known.
The first important post-primary decision Mr. Pataki made was to put an ad on the air that evoked his role as governor during the Sept. 11 attacks without specifically mentioning it. In the ad, the governor thanked New Yorkers for their courage over the last year. 
The campaign was so nervous about the ad that aides showed it to friends and relatives to gauge reaction first. Mr. McKeon even took a tape to a firehouse and played it for firefighters to see if they were offended. "We did not want to do anything that would look like we were exploiting or using 9/11 in any way," Mr. Stoll said.
Then Mr. Pataki took advantage of Mr. McCall's relatively undefined image, unleashing a series of ads containing videotapes of Mr. McCall saying, among other things, that he supported a commuter tax and thought urban schools deserved more aid than rural and suburban schools. Other ads portrayed Mr. McCall as a supporter of high taxes because he had voted for raising taxes 19 times while a state senator in the 1970's.
The ads put Mr. McCall, who is the state comptroller, on the defensive at a critical time when he needed to raise money. He responded with a spot in which he looked at the camera and said Mr. Pataki was telling lies about his record. It is unclear how effective it was, since the governor's ads had used Mr. McCall's own words against him.
Then the McCall campaign got hit with a political torpedo. The New York Post reported he had written a letter on official stationery to the head of Verizon, noting the state's large investment in the company and mentioning he was passing along a resume. The resume belonged to his daughter, who was later hired by the company. 
No Pataki campaign officials will talk about the source of the Post story, but campaign finance records show the Republican State Committee paid for a large amount of copying at the archives shortly before the story appeared.
Mr. Pataki's campaign benefited greatly from Mr. McCall's slow response to the allegations. The McCall campaign first retrieved all his correspondence from the archives, then waited a week before releasing dozens of other letters in which he had recommended friends for jobs. In essence, the Democrat had lost a week of the campaign defending himself against charges of nepotism.
The governor gained another tactical victory by insisting that debates include all the minor-party candidates, giving his main opponents less time to attack him and cluttering voters' minds with marginal candidates. 
In the second debate, however, Mr. Golisano began to attack Mr. Pataki's ethics, claiming his administration had traded paroles for campaign contributions, among other corruption allegations. Mr. Golisano, a Rochester billionaire financing his own campaign, followed the debate with attack ads making the same charges.
Mr. Pataki waited a week before responding, mostly because his tracking polls did not show Mr. Golisano gaining ground, campaign officials said. The Pataki team also believed Mr. Golisano was taking anti-Pataki voters from Mr. McCall, aides said. 
But on the Friday after the debate, Mr. Pataki approved broadcasting a single ad that quoted newspapers saying Mr. Golisano's ads were misleading and untrue. It was the only time in the campaign that the governor responded directly to the onslaught of negative ads by Mr. Golisano's campaign. 
"We relentlessly focused on Carl McCall because we knew he really was the opponent, not Golisano," Mr. McKeon said.
Eleven days before the election, Mr. Pataki managed to win the endorsement of the largest homosexual-rights group in the state as well, by persuading the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, to promise to let a gay-rights bill come to a vote in December. 
Mr. Pataki also proved a master of cementing political ties with personal kindnesses. His long-running feud with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ended shortly after Mr. Giuliani was given a diagnosis of prostate cancer in early 2000. The governor invited the mayor to his house in Garrison, N.Y., for a heart-to-heart talk, his aides said. The relationship deepened after the Sept. 11 tragedy, and the mayor was a staunch supporter of Mr. Pataki in this year's race, calling him "a terrific human being." 
The governor also made a call to Jack Kennedy, the president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, a Long Island umbrella organization with 60,000 members, shortly after Mr. Kennedy's grandchild drowned in a swimming pool. At a labor rally on Long Island for the governor in the last week of campaigning, Mr. Kennedy was nearly moved to tears talking about how close he felt to the governor.
With three weeks to go in the race, Mr. Pataki had 12 times the money of Mr. McCall, and ads painting Mr. McCall as a narrow-minded city liberal and the revelations about his job recommendation letters made it hard for him to close the governor's lead in public polls. Many big-time Democratic donors refrained from giving to his campaign. 
Mr. McCall's financial problems were compounded when he got into a fight over money with the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe. Two weeks before Election Day, Mr. McCall appeared on WLIB, a radio station with a predominantly black audience, and told listeners they should call the national committee and tell Mr. McAuliffe to live up to his promise to give Mr. McCall $500,000. "It's not love," Mr. McCall said. "It's money I want." 
Mr. Pataki's campaign made sure no one in the news media missed the comments, Pataki aides said. The next day Mr. McAuliffe said publicly that he doubted Mr. McCall could win and that the party's resources were needed elsewhere. Democrats soon patched up the rift, but the internecine fighting did nothing to improve Mr. McCall's position, strategists said.
The rest of the campaign was smooth sailing for the governor. Internal polls showed him with a solid lead and plenty of support from Democrats. Mr. Mahoney and Mr. McKeon did not even attend the Thursday night strategy meeting before Election Day, choosing instead to go trick-or-treating with their children.
On the final weekend of the election, Mr. Pataki shifted to more positive ads, airing a feel-good piece about the pride of New Yorkers and another in which several children say what they want to be when they grow up. He coasted to victory with 49 percent of the vote, and 39 percent of heavily Democratic New York City. He also got about 38 percent of the city's Latino vote, according to one study. 
Mr. Mahoney credited the victory to Mr. Pataki's sharp political instincts and the campaign's extensive preparations. "Sun Tzu said all battles are won before they are fought," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE MOOD; 
Fears Increase, But Consumers Keep Spending

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The American consumer, still the nation's main source of economic strength, seems torn between worrying about the future and making another trip to the mall.
 Polls indicate that many people, after sustaining an unusual amount of optimism during the last two years of turmoil, are beginning to wonder whether the current path of slow growth has become the new economic reality, rather than merely an interlude. But despite those concerns, Americans have done little to curb their purchases of clothing, houses and many other items. 
 With corporate executives still reluctant to invest in new equipment and nearly every other large economy in the world struggling, the strength of consumers' resilience will play a central role in determining the economy's path well into the future.
"There's a fair amount of anxiety about the economy, but there is not a consistently negative view of it," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, a polling organization. "Perhaps people have learned to roll with" the ups and downs of the business cycle. 
Call it the post-prosperity economy. The labor market remains healthy enough to keep incomes growing modestly, and the long booms of the 80's and 90's have convinced many consumers that the good times will soon return, making them willing to take on new debt.
Few consumers bothered to hunker down during last year's recession or this year's stuttering recovery. Despite the loss of about two million jobs, the steep fall in the stock market and the Sept. 11 attacks, household spending has defied the traditional pattern and grown every quarter since the recession began. As a result, the normal pent-up demand that develops during a downturn and helps propel a strong rebound is now absent.
Even a dozen interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve -- including one last week -- have failed to fully reinvigorate the economy. Instead, the repeated false starts of the last year have left the country vulnerable to a continued cycle of slow growth and gathering doubts, economists and executives say.
"We've always been resilient as a group of consumers," said Richard A. Galanti, the chief financial officer of Costco Wholesale, the warehouse discounter. "But all the lack of consumer confidence ultimately has to catch up with you."
Consumer confidence, while still higher than it was in the wake of other recent recessions, has fallen sharply since the summer, according to surveys by the Conference Board, a research group in New York, and the University of Michigan.
Only about one-third of Americans expect the next five years to bring continuous good times, down from 60 percent in 2000, according to the University of Michigan survey. Still, the number remains higher than it was during earlier slowdowns, when it regularly fell below 20 percent.
Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, said he suspected that even as spending has held up, people are starting to worry that the boom of the late 1990's will not come back for a long time. As a result, he said, there will be less spending on what he calls consumer "wish lists."
Richard T. Curtin, director of surveys at the University of Michigan, predicted that the next six months would be "a very weak period" for the economy.
It is also possible that the decline in stock prices since 2000 may have a delayed effect on consumer spending, as confidence that share prices will rebound begins to fade. In October, for the first time since UBS Warburg began asking the questions six years ago, more than half of investors said that it was not a good time to buy stocks.
As often happens when sentiment hits bottom, however, the stock market has rallied sharply since last month, a move that might help persuade consumers to keep spending.
Absent an economic shock from a prolonged war in Iraq or some other surprise, most analysts expect the economy to remain strong enough to avoid a renewed recession. But the flickering consumer optimism, combined with slowing income growth, also seems likely to keep the economy from taking off soon.
"There's too much uncertainty for us right now for the economy to pick up," said Carol Avellino, 43, who lives with her husband and two children in the Orange County, Calif., community of Orange, and is a project manager for a home builder. "I think we've got a ways to go."
Like many households, Ms. Avellino and her family have made small cuts in their spending, reducing trips to restaurants and the gifts they give each other but eliminating neither. Across the country, consumers are saving about 4 percent of their income, up from less than 2 percent in the late 90's, and spending is growing more slowly, according to the Commerce Department.
The wild card that could finally snap consumers' optimism and send the savings rate back toward the levels it reached in the pessimism-filled 1970's, early 80's and early 90's -- above 8 percent -- is a war with Iraq, many economists say.
Wars depress consumer spending and business investment simply by making people less sure about the future. But Mideast conflicts can also affect household budgets directly by threatening oil supplies, thereby increasing gas prices. 
"Consumer confidence is quite sensitive to fuel prices," said Gary E. Langer, the director of polling at ABC News. "If gas prices are rising, consumers feel it pretty quickly and tend to react negatively."
In fact, a tripling of oil prices in 2000 contributed to the recent downturn, much as energy price spikes have played a role in almost every recession of the last 30 years.
Barring a long war, however, consumers have given little indication that they are on the verge of sharp new cuts in spending. Last week, large retailers like Wal-Mart and Gap said shopping had picked up somewhat in recent weeks.
The willingness to spend and worry at the same time seems to stem partly from the long expansions of the 1980's and 1990's. They persuaded people that healthy growth, rather than the inflationary era from the early 1970's through the first couple years of the 1980's, was the natural state of the American economy.
"We won't go back to how we were before, with the exploding tech sector," said Dottie Macon, a 41-year-old homemaker in the Houston suburb of Pearland. But, she added, "we can say that it will turn around."
The relative prosperity of the economy, compared with the periods after past recessions, also plays a role in consumers' resilience, economists say.
Although job losses over the last two years have roughly matched the levels of a typical modern recession, people who kept their jobs fared unusually well. With unemployment at its lowest level in three decades as the recession began, the job market was so tight that wages continued to rise even as unemployment climbed to just under 6 percent from around 4 percent. The combination of very low inflation and steady income gains produced an improved standard of living for millions of Americans right through the recession.
The so-called misery index -- an invention of Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign that is calculated by adding the jobless rate and annual inflation rate -- has remained about 7 through this downturn. From 1970 to 1995, it was never below 8 and peaked above 20.
"Consumers just have a lot of cash," said Carl Steidtmann, the chief economist at Deloitte Research. "We're in the midst of the largest home refinancing boom ever, and one of the largest tax reductions."
Still, few see indications that there will be a surge in spending such as used to happen early in recoveries, because this time there will be little pent-up demand to serve as an economic accelerator.
Instead, consumers continued to take on new debts, whose payments have presented little problem for most people mostly because of the sharp decline in interest rates over the last three years.
For consumers, low interest rates are a mixed bag, permitting them to save money on buying cars and houses but costing them income from savings accounts. Over all, consumers receive more interest than they pay, so lower rates might be seen as harmful.
This has not been the case recently, quite clearly.
In part, that is because mortgage refinancings have made it possible for consumers to take money out of their homes that could be spent immediately.
If mortgage rates, which rose some in October, continue to edge up, they could cut off the flow of refinancings and damp spending.
Absent falling interest rates or rapidly advancing stock prices, consumers often turn to savings. Conservative spending will look particularly appealing to many of the baby boomers approaching retirement.
"There won't be a large change," said Mr. Curtin at the University of Michigan. "But it will be a small and cumulative change over a year or so. People will rebuild their savings, and it will come out of spending."

Travel Warnings Trouble Some Envoys in Southeast Asia

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
After the Bali bombing last month, when the Bush administration was considering a travel warning affecting not just Indonesia but much of Southeast Asia, at least three American ambassadors in the region objected, arguing that there was not much terrorist risk in their countries.
 The State Department considered the ambassadors' views, officials said -- then issued the warning for 11 countries, including the three, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, whose ambassadors had asked that those countries be exempted. 
 Still, the American warning was relatively mild and general compared with advisories issued by Denmark, Germany, Britain and Australia. They not only issued a general warning but also specified popular tourist places in Thailand where the possibility of a terrorist attack was deemed high. 
Government leaders and many citizens in Southeast Asia are trying to sort out how, when the Americans, Europeans and Australians share intelligence in the era of Al Qaeda, their governments still issued conflicting warnings. Different interpretations, diplomats say when speaking diplomatically. Politics, they say, more candidly. 
They add that the decisions are made in the capitals, not in the field, often over the objections of those on the spot. 
This troubles many ambassadors, who fear that the warnings play into the hands of the terrorists. 
Al Qaeda does have a network in Southeast Asia, and further attacks may loom, several diplomats said last week. But they are likely in other parts of the world as well.
"I'll tell you a secret," said a veteran European ambassador in the region. "There are cells in the United States, there are cells in Europe, and there are cells in Southeast Asia." 
Why then, he asked, was the travel warning only for the nations of Southeast Asia?
After the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, no European government advised its citizens not to travel to the United States, another European ambassador noted.
Several of the hijackers, including Mohamed Atta, lived and plotted in Hamburg, yet no one has issued a travel warning against going to that northern German city.
With a semiauthoritarian government, Singapore is probably as safe, if not safer, than Hamburg, or most cities in the world.
Far from warning people to stay away after the Sept. 11 attacks, America's leaders encouraged Americans to travel to New York, to support tourism, in a show of patriotic solidarity, and many world leaders did just that. 
The approach toward Bali, and now other tourist spots throughout Southeast Asia, has been the opposite.
"We are caught in a bind," said a Western ambassador in Thailand. "You want to give a cool assessment of the risks, which are greater now. On the other hand, you don't want to run and hide from the terrorists. You want life to go on.
"How do you maintain that balance? It's very tricky."
The warnings play into the terrorists' hands, diplomats and counterterrorism experts say, by creating terror and panic in people, which is what the terrorists want.
The resulting fear also does tremendous economic damage. In Thailand, about 6 percent of the economy comes from tourism, one of the highest levels in the world.
"You cannot overestimate the importance of tourism here," one ambassador said.
With corruption, a fledgling democracy and weak leadership, Indonesia is already in the economic straits. A blast like the one in Bali, and the travel warnings that followed, will keep away not only tourists but also foreign investors.
Only more unemployment and more poverty can result -- and therefore, many Indonesians say, more fertile recruiting grounds for Islamic terrorists. 
Several diplomats said that a strong factor behind the recent warnings was the political beating that the Australian government took after the attack in Bali, which killed 87 Australians, from surfers to rugby players. Prime Minister John Howard has been forced to defend the government against charges that it failed to warn about the possibility of an attack. That is so, even though no evidence has surfaced than any country had intelligence about a possible attack in Bali.
That example makes other governments nervous, a European ambassador said; his country's warning was issued in the capital, not by the embassy, he said.
If there are no terrorist attacks, few people will criticize a government for issuing a warning, diplomats say.
But if there is an attack, and the government has not protected itself by issuing a warning, there will be a high price to pay, they say.

HEADLINE: Arik Vs. Bibi 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Disgruntled Democrats in the House wonder: Should we take the principled, sharp-left route of Israel's Labor Party? 
 Labor's leaders recently departed from the coalition government headed by Israel's prime minister, Ariel (Arik) Sharon of the rightist Likud Party, to become full-time doves again. 
 Arik, short of a majority in the Knesset, looked to his right and saw nothing but a year of political blackmail and instability. So he called an election, which will probably be held the first week in February. 
Likud hopes to double its number of seats in parliament, thereby to form a stable, security-minded government with centrist allies. But the big political question in Israel is: Who will bear Likud's standard? 
Will it be Arik, who made a comeback out of oblivion rivaling that of de Gaulle and Nixon, and won in the biggest personal landslide in Israel's history? 
Or will Likudniks choose Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu, a former prime minister who -- with victory in prospect two years ago -- refused to stand for election because he nobly wanted it coupled with the election of a parliament that would give him a mandate?
That question of leadership will be settled within the next month. Likud's central committee, dominated by Bibi supporters, will set the rules for the primary election, but the 300,000 party members -- many recently recruited by Arik's son, Omri -- will make the decision. These Likudniks pay a small fee to register, symbolic of their intent to vote. A 70 percent turnout is expected, and the latest polls range from a slight to a substantial lead for Arik. But Bibi has come from behind before. 
Though both are hardliners and conservatives, this primary is no Tweedledee-Tweedledum election. The contrasts go far beyond the contestants' 20-year age differential. 
Arik is of Israel's "greatest generation," a passionate Zionist, hearty, good-humored, a leader in battle who likes to crumble the earth on his farm between his fingers. Bibi, from a legendary family, is intense, purposeful, a passionate pro-growth capitalist, highly articulate in Hebrew and English, an executive determined to reform his country's outdated socialist ways. 
Arik is primarily focused on winning the terrorist war being waged on Israel. Once a symbol of division, he is now a determined unifier, with his campaign theme to his party stressing his electability that will add seats in the Knesset: "The People Want Sharon." Bibi is attuned to economic worries, with unemployment at 10 percent and the fractionated Knesset pulling the budget apart; his slogan evokes "A New Beginning." The two differ more on priority than policy: Sharon stresses national security; Netanyahu emphasizes economic change.
Arik just appointed Bibi his foreign minister, magnanimously keeping him inside the tent; Bibi accepted, lest he look disloyal, but on condition of snap elections, which Arik's refusal to kowtow to the far right forced him to call. 
Arik and Labor's Shimon Peres differed profoundly on security and economic policy, but they liked and trusted each other; with Arik and Bibi, it's the other way around. In the 90's, Arik helped deliver the religious vote to Bibi, but after the victory, Bibi tried to stiff him. Last year, when Arik privately praised Bibi's economic acumen, I said that was nice in view of Arik's having once been double-crossed. Arik smiled, held up two fingers and said "twice." (J.F.K. motto: "forgive but don't forget.") 
A factor in the minds of Likud voters is the American connection. George W. Bush was first introduced to Israel by then-Prime Minister Netanyahu, who wisely saw the Texas governor's prospects. But Bush has welcomed Prime Minister Sharon to the White House seven times (to zero for Arafat), and Arik's connective tissue with Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell and Rice is considerable. He's earned their trust by moving -- often at political cost -- toward the right-center. 
Bibi counters that public opinion drives politics in the U.S. and that he is better equipped to make Israel's case on television. Neither man likes the State Department "road map" with its one-sided deadline and unwanted Russo-European-U.N. intercession, but with Iraq in the offing, both duck that issue.
So will it be "the economy, stupid" favoring Bibi, or Dr. Win-the-War, favoring Arik? I don't have a vote, but before it's over I'll cast an opinion.

HEADLINE: Arkansas Rice Farmers Run Dry, And U.S. Remedy Sets Off Debate 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: ULM, Ark., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Rice farmers like John Kerksieck are on the brink of draining one of Arkansas' biggest aquifers dry.
 That alone is troublesome, in a state that gets almost 50 inches of rain a year. But even more confounding -- since these Southern farmers will not be the last to find themselves in such a pickle -- is the question of what to do about it. 
 Most of the farmers want the government to send them replacement water from the White River. The Army Corps of Engineers and the state support a plan to spend more than $200 million in federal money on the project, or about $300,000 a farmer. It is time, they say, for the government to do in other states what has long been done in the West -- provide irrigation water to farmers who have no other resort. 
But others are concerned about the precedent such a project would set. If the government rewards farmers who use up their water here, they say, what is to stop others from doing the same?
The debate touches on issues of water rights and responsibilities, and spills over into farm policy, because one issue is whether taxpayers should have to spend more to help grow rice, which is already heavily subsidized. It also involves wrangling about whether the corps, which has been limited to navigation and flood control, has any business wading into irrigation.
One interest group, Taxpayers for Common Sense, contends the plan is a boondoggle of the first order.
Farmers here in Arkansas' Grand Prairie, one of the country's richest rice-growing areas, see it differently. "We really don't have a water problem," said Mr. Kerksieck, 42, in hunting garb in anticipation of the duck season, which rivals rice farming as the Grand Prairie's main preoccupation. Like many here, he traces his lineage to the farmers who arrived in the early 1900's, starting a century of pumping from the aquifer at rates that could not be sustained.
"There's plenty of water in the river," Mr. Kerksieck said. "They've just got to let us divert it."
Another farmer, Lynn Sickel, 51, said: "I'm a conservative person. But if this is what it's going to take for highly productive farmland to continue to provide food nationally and internationally, well, that's the taxpayer's burden."
David Carruth, a local lawyer who had led opposition to the plan, posed the question a different way. "Why shouldn't we say to these farmers in the Grand Prairie: 'You've known since 1940 that you had a problem with your aquifer, and you went ahead and overpumped it anyway,' " he said. " 'Why should we go ahead and grant you another resource?"
Neither Congress nor the Bush administration has made a final decision about the plan, with total cost estimated at $319 million, with the federal government paying 65 percent. But nearly all sides agree that time for a decision is running short. Water levels in the shallow aquifer, known as the Alluvial, are declining at rates so fast that by 2015 there will not be enough left underground to sustain the area's 1,000 farms, which cover about 250,000 acres and represent about 5 percent of country's rice production.
The economic impact of such a collapse could surpass $46 million a year, the corps has estimated.
The Grand Prairie is not the only area in trouble because of declining groundwater. Underground water accounts for 22 percent of American water use, and in many areas, including much of the Great Plains, coastal Florida and North Carolina and parts of the Mississippi Delta, it is being depleted. Even in eastern Arkansas, whose aquifers are fed by the Mississippi River, overuse has prompted state officials to designate a second area as critical because of scarce groundwater.
But the Grand Prairie area is the first whose aquifer problems have prompted the Corps of Engineers to propose stepping in, a move that many see as an important test case as water shortages, even in the East, have become common.
"One could take the position that, hey, the farmers are the ones who created this mess, so why don't we just let their wells go dry and let everybody go broke, and then the problem will fix itself," G. Alan Perkins, a Little Rock lawyer and an authority on water law, said. "But the critical problem is that right now, we're facing an imminent aquifer failure."
Like many states, Arkansas has essentially never limited the amount of water that farmers can pump from their land. In the last 50 years in the Grand Prairie, farmers have relied increasingly on irrigation, over and above ample rains, to increase the yields of their crops. The farmers have increased by nearly tenfold the amount of water pumped from the Alluvial Aquifer, even as its level was declining by more than a foot a year, the state Soil and Water Commission said.
"By allowing limitless access to such a resource, we encourage overexploitation," said Robert Glennon, a law professor at the University of Arizona and the author of "Water Follies," a new book on groundwater depletion.
Even now, under the critical area designation, state law permits limits on pumping only if an alternative source of water is made available to the current users at equal or lower cost. Arkansas hopes that alternative can be the White River, but it says it cannot carry out the project without significant federal help.
"We see groundwater depletion in Arkansas being a major problem, and one that involves the national interest, and really the only federal agency with the expertise and ability to deal with it is the corps," Earl T. Smith, chief of the Arkansas commission's water resources management division, said.
Under the corps' current plan, about 2 percent of water from the White River would be diverted for farm use, a project that would include pumping stations, canals and reservoirs. The plan, which the corps said would save the aquifer by reducing pumping to sustainable levels, has passed an environmental review, but faces opposition from outdoor and environmental groups like the Arkansas Wildlife Federation. The groups contend that lower river flows could alter the habitats of certain fish and migratory birds, including ducks, and thus hurt fishing and hunting.
Congress has allocated $45 million for the project, and farmers and the State of Arkansas have spent an additional $11 million. The Bush administration has not included the plan in its budgets. Although withholding a final decision, the Office of Management and Budget has limited how the corps can spend money already allocated for the plan, restricting it to conservation purposes.
Mr. Carruth, the critic of the plan, said a better approach would be to retire some farmland and to spend federal money on technology to enable farmers to use water more efficiently. That approach, he says, eases overpumping of the aquifer without the costly river diversion.
"Why should we subsidize a pump that will sell subsidized water to grow a subsidized crop?" he asked, noting that federal price guarantees mean that rice farmers receive $3.10 a bushel for their crop, more than twice the current $1.40 market price. 
An analysis by the corps said that without White River water, there was no way to save enough underground water to continue irrigation at anything but a tiny fraction of current levels.
The farmers say the goal of maintaining a domestic food and fiber industry, and avoiding further reliance on foreign suppliers, is well worth the federal cost, even if it means guaranteeing water and crop payments for their rice.
"There is a long and established history of the federal government being involved in water resources development and protection" John C. Edwards, the executive director of the White River Irrigation District, which represents the 1,000 Grand Prairie farmers, said. "There has been a federal interest in irrigation in 17 Western states. Now that water problems are coming to the East, we can learn from the past to make this a better project for the future."

HEADLINE: Baby Bells Are Hoping for a Reprieve 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
In the clubby world of Senate policy-making, a single senator in a critical position can effectively bring legislation to a standstill. 
 Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, largely accomplished just that in the costliest lobbying battle over the last year -- one that may decide which companies will have an edge in the next generation of telecommunications. 
 The senator's gatekeeper role as chairman of the Commerce Committee helped to stifle a bill that was backed by the regional Bell telephone companies and had passed the House by an almost two-thirds majority. The legislation, which would have freed the Bells from being forced to lease their advanced data communications networks to competitors, had been opposed by AT&T and other communications carriers who count Senator Hollings among their allies.
But now that the Republicans have regained control of the Senate, Senator Hollings will be replaced as the committee's chairman by John McCain, the Arizona Republican who had led the panel until a year and a half ago and has a close relationship with the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. By tradition, the Commerce Committee typically takes the lead on communications issues. 
While telecommunications is not generally a partisan issue, the Baby Bells are welcoming a reprieve from one of their harshest opponents. 
"Senator Hollings has historically been very clear about his opinion of the Bells," said William M. Daley, a secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration who now serves as president of SBC Communications. SBC is second only to Verizon Communications, another offspring of the breakup of the Bell System, among the nation's largest local phone companies. "McCain may be a little more open to some of the positions that we as an industry articulate."
Still, while Senator McCain generally favors deregulation as a way to stimulate competition, the Baby Bells will not necessarily find him a strong ally, given his populist tones.
"Senator McCain places consumer interests above special interests," Pia Pialorsi, his spokeswoman, said. "He advocates a deregulatory environment that he believes will best support the growth of competitive markets and benefit consumers."
As with many aspects of his policy-making, Senator McCain has historically chosen an independent path on telecommunications issues. He was one of five senators -- and the only Republican -- to vote against the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which helped begin a process of relaxing many telephone industry regulations and easing the Bells' way into the long-distance market. 
At the time, Senator McCain argued that the law did not take deregulation far enough and would lead to prolonged litigation. Indeed, a number of provisions of the 1996 law wound up in federal courts. 
For the Bells and their competitors, the big contest involves the future of the broadband, or high-capacity high-speed networks, that business customers and consumers are demanding. It is a business worth billions of dollars in annual revenues, and the open questions around the network include who will build it, who will have access to it, who will control it and who will subsidize it. 
The Baby Bells -- which in addition to Verizon and SBC are BellSouth and Qwest Communications International -- argue that they need to be unshackled from their obligations under the 1996 law. To promote local competition, the law required the Bell companies to open their longtime monopoly networks to rivals, generally by leasing access to all the pieces of those networks at wholesale prices.
But the Bells say this process has put them at an economic disadvantage to cable television companies, which do not face such requirements and which have sprinted ahead of the local phone companies in offering broadband Internet service to residential customers. Last February, a bill sponsored by Representatives Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, and John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, passed the House in a bipartisan vote of 273 to 157, freeing the Bells from many of the leasing requirements. 
"Tauzin-Dingell was all about telling the F.C.C. that the majority of house thought the Telecom Act was broken," said Scott Cleland, the chief executive of the Precursor Group, a communications research firm in Washington. "That message was sent and received."
Opposing the Bells is a large coalition of long-distance carriers like AT&T, WorldCom and Sprint; Internet service providers; upstart phone companies; and cable companies. 
"We're not opposed to deregulation, but we think the competition ought to be developed first," said Peter G. Jacoby, vice president of Congressional relations at AT&T.
Along with the House majority, Senator McCain and Michael K. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, seem to be in general agreement that deregulation is the solution to stimulating the telecommunications markets. The differences may lie in the details, methods and timing. 
In August, Senator McCain introduced a bill on broadband deregulation, one seen as more of an intellectual exercise than as a pragmatic piece of legislation. The proposal, in which both sides find things to like and dislike, was seen as the senator's way of injecting his views into the debate, without taking sides.
"Unlike other bills which clearly favored one side or another, it takes a much more market-by-market approach," said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff at the F.C.C. who is now an analyst for the investment firm Legg Mason Wood Walker.
The bill, for example, continues to provide the Bells' competitors with access to the older technologies in the Bells' networks, while taking a hands-off approach to broadband facilities that the Bells may build. 
The proposal, focusing on the residential market, also takes an antiregulation stance, by restricting the ability of the F.C.C. and state agencies to impose requirements on high-speed Internet providers.
While Senator McCain's legislation is dormant, it serves as a signal of his thinking to the F.C.C., which is now conducting evaluations that are very likely to remove a number of the obstacles for the Baby Bells, industry analysts say. Senator McCain and Mr. Powell share a cordial relationship and deregulatory philosophy. It was Senator McCain's intervention in 1997, after all, that helped Mr. Powell win a seat on the F.C.C. during the Clinton administration.
It is at the F.C.C. where the industry now expects the broadband matter to be decided. But Senator McCain will still be able to use the Commerce Committee as a bully pulpit on his other pet telecommunications issues -- like rising cable television prices. In April, he asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a review of why cable prices have climbed so steeply. Since 1996, cable rates have risen 36 percent, almost three times the pace of inflation, the Consumers Union said.
While he has not taken a position on EchoStar's proposed acquisition of its satellite television rival DirecTV, which the Justice Department and F.C.C. have both rejected, Senator McCain has said that the satellite industry needs more support to make inroads into cable's market share. He has also criticized the broadcast industry for what he considers its foot-dragging in the transition to digital television.
A maverick proposal is the senator's call to broadcasters to grant free air time for political candidates -- a campaign reform measure which the National Association of Broadcasters, one of the largest and most influential lobbying groups, strictly opposes. Senator McCain said free time would de-emphasize large contributions by reducing candidates dependence on fund-raising.

Remaining True to His Beliefs, Whatever the Consequences

BYLINE:  By RON WERTHEIMER 

 BODY:
"I'll never tell a lie," Jimmy Carter said. In 1976 the voters, dizzy from Watergate, embraced the singular politician who would make such an audacious promise, a man of high morals and unvarnished faith who spoke of a country "as good and honest and decent and truthful and competent and filled with love as are the American people."
 Those American people, who elected him president, soundly rejected him four years later, despite his stunning diplomatic feat, the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, which had seemed to promise an end to conflict in the Middle East. At 56, the man was finished. Today, however, after a journey beyond the White House that has been as noteworthy as his path to it, Mr. Carter is basking in the adulation certified by last month's Nobel Peace Prize. 
 With fortunate timing, "American Experience" is offering "Jimmy Carter," a fascinating two-part portrait, tonight and tomorrow night on PBS.
The filmmaker Adriana Bosch, who has delineated the lives of presidents including U. S. Grant and Ronald Reagan, skillfully lays out a sympathetic but clear-eyed picture of Mr. Carter, assembled out of home movies, news clips and interviews with historians, journalists and a parade of Carter associates, from former Vice President Walter F. Mondale to Bert Lance, the budget director who left Washington under a cloud. Most important among the talking heads is Rosalynn Carter, wife and confidante, who still giggles at the thought of their courtship and turns coldly grim as she recounts those last days at the White House.
Mr. Carter's own words are heard in the abundant archival segments and in quotations from his writings, read by the narrator, Linda Hunt. He is to speak for himself in a separately produced interview that also includes his wife; it is to be broadcast in two parts, after the "American Experience" programs.
Tonight's documentary starts with Mr. Carter's boyhood around Plains, Ga., and takes him through his unlikely election as president. Serious, analytical and a born student, he was attending the Naval Academy when his future wife saw his picture in the bedroom of her friend, his sister Ruth. "I just thought he was the most handsome young man I had ever seen," Mrs. Carter says.
They were married a month after his graduation, and he embarked on his naval career, which was cut short in 1953, when his father died and Jimmy Carter came home to Plains to take over the family peanut business. Although Mrs. Carter admits to her disappointment at being back home, she taught herself accounting to help out. "They're partners in everything," their son Chip says of his parents. That would become apparent years later when Mrs. Carter attended cabinet meetings.
A state senator, he ran unsuccessfully for governor, learned from his mistakes and prevailed in 1970. At his inauguration he surprised many Georgians, who assumed he was a segregationist, when he declared, "The time for racial discrimination is over." Soon he was on the cover of Time, which proclaimed, "Dixie whistles a different tune." 
Even in Georgia, not everybody danced to the Carter tune. His unerring faith in his own perspective and his distaste for political compromise sometimes blunted his effectiveness, but not his ambition. Soon he surprised people well beyond his state by stalking the presidency. 
"Nobody knew him," says the historian Douglas Brinkley. "It was like picking a name out of the phone book."
Tomorrow night's conclusion shows Mr. Carter pursuing a foreign policy with a focus on human rights. Still, he journeyed to Iran to praise the shah, a dubious ally. A week later 53 hostages were taken at the American Embassy in Tehran, as opposition to the shah grew violent. This frightening embarrassment, compounded by a failed attempt to rescue the hostages, soured voters who were already anxious about a plummeting economy and energy crisis and were tired of Mr. Carter's preaching. Nominated for a second term, he was trounced by Mr. Reagan.
Mr. Carter has spent the years since as an advocate for peace and social justice, putting into practice the moral precepts he has embraced from the start. This program is a vivid reminder that a good president and a good man are not necessarily the same thing.

HEADLINE: The Americas Court a Group That Changed New York 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
In a mighty demonstration of the power of ideas, a small conservative research group called the Manhattan Institute once helped change the course of the most liberal big city in the country. Through most of the 1990's, a handful of intellectuals from the institute met regularly with leading officials of the Giuliani administration, contributing ideas that helped shape the way New York thought about crime, welfare, taxes and education.
 Now with a new mayor in City Hall who has less interest in the research group's ideas, the little think tank that could is taking its ideas elsewhere, particularly Latin America. It has already counseled the president of Honduras, the former president of Argentina, the mayor of Caracas, Venezuela, and a man who has a chance of becoming the next president of Chile. 
 At times it seems that Latin American leaders cannot get enough of the institute and its ideas. There is now a permanent office in Santiago, Chile, and public officials regularly come to New York to study the institute's conservative philosophy, hoping that some of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's fame will rub off on them. 
"Giuliani had a great success in restoring security to the city of New York," said Raul Torrealba, mayor of Vitacura, one of Chile's wealthiest cities and a place, like many others in the region, where security and quality of life are big concerns. "He showed that you have to focus on the small things if you want to get the big things under control." 
Mr. Torrealba and 21 other Chilean and Brazilian officials spent the better part of last week sampling the city's success. A group of Chilean educators is in town this week. 
After a visit last week to the Lower Manhattan Business Improvement District, which has the kind of public-private partnership the institute favors, Mr. Torrealba said he was intrigued at how Wall Street businesses essentially asked the city to raise their taxes by a special assessment to pay for additional security forces, street signs and sanitation.
"I don't have the power to impose additional taxes the way you do here," he said, explaining that the national government assesses all taxes in Chile. But as a substitute, he said, he will ask businesses in his city to voluntarily contribute support for a district like New York's.
The Chilean mayors also took a look at some educational programs that were inspired by the institute's theories about accountability. And they met several times with New York police officials to find out how the city reduced its crime rate.
They were even addressed by George L. Kelling, a senior fellow at the institute, who originated the "broken windows strategy," which became the foundation of the city's later "zero tolerance" policy toward crime: the idea that strongly enforcing laws against minor infractions discourages more serious crimes by sending a signal that the community is in control.
Public officials in half a dozen Latin countries have already adopted variations of the institute's community policing ideas, but the group's leading adherent in the region is Joaquin Lavin, now the mayor of Santiago. In 2000, Mr. Lavin ran for president and cited his record of putting the institute's concepts into effect.
As mayor of Las Condes, a wealthy community that is part of metropolitan Santiago, Mr. Lavin put local code enforcement officials in patrol cars with the national police to assert some local control. He also created a school for delinquent students that was modeled after the Wildcat Academy in Manhattan, an alternative high school that was founded on concepts of accountability put forward by the institute. 
Although he ran strongly, Mr. Lavin lost the 2000 presidential race. He was later elected mayor of Santiago and is now considered a leading candidate for the next presidential election. His near-victory spawned a whole generation of Chilean politicians for whom the Manhattan Institute is the equivalent of an ideological Vatican.
The institute's president, Lawrence J. Mone, said its expanding role in Latin America was a result not of a new initiative but rather the demand for change in the region. He said the institute first sponsored a conference there a decade ago, and as interest from local organizations in several countries grew, the institute stepped up its activities. 
"What we're doing is exporting a set of ideas about governing cities that we just think makes sense," Mr. Mone said. But the efforts in Latin America do not mean the institute's dedication to New York has diminished, he said.
"We're deeply committed to the city, especially after 9/11," Mr. Mone said. "We're not going to redirect any energy away from New York."
But critics say the institute has been forced to find new markets for its ideas because it has been coasting on past successes. "Even the Yankees ran out of steam," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. Mr. Moss, who advises Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said he used to be a big supporter of the Manhattan Institute but found that the group had lost its intensity. "They've become more interested in putting forward their old ideas than coming up with new ones," he said. 
Andrew White, director of the Center for New York City Affairs at the Milano Graduate School of the New School University, said the institute is not as influential with the Bloomberg administration as it was under Mayor Giuliani because "it's not writing about how to make government more effective," which is the mayor's goal. "To me," Mr. White said, "they're preaching ideology."
If there is a crusade, said Carlos M. Medina, executive director of the institute's Inter-American Policy Exchange in Chile, it is simply to bring good ideas together with good people who can make things happen. 
"We don't sell ideas," Mr. Medina said. "We share them." The nonprofit institute has no formal business arrangement with any clients or officials in Latin America.
Mr. Giuliani, who has started a private consulting firm, is also sharing ideas with the rest of the hemisphere, but for a price.
The Giuliani Group, which the mayor formed with other officials from his administration, recently signed a $4.3 million consulting contract to help officials in Mexico City get a handle on the city's increasing crime problems. The Manhattan Institute has no direct link with the Giuliani Group, but Mr. Mone, the institute's president, says he applauds what the former mayor is doing and stands ready to help. 
The institute plans to hold a conference in Mexico next year to discuss how its model of urban control and accountability might work in Mexico. "There is a lot of skepticism there about whether these ideas are applicable," Mr. Mone said. 
The institute is acting on the belief that Latin America has embraced its ideas so firmly because the region is ripe for change. Throughout the 1980's and 1990's, democracies were installed in one Latin American country after another. Markets were opened and economies deregulated. Now there is a budding interest in empowering local governments, and mayors like Marta Ehlers Bustamante of Lo Barnechea, a city near Santiago, are so eager to replicate New York's success that they do not care where the ideas come from. 
"Whatever forces us to change from the system we have now," Ms. Ehlers Bustamante said, "is good."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: INSPECTIONS; 
U.N. Set to Move In Quickly To Seek Iraq Nuclear Arms

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
United Nations atomic experts have finished detailed plans for a "full court press" of fast-moving inspections that will quickly uncover any major nuclear weapons program Iraq has undertaken in the last four years, according to Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the nuclear team.
 While Mr. ElBaradei said he was confident he would find "all large components" of nuclear weapons work in Iraq, he cautioned that his inspectors could face difficulties detecting smuggled nuclear materials and will need help from other governments. He said it could take several months to assess evidence the Bush administration has provided to support its claims that Iraq is trying to build a nuclear weapon. 
 "We are going to use every weapon in our diplomatic inspection arsenal to make sure that if there was any breach, we can detect it and detect it early," said Mr. ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in an interview Friday, when the Security Council unanimously approved a resolution giving the inspectors enhanced authority. 
"We are going to be tough," he said. "We will not tolerate any cat-and-mouse."
Mr. ElBaradei will travel to Baghdad on Nov. 18 with Hans Blix, the head of the United Nations chemical, biological and long-range missile inspections team. The inspectors have been barred by Iraq since they withdrew in December 1998, on the eve of American and British bombing raids to punish Baghdad's failures to cooperate with the inspectors.
Bush administration officials have said they will be watching the inspectors' every move, ready to go to the Security Council to call for war against Saddam Hussein at the first sign that he is cheating or obstructing the inspectors' work. But while the United States and Britain, the co-authors of the resolution, see the inspections as a trigger for war, other Security Council members are hoping they will force Iraq to disarm and lead to peace.
Up to now, Mr. ElBaradei, who is based in Vienna, has stayed in the background as Mr. Blix talked to the Security Council and reporters, even though the two chiefs have equal authority. But as the inspections get under way, Mr. ElBaradei becomes a key figure for the Bush administration. 
In a report in February 1999, the atomic agency said its inspections to that point "revealed no indication" that Iraq had a nuclear weapon or retained "any practical capability" to make fuel. Iraq is only allowed to have very limited amounts of radioactive isotopes for medical treatment and agricultural uses.
President Bush has charged that Mr. Hussein reactivated his nuclear program, employing many scientists and technicians and withholding key information about procurement and foreign assistance. Mr. Bush warned that if Iraq acquired fissile material, it could build a weapon within a year.
Mr. ElBaradei said he would arrive in Iraq with about 10 atomic experts, and a week later start building the team to about 25 inspectors. They will move quickly to revisit sites they examined previously, he said, to see whether old surveillance systems remain in place and to set up environmental sampling to test for radioactivity.
He said that he would need up to three months to set up a broader plan of work based on programs that Iraq declares and suspicions the inspectors may have about hidden activity. 
He said that he and Mr. Blix expect to have latitude to make judgments about Iraq's cooperation, suggesting that their standards might be more flexible than the administration's. 
The inspectors will not be alarmed by "a minor omission" in Iraq's weapons declaration, Mr. ElBaradei said. "We will be guided by the definition of material breach, which is really a major violation of the very purpose of the process." 
Mr. ElBaradei said it is virtually impossible for Iraq to conceal an advanced nuclear weapons program, because it requires large industrial sites and emits radioactivity. But it will be hard for inspectors to discover if Iraq has smuggled in small amounts of uranium or plutonium. 
"The difficult part would be if Iraq were to import nuclear material from abroad, across the border, that would be a real challenge to our system," Mr. ElBaradei said. He is appealing for intelligence data any country might have about black market nuclear trading with Iraq.
The atomic chief predicted that evaluating information provided by the Bush administration about Iraq's attempt to buy aluminum tubes, which the president cited as the most damning evidence of Iraq's nuclear ambitions, would be a complex job. While he is expecting more details from Washington, he said he did not yet know if the tubes went to Iraq, and he remained unsure if they were for nuclear development. "Our assessment is that they could have been used for conventional rockets in addition to being used for uranium enrichment," he said.
During the Security Council's heated negotiations over the resolution, Mr. ElBaradei, an Egyptian, reached out to the Arab world to defend the inspections, and conducted a long interview with Al Jazeera, the Arabic-language television station. "The Arab world must understand that there is a problem in Iraq, and it is not because Iraq is an Arab country," he said. "It is because Iraq has not fulfilled its obligations with regard to disarmament."
The new resolution, he stresses, has language -- albeit deeply buried -- that holds out the prospect to Baghdad of an end to economic sanctions within a year if Mr. ElBaradei and Mr. Blix give their approval. But Mr. ElBaradei expects his word to carry weight in the Middle East if he says that Mr. Hussein balked. "I think they will probably listen to me, because I will speak to them in their own language," he said.

HEADLINE: A Break for Low-Wage Workers 

 BODY:
The idea of compelling employers doing city business to pay workers a living wage -- sufficiently above the minimum wage to break the poverty line -- has taken hold in about 80 cities and communities around the nation. Now, New York has come up with its own modest version, which should be a first step toward helping some of the city's poorest workers.
 This is not a good time to be spending city money. But this is a worthy cause and we're glad the City Council has produced a prudent bill that should not cost the city more than $1 million the first year. 
 The Council's plan, passed last week with bipartisan support and sent to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, would raise the pay of 50,000 home health care attendants -- most of them black, Hispanic and immigrant women -- who help care for sick, elderly and disabled patients through home care agencies that contract with the city through Medicaid. Their pay would increase to $8.10 an hour with benefits (about 60 cents above the current average), or $9.60 an hour without benefits, rising to a minimum of $10 an hour by mid-2006.
It's no coincidence that these workers are members of the powerful 1199/S.E.I.U., headed by Dennis Rivera, which led a coalition pressing for the bill. The measure reflects union muscle -- the American Federation of Teachers won living-wage coverage for some of its child care workers, too. It's also politically pragmatic, seeking to cover workers in a way that is less likely to draw a mayoral veto. Mr. Bloomberg balked at any bill that would affect private firms that might move elsewhere, such as employers in commercial properties leased to the city or companies that receive city subsidies.
While many other living wage measures have floors approaching or exceeding $10 an hour -- Westchester's is $10.50 an hour -- New York's bill is conservative. The city would pay just 10 percent of the proposed increased pay, with the remaining 90 percent coming from the state and federal governments. That seems a small price to pay to help keep low-paid employees in thankless but critical jobs that cannot be eliminated, not even in a bad economy.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTION: THE ECONOMY; 
BUSH'S WAY CLEAR TO PRESS AGENDA FOR THE ECONOMY

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
With his party in control and his political standing solidified, President Bush has new freedom to confront the weakened economy on his terms and has put his advisers to work developing an ambitious agenda for the next two years.
 It is sure to include making permanent the 10-year tax cut passed last year, securing new tax cuts for investors, holding down spending in areas other than national security and moving slowly toward overhauling the tax code and Social Security. 
 The president is eager to take advantage of the Republican majority on Capitol Hill, his aides say, adding that he has long since absorbed the lesson of 1992, when Bill Clinton beat his father partly by casting him as out of touch on the economy. But after two years in office, Mr. Bush faces added pressure to get good economic results or pay a steep price when it comes to his own re-election, political strategists and economic policymakers in both parties say. 
Mr. Bush used the economic downturn that began around the time he took office to build support for the $1.35 trillion tax cut he signed into law 17 months ago. In that way the economy's current weakness could be an opportunity for the White House to assert that expanded tax-cutting would again give the economy the lift it needs. He and Republicans in Congress have also made clear that they intend to do more to shield companies and doctors from lawsuits, continue to loosen environmental regulations and promote more international trade.
For two crucial reasons, Mr. Bush will hold the economy's reins as never before. First, even though the Democrats are sure to put up a fight, in Congress and in the presidential campaign, they are in disarray on economic policy -- and deeply split over tax cuts in particular. Second, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was seen in recent years as having far more power to smooth out economic bumps than the president. But the Fed has just about exhausted its power. It has pushed its main interest rate down to 1.25 percent through 12 rate cuts over the last two years, leaving it with little room to reduce rates further.
With the Fed all but sidelined, the focus is shifting to tax and spending policy. But relying on further tax cuts -- with an increase in government spending on national security and a possible war with Iraq -- also runs the risk that the current modest budget deficits will swell into an economic and political issue, as they did in the 1980's and early 1990's.
This is also the first sustained period of economic weakness since mutual funds and 401(k) retirement plans made investing part of everyday life across the income spectrum, and some White House officials are concerned that there is no playbook for responding to anxiety among the mass investor class.
Mr. Bush confronts other risks. After nearly two years of attributing the economy's troubles variously to a hangover from the Clinton years, Osama bin Laden, obstructionists in the Democratic Senate and the business cycle, the president will most likely be forced to take full political ownership of the economy.
"There's no more calling this the Clinton economy or the Daschle economy," said Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee. "It's now the George W. Bush economy. So Republican fortunes for 2004 will rise and fall with the economy in the next two years."

A Team in Tumult
In late 2000, even before the disputed election was settled, Mr. Bush set in motion a strategy of acknowledging the economic problems he would face as president.
His running mate, Dick Cheney, started publicly characterizing the economy -- correctly, it turned out -- as on the brink of recession. Mr. Cheney began making a case that Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut, which until then had been justified primarily as a way to give the budget surplus back to taxpayers, would ward off an economic downturn that he tied to the Clinton administration.
Mr. Bush and his team have used economic difficulties to press for their policies on taxes, trade, energy and other issues ever since. Having absorbed the lesson of 1992 -- that it is fatal to appear out of touch with the economic angst of voters -- Mr. Bush has continued to address the economy's problems openly even when things seemed to be improving.
Throughout this year, Mr. Bush said he would not be satisfied with the economy until every American who wanted a job could get one. He sought to tie his popularity as commander in chief directly to his economic plans by asserting that his agenda was directed at providing security of all sorts for the nation.
But if Mr. Bush has been consistent in his message of concern and hope, his top economic advisers have been prone to gaffes and feuds, leaving the administration without an economic spokesman of any stature, members of each party said.
"There clearly seems to be a high level of frustration with the president's economic advisers in general," said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group. 
Prominent Republicans said the most consistent target of criticism, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, is unlikely to leave anytime soon. Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the budget director, has had stormy relations with both parties on Capitol Hill, but he is well regarded within the White House, and if he leaves it is likely to be to run for governor of Indiana.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, chairman of the National Economic Council, has drawn criticism as being disorganized, and he has been shorn of any substantial role as a spokesman on economic matters. But he has denied rumors that he is on his way out.
People with ties to the administration, especially conservatives, have been promoting a bigger role for R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. But his prospects for getting more responsibility are uncertain.
Asked on Thursday about the future of his economic advisers, Mr. Bush lauded their performance in guiding the economy through two turbulent years but had no assurances there would not be changes.

No 'Rubinomics' for Them
Behind the emerging Bush economic strategy is a shift away from the bipartisan consensus of the late 1990's that fiscal responsibility should come first when setting budget policy. Instead the administration is reasserting conservative economic orthodoxy and giving itself more room for tax cuts.
Conservatives have always been skeptical that balancing the budget was a more potent strategy than cutting taxes. But they went along with the fiscal rectitude formula, championed by Robert E. Rubin while he was economic policy coordinator and then Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, as a way to keep Democratic spending in check.
Now Mr. Bush's advisers are openly deriding what they call "Rubinomics." Gone is any talk of paying off the national debt or leaving untouched the temporary surplus being generated by Social Security, both staples of the Clinton policy.
White House officials say there is nothing to support the primary economic benefit claimed by proponents of fiscal responsibility, that cutting deficits or running surpluses puts downward pressure on interest rates.
"As an economist, I don't buy that there's a link between swings in the budget deficit of the size we see in the United States and interest rates," Mr. Hubbard said. "There's just no evidence."
Indeed, Democrats are having a difficult time invoking the interest-rate argument because rates have declined sharply even as the budget has moved from surplus to deficit in the last two years.
Mr. Hubbard said deficits in the range of $100 billion to $200 billion a year were not economically harmful, especially if there was a commitment to hold spending in check and eventually bring the deficits down. The deficit for the year that ended Sept. 30 was $159 billion. Private analysts said the deficit could well be $200 billion or more for the next several years at least.
The White House formulation -- that economic growth leads to an improved budget situation, not the other way around -- reminds many analysts of the assertions of the so-called supply-siders in the 1980's, when Republicans promised that tax cuts would pay for themselves.
Stanley Collender, managing director of the federal budget consulting group at Fleishman-Hillard, the public relations firm, summed up the administration's fiscal philosophy this way, "Cut taxes because we have a surplus, and cut taxes because we have a deficit."
Democrats agree that running moderate deficits during a downturn is appropriate. But they say the administration is leading the nation down a path of more or less permanent deficits. 
Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the nation would burden future generations with heavy government debt and find it even more difficult to keep Social Security and Medicare afloat as the population ages.
So far, voters do not seem to care. When he asked voters this week to pick among 12 reasons to support Democrats, Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, found that dealing with the budget deficit came in dead last.

How Bad Is It?
In developing his agenda, Mr. Bush has to start by determining how weak the economy is.
Through much of the fall, the administration said it expected the economy to begin bouncing back by the end of this year or early next. But aside from the stock market, which has rallied over the last month, most economic indicators have turned down in recent weeks, leading to renewed concern in the White House.
Most of the ideas the administration has been considering would affect the economy primarily in the long run. Making last year's 10-year tax cut permanent would have little short-term impact, although Republicans on Capitol Hill are considering calling for phased-in personal income tax rate reductions scheduled for 2004 and 2006 to take effect immediately.
The White House has also been weighing steps to help investors, including reducing the taxation of dividends and increasing, to $8,000 from $3,000, the amount of capital losses that can be deducted on individual income tax returns.
For the long run, the policy debate is likely to be dominated by proposals being developed by the administration to add private investment accounts to Social Security and rewrite the tax code.
But the White House seems unlikely to move rapidly on either issue. Social Security, several Republicans with ties to the administration said, is too politically divisive right now for the president to make it a priority, especially if the stock market remains volatile. Bush officials said it would take a long time to build political support for big changes to the tax code, though they left open the possibility of putting some ideas on the table to begin the debate.

The Twiddling Opposition
Mr. Bush's success in pushing his tax cut through Congress last year with bipartisan support has left Democrats deeply divided on economic policy.
Mr. Bush will most likely be able to continue exploiting the internal problems among Democrats just as he did in the campaign. Many moderate Democrats in the Senate who are up for re-election in 2004, like John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, will be hard-pressed to defy the president on taxes and the economy this year, having seen his ability to influence close races in Republican-leaning states like theirs, strategists said.
For now, Democrats seem likely to spend as much time debating one another as taking on Mr. Bush. In reviewing the election results this week, the centrist Democratic Leadership Council warned against simply "moving to the left" and fighting the president at every turn.
Liberals drew the opposite lesson. Democrats, said Robert L. Borosage, co-director of Campaign for America's Future, a liberal advocacy group, need to "fight openly for working families against what will clearly be a flood of special interest, corporate lobby legislation aimed at rolling back environmental protections, larding on corporate welfare and making our tax code even more regressive than it already is."

HEADLINE: Look Beyond City's Fiscal Woes, Mayor Tells a Congregation 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The budget news coming out of City Hall is grim, with city officials debating how much to raise property taxes and how deeply to cut core services. But yesterday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg urged the parishioners of a Brooklyn church to take the long view.
 "The best days for New York are yet to come," Mr. Bloomberg said at the Christian Cultural Center, a giant, predominantly black church in East New York, in a relatively rare appearance at a Sunday morning church service. 
 This week Mr. Bloomberg is set to announce hundreds of millions of dollars in budget cuts to help close a deficit that could be as large as $1 billion this year and $5 billion to $6 billion next year. A hiring freeze will reduce the size of the Police and Fire Departments as veterans retire; more than 100 sanitation workers who worked at the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island are being laid off; and the mayor's aides are asking the City Council to raise property tax rates as much as 25 percent.
But the mayor sounded an upbeat note yesterday about the city's future. He spoke of the possibility of bringing the 2012 Summer Olympics to New York, as well as the 2004 Democratic and Republican National Conventions.
Mr. Bloomberg described the city's fiscal woes as a "short-term economic problem" and said that balancing the budget would require "some painful steps." But he spoke optimistically about the outlook for the city over the next few years. 
"Don't lose sight that longer term, two or three years from now, five years from now, 10 years from now, this city has a better hand to play than any other city in the world," Mr. Bloomberg said to applause.
And Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican who was a Democrat before he ran for office, said he would make personal pitches this week to bring the Democratic and Republican conventions to New York in 2004.
Mr. Bloomberg flew to Washington yesterday to dine with Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and to make the case for holding the party's convention in New York rather than in Boston, Miami or Detroit, the other contenders. Later in the week, Mr. Bloomberg plans to make a similar bid for the Republican convention.
At the church, Mr. Bloomberg spoke enthusiastically about the economic boom that he said the Olympics would bring. The Games, he said, would galvanize the city's tourism industry and create "100,000 man-years of construction projects."
"There are always naysayers who don't want to run any risks and say it would add to the traffic and that sort of thing," he said. "I'll take some extra traffic for two weeks, thank you, to have all of the benefits that the Olympics would bring to us."

HEADLINE: Kelly Seeking Federal Money For City Police 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has undertaken an unusual lobbying campaign in Washington, seeking federal money because the New York Police Department has assigned so many officers to counterterrorism duties. The campaign is part of Commissioner Kelly's effort to prevent the city's fiscal woes from significantly reducing the size of the police force.
 The federal government rarely pays for operating expenses or overtime for municipalities. But aides to Mr. Kelly say he has argued that Washington should bear some of the department's costs because of the number of city officers who have been working since Sept. 11, 2001, to prevent additional attacks. In that way, according to the argument, the officers have been contributing to the national defense, which was previously the sole province of the federal authorities. 
 "We have taken 1,000 police officers -- a huge commitment -- and dedicated them to counterterrorism," one aide said, adding that the department was responsible for protecting Wall Street, the nation's financial capital. "That needs to be reflected. There has to be an appreciation of that."
Mr. Kelly, whose experience in Washington includes a total of four years as an under secretary of the treasury and as the commissioner of the United States Customs Service, has met in recent weeks with Attorney General John Ashcroft, the House majority leader, Dick Armey, and Tom Ridge, the White House director of homeland security. Mr. Kelly has also met with and enlisted the support of New York's two United States senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who are also seeking additional federal money for the city, and has hired a Washington lobbying firm to aid in his effort.
With next year's city budget deficit projected at $5 billion to $6 billion, the Police Department is facing possible cuts that officials have said could lead to the reduction of as many as 4,000 officers. Such cuts could affect the department's ability to fight terrorism and keep crime down. Mr. Kelly hopes to persuade Congress and the Bush administration to carve out about $261 million for his department from the roughly $3.5 billion set aside for local authorities for domestic security counterterrorism.
The $261 million would pay for protection and detection equipment and $40 million in overtime that the department hopes to use for specialized training, the aide said. Mr. Kelly has often said that the overtime money was important because it would enable officers who work together to train as a unit. 
In a recent speech, Mr. Kelly cited a report by former Senators Warren B. Rudman and Gary Hart for the Council on Foreign Relations that calls the looming terrorist threat a national emergency and says the next attack in the United States will probably bring "even greater casualties and widespread destruction to American lives and the economy."
"The federal government has to invest in protecting those areas that the terrorists are likely to try to hit again," Mr. Kelly said in the speech, at a Citizens Crime Commission breakfast. "New York City and Washington, D.C., are the two targets on their list. Period." 
He asked his audience, law enforcement officials and business leaders, to consider pressing the attorney general and the Congressional leaders who oversee the $3.5 billion in domestic security money to create a special fund for the city. "The stakes could not be higher for New York, especially now, with our own severe budget problems," he said.
In the speech, Mr. Kelly said that he recently met with the co-chairmen of the joint Congressional committee overseeing domestic security, Mr. Armey, a Texas Republican, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and that neither was opposed to the idea of special money for New York City and Washington.
Still, Mr. Kelly cautioned that both men had cited Washington's tradition of dividing its limited resources by state or population. He said such a division "simply may be too irresistible to overcome, regardless of the threat to New York."
Mr. Kelly's effort could be complicated by the elections last week, which gave the Republicans control of the Senate, a change that some political analysts believe will reduce the influence of New York and the rest of the Northeast in Washington.
In the past, New York City police commissioners faced with budget problems have lobbied City Council members and warned about the potential impact of a shrinking department on crime rates.
Though commissioners in years past have sought federal help to pay for individual programs, Mr. Kelly's request is unusual in that he is asking Washington to pay for overtime designated for a specific purpose: counterterrorism. The 1994 crime bill provided money for the hiring of 100,000 police officers nationwide, including thousands in New York, for a more general purpose: to help fight growing street crime.
Citing the 1994 bill, Michael P. Jacobson, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice who has headed the city's Departments of Correction and Probation, called Mr. Kelly's approach creative. Noting that the legislation opened the door to financing local police with federal dollars, Professor Jacobson said, "If they'll pay for cops to find out who did a street robbery, why won't they pay for cops to find out who wants to attack us or the federal building?"

HEADLINE: Good Health Is Linked To Grocer 

BYLINE:  By MARY DUENWALD 

 BODY:
In many American neighborhoods, poor eating habits may stem from a lack of access to fresh, nutritious food, new research suggests.
 The more supermarkets a neighborhood has, the more fruits and vegetables its residents eat, according to a study from the University of North Carolina. 
 The effect was found to be especially strong in predominantly black neighborhoods, where produce consumption rose by 32 percent for each additional supermarket. In mainly white neighborhoods, the comparable increase was 11 percent. 
The presence of at least one supermarket in a black neighborhood was also associated with a 25 percent increase in the number of residents who limited the amount of fat in their diets, as compared with people in neighborhoods with no supermarket. In white neighborhoods with one supermarket, 10 percent more of the residents watched their fat intake. 
Only 8 percent of the black participants in the study lived in neighborhoods with at least one supermarket, while 31 percent of the white participants did. The largely white neighborhoods had, on average, five times as many supermarkets as the black neighborhoods, the researchers found.
"There is an assumption that we all have access to healthy foods, and that when people aren't eating healthy, it's because they choose not to," said Dr. Kimberly Morland, an epidemiologist and lead researcher on the study, who is now at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. "But this demonstrates that the availability of food varies between neighborhoods, and it's related to the affluence and the race of the neighborhood."
Most of the black neighborhoods in the study did have small groceries, but these were not associated with beneficial nutritional practices. Supermarkets, the researchers noted, are more likely to offer a wide selection of food at affordable prices.
The findings confirm what people in black communities have long observed, said Dr. Maya Rockeymoore, a public health scholar at the National Urban League Institute for Opportunity and Equality in Washington.
"In some neighborhoods, it's easier to get an artery-clogging piece of fried chicken than it is to get a fresh apple," Dr. Rockeymoore said. "Many urban community dwellers would love to have better eating habits, but if there's no grocery store nearby, you're talking about getting on public transportation with a grocery cart."
Dr. Rockeymoore said the problem might partly explain why rates of heart disease, stroke and diabetes were high in many black neighborhoods.
Medical research has shown that eating plenty of fruits and vegetables can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke and help prevent bone loss. Diets high in fat have been linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. "Very few illnesses have not shown some association with dietary practice," Dr. Morland said.
Her study was based on data that was originally gathered during the mid-1990's to study the risk of atherosclerosis in various communities. More than 10,000 adults in four states had been asked to answer questions about what they ate each day. The predominantly black neighborhoods studied were in and around Winston-Salem, N.C., and in Jackson, Miss. The mainly white neighborhoods were in Washington County, Md., and suburban Minneapolis. 
Dr. Morland correlated the nutritional reports with records from local health departments and state agriculture departments showing the locations of supermarkets.
The researchers noted that whites in their study had three times the access to cars as blacks had, and speculated that this might explain why nearby supermarkets made a greater difference among blacks.
But transportation is probably not the only explanation, said Dr. Steven B. Wing, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, a co-author of the study. "If you either don't have transportation, or you work long hours because of your economic situation, or you feel that when you go to a store in a white neighborhood, you are under surveillance, it's not going to be as easy for you to have access to good food at affordable prices," he said.

HEADLINE: Fixing Aneurysms Without Surgery 

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
In treating hemorrhaging cerebral aneurysms -- burst blood vessels in the brain -- there are two camps: the clippers and the coilers.
 A recent study in The Lancet, a London-based medical publication, has come out strongly in favor of coiling, a nonsurgical method far more popular in Europe than it is in the United States. 
 A medical trial was stopped on ethical grounds when it became clear that a year after treatment 31 percent of the surgical patients were disabled or dead compared with 24 percent of the "coiled" patients.
Since aneurysms often kill and disable young or middle-aged people, neurosurgeons want longer studies to see if coiling lasts as long as clipping does. But these preliminary results, brain specialists say, could still lead to a revolution in the way aneurysms are treated here. 
The study's most important conclusion, doctors agreed, is that all American aneurysm patients should have what 75 percent of them now do not: the choice.
The Lancet study "will open the market for coiling," said Dr. J. P. Mohr, a professor of neurology at Columbia University and director of the Tananbaum Stroke Center there, who was not involved in the research.
It "doesn't answer every question" but puts coiling "very much on the map," agreed Dr. John R. Marler, associate director for clinical trials at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
The technique was invented in the United States but did not prosper as it did in Europe because of concerns over long-term outcomes, but also, some doctors say, because of tradition and rivalries over fees.
Cerebral aneurysms do not kill as many people as strokes or heart attacks do, but they are spectacularly fatal: 15 percent of all victims die in minutes, and half are dead in a month.
"It's a very, very bad thing to have happen to you," Dr. Kieran Murphy of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, one of the participants in the Lancet study, said with gentle understatement.
Of the survivors, half are neurologically devastated. Some cannot feed themselves, some suffer seizures, slurred speech or personality changes. The luckiest return to normal with only a few missing memories. All live in dread of a "rebleed."
Brain aneurysms are more common than many realize. About 1 American in every 15, it is estimated, is living with one right now. About 30,000 of them will burst this year. 
For 30 years, clipping has been the standard treatment: a neurosurgeon saws off a segment of skull, pushes gently through the brain to the bleeding site and places a clamp -- "like a tie clip," Dr. Murphy said -- on the section of arterial wall that has weakened and ballooned out.
Coiling is the newcomer. Using computer-aided X-ray scanners, a radiologist threads a very thin catheter up from the patient's groin through the neck and along the narrowing, fragile alleys of the brain until it reaches the aneurysm. Twisting it carefully, he pokes its snout into the aneurysm itself and then slips down it fine platinum coils, like tiny Slinkies about twice the thickness of a human hair.
As smaller and smaller coils are fed in, they form a mesh rather like a Brillo pad. Blood clots on it, and the mass blocks off the neck of the aneurysm.
Recovery time is faster, with less chance of dangerous infections or seizures, doctors agree. Versions of the coiling idea, including rubbery pellets and wire "Christmas trees," have been around for over 20 years, Dr. Mohr said. But the crucial advance was a coil that detached from the catheter when a small current was sent down the wire.
Dr. Mohr compared the dispute over coils to that over the use of wire mesh stents in clogged arteries to prevent heart attacks.
"When stenting was first considered for coronaries, everybody thought it was crazy," he said. "Now there are two alternatives. If stenting fails, you have to do a bypass."
The new coil was invented in 1990 by Dr. Guido Guglielmi, a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist and electronics expert then working at the University of California at Los Angeles. It is produced by the Boston Scientific Corporation of Natick, Mass., which says it paid nothing toward the Lancet study. The Medical Research Council, the British equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration, financed the study.
Coiling is used on 75 percent of aneurysms in Europe, Dr. Murphy said, compared with about 25 percent in the United States.
Brain specialists and Boston Scientific executives interviewed cited several reasons.
In Europe, most aneurysm patients are taken to large regional hospitals where specialists in both procedures work in teams. By contrast, about 75 percent of all Americans with the crisis symptoms that turn out to be burst aneurysms go to local hospitals.
Most of America's 3,000 hospitals have only one or two neurosurgeons on staff, who also handle brain tumors, gunshots and car accidents. Unless patients are referred to larger hospitals, numbering about 300, where coiling is offered, they will not be seen by doctors who know the procedure.
That does not bode well for patients, all the doctors interviewed agreed. Studies show that aneurysm patients fare much better in hospitals that treat more than 20 aneurysms a year and have "neurocritical care" nurses.
Still, some cannot be coiled. The springs will not hold in them if the aneurysms have wide necks, Dr. Murphy said.
The Lancet study involved 43 hospitals in Europe, Australia and Canada; Johns Hopkins was the only American one. Of the 9,559 aneurysm patients assessed, 7,416 were candidates for only clipping or only coiling or refused to participate; with the rest, a computer randomly assigned 1,073 to coiling and 1,070 to clipping.
Karen Cook, a former virology researcher in Aldbourne, England, became part of the study after she collapsed in an antique store in 1999. Her memories of the next few days are hazy, but she remembers the trial being explained "in one of my lucid moments."
She agreed, was assigned to coiling and was relieved. "I didn't fancy the can-opener job on my head," she said. "The idea of somebody digging around in my brain didn't fill me with joy."
Her only side effects were "a spectacular 2-foot by 2-foot bruise" where the catheter went in and a month of headaches.
Three years later, "I'm doing very well," she said. "I don't think anybody else would notice anything different. There are some holes in my short-term memory. I can't do mental arithmetic as I once could, and I can't get through the day without a sleep. But I get no headaches at all now. I'm back at work, though not as many hours as I used to. And I drive a car."
When she goes back for annual angiograms, she can see the coils. "You know the little springs you get out of clothes pegs? Like that," she explained.
Some American neurosurgeons are unhappy with aspects of the study.
Dr. Robert E. Harbaugh, director of cerebrovascular surgery at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire, agreed that the seven percentage point difference in good outcomes after one year was significant, but he said he wanted to see longer studies to prove that coiling would prevent rebleeding over the long run.
"You need to use what's safer over a lifetime, not safer over one year," he said, while agreeing that the study was "a historical piece of work" and that "both options should be available" to all patients.
Dr. Richard Kerr, a neurosurgeon at the Radcliffe Infirmary of Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Lancet study, agreed that follow-up was needed. But he said that "tens of thousands of patients have been treated with this around the world, and the rebleed rate is not that great."
"I'm a surgeon," he added, "but I'm very conscious that the results of surgery are not as good as they ought to be. That's why I've embraced this. Maybe there is a better way."
Dr. Harbaugh also said he was worried that some doctors in the Lancet study had more experience than others, a fact that could skew results.
American surgeons, Dr. Kerr said, want a trial that will compare America's best brain surgeons to its best endovascular radiologists.
"But there's no point," he said. "That's not what's available to Joe Public." 
Dr. Mohr did complain that the Lancet trial had a "striking omission" in that it did not say how many procedures themselves caused ruptures.
Dr. Guglielmi, reached in Rome, said there were two reasons his coil met more resistance in the United States than in Europe. First, the best-trained American neurosurgeons have relatively high success rates and so have great confidence in their skills.
And second, he said: "In Europe, a doctor has a monthly salary regardless of the procedures he does. But in America, if the neurosurgeon doesn't clip an aneurysm, he doesn't get the money. Economics could be a factor."
Dr. Marc Mayberg, chairman of neurosurgery at the Cleveland Clinic, agreed that rivalries over fees between surgeons and radiologists hurt patients.
"The kind of departmental structure set up 50-plus years ago needs to change," he said. "The bottom line is that a patient needs to be evaluated in an unbiased manner by a team."
The Lancet study "opens the door to both technologies," Dr. Mayberg said.
The wave of the future may be neurosurgeons who can also coil; Dr. Mayberg has two such surgeons on his team, and he estimated that another 15 to 20 American surgeons learned coiling each year.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "Threading Wire Into Fragile Arteries"A new study has endorsed a method of filling aneurysms with tiny coiled wire, causing blood to clot before the vessel ruptures. The technique only works on aneurysms with narrow necks where the coils can collect in a basketlike mass. A small flexible tube called a microcatheter is threaded through the body from an opening in the groin (right). Guided by X-ray imaging, it arrives at the brain aneurysm. Small platinum coils are pushed into the aneurysm through the microcatheter. Passing the wire structure into the aneurysm continues until is fully packed with coils, obstructing the flow of blood. An electrical charge at the coiled wires end detaches it; the microcatheter is withdrawn. Blood clots around the coils, stopping the aneurysm from bursting. The coiled wire resembles a tightly packed Slinky in miniature, about double the width of a human hair. The coils form omega-shaped loops. (Source: Boston Scientific Corp.)

HEADLINE: Out of Control, Deer Send Ecosystem Into Chaos 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: FRONT ROYAL, Va. 

 BODY:
In Posey Hollow, tucked into the Blue Ridge Mountains, Dr. William J. McShea was inspecting a forest primeval -- 10 acres of oaks, wild yam vines, seedlings and shrubs that made an ideal home for nesting songbirds and scurrying small mammals.
 But he had to look through an eight-foot deer fence to see it. Where he stood, the forest was trimmed from eye level to earth as if by an army of obsessive landscapers. Mature trees stood unharmed, but oak seedlings were nipped in the bud. The only things thriving were Japanese barberry and other nonnative flora, plants that deer cannot digest. 
 In the last decade, from the Rockies to New England and the Deep South, rural and suburban areas have been beset by white-tailed deer gnawing shrubbery and crops, spreading disease and causing hundreds of thousands of auto wrecks. 
But the deer problem has proved even more profound, biologists say. Fast-multiplying herds are altering the ecology of forests, stripping them of native vegetation and eliminating niches for other wildlife. 
Varmints of old were mainly predators, Dr. McShea said, but this is the age of the marauding herbivore.
"I don't want to paint deer as Eastern devils," said Dr. McShea, a wildlife biologist associated with the National Zoo in Washington, "but this is indicative of what happens when an ecosystem is out of whack." The damage is worse than anyone expected, he and other scientists say.
In the West, mule deer and blacktailed deer sometimes cause problems, but it is mainly in the more densely suburbanized East and Midwest where whitetails are causing the most trouble for people and ecosystems.
Research like that under way here, where several deer-free plots have been studied for more than a decade, has shown how deer can profoundly change forests.
In Wisconsin, deer have prevented restoration of native white cedar, whose seedlings they eagerly seek out. In Minnesota, hemlocks are nibbled away before they can grow. Near New Haven, one biologist has found foot-high cedars that turned out to be 12 years old but were as stunted as a carefully pruned bonsai.
The damage "drives me to my knees," said Dr. Gary L. Alt, a wildlife biologist and lifelong hunter on the Pennsylvania Game Commission. "We've got to balance deer with habitat," Dr. Alt said. "If we don't, everything will be lost. The deer population will not be healthy and scores of other species will suffer."
Except in a few favorable situations, sharpshooting, trapping, birth-control darts, repellents and other tactics are not having a big impact, he and other experts say. 
Expanded hunting, considered by many experts to be the best hope of controlling numbers, has its limits as well. For example, most hunters, and most states' hunting regulations, still favor shooting bucks, even though the best way to control populations is to kill females. 
Some states are changing regulations in ways that could cut deer numbers, but hunters are resisting. Others are expanding seasons and the number of deer a hunter can kill, but federal wildlife officials note that hunters are a graying population, with fewer each year to make a dent. In any case, controlled hunts staged in suburbs often run up against strident opposition from animal welfare groups.
Faced with ever-rising deer numbers and few solutions, some biologists are advising people to focus more on changing their own behavior and attitudes than on hoping for a sudden answer to the deer problem.
"People should finally get used to having deer around and adjust to that," said Dr. Allen T. Rutberg, a senior research scientist with the Humane Society of the United States and a professor at the Tufts University veterinary school. "They're going to be a fact of life, like drought and storms." 

Drawn to the Suburbs
People long ago wiped out the wolves and other predators that kept deer populations in check. Then suburbanization created a browser's paradise: a vast patchwork of well-watered, fertilizer-fattened plantings to feed on and vest-pocket forests to hide in, with hunters banished to more distant woods.
"Deer are an edge species," Dr. McShea said, "and the world is one big edge now."
Deer pose problems because they are both loved and loathed -- Bambi to children and Godzilla to gardeners.
Web sites devoted to deer are as diverse as whitetailsunlimited.org and deer-off.com. 
Deer generate more than $10 billion a year in revenue related to wildlife watching and hunting, federal wildlife officials say. But they spread Lyme disease and livestock ailments. They are struck by cars, trucks and motorcycles more than a million times a year, with the accidents killing more than 100 people annually and causing more than $1 billion in damage. 
The human toll makes deer deadlier than sharks, alligators, bears and rattlesnakes combined.
They also devour plantings, saplings and crops, causing nearly $1 billion in farm, garden and timber damage, federal officials say. One deer can consume a ton and a half of greenery a year.
Estimates range widely, but there were probably at least 20 million whitetails across a wide swath of North America several centuries ago. Even Thomas Jefferson had to defend his Monticello vegetable gardens with a 10-foot-tall planked fence. 
Then came an era of unbridled hunting for commercial venison sales and the widespread displacement of forests by farms, and by the 20th-century, deer were nearly eliminated from every corner of their range. So, prompted by pleas from hunters, state officials worked hard to restore deer. For example, the deer now clearing brush in Posey Hollow descend from stock trucked to Virginia decades ago from Arkansas.
Such efforts have succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. The national whitetail population has risen from a low of about 500,000 in 1900 to something like the 20 million of Jefferson's time. 
But they are concentrated in smaller patches of habitat, scientists say. Generally, biologists say, when deer exceed 15 to 20 per square mile, ecosystems begin to degrade, and today deer number in the hundreds per square mile in some places. 

Thinning the Herd
In a few places, the animals are relatively easy to kill, deport or sterilize. But these methods have significant limitations. 
Contraception, promoted for years by the Humane Society and other animal welfare groups, has effectively reduced some deer populations in places like Fire Island in New York, but usually only where wildlife biologists have permission to go into every backyard to dart all the does in a particular population. Female deer rarely wander far from where they were born, so they are relatively easy to find.
Elsewhere, though, any undarted does are quickly able to rebuild herds. Also, the current contraceptive vaccine must be readministered every year, but each year the darted does become a bit more wary and elusive, experts say.
Sharpshooting by professional marksmen or trained police officers has worked in parts of Princeton, Cleveland, Philadelphia and other communities that accept lethal controls. But in Princeton, the rifle-toting biologists doing the culling could not shoot animals in the most densely populated neighborhoods, so they had to resort to capturing dozens with nets and killing them with a device similar to the gunlike bolts used to slaughter cattle in stockyards. 
Biologists have found that trapping deer this way greatly increases their stress compared with a bullet to the brain, and animal welfare groups have aggressively protested the method.

Defending Plants
The deficiencies of these strategies have left homeowners and landscapers struggling to keep deer away from their plantings, which are prime deer fodder because they are fattened with ample fertilizer and water.
In wealthy neighborhoods north of New York City or around Washington, it is not uncommon to see high black-mesh fences enclosing entire estates. 
Gardeners have tried an array of repellents, containing rotten-egg essence, hot pepper extracts and even lion excrement. They usually work for a while but need to be replenished frequently. 
In some areas beset by deer, gardeners and landscape designers are being encouraged to move from defending lush plantings to changing what they plant, in hopes of discouraging hungry deer.
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven recently published a survey listing dozens of flower and shrub varieties that gardeners in the state found were least likely to be eaten by deer. By switching from sunflowers, tulips and roses to butterfly bush, marigolds, poppies and lavender, gardeners can maintain attractive yards without attracting deer, the study's author, Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward, said.
But biologists and gardeners have learned that if deer are hungry enough they will eat any plant. 
A new type of fencing made by a Canadian company, ElectroBraid, creates a psychological barrier to deer by shocking them as they nudge forward with their delicate noses. For the moment, it is only practical in places like airfields, where deer have been struck by more than 500 aircraft over the last decade, including fighter jets and Boeing 737's, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
In many communities, new policies aimed at changing human behavior around deer have met with resistance. For example, in many communities ravaged by azalea-munching deer some homeowners still cannot resist putting out 50-pound sacks of corn to attract the graceful creatures. Many suburbs, including Princeton and Lakeway, Tex., have banned the practice, but some deer lovers unabashedly continue to feed. 
"I feed them when I want to feed them," said Judy Samouce of Lakeway, a fast-growing Austin suburb, tucked on the edge of the deer-thick Edwards Plateau. The deer were what attracted her to the area.
There is some progress in places. The death toll on roads and highways in Princeton has dropped sharply since culling began there two years ago. Accidents have also been reduced in Lakeway, which trapped more than 1,400 deer over the last several years and deported them to ranches in northern Mexico, where officials were eager to restore deer populations.
This year, though, Lakeway officials say they are running out of ranches willing to take deer.

Changing Hunters' Habits
In most places around the country, many wildlife experts say, the biggest effect on deer populations will probably come through changing hunting practices.
The Sand County Foundation, a Wisconsin land conservation group, has a decade-old program allowing hunters to kill deer on preserve and private lands, as long as they shoot a doe or two before taking a buck.
"The whitetail deer is a lovely, engaging animal, and it thrills me to see them, even now when they're causing so much trouble," said Dr. Brent M. Haglund, the president of the foundation. But now that numbers are so excessive, balance must be restored, Dr. Haglund said, and the only realistic way to do that is for hunters to replace the country's long-vanished predators.
The cost of doing nothing has risen too far, he said. "Deer collisions are killing people," he said. "That to me is the most legitimate reason to look for sound, sustainable ways to reduce deer density."
In Pennsylvania, where exploding deer populations have erased tree seedlings and trillium and other wildflowers from many forests, game officials have begun reshaping hunting regulations, less to suit the desires of hunters for ever-bigger herds and more to suit the needs of ailing ecosystems.
The main changes are designed to encourage the shooting of does instead of bucks. This initially rankled many hunters.
Dr. Alt, on the Pennsylvania Game Commission, said he used to think his biggest on-the-job hazard was crawling into a den to study hibernating bears. But when he joined the commission three years ago, he said, he was heckled and hounded at crammed public meetings where angry hunters attacked his ecological approach to deer. 
Attitudes have started to change, he said. Expanded seasons for antlerless deer, most of them female, are becoming popular and are expected gradually to reverse the proportions of killed male and female deer. Eventually that should stabilize the herds.
But the slow spread of chronic wasting disease, a brain infection of deer and elk similar to mad cow disease, may impede efforts to use hunters to manage deer.
In Wisconsin, where the disease most recently appeared, applications for hunting licenses have dropped 25 percent to 30 percent this year, said Peter J. Gerl, the executive director of Whitetails Unlimited, a national private hunting group based there.
Officials say there is no evidence that the disease can cross to humans. But some have advised people to avoid meat from deer taken in areas where the disease has been found and to use caution in butchering their animals, avoiding contact with brain or other tissues that could hold the viruslike protein particles that cause the illness.
This fall, hunters have been helping Wisconsin officials kill 25,000 or more deer in the zone where about 3 percent of a sample of deer tested positive for the infection. But in the long run, the outbreak could discourage hunting in the state, harming the economy and increasing deer numbers. 

Experimental Efforts
Ultimately, even many deer lovers say, more hard-nosed intervention, either aimed at stopping reproduction or increasing mortality, will be needed. 
One possibility is an experimental single-shot vaccine that could cause does to stop producing eggs for years, eliminating the need for annual darting. State biologists in Connecticut are trying a new approach, trapping dominant males and using chemical injections to sterilize them. Their hope is that these bucks continue to shield harems of does from competitors in the fall mating season without being able to inseminate the females themselves.
But these approaches will require years of testing.
Dr. McShea is experimenting on his Front Royal plots with an all-of-the-above blend of sharpshooting to cut herd size and contraceptives to keep herds under control.
If it works, he said, he may one day be able to leave behind 14 years of work on an overabundant mammal and return full time to the research that was his focus when he became a biologist: saving rare ones.

(Allen Rutberg); STRIP GRAZING -- When overabundant, deer can ravage wildflowers. Outside Pittsburgh, scientists in 1996 fenced off part of a forest carpeted with trillium and other wildflowers. The protected beds blossom readily, while unshielded plants are eaten nearly to the roots.; GRISLY ENCOUNTERS -- More than a million vehicles collide with deer each year, causing more than 100 human deaths and more than $1 billion in repair costs. Accidents peak in the fall, during hunting and mating season. Here a car strikes a deer along Highway 93 near Lakeside, Mont., moments after the photographer pulled over to take the animal's portrait. (Photographs by Dr. T. Knight); (Associated Press) Chart/Map: "More Deer, More Drivers, More Collisions"It is not known exactly how many deer are on the loose in the wild. But their encounters with automobiles may offer a clue. In Connecticut, the number of drivers who reported hitting a deer rose 297 percent in five years. Map of Connecticut shows the location where drivers reported hitting a deer for 1995 and 2000, in comparison.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Journal Lays Off 23 Employees 

 BODY:
The Wall Street Journal, the flagship newspaper of Dow Jones & Company, laid off 23 news employees yesterday, in part by eliminating one cluster of eight reporters and editors assigned to legal affairs and a second cluster of four that dealt with regional economic news.
 The other 11 layoffs were scattered throughout the news operation. 
Eight news employees also took buyouts, for a total loss of 31, or 5 percent of the news staff of The Journal's domestic edition. 
 In addition, 3 of the 48 jobs in the paper's editorial department will be cut.
The layoffs are scheduled to take effect at the end of December. They are part of 230 announced last week by Dow Jones, the second round of job cuts this year. Since 2000, Dow Jones has laid off 1,119 employees.
The fate of the legal reporting group came as a surprise to newsroom employees because of the heavy amount of news on corporate crime in recent months.
The advertising recession has hit The Journal, with a circulation of 1.8 million, harder than most major newspapers. Financial services and technology advertising, core elements of its advertising portfolio, have declined more sharply than almost any other advertising category. The volume of advertising in The Journal in September was less than three-quarters of what it had been in September 1998.
Shares of Dow Jones fell 39 cents, to $36.58.

HEADLINE: One Subsidy Too Many 

 BODY:
Americans are depleting their water supplies, especially their once-vast underground aquifers, at a rapid pace. Yet this alarming fact has failed to register with influential segments of the population, including developers who keep building unsustainable subdivisions and farmers who keep growing unsustainable crops. A case in point are the rice growers of Arkansas, who are on the brink of pumping one of the state's biggest aquifers dry and are now imploring the federal government to bail them out. 
 Together with the state and the Army Corps of Engineers, the farmers are supporting a $300 million project that would tap the White River to replace irrigation water from the Alluvial Aquifer, which has declined to perilously low levels. The project -- costing about $300,000 per farmer -- would divert river water to 1,000 farmers on 250,000 acres, representing about 5 percent of the country's rice production. 
 The White River ecosystem, which includes two important wildlife refuges, will inevitably suffer. What's most irritating about the scheme, however, is that it further enriches an industry that is already extravagantly subsidized. Under the federal crop support program -- itself a wasteful exercise -- rice growers receive guarantees of $3.10 per bushel for their crops, more than double the $1.40 market price. One perverse result has been a huge increase in acreage devoted to rice farming even as market prices have hit a 15-year low.
The Corps of Engineers insists that the project is essential to the survival of the regional farm economy, and claims it will divert only 2 percent of river flows to irrigation. Wisely, however, President Bush's Office of Management and Budget, which has grown increasingly skeptical of the Corps's projections, has so far refused to spend $45 million that Congress has allocated. It should keep on refusing. Other alternatives -- like using federal money to take farms out of production, encouraging farmers to switch to less water-intensive crops, or underwriting more efficient uses of existing water -- have not been fully explored. Beyond that, allowing this project to proceed would invite the misuse of scarce water resources elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Credit for the World's Poorest 

 BODY:
For someone living on a dollar a day, a loan of a few hundred dollars -- to buy a sewing machine, a refrigerator or a bicycle -- can mean the difference between destitution and a productive life. That was the premise behind Bangladesh's successful Grameen Bank, established 25 years ago, and the global microfinancing movement it helped spawn.
 Modest loans to the world's poorest so they can invest in enterprises close to home have proved a winning development strategy, an effort decidedly short on success stories. If done properly, microfinancing can also be good business. The 30 million or so "micro-borrowers" in countries like Bangladesh, India, Colombia and Indonesia have proved more diligent about meeting their loan obligations than most commercial banking clients anywhere. 
 This is one reason "real" banks are starting to get involved, and the reason an increasing number of governments and international organizations have realized that microfinancing provides a worthy form of renewable development capital. Instead of traditional collateral, the guarantee that these loans will get repaid is often a community-wide commitment, or a neglected individual's deep appreciation for being offered an unexpected chance.
The most effective programs lend to women clients, with the added benefit of bolstering their independence and strengthening their role in society. Expect microfinancing to play an important role in helping to reconstruct Afghanistan, and in bringing its women back into economic life.
As these programs come increasingly into vogue, however, they should not become victims of their own success. Governments would do well to heed the advice of respected pioneers in the field like Women's World Banking, which worries that microcredit will become so commercialized that it becomes keyed to better-off borrowers. Nor should microcredit programs be overrun by politically motivated government handouts. 
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is scheduled to address a microcredit conference in New York this week. Mr. O'Neill has shown a willingness to think creatively about foreign aid. He should see to it that the administration steps up its support of microfinancing organizations as part of its broader move to increase development spending that can be shown to be effective.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Cincinnati; 
Queen City Holds Its Own In the Economic Downturn

BYLINE:  By AMY ZIPKIN 

 BODY:
Cincinnati, home to such old-economy stalwarts as Procter & Gamble, Federated Department Stores and Kroger, is a major port city and transportation center for a large swath of southern Ohio and northern Kentucky. To the northeast is the so-called Mason Corridor, along Route 1-71 and south of Route I-275. Its concentration of light manufacturing plants and service companies is a common business destination.
 The city is holding its own during the economic downturn with an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent, compared with 5.7 percent nationally. South of the Ohio River, Kentucky is benefiting from a recent $44 million call center expansion by Citibank in Florence and a $46 million expansion of operations in Covington by Fidelity Investments. And the Economics Center of the University of Cincinnati says the $3 billion riverfront revitalization project (on both the Cincinnati and Newport, Ky., sides of the Ohio River), begun in 1993 and scheduled to be completed in 2008, should bolster the economy. 
 With a conservatory, opera and symphony orchestra, the Queen City is a cultural oasis. But, racial tensions are high, and major crimes were up in the first half of the year.

THE AIRPORT
The Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport (situated in Kentucky) is a Delta hub. That means frequent flights at generally higher fares than at nearby airports, according to Henry Harteveldt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in San Francisco. As a result, there's a lot of comparison shopping for last-minute tickets.
John J. McCoy, a partner in the law firm of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister, recently paid $1,600 for a round trip to La Guardia in New York, twice what he would have paid to fly from Dayton, 45 minutes away, he said. (From Cincinnati's north side, the distance to either airport is the same.)
Louisville International Airport in Kentucky and Indianapolis International Airport also draw budget-minded travelers lured by discount carriers like Southwest, despite the extra time required to get there.
At the Cincinnati airport, the lines move pretty freely after 9 a.m., but expect waits of up to an hour or longer before then. After her son missed an early-morning flight on a Monday in June because of a jam-up at the security checkpoint, Jill McBride, a local marketing consultant, was told by Delta personnel to avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons.
Rick Barlow, a local film producer, gives the Cincinnati airport an A for its efficient handling of large volumes of people at peak times. But he bemoans the lack of a sit-down restaurant. The airport's business center gets both a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down. Business travelers say it has plenty of space, but the TV volume is sometimes too high.

HOTELS
While hotels on the Kentucky side offer skyline and riverfront views, many visitors prefer to be near corporate headquarters downtown. The HILTON NETHERLAND PLAZA HOTEL (513-421-9100, $99 to $199), built during the Depression, is a fine example of Art Deco architecture, with murals on ceilings and walls. Room sizes vary, but all have high-speed Internet access and two phones.
GARFIELD SUITES HOTEL (513-421-3355, $109 to $199), a short stroll to Kroger or Federated, has kitchens in every suite and an on-site deli. The CINCINNATIAN (513-381-3000, $225 to $260), a small European-style hotel, features oversize Roman tubs and is the place to go for celebrity watchers -- Pete Sampras was sighted recently. Mr. McCoy says guests also like its intimate lobby and reliable service. Guests with more conventional tastes give high marks to the WESTIN (513-621-7700, $209 to $285).

RESTAURANTS
MAISONETTE (513-721-2260, $200 for dinner for two, including wine and tip), which at 38 consecutive years holds Mobil's longevity record for a five-star restaurant, displays the artwork of American Impressionists like Frank Duveneck. Fall selections include a beef tenderloin with forestiere sauce and an Amish chicken breast with lemon marmalade.
Maisonette's former chef, John-Robert de Cavel, is challenging its culinary supremacy, however. He opened JOHN-ROBERT AT PIGALL'S (513-721-1345, $200) in late August. "Everybody loved what they had and loved what everybody else had," said Ms. McBride, who chose sauteed skate wing but sampled the rack of lamb and sauteed halibut.
JEFF RUBY'S (513-784-1200, $150) says it is the only steakhouse in the Midwest with a glass-enclosed dry-aging room.
MONTGOMERY INN AT THE BOATHOUSE (513-721-7427, $60) is known for its ribs and sweeping river views.

ENTERTAINMENT
Recently reopened, the BLUE WISP (513-241-9477) is considered the city's premier jazz club. The resident Blue Wisp Big Band holds sway on Wednesdays. The CINCINNATI ART MUSEUM in Eden Park (513-639-2995) houses masterpieces by Monet, Picasso and van Gogh. The SHADOW BOX CABARET (859-581-7625), a quick drive across the river in Newport, features rock 'n' roll and off-color comedy shows, while the AQUARIUM at Newport (859-261-7444) has six walking tunnels for contemplating aquatic life.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Shares Fall on Iraq Worries In Light Holiday Trading

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Escalating concerns about a war with Iraq dominated Wall Street yesterday, sending stocks sliding in trading that was light because of Veterans Day. 
 Analysts said the declines were not surprising given the market's strong October rally; with the better-than-expected earnings season, profit taking is still under way. 
 Investors are also shying away from commitments to stocks as they focus on the possibility of American troops fighting in Iraq. 
"If you look at investor sentiment, we've switched to more complacency; also, you now have Iraq taking center stage," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company. "That uncertainty is causing hesitation for investors." 
"I think we'll have a very choppy environment in the near term," Mr. Goldman said. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 178.18 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 8,358.95. The drop gave the blue chips their first three-day decline in five weeks, with a loss of 412 points.
The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq index dropped 40.09 points, or 3 percent, to 1,319.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 18.55 points, or 2.1 percent, to 876.19.
The bond market, which was closed yesterday for Veterans Day, will reopen this morning.
Senior administration officials said President Bush had approved tentative Pentagon plans involving up to 250,000 troops invading Iraq should a new United Nations effort at arms inspection fail. 
That comes after the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Friday demanding that Saddam Hussein eliminate weapons of mass destruction and open up arms sites to inspectors. Iraq has until Friday to accept the terms. 
"Ideally, I think people would like to see Saddam and his cabinet say, 'Come on in,' " said Charles White, portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. "Realistically, investors are wanting to see, if Iraq refuses, a quick and decisive action, one in which there is a coalition of countries that endorse the action and not the U.S. and Britain acting bilaterally to do this. 
"The market should not, absent any real material change in the fundamentals, make much headway in one direction or another," Mr. White added. "But we're one geopolitical headline away from seeing the market up for sale again." 
There was no economic news and few corporate developments yesterday to distract traders. The light holiday trading also tended to exaggerate price swings. 
Investors have been more upbeat after five consecutive weeks of Dow gains on better-than-expected earnings. But analysts say the market remains vulnerable to profit taking. 
In addition, some investors are nervous that the Federal Reserve's larger-than-expected half-point cut in interest rates signaled an unusually fragile economy, leading to selloffs last week that snapped the four-week winning streaks of the Nasdaq and the S.& P. 500. 
Decliners included Hewlett-Packard, which dropped $1.83, to $14.85, after its president, Michael D. Capellas, quit. The move comes after reports that he was a front-runner to become chief executive of WorldCom, the telecommunications company trying to reorganize under backruptcy protection. 
Oracle, the technology company, fell 50 cents, to $9.05, after Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock from buy to hold. 
Dianon Systems, the diagnostic service provider, rose $6.45, to $46.64, after the Laboratory Corporation said it would acquire the company for about $598 million in cash. Laboratory fell $1.20, to $22.75. 
OfficeMax gained 31 cents, to $5.60, after the retailer reported third-quarter profits that beat Wall Street's estimates by a penny.

Bugle Call For 11/11: 'Charge It!'

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
ON yet another Veterans Day, with yet another war on the horizon, many New Yorkers did their best yesterday to heed their leaders' appeals to patriotism.
 They shopped. 
 It used to be a dreary cliche, this idea that our revered days of remembrance have been turned into opportunities to keep store aisles crowded. But since the terrorists struck last year, shopping has been elevated to a patriotic act, the command from our political leaders being to go on with life as if nothing happened, for otherwise you-know-who will have won.
Some Americans have gone overboard, a distortion best summed up in two words: Winona Ryder. But in more restrained, and certainly more legal, fashion, New Yorkers responded to the call. 
There they were yesterday with their charge cards, taking advantage of the sales that are as much a part of Veterans Day as flag-waving. Indeed, the flag doesn't seem quite the hot item that it was in the city a year ago. Not that it has disappeared. Far from it. But it doesn't enjoy the cachet that it did. Perhaps an old friend was on to something when she observed soon after Sept. 11, 2001, that "the American flag is this year's pashmina."
Sadly, one important purpose that flags now serve is to cover the coffins of World War II veterans, who are yielding to the inevitable at an ever-faster rate. They have been dubbed the Greatest Generation because of the sacrifices they shouldered, for the most part without expectations of homage that is only now being offered, from "Saving Private Ryan" to the memorial under construction in Washington.
That generation's endurance underscores how little our national leaders ask of us today even as they talk of war. In this spending-equals-patriotism climate, they have not encouraged true sacrifice, no matter how simple. Turn off unneeded lights? Or turn down the thermostat? Or leave those massive gas guzzlers in the garage? Or do anything else to reduce America's oil dependence on the country that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11? Not a chance.
If anything, we seem headed in the opposite direction. It is hard to conclude otherwise after seeing the latest monster to hit Manhattan's streets: the stretch sport utility vehicle, if you can imagine such a thing, an oil burner so huge that the driver and the passengers are practically in different time zones.
In New York, political leaders have run from sacrifice as they would from that New Mexico couple hospitalized in Manhattan with bubonic plague. They saw a fiscal crisis brewing many months ago. Everyone saw it. So what happened? Instead of tightening belts, the state increased spending this year by six percent; the city budget grew three percent.
Ducking fiscal realities extended to the race for governor. The major candidates were given a free pass to avoid serious discussion of how they would deal with multibillion-dollar budget deficits. Now come rumblings of tax increases, reduced services and higher mass-transit fares. Of course. The election is over.
AT least the politicians are to able recognize someone else's sacrifice when they see it. On this Veterans Day, they praised those who answered the bugle call in wartime.
In a ceremony at Madison Square Park, Senator Charles E. Schumer delivered a rousing speech about how Americans have always lined up to serve during perilous times, even while aware that they might die in the effort. Not that Mr. Schumer ever did any such thing himself.
Actually, none of New York's top-rung political figures served in the military, including those of the Vietnam War generation, like George E. Pataki, Michael R. Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani. As for the New Yorker who talks openly about wanting to be president, the Rev. Al Sharpton, he somehow felt that Veterans Day was a fitting time to meet with Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations.
It would be nice to report that the crowds were thick at the Madison Square Park ceremony. They weren't. Nor did people stand more than one deep -- and not even that in many places -- along the route of a parade up Fifth Avenue.
"It's really lost its meaning, even post9/11 and even with us getting ready to go to war in Iraq," said Mark Hyman, an electrical engineer who served in Vietnam in the late 1960's. And Sal Scarlato, a veteran of the Korean War, lamented that the numbers of people turning out for these remembrances keep dwindling.
"The wind is down every year" was how he put it.

HEADLINE: Groups Clashing Over Safety of 15-Passenger Vans 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
With deaths and lawsuits drawing attention to high-riding 15-passenger vans, federal officials are urging automakers to improve the safety of the vehicles, which are widely used by school sports teams, church groups and summer campers. 
 But consumer advocates, automotive engineers and lawyers involved in lawsuits arising from some crashes, say that recommendations issued a little less than two weeks ago are extremely limited and do not address fundamental design flaws. 
 "These vehicles need a major design overhaul," said Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group that is planning to propose modifications to the vans at a news conference in Washington today. 
Ms. Claybrook, a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the board's recommendations "barely scratch the surface" of what needs to be done. 
In early 2001, after a string of fatal crashes involving the vehicles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration first warned that fully loaded 15-passenger vans were much more likely than other passenger vehicles to flip over. But the agency, which repeated the warning in April 2002, and the automakers have maintained that the vans are not defective. Rather, they say, the vans handle more like a truck than a car and can be safely operated by an experienced driver.
But many critics contend that the vans are top-heavy and some, especially the Fords and Dodges, have perilously short wheelbases that increase the likelihood of sideways skids. When the vans go into a skid, the experts say, their top-heaviness causes them to roll over.
"Once these vehicles start sliding they become uncontrollable for the average driver," said James A. Lowe, a lawyer in Cleveland who is suing Ford Motor for a rollover crash in which a child and an adult were killed. 
The vans, which were introduced more than 25 years ago, are also widely used by the military and for shuttle services at airports. Experts estimate there are about 500,000 of them on the road. Ford's 350 Econoline dominates sales and has about 85 percent of the United States market. The General Motors Chevrolet Express 3500 and the GMC Savana 3500 are also popular. Dodge stopped building its Ram 3500 Maxi-Wagon in June because of declining sales.
In letters to Ford and General Motors on Nov. 1, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended testing of several new devices -- mostly related to braking -- that are intended to improve the handling of the vans. The agency also recommended that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration begin testing the vans in emergency situations. 
As mild as the recommendations might seem to critics, both Ford and General Motors, said their vans were safe and that they did not believe that changes were needed.
Kristen Kinley, a Ford spokeswoman, said: "We will work closely with the National Transportation Safety Board to understand their concerns. But we're not certain what that will mean exactly. You don't just want to do tests for the sake of doing tests."
At General Motors, James D. Schell, a spokesman specializing in product safety, said he regarded the recommendations as constructive. "But whether or not we'll actually do these things, I don't know," he said.
Barry M. Sweedler, the former director of the Office of Safety Recommendations and Accomplishments at the National Transportation Safety Board, said the board's recommendations were reasonable, given the conservative nature of the agency. But he said he personally did not think the vans were safe. Besides being top-heavy, he said, the vans lack the heavy reinforcement of roofs and side walls that is standard on school buses.
"When you look at the total vehicle," he said, "it's just not the kind of vehicle you would want to put your loved ones in for anything but going from the airport to the rental car lot. And even then, when I get in one of them in that situation -- I was in two of them the other day -- I sort of cringe."
Among the devices that the safety board asked the automakers to evaluate is one called an electronic stability control system. When a vehicle veers sharply, the computerized system applies the brakes to individual wheels in an attempt to get it back on course. Another of the devices sounds an alarm when a vehicle starts unexpectedly shifting across highway lanes.
John M. Stilson, a safety consultant who worked for nearly 20 years for Ford and DaimlerChrysler, the maker of the 15-passenger Dodge van, said that loss of control with the vans can be sudden. 
"You've got maybe two seconds between you and death," he said. "These devices aren't going to be enough to help most drivers regain control."
"These steps are not going to do anything to fix the vehicle's instability and its propensity to roll over,' he added.
Some experts say the vans could be made much more stable by adding an extra set of wheels on the rear, as with some light trucks, and by lengthening the frame or wheelbase. These changes, of course, would increase the cost of the vans. They now sell for as little as $27,000 compared with about $35,000 for a school bus with similar capacity but more safety features.
Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the safety board, said that statistics and crash investigation reports available to the board did not provide a basis for making stronger recommendations. "We recommend only what we feel we can support by the data," Mr. Lopatkiewicz said. 
A study on the crashworthiness of 15-passenger vans is expected next year, Mr. Lopatkiewicz said, adding: "We'll see what kind of data we have to support other recommendations then."
In the decade ended in 2000, 558 people died in rollover crashes of 15-passenger vans, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In its letter to the automakers, the board said the death rate in the vans was comparable to the death rate in other passenger vehicles. But it also said that 81 percent of the deaths in 15-passenger vans occurred in rollover crashes involving only the van. That, a spokesman said, is more than four times the rate of deaths in similar rollovers in cars.
The highway safety agency first cautioned about 15-passenger vans after crashes in early 2001 killed athletes from Urbana University, Kenyon College, DePaul University, the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and Prairie View A&M University. 
In May 2001, a 1993 Dodge Ram carrying 12 women from the First Assembly of God church in Burkburnett, Tex., spun out of control after a rear tire threw its tread. The van rolled several times, killing four of the women, injuring the other eight. 
As jurors were being selected for a trial in the case late last month, DaimlerChrysler, the maker of the Dodge, and Michelin, the tire maker, reached a confidential settlement with the survivors and the families of the dead. Since DaimlerChrysler stopped making 15-passenger vans this year, the board did not ask it to address the safety issues, even though, experts said, tens of thousands of them are still on the road.
The crashes have continued. 
In September, 14 migrant forest workers died when their 2002 Dodge Ram ran off a narrow bridge in Maine and landed upside down in a stream.

HEADLINE: Terrorist Target? Frantic Thailand Says It Is Safe 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS with KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
No country has honed its image with more care than Thailand and one result has been a windfall: nearly $7 billion a year in tourism revenue. 
 Enchanting, delightful, charming, gentle, magical -- an entire vocabulary has been created to describe the country that calls itself the Land of Smiles. 
 That leaves little room for bombs.
So when other nations started putting Thailand at the top of their lists of terrorist warnings after the attack on the Indonesian island of Bali last month, the reaction here was frantic. 
"Kingdom labeled a terrorist target," read the headlines. "Alarm bells ringing." "Tourism industry in crisis." 
The first official response was to wish it would all go away.
"Please don't be frightened," said Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. "If I'm not afraid you shouldn't be either. Trust me." 
The military began a "Thailand is safe" publicity campaign and the Tourism Authority of Thailand budgeted more than $1 million for a blitz of foreign tour companies. 
Many of the steps that followed seemed intended as much to reassure as to have a real effect on terrorism. 
The government formed a special command to coordinate antiterrorism measures, announced that 1,000 police officers would guard tourist spots and said it would keep "particularly close watch" on people from the Middle East.
Bars in Bangkok's main red-light district, Patpong Road, asked the police to increase their presence to 100 officers from 40.
The governor of Bangkok, Samak Sundaravej, said anyone using fireworks during the Loy Kratong festival this week would be "treated as terrorists and arrested."
Then everybody held their breath. Would the Bali bombing, which took more than 190 lives, be a windfall as tourists rerouted themselves to Thailand, or would it be a disaster as travelers stayed away from Southeast Asia altogether?
Thailand's tourist arrivals, which continued to rise by 6 percent a year even after the Sept. 11 attacks, reached 10.3 million last year.
It looks as though that picture is going to darken.
While tourists from Southeast Asia and adventurous young people have not been put off, affluent, middle-aged tourists from elsewhere have been shunning the region's many luxury resorts, hotels and tour operators say. 
Last week, the Thai Hotels Association, which represents 90 hotels around the country, said 32,000 room-nights had already been canceled, at a cost of at least $3 million.
"We have huge losses every day," said Roberto S. Jotikasthira, an official with the Association of Thai Travel Agents. He said dozens of foreign travel agencies had canceled visits, including one representing 400 tourists from Italy and another representing 1,200 from Portugal.
Along with Europeans, Americans and Australians have also been conspicuous by their absence, and that has hurt resorts catering to them.
Dominick Martinetti, an American software marketer who travels often in Asia, and his family have had a complex of five hotels near the beach in Phuket practically to themselves. "We're the only people at the restaurant," he said. "We're the only people at the pool and we're practically the only people at the beach." 
Mile after mile of wide, sandy beaches have turned Phuket into one of Asia's biggest tourist destinations over the last decade. Despite the government's assurances, security has not been tightened noticeably on the island. There are no soldiers toting automatic weapons through the airport. Hotels employ private-security guards, but they are commonly armed with nothing more than radios. 
If the big hotels are hurting, then the pain is being felt most sharply by the workers who live nearby in the clusters of simple homes made of wood and corrugated steel. On a recent afternoon, local men and women peddling everything from silk tablecloths and T-shirts to massages outnumbered the tourists on some beaches in Phuket, and many looked dejected. 
"Usually, this is the high season," said one salesman, looking at a row of bright blue lounge chairs that were mostly empty at midday.
Beyond Thailand, where tourism accounts for as much as 5 to 7 percent of the economy by some estimates, there was a broader fear that the international travel warnings would shrink tourism throughout Southeast Asia. 
Not unexpectedly, Indonesia has already seen a sharp drop in arrivals. Hotel occupancy is reported to have fallen to 10 percent or lower in Bali, the country's most popular destination. Cathay Pacific, one of Southeast Asia's biggest airlines, has canceled 3 of its 10 weekly flights to Bali for lack of demand and security concerns. 
But the warnings have also swept up other nations in the region, including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, East Timor and Myanmar, where there have been no terrorist attacks.
There is more apparent basis for warnings about the Philippines, where a violent Muslim insurgency has been active.
The warnings about Thailand began two weeks ago when the Danish government advised "the greatest vigilance" in places like shrines and temples and entertainment venues frequented by foreigners.
"It's a big snowball effect," said John Koldowski, the managing director for strategic intelligence for the Pacific Association of Travel Agents, an industry group. 
The nations involved have responded in characteristic ways. Where Thailand prefers to avert its eyes from unpleasant things, Singapore prides itself being straightforward. "Terrorism is not a faraway problem," said Singapore's prime minister, Goh Chok Tong. "The bomb blasts in Bali confirm what we have warned all along, that terrorists are shifting their theater of operations to Southeast Asia."
Singapore announced that it was sending troops to guard industrial complexes, increasing naval patrols and installing new X-ray scanners to inspect cargo at its port.
In the Philippines, where the government seems to be trying to be vigilant, officials called off the presentation for the Guinness Book of World Records of a five-yard-long shoe in Marikina, the town that produced footwear for Imelda Marcos.
In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, a master of the potshot, called the foreign travel warnings unfair and hypocritical.
"I think Australia is unsafe," he said. "America is a very dangerous place. You shouldn't be on a high building in America."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
A Networked World's Final Frontier: the Airplane

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN 

 BODY:
On a recent flight from New York to Oakland, Calif., Madeline Duva worked her BlackBerry pager with the intensity of a pinball player, right up until the second of four announcements from the flight crew reminding passengers that all electronic devices must be turned off.
 Ms. Duva, a vice president with a San Francisco financial-data company, Sector Data, complied with the request, but said the communications blackout during the six-hour flight left her worrying about a last-minute directive to a colleague. "Now I'm sitting here and I'm thinking, 'I hope that order went in,' " she said. 
 Despite her anxiety over the status of the deal -- and whether a friend had gotten World Series tickets -- she resisted the urge to download e-mail messages to her BlackBerry for the duration of the flight. "You want to play by the rules, because you don't know if it could cause a problem," she said.
Like many gadget-toting business travelers, Ms. Duva regularly inhabits what might be described as the eye of the information hurricane: in an era of information overload, air travel remains a unique exception to an increasingly networked world. Not only can passengers not get information about whether a deal went through or who is ahead in the bottom of the seventh inning, they cannot seem to get a satisfying explanation for why they cannot use their cellphones, BlackBerries or a host of other electronic devices in the air.
In the meantime, there is a continuing face-off between passengers who surreptitiously -- and sometimes, blatantly -- use gadgets to send text messages or even make voice calls, and flight crews who must keep an eye out for thumbs tapping away under a tray table (and then determine whether a particular device can safely be used for other tasks with its phone feature shut off).
Indeed, two flight attendants on the same Oakland-bound flight said that on every flight a handful of passengers have to be asked to turn off electronic devices, and that travelers were not always willing to oblige.
"At least we have passengers who tell us people are trying to do it behind our backs," said one flight attendant, who insisted that her name not be used, adding that part of the problem is that travelers do not believe that these devices cause interference with the aircraft's communications system.
Whether electronic gadgets that emit radio signals do in fact compromise the safety of the aircraft is a matter of some debate, one complicated by the public perception that many people have illicitly used a cellphone or pager in an aircraft from time to time, and so far, no plane has crashed because someone's phone rang.
"Most of the time, nothing ever goes wrong," said Joe Burns, an Airbus captain who serves as director of flight standards and technology for United Airlines. "When passengers see that, it builds up the opinion in their mind that these things are safe. But we do have some documented evidence that these things can cause problems on specific aircraft."
Part of Captain Burns's job is to evaluate which technology can safely be used on planes, both in the cabin and in the cockpit. In the past, he said, manufacturers had to demonstrate that their technology was safe to use in the air; now the burden of proof has in some sense shifted to the airline industry to determine which emerging technologies cause interference.
"Our real concern moving forward is the proliferation of these PDA's with wireless communication devices built in," he said. "We have to keep on the leading edge to determine which devices are actually transmitting."
Another complicating factor is confusion over who is responsible for making the rules. The ban on cellphone use in aircraft was issued by the Federal Communications Commission, not out of concern for passengers' safety, but because using cellphones in the air can cause problems with wireless networks on the ground.
Paul Takemoto, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said the F.A.A. itself did not ban the use of specific portable electronic devices, but prohibited the airlines from allowing passengers to use them unless the carriers can prove the devices do not interfere with communications systems. Although Mr. Takemoto said the agency was looking closely at the multitude of wireless devices that are becoming popular, the burden has fallen on the airlines to police the issue.
Of course, it has not helped matters that plans to offer air travelers Internet access or messaging capabilities, tantalizingly within reach a year and a half ago, have been suspended as the airlines focus on other priorities, like new security measures and profitability.
Two of the leading initiatives to bring enhanced communication services to aircraft are testing their technologies with international carriers and private jets, but no one is willing to guess when America's airlines will have the money for this type of investment.
Connexion by Boeing, a division of Boeing that delivers a broadband Internet connection to aircraft, will start a trial with Lufthansa in January on a 747 flying from Frankfurt to Dulles International Airport near Washington. A month later, British Airways will test the technology on a similar aircraft flying between Heathrow in London and Kennedy in New York. The company also announced an agreement with Japan Airlines and currently has government and corporate clients in the United States.
Using the Connexion by Boeing service, passengers can plug in their laptops, open a Web browser and enter a credit card number to pay a fee of $25 to $35 per flight segment for unlimited Internet access -- but not anytime soon between, say, New York and Los Angeles.
Stan Deal, Connexion by Boeing's director of sales, said although American carriers continued to express interest in the technology, "The main issue for the U.S. is some level of economic stability and recovery." He added, "There are too many unknowns out there to predict exactly when yet."
That perspective is echoed by John Wade, executive vice president for strategic planning at Tenzing, a competing service that has developed technology to offer Internet access in aircraft as well as a separate messaging service that uses seat-back entertainment systems.
The messaging service, installed on one Virgin Atlantic aircraft, charges passengers $2.50 to send a text message to a phone number or e-mail address (passengers cannot receive replies yet). Tenzing's Internet service, available on 30 Cathay Pacific aircraft, charges passengers $9.95 to give them access to their e-mail accounts for viewing the sender and header of unread mail (reading the entire e-mail costs an additional $1 for each message).
Mr. Wade expects more airlines will opt for some type of messaging service over high-speed Internet access, but declined to predict a time frame for American carriers. "I think it would be unrealistic to give a date because no airline has committed to it," he said. "But we are seeing renewed interest."

HEADLINE: Checking Is Free, but the Profits Are Hefty 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Banks are aggressively promoting free checking accounts. But some customers are discovering that free often comes at a price.
 While customers no longer have to pay fees if their balances drop below a minimum, many who open these accounts often end up paying more in other charges, like those for bouncing checks or using automated teller machines. Without a minimum balance requirement, people may be careless about keeping enough in their accounts to avoid bouncing checks. 
 "The fact is, free checking accounts don't turn out to be free for a lot of people," said Gary D. Stein, a partner at the Capital Performance Group, a Washington consulting firm focused on banking. "Banks make a lot of money off these accounts." 
Banks make money from free-checking customers in three ways. Because such accounts generally pay no interest, they provide a cheap source of money for the banks, which can then reinvest the money elsewhere, Mr. Stein said. The banks also use the accounts to attract new customers who will then buy their other products, like insurance or mortgages. Banks also charge many fees, particularly for covering bounced checks.
The banks' eagerness to promote free checking comes at a time when consumer banking has been "the one bright spot" for the industry, said Judah Kraushaar, a bank stock analyst at Merrill Lynch. Profits are down in many other financial areas, like managing money, lending to corporations and selling new issues of stocks or bonds.
For most banks, fees probably account for a third or more of revenue, Mr. Kraushaar said. The banks do not consistently specify what percentage of those fees are tied to bank deposit accounts, but those fees are probably growing faster than any other type, he said. Asked about the fees they charge checking account customers, banks say it is the customers' responsibility to be aware of the fees and be careful to avoid them.
"You get into the theater for free, but we make money on the pop and the popcorn," said William A. Cooper, chief executive of TCF Financial in Wayzata, Minn., which was one of the first banks to promote free checking aggressively.
TCF can charge free checking and other accounts 36 different fees, Mr. Cooper said. Half of TCF's checking-account customers avoid paying any penalties in a given month. But the other half pay so much that more than a quarter of the bank's operating revenue last quarter, or $59 million, came from such fees. The fees helped push earnings up 16 percent at the bank from the previous year.
Mr. Cooper said most of his customers did not mind the extra charges. "There are fees that bother people, and there are fees that don't," he said. 
Some customers are turned off by the fees and wind up canceling their accounts. Marty West, a 42-year-old deliveryman who lives in Brooklyn, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, was a longtime customer of U.S. Bancorp. But last summer, he also opened a no-fee checking account at Charter One, another bank in the area that was offering free gifts for new customers. After some unexpected charges, he left the bank a few months later. "It wasn't worth the hassle to follow all the rules they had," he said.
Charter One offers anyone opening a checking account a free debit card, which the customer must use at least three times a month to avoid a penalty. When Mr. West used the card only twice in one month, the bank deducted $1.50 from his account, he said, causing his account to have a negative balance.
Then Mr. West, unaware that he had missed the month's cutoff date and that he had been charged, used the card to try to make the required third purchase before month's end. The bank then charged him a $29.50 fee for exceeding his balance.
"Some people open free checking accounts and don't realize there are fees involved if you overdraw," said Eugene Lucci, vice president for deposit products at the bank. Charter One recently began offering a service to notify customers when their balances were low, he said.
The fees that banks charge to cover bounced checks "are the largest source of fee revenue from retail customers at most banks," said Ralph Haberfeld, a consultant in Lincoln, Neb., who specializes in developing checking account products for banks. Most banks charge about $25 for each bounced check, he said.
Free-checking customers often wind up bouncing more checks than other checking customers, perhaps in part because they are less likely to have a cushion of money or to be as conscientious about their balances.
Some banking customers who pay overdraft fees "live from paycheck to paycheck and view this almost as a payday loan," said James M. McCormick, president of First Manhattan Consulting Group. Other consumers are simply careless. Mr. McCormick said he knew of a doctor who had paid $3,000 to a bank in one year to cover insufficient-funds fees.
The second-biggest fee that banks collect is for debit cards, which many banks offer to any free-checking customer. Banks are paid by retailers each time a debit card is used. Last year, retailers paid $2 billion in such fees to banks, up 35 percent from the previous year, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, which tracks the credit and debit card industry.
Though some customers become angry enough about bank fees to give up on free checking, enough stick around to make it worthwhile for the banks. In many cases, it is simply too much of a bother for a customer to switch accounts.
"Switching a checking account is a lot of work," said Ramesh N. Shah, head of consumer banking at GreenPoint Financial, a New York savings and loan that began offering free checking last November.
Even if free-checking customers are careful to avoid all these fees, the banks can still make money off their accounts. Banks typically make a profit based on the difference, or spread, between what they pay in interest to depositors and the rate at which they can reinvest the money. Since free checking accounts generally pay no interest, banks can earn an even higher return by reinvesting the customers' money elsewhere. 
Commerce Bancorp and Washington Mutual have been promoting free checking aggressively in recent months in the New York metropolitan area to build market share.
"Our business model is based on high deposit growth," said David S. Slackman, who oversees the Manhattan branches of Commerce, a Cherry Hill, N.J., bank that has opened 10 branches in Manhattan in the last year, quickly accumulating more than $500 million in deposits at them. "We are not dependent upon stupid fees or expenses."
On average, free-checking customers have a balance of $1,200 each, said Mr. Haberfeld, the consultant, though those balances may not be consistent enough to avoid fees.
Even if banks make relatively little upfront on free checking accounts, they are often able to sell these customers other products, like home or auto loans. "We look at these accounts as an initiation of a relationship," said Doug Marshall, senior vice president for product management at Washington Mutual.
The free-checking model has not spread to New York's biggest banks. Chase Manhattan, part of J. P. Morgan Chase, and Citibank, part of Citigroup, have not introduced such accounts; together they control more than a third of the consumer deposits in the metropolitan area. They say their customers are getting better service and point out that they have far more branches than any of the other banks in the area.
"Our profits are not dependent upon charging our customers penalty fees," said Rolland Johannsen, senior vice president for consumer financial services at Chase. "We think we provide as good or better value for our customers." 
Many customers avoid paying for checking anyway, he said. One way is to link savings and checking accounts to meet the required balance.
"If you have $10,000 in the bank," said Mr. McCormick, the consultant, "you probably already get free checking."

HEADLINE: Winning A Battle, Not a War 

BYLINE:  By Donald Green and Eric Schickler; Donald Green, a professor of political science at Yale, and Eric Schickler, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, are authors, with Bradley Palmquist, of "Partisan Hearts and Minds: Political Parties and the Social Identities of Voters."

 BODY:
During the 2000 campaign, Karl Rove, George W. Bush's political adviser, was fond of comparing his candidate's mission to that of William McKinley, whose victory over the populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan in 1896 ushered in an enduring Republican majority. Rather than simply winning the election, Mr. Rove's goal was to create a political realignment that would allow Republicans to dominate policy making for more than a decade, just as they did after McKinley's victory.
 In many ways, last week's election can be seen as the realization of Mr. Rove's aspirations. Despite a weak economy, the Republicans strengthened their control of the House and restored their majority in the Senate. The magnitude of this victory is underscored by the fact that only once in the last century did a midterm election produce gains for the president's party in both houses: in 1934, when Franklin Roosevelt engineered a political realignment that persists to this day. 
 Karl Rove notwithstanding, the United States still awaits another political realignment -- a period of fundamental change in the way the public views the parties. For better or worse, for almost 70 years neither Republicans nor Democrats have succeeded in substantially altering public perceptions of what they stand for. Last week's election was no different.
The essential feature of the New Deal realignment was that it produced not only Democratic victories but also Democratic partisans. Before the New Deal, the stereotypes of Democrats and Republicans were different from what they are today. Most black voters, for instance, had Republican sympathies, partly because they felt loyalty to the "party of Lincoln."
Roosevelt created a Democratic realignment by forging a new Democratic identity that stood for workers, immigrants and city dwellers -- and against big business and other interests identified with Republicans. These New Deal stereotypes of Republicans and Democrats are alive and well. The last New York Times/CBS News poll taken before the election showed that 57 percent of Americans believe that Republicans are more concerned about large corporations than about ordinary Americans, as compared to just 25 percent who view the Democrats in these terms. By contrast, Republicans are overwhelmingly perceived as the party associated with a strong military and national security. These are poll results from 2002, but they could well have come from 1955.
Thus last week's Republican triumphs are the result not of some noteworthy shift in partisan allegiances; Republicans won because voters are concerned with issues they have long associated with the party. In fact, Democrats retain a lead of about five percentage points over Republicans in party identification, a lead that is virtually identical to the party's edge 10 years ago.
It is true that recent Republican victories in southern states like Georgia reflect the substantial, though gradual, drift of the region away from its Democratic roots. But this process began well before the presidency, or even governorship, of George W. Bush. The Republican realignment of the South may be traced to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, when the infusion of newly enfranchised blacks into the Democratic Party caused the conservative Democrats who then dominated the South to bolt and signaled the end of one-party politics. This process accelerated during the Reagan years. But outside the South, Democrats' advantage in partisan identification -- about two-fifths of all voters identify themselves as Democrats, while about a third consider themselves Republicans -- has held remarkably stable for 50 years.
So why, outside the South, have Republican victories not generated more Republicans? Part of the reason is that this is an era of candidate-centered politics, when party labels are becoming less prominent in political advertisements. The parties, which are more likely to spend money on TV advertisements than on traditional "party-building" activities like phone banks or volunteer organization, are themselves partly to blame. The typical citizen no longer has much interaction with political parties.
Yet the 2002 elections attest to the continuing significance of partisan attachments. Of the 435 seats up for election in the House, for example, approximately 390 were deemed to be "safe" for one party or the other. The basis for such safety is the knowledge that most voters who identify themselves as Democrats can be relied upon to vote Democratic, and the same holds true for Republicans.
At the national level, approximately 70 percent of voters identify with either the Democrats or the Republicans and these partisans stick overwhelmingly with their party. According to the final New York Times/CBS News election poll, just 8 percent of Democrats who were likely voters planned to vote Republican, while just 4 percent of Republicans who were likely voters planned to vote Democratic.
The Democrats need not worry that Republicans created a vast new group of Bush Democrats in 2002. Republicans prevailed a week ago not because they altered the public's stereotypes of the parties, but because the public mood fit the stereotypes of the parties that already existed. As the party associated with patriotism and national defense, Republicans benefited from a policy agenda that put Iraq at the forefront, upstaging social spending issues like Medicare or Social Security.
Viewed from this perspective, last week's triumph may represent a missed opportunity for the Republicans: they won the election but failed to create a new image for themselves. And the Democratic Party -- even though it has lost the White House and Congress -- may find some small consolation in the knowledge that its image, though antiquated, still appeals to more voters than any other.

HEADLINE: Democratic Presidential Hopeful Lays Out His Plans for Economy 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
One week after suffering a dispiriting loss in midterm Congressional elections, Democrats are trying to move from the past and into the future: the race for president.
 A likely presidential contender, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, is to give a speech here on Tuesday calling for sharp spending reductions and rolling back tax cuts for the wealthy, as he seeks to distinguish himself from fellow Democrats and President Bush. 
 The speech by Senator Edwards comes at a time of logistical maneuvering among prospective Democratic contenders that it now appears will result in the shape of the party's presidential field being largely set by the end of the year. 
Mr. Edwards's address, an advance copy of which was provided today by aides, comes amid recriminations among Democrats about last Tuesday's defeats, with many arguing that it was a failure of the party to lay out its own economic agenda.
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Edwards criticizes both Democrats and Republicans as he seeks to stake out a middle ground between the two.
"You know why Americans think many Democrats want to spend too much money?" Mr. Edwards asks in the speech, to be delivered at the Fortune Global Forum here. "They do. You know why Americans think many Republicans are close to corporate interests? They are."
"Washington has begun a bidding war over who can spend the most," Mr. Edwards says. 
At a time when Republicans in Washington are moving to accelerate the phased-in $1.3 trillion tax package passed by Congress, Mr. Edwards calls for delaying the next phase of tax cuts on the maximum rate paid by families making over $200,000. He also urges Congress not to repeal the estate tax, saying families should instead be given an exemption on the first $7 million before the tax kicks in. He said the two measures would save the nation $1.3 trillion over 20 years.
"The election is over -- and I hope that people in both parties will be willing to say what a very few of us have been saying for months but everyone knows is true: We have to address the Bush tax cut," he says. "Whether or not we could afford it when it was originally passed, it is now clear that it is unsustainable."
Three other potential Democratic contenders, Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, and Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, have also suggested delaying or scaling back parts of the Bush tax cut. Al Gore, in a speech last month, declined to say whether he supported that position.
Mr. Edwards, echoing a position widely held by Democrats, will also call for eliminating tax shelters that allow corporations to shield income by moving their headquarters overseas, or by depositing corporate salaries into overseas accounts. 
He advocates a 10 percent cut in the government work force, exempting only the Defense and Homeland Security Departments.
Mr. Edwards will also call for $90 billion of one-time "shot-in-the-arm" measures to resuscitate the economy, including money to cover a $500 refundable energy tax credit to every American family. An additional $20 billion or so would be paid to states this year to help cover their own budget shortfalls forced by increased security and Medicaid costs.
Mr. Edwards will also urge changes in corporate governance laws, like requiring investment banks to clearly separate divisions advising investors on what stocks to buy from those selling stocks.

HEADLINE: Gates Offers India $100 Million to Fight AIDS 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
Saying India could still ward off a devastating AIDS epidemic, Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, announced here today that the foundation he and his wife established will give more than $100 million over 10 years to reduce the spread of H.I.V. and AIDS in India. 
 It is the largest single program focused on a specific country that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has undertaken since it was founded nearly three years ago. 
 India has an estimated four million cases of H.I.V. infection (although many believe the real number is higher), but the rate of infection is still relatively low, at about eight-tenths of 1 percent.
"AIDS is in an early stage here," Mr. Gates, whose worth Forbes magazine recently put at $43 billion, said at a news conference. "There is the opportunity through the right preventive strategies to keep it that way." 
He also said he hoped that successes in India could be applied in other developing countries. If necessary, he said, more money would be forthcoming, adding, "The initial commitment of $100 million is simply the beginning of what we think is appropriate." 
With a billion people and an estimated half-million software developers, India is an increasingly important market for Microsoft, which has been under pressure from so-called open-source computing. That movement, which has been having success winning over developers, favors the Linux operating system -- available free or in inexpensive software packages -- over proprietary systems like Microsoft Windows.
In a recent e-mail interview, Mr. Gates spoke of the close personal ties developed with India through Microsoft. Many Indians have worked at the Seattle headquarters, and Microsoft has a facility in Bangalore and a large campus in Hyderabad that includs a software development center. 
That relationship, he said, has given him a vivid sense of India's economic, scientific and technological potential -- and how AIDS threatens it. "India is at once on the cusp of economic greatness and of an epidemic of tragic proportions," he said.
But even though his four-day trip here mixes business and philanthropy, he has carefully tried to build walls between the two. There were no Microsoft activities on his schedule today, and he deflected any suggestions that philanthropy could be good for business.
The money will be channeled to Indian partners, primarily nongovernmental organizations. Their main focus will be mobile populations, like truck drivers, rail workers and migrant laborers, who carry the infection across state lines.
Mr. Gates and the director of the foundation's H.I.V./AIDS and tuberculosis programs, Dr. Helene Gayle, said they thought the foundation might have greater nimbleness than government in linking programs across state lines, and between different sectors of society, like business or aid groups.
Mr. Gates also said he hoped to erode the stigma around the disease in India.
While careful to praise the steps the Indian government had taken to combat the disease's spread, he said, "The recognition we came to, and one I think the government is also coming to, is that more needs to be done."
Doing more needs more resources, which Mr. Gates has in abundance. His net wealth is almost as large as the Indian government's $44.3 billion in revenues last year. He said in the e-mail interview that the size of the grant was meant to send a "message of hope and solvability."
With all the security and advance planning of a head of state, but with a considerably more low-key demeanor, Mr. Gates navigated a day that included a visit to a care center for women and children with H.I.V., a meeting with the prime minister, a news conference and then roundtables for business leaders, politicians, nongovernmental organizations and journalists. There was also a reception held in conjunction with the health minister.
While Mr. Gates stressed that he was embarking on a partnership with the government, there was a certain ambivalence on the government side toward a foreigner's bankrolling prevention of an epidemic that officials have sometimes seemed reluctant to acknowledge.
Both Mr. Gates and Robert Blackwill, the American ambassador, have publicly cited a report by the United States National Intelligence Council that predicted that India could have as many as 25 million H.I.V. infections by 2010. The minister of health and family welfare, Shatrughan Sinha, said on Friday that Mr. Gates and Mr. Blackwill were sowing "panic" by referring to the report, a comment he repeated tonight.
In truth, no one knows how many cases India has, let alone will have, because systematic surveillance has been seriously lacking. "Understanding the scale of epidemiology is somewhat limited in all developing countries," Mr. Gates said, diplomatically, today.
He also said Mr. Sinha would head a board supervising the donation. At the reception Mr. Sinha, in turn, proclaimed, "Mr. Gates, we are with you."
Mr. Gates said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had expressed appreciation for the foundation's efforts. Mr. Vajpayee made a significant speech about AIDS on the country's independence day in 2000, but has not regularly spoken about it since. Asked if he had encouraged Mr. Vajpayee to speak out more, Mr. Gates said, "We talked a lot about the need to raise visibility, to think creatively in that."
The Gates Foundation is also the largest backer of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, which is to begin trials in India next year. The foundation has invested $100 million in research on microbicides, gels designed to kill H.I.V., which could give women a way to prevent infection without relying on men to use condoms.
In an interview, Dr. Gayle spoke of the challenges of devising preventive measures that could collide with a society's economic and social compulsions. Much of the disease's spread, for example, can be traced to men who must go away from home to find work, whether as truck drivers or laborers, and "you must look for a way where seeking employment doesn't foster risk," she said.
In addition, as both she and Mr. Gates observed, the spread of AIDS is linked to the low status of women.
No matter, an upbeat Mr. Gates said today. "You can't just stand by and let the AIDS epidemic spread because whatever factors are going to make it hard."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 14, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about plans by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to give $100 million to combat H.I.V. and AIDS in India misstated the timing. While saying there is no fixed period for distributing the money, Mr. Gates and foundation officials have projected that it will be given out over 5 to 10 years; he did not say it would be given out over 10 years.
Also because of an editing error, the article referred incompletely to Microsoft's offices in India. There are five in addition to those in Bangalore and Hyderabad.

HEADLINE: EATING WELL; 
American Caviar Comes Into Its Own

BYLINE:  By Marian Burros 

 BODY:
THE holidays provide the best excuse for excess: out come the crystal bowls, to be filled with the world's finest beluga, sevruga and osetra. But with a black market in caviar thriving in America, and with so many cases of mislabeled or improperly stored caviar in the news, shoppers are right to wonder if they are getting their money's worth. 
 In the latest high-profile case, Arkady Panchernikov, an owner of the Manhattan caviar bar Caviar Russe, pleaded guilty earlier this month to six counts of trafficking in caviar without proper permits, and to false labeling. The government said Mr. Panchernikov's distribution business, Caspian Star Caviar, had handled at least 60 percent of the caviar consumed in the United States in the last four years. Another owner of Caviar Russe, Don Magnotta, said last week that Mr. Panchernikov, who is to be sentenced in January, is no longer associated with the business. 
 The illegal market in wild caviar is thriving because caviar is so scarce and poorly controlled; its black market sales bring in more money than many illegal drugs. Wildlife scientists believe Caspian Sea beluga sturgeon, the king of caviar producers, is close to extinction, and that osetra and sevruga sturgeon are seriously depleted.
While harvesting Caspian Sea beluga sturgeon and importing its caviar into the United States have been banned in the past, at the moment, beluga can be legally harvested, and this country is in the process of lifting its ban on importation.
But after conversations with officials from the Fish and Wildlife Service, whose business it is to catch the black marketeers, I wonder if buying caviar isn't the modern version of buying a pig in a poke. Worse, maybe, because even if you look at the caviar before you buy it, which the fellow buying the pig didn't do, it's not likely you would know whether the caviar was as advertised.
Ed Grace, a Fish and Wildlife special agent, said he couldn't bring himself to eat caviar. "Not after what I've seen," he said. "How it comes in suitcases, unrefrigerated on a 20-hour flight; stuff that is two and three years old that people say is fresh." 
Sal Amato, another special agent with the service, said the odds of being cheated when buying almost any wild caviar are close to 90 to 1. Despite 18 to 20 convictions over the last two years, he said, "the market is still rife with black market caviar."
"There's too much money involved, too much incentive to deal in it," he said. "It's not going away."
Does Mr. Amato suggest buying farmed American caviar in place of caviar from the Caspian Sea? Yes, and so do his colleagues at Fish and Wildlife. With farmed American caviar, they say, you will get what you pay for. But before you start conjuring up images of overly salty, oily black-dyed fish eggs, you should know that a lot of good work has been going on with American sturgeon aquaculture. Two years ago, I tasted some of the Sterling transmontanus caviar from a farmed white sturgeon species native to the Pacific Ocean, from the Stolt Sea Farm in California, and was impressed. But I was not nearly as impressed as I was last week when I tried it again.
In a blind tasting of six caviars, two farmed, the rest wild, Petrossian's Sterling caviar tied for first place with Petrossian's royal osetra. I loved the bursts of nutty flavor that came from Sterling's firm little grains.
Even more remarkable is that the Sterling caviar is being featured face to face with Caspian caviar in this year's catalog from Petrossian Paris, the prestigious importer. Americans, after all, consume one-third of the world's caviar.
Armen Petrossian, the president of the company, will neither acknowledge that beluga is endangered and that other sturgeon are in bad shape -- in fact, he disagrees with the assessment -- nor will he say that he is hedging his bets. But he has been working with Stolt Sea Farm for two years, and even longer with a French aquaculture firm, to improve the quality of their roe.
"It took a couple of years to convince Petrossian to work with us," said Chuck Edward, the sales and marketing manager of Stolt Farm. "Their noses came down a little bit."
Mr. Petrossian said that his company could help Stolt improve its premium product. "I think the image of domestic caviar in the U.S. is very bad; low class, inexpensive and bad," he said. "Someone who is producing the roe doesn't know what the customer wants -- about the texture, presentation, grading -- and that's what we are specialists in. What we want to do is make the Sterling caviar very fabulous, make it comparable to the wild product." And they have.
Just because it's farmed, however, doesn't mean it's cheap. At Petrossian, Sterling transmontanus caviar sells for $1,700 a kilo or $88 for a one-and-three-quarter-ounce jar. The same amount of wild sevruga from the Caspian Sea is $98; the osetra, $129; and the beluga, $154.
If, despite warnings from the Fish and Wildlife Service, you must have Caspian Sea caviar, you can try to check its authenticity. Legitimate imported caviar requires certification papers and labels on the original one-kilo tins. You should ask to see them. But William Donato, the resident agent of Fish and Wildlife in charge of New York State, says that even the labels are no guarantee. "Labels are a good thing," he said, but caviar criminals "have ties with the Russian mafia. They will counterfeit anything."

Sharing Hardships and Ideas, Cuban Printmakers Win Praise

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA 

 BODY:
The future of Cuban graphic arts is found among thick stones and ancient presses down a dead-end street just off the Cathedral Plaza. Past the ever-present curbside trio singing old Cuban songs in the faux-festive tourist atmosphere, the real party is inside the Experimental Graphics Studio, where printmakers, poets and musicians share ideas and inspiration.
 For 40 years, the Old Havana studio, with its gallery, has been home to the island's leading graphic artists, who have gone on to win honors at biennials in Europe, Japan and Latin America. Yet an easygoing camaraderie prevails inside the high-ceilinged room, which smells of paint and strong cigarettes, where established artists and newcomers work side by side. It is part salon, where singers or writers may drop in for a visit, and part classroom without walls, where there are no secrets of technique or opinion. 
 "It is not a school in the formal sense, but it is the best school because you are not obliged to stick to one lesson," said Raimundo Respall, who runs the studio's gallery. "Artists learn from each other. You need someone to look at what you are doing. All that flows inside this studio, and that is our great value. Anything else is just a printmaking factory." 
The studio was started in 1962 to revive printmaking techniques that had once been used to make labels and cigar rings. A handful of lithographers had been to Mexico, Mr. Respall said, to learn from masters there. But the art did not thrive until a chance encounter with the poet Pablo Neruda.
The old presses had been abandoned in a warehouse and the thick stones used for lithographs had been tossed aside in the street, Mr. Respall said. The studio's founders asked Neruda to persuade his friend Che Guevara, then Cuba's minister of industry, to give them the presses and a place to work.
"The studio made sure that the graphic arts in Cuba did not die," said Eduardo Roca Salazar, one of the island's most distinguished printmakers, who started at the studio in 1975 and is known as Choco. "It is one of the most impressive places in the world, not just Cuba, for all the magic that has gone on here."
Some might say that the real magic has been how the studio has thrived despite the high cost of paper and ink -- all imported -- as well as prohibitions against selling its work in the United States. The gallery helps offset costs, selling prints for anywhere from $40 to more than $500.
"I was really impressed by how much they do with how little they have," said Marjorie Devon, the director of the Tamarind Institute in New Mexico, which trains master printmakers. "The work was strong and it had passion."
Resourcefulness is itself an art perfected by Cubans, who pepper their conversations with references to "resolving the situation" by improvising. The fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's set off serious hardship on the island, artists said, which tested their creativity in unexpected ways: inks were improvised from black powder and soap, and beer cans were split open to make engraving plates, for example.
"We learned to do things on our own," said Jose Omar Torres, the studio's artistic director. "It was an era of misery, no doubt. What you had to save was the spirit. Misery passes, but if you kill the spirit, you kill the man."
Yet that same era ushered in opportunities for the artists to begin showing their work to a wider audience, as the island turned to tourism for its economic salvation. Collectors from Spain and Japan eagerly snapped up prints and invited artists to cultural exchanges. And even though there are formal prohibitions against Americans' doing business with Cuba, it is said that there are more than a few art dealers in Manhattan and Miami who quietly offer Cuban prints.
The work itself is varied, which Mr. Respall said is by design. Unlike artists in the Soviet Union, where socialist realism dominated, the Cuban printmakers rejected such hokey heroism, he said, preferring to root themselves in their Caribbean culture. To this day, he said, there is no pressure to parrot themes or slogans.
Choco's deep-hued and textured prints, with their evocative Afro-Cuban religious themes, can hang alongside Eduardo Abela's wry woodcuts that turn the harbor's famous lighthouse into a bottle-shaped ad for "Absolut Kuba." 
There are sly political takes, too. Mr. Abela has one woodcut of a taxi-turned-rowboat filled with migrants. Another artist drew a stark and angular seaside street, where a solitary figure peered into the vast and empty sea. In "Collective Vigilance" an artist shows a daisy chain of figures spying on each other with telescopes.
While many artists are able to travel abroad for shows, they face more obstacles to visiting the United States. As Cuban musicians, dancers and writers have found, American authorities have been reluctant to grant many visas to artists, despite past policies that promoted cultural exchanges.
The biggest debates at the studio in recent years have not been about politics but art. Newcomers in the 1990's began to dismiss the work of older artists as sentimental or too literal, Mr. Respall said, and embraced extravagantly intellectual approaches that required too many explanations to make sense.
"They called it conceptual art, but that is debatable because to me it had no concept," Mr. Respall said. "They were artists who cared more about words. And they spoke about past artists as if they had done nothing new in the present."
Choco, one of the targets of the new critics, had made prints of rural life in the 1970's, but it was only a reflection of the country's priorities at the time, when thousands of people were obliged to take up machetes and help cut sugar cane. 
His current work is intense with color, with traditional elements done in a modern style that would be at home in Chelsea or SoHo.
Choco now has his own studio inside a former warehouse, where he makes prints and paintings to the sound of Miles Davis on the boombox. It is a big, comfortable space, removed from yet intimately connected to the old studio, which he still visits.
"The studio was the start," he said. "Without them, all this would have been impossible. How could I have done art without them? I had no machines or material."
One of the current rising stars, Julio Cesar Pena, can relate to that view. He came from a rough-and-tumble neighborhood in Havana, and his family had no idea that a man could make a living at art. Mr. Pena started drawing as a hobby, teaching himself, and became so hooked that he tried, without much luck, to get into art school. The studio accepted him in 1997.
"This is what fed me," he said. "I learned from those great masters there. This has been my school. I do not know if it is luck or grace, but that is how I learned. Here."
Today his prints of skeletons engaged in everyday street scenes are among the workshop's most popular images. His print "Rumberos del Momento," featuring a skeletons' street party, was featured on the cover of the 2001 catalog for the Kanagawa International Print Triennial in Japan, where it won first prize.
"Life brings with it the guarantee of death," Mr. Pena said. "Death is always with us, so I want to touch life. You have a skeleton inside you already."
Mr. Pena himself looks like a skeleton, with a buzz cut and body that is all bones and angles, and he moves and speaks at a machine-gun pace. True to his roots and the moment and wearing a T-shirt that declared "Working Class Hero," he walked into an Old Havana bar, embracing everyone from the waitress to the house band.
"You have to dance!" the singer shouted to him. "You have to."
Mr. Pena, who was sketching on a scrap of paper, did a quick step with a smile. The streets, it seemed, were as much a school as the studio.
"It's important to know the life of an artist," he said. "I do my work, and I enjoy the moment, drinking, dancing. That is my work, too."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 13 about the graphic arts in Cuba referred imprecisely to Cuban artworks sold in the United States. They are not banned under the American embargo on Cuban goods; like publications and other informational materials, they are exempt, and Americans who go to Cuba on authorized travel can buy them.

HEADLINE: Vodafone Surprises Markets by Halving Its 6-Month Loss 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
The Vodafone Group did today what few mobile phone companies have done in a long time: It surprised the market with positive news.
 Vodafone, the world's largest wireless company, said it more than halved its loss for the first six months of the fiscal year, and reported improvements by almost every measure, including increased cash flow and lower debt. 
 The upbeat news, rare in a wireless industry that has been battered by ballooning debt, by slowing growth and by a resistance to a new generation of mobile phones, helped pull the entire London market higher. Shares of Vodafone traded here climbed 12.5 pence, or 13 percent, to $:1.11 ($1.76), their largest one-day gain in nearly three years. In New York trading, the stock closed at $17.63, up $2.18. 
Throughout the telecommunications boom of the last decade, Vodafone made dozens of acquisitions in hopes of one day building a global network from Tulsa to Tokyo. But unlike rivals, which were also busy building empires, Vodafone tended to use stock, not cash. When the telecommunications bubble burst, Vodafone found itself on far stronger financial footing than competitors, and that has allowed it to grow, while others are shrinking, analysts said.
"When everyone else is licking their wounds to conserve cash, Vodafone has the financial muscle to develop and market new services and continue making acquisitions," John Tysoe of WestLB Panmure said.
Vodafone, for instance, has offered to buy the 85 percent that it does not already own of Cegetel, a French phone company. The acquisition would fill one of the last major holes in Vodafone's European network. But Vodafone will first have to outmaneuver Vivendi Universal, which owns 44 percent of Cegetel and would like to retain control.
Vivendi, which is scrambling to reduce its 19 billion euro debt pile, has been holding talks with bankers, private equity firms and rival phone companies to try to raise the 4 billion euros it would need to counter Vodafone's offer.
Sir Christopher Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, said today that he had spoken with Vivendi's lenders in an attempt to convince them that Vodafone was in a stronger position to run Cegetel than Vivendi.
In addition to acquisitions, Vodafone has continued to add customers, some 3.7 million in the most recent quarter, bringing the total to 107.5 million.
The challenge now, analysts said, is for Vodafone to persuade customers to use new services like Vodafone Live, which allows them to transmit photographs, download music and play games. To use the service, customers will need to buy a new phone for about $300, a cost that some analysts said could still be too high.
"The jury is still very much out with anything to do with data on mobile phones," Colin Morton of BWD Rensburg said.
For the six months ended Sept. 30, Vodafone lost $:4.34 billion ($6.9 billion), compared with a loss of $:9.74 billion a year earlier. Much of that loss is a result of the amortization of good will, mainly related to Vodafone's purchase of Mannesmann of Germany.
Operating profit, excluding good will and exceptional items, rose to $:4.6 billion from $:3.4 billion a year ago. Vodafone said it generated $:2.9 billion of free cash flow in the period, more than for all of last year. Revenue grew 67 percent, to $:14.9 billion. Vodafone also said it reduced debt 11 percent, to $:10.7 billion.
"Across the board, these numbers are ahead of what analysts had expected," Mr. Morton said.

HEADLINE: Outcry in Ontario Over Energy Prices 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Across much of North America this fall, electricity bills are being held in check by a slack economy and intense competition among producers. But not in Ontario, where politicians are scrambling to quell a public outcry over soaring power prices.
 Six months after deregulating its power market in hopes of promoting competition and encouraging investment in new capacity, the government of Ontario, Canada's most populous and industrialized province, backtracked late Monday and said it would freeze retail electricity rates for the next four years. 
 Households and small businesses will be given rebates averaging about 75 Canadian dollars ($47.79) to compensate for the surge in electricity bills since the start of deregulation in May, the government said. It also froze the fees local distribution companies charge customers for delivering power from producers to them, reversing an earlier decision to allow them to rise gradually. 
"We have to smooth out the bumps along the road to a competitive market," John Baird, the province's energy minister, explained.
Critics said they saw in the decision the seeds of a crisis like California's in 2001. A price freeze, they said, would significantly increase the risk of blackouts in coming months, and threaten the financial stability of some utilities.
"The retreat is so dramatic," said Tom Adams, executive director of Energy Probe, a Toronto research and consulting firm. "It would be positively hazardous for anyone to lay down their cash here in any form of long-term investment."
With the ruling Progressive Conservative party trailing in public opinion polls, Mr. Adams said, the government's action looked like a political ploy. An election is expected to be called here within 18 months.
Electric bills have become a major issue for many businesses, from hotel operators to mushroom growers. The situation is "a mess," said Gregory Gray, operations manager at Money's Mushrooms near Campbellville, west of Toronto.
Mr. Gray's company produces 22 million pounds of mushrooms a year, using large amounts of electricity for climate control in its greenhouses. He said the power bill in August was 40 percent higher than the year before, and the September bill will probably be more than double.
High demand in an unusually warm summer was partly to blame for big power bills, analysts said. But the volatile prices and the deepening financial problems experienced by many North American utilities since the collapse of Enron have also exposed flaws in the government's blueprint for the power sector.
"It is important to recognize that the world in which we operate is much different than the world in which the Ontario market was created," said Duane Cramer, vice president of Sithe Energies, a New York-based power producer, at a conference here last month. Sithe is a unit of Vivendi Universal.
Sithe recently shelved plans to build two power stations on the outskirts of Toronto. "We've spent much of the past year spinning our wheels, and we've run out of rationales to continue spending money," Mr. Cramer said.
According to Rocco Sebastiano, a lawyer at Osler Hoskin & Harcourt who specializes in energy matters, "there isn't the appetite in the marketplace to make significant investments in energy these days."
Despite deregulation, Ontario's power market is still dominated by two government-owned companies. One, Ontario Power Generation, was created to take over the power plants owned by the old provincial monopoly, Ontario Hydro, when the monopoly was broken up in 1999; the other, Hydro One, was created at the same time to take over Ontario Hydro's transmission network. 
Hydro One was supposed to be floated in an initial public offering, but unions and advocacy groups heatedly opposed the sale, and Ernie Eves, the provincial premier, called it off shortly after taking office. Instead, the government is trying to find a buyer for a stake of up to 49 percent in Hydro One.
To increase competition, the government ordered Ontario Power Generation to give up control over at least 4,000 megawatts of generating capacity over the next three years, about one-sixth of its total capacity. By 2012, Ontario Power is meant to control no more than 35 percent of the province's electricity supply; it now has more than 75 percent.
But the government recently forced Ontario Power to cancel a proposed sale of two coal-fired power plants because the buyers would not promise to convert them to run on natural gas or another energy source cleaner than coal.
The power picture has not been helped by delays in getting a nuclear plant at Pickering, east of Toronto, running again. The plant, which can produce 2,060 megawatts of power in all, has been closed since 1997 because of safety concerns.
The first of the four generating units was to be restarted before deregulation began, but Ontario Power now says it will not come online until the spring. In the meantime, Ontario has had to buy power from neighboring provinces and from the United States at greater cost.
Refurbishing the Pickering plant has also eroded Ontario Power's profits, with much of the rising cost, now estimated at about 2.3 billion Canadian dollars ($1.47 billion), charged off as operating expenses.
As a result, the company made no contribution last year toward paying down the 20.1 billion Canadian dollars in "stranded debt" that the province assumed from Ontario Hydro to make its two successor companies more attractive to outside investors. According to Mr. Sebastiano, Ontario Power "hasn't moved to market-driven forces -- they're still in a monopoly position."
At the time of deregulation, the government said rising prices would curtail demand and be self-correcting. Mr. Baird said today that he now expected demand to be held in check by conservation. To set an example, the government said it would use only half the usual number of Christmas lights to decorate the giant tree at the provincial legislature.

HEADLINE: An Academic Retreat for African Ex-Presidents 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Africa is not an easy place to be a former president. One's likeness is rubbed right off the currency as soon as one moves out of the presidential mansion. The cars and the houses and the thousands of minions disappear into thin air as well. Schools and streets and airports are renamed for the new guy. Then there is the pesky question of paying for one's presidential misdeeds.
 But there is now a new opportunity for African ex-presidents with too much time on their hands: a fellowship at Boston University that comes with fancy accommodations, a healthy stipend, plenty of security and the opportunity to return to the lectern. Delta Airlines is even providing domestic airfare, the fellowship's version of a presidential jet. 
 The first fellow, who began in September, is Kenneth Kaunda, who ruled Zambia from independence in 1964 until he stepped down 27 years later. It is not hard to see how Mr. Kaunda found the offer of a fellowship attractive. 
After leaving office, Mr. Kaunda and top members of his party were arrested repeatedly, usually on treason charges that were later dropped. When Mr. Kaunda tried to come out of retirement in 1996, he suddenly found himself in court again, facing accusations that he was not even a Zambian citizen. 
Since arriving in Boston, Mr. Kaunda has been busy both on and off campus. He recently gave the opening lecture at a conference at Boston University on integrating Africa into the global economy, and he has also spoken at Harvard and at People's Baptist Church in Boston. The university is preparing an archive of African presidents, and Mr. Kaunda has sat for a lengthy interview, recalling his days in office.
"He is a living embodiment of Africa's past struggle against colonialism, and his commitment to democracy and free-market reform makes him a symbol of Africa's present and future challenge to live with globalization," said Charles R. Stith, a former American ambassador to Tanzania who now runs Boston University's African Presidential Archives and Research Center.
The fellowship is part of a broader effort by American universities to establish direct links with Africa. Already, Boston has a study-abroad program with the University of Abdou Moumouni in Niger and a faculty exchange program with a university in Ethiopia. Now the university has a former head of state from Africa hanging around the campus as well.
"I'd definitely recommend this program to other African presidents," Mr. Kaunda said in a telephone interview from Florida, where he was on a speaking tour. "It helps Americans understand Africa and the other way around."
Mr. Kaunda said he had not found Americans lacking when it came to their knowledge of Africa. "I had lunch a couple of days ago with three professors in Boston, and I was amazed, and pleasantly so, to see the depth of their knowledge of Africa's problems," he said.
The freewheeling fellowship could not have come at a better time for African ex-presidents, some of whom are going through a particularly rough patch. There is the former president of the Central African Republic who was sentenced to death in absentia recently for plotting to overthrow the current government, and the ex-president of Zambia whose house was searched in a drug investigation. A former Nigerian dictator was recently linked to the killing of a journalist 15 years ago.
No ex-president is an angel -- here in Africa or anywhere else -- and the Boston University fellowship, called the Lloyd G. Balfour African Presidents in Residence Program, takes that into consideration. But there are limits, and Boston University, which has one of oldest African studies programs in the country, intends to steer clear of presidents who completely trampled democracy while in office.
When it comes to deciding who is a potential fellow and who is damaged goods, Mr. Stith has been working with the Bush administration to ensure that Boston University's selections do not collide with foreign policy interests. State Department officials say they back the program as a way of showing African leaders that there are tangible rewards for stepping down.
Mr. Kaunda, the current fellow, will hold the position for a year. Then, Mr. Stith will choose from the many other presidents he says fit the bill, including Ketumile Masire of Botswana, Nicephore Soglo of Benin, Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro of Cape Verde and Jerry Rawlings of Ghana.
Nelson Mandela of South Africa is high on the list of contenders, but university officials are also willing to consider his predecessor, F. W. de Klerk, who presided over the end of white rule.
"It's an interesting pool of people," said Mr. Stith, who plans a trip through Africa in January to begin searching for the second fellow. "There are more possibilities than most people imagine, and it's a group that is growing by the year."
In the coming months and years, Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda could all be ex-presidents. Mr. Stith refused to rule in, or rule out, Mr. Moi or Mr. Mugabe, saying that doing so before their terms end would amount to speculation. Mr. Museveni's name, however, does appear on Mr. Stith's short list. "The determination of eligibility can only really be made when one is a former president," Mr. Stith said. "You can only make an assessment of leaders' contribution to democracy after they are out of office."
Mr. Kaunda, for instance, would not have been eligible if the fellowship had been around 30 years ago, around the time he banned multiparty politics. Over the years, however, he became a democrat, and he stepped down peacefully after calling multiparty elections and losing to Frederick Chiluba.
"Most of the democracies in Africa are relatively young compared to ours," Mr. Stith said. "The role ex-presidents play is still very much a work in progress."
Mr. Stith would not say the amount of the stipend the African fellows receive. He did say that they would live less stately lives than they did during their presidencies, but "a little better than a junior professor."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
No Environmental Study, but the Loan Still Clears

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Investors and developers who want to secure loans quickly are buying insurance policies instead of going through the more time-consuming process of having buildings and land parcels examined for environmental contamination.
 The policies cover only the bank's exposure to loss on the loan; they do nothing to protect the investors who purchase the loans, and they do not cover any costs of actually cleaning up contamination. 
 Still, commercial real estate investors are buying the policies at a rapidly escalating pace, motivated by eagerness to lock in loans while interest rates are low and sometimes by the desire to persuade banks to underwrite loans they might otherwise reject.
Billions of dollars in commercial real estate loans have been secured using these policies in the last few years, and now the first claims are beginning to trickle in. The moment presents a significant test for the insurance companies that have set up divisions to write these policies, the banks making the loans, the real estate investors and developers and the buyers of commercial mortgage-backed securities that ultimately invest in pools of loans. 
The policies are still relatively new and untested, and they are to a large extent filled with exclusions for problems like asbestos, lead-based paint and mold. In recent years, though, insurance companies have set up separate divisions to sell the policies as an alternative to environmental inspections.
Charles J. Perry, the president of Environmental Warranty, an underwriter based in West Hartford, Conn., promotes the policies as a substitute for inspection, likening them to title insurance. "If I could transfer risk, as opposed to understanding it, for about the same money and a lot less heartache, why not do it?" Mr. Perry said.
Francis W. Coughlin, the president of the British American Development Corporation of Latham, N.Y., bought such a policy this summer for the mortgage on a 40,000-square-foot office building in his 350-acre Airport Park development near Albany. The reason, he said, was speed.
"Interest rates were buzzing around, and looked like they were going to go up," Mr. Coughlin said. "I wanted to get it locked in. The rates can vary a whole point, and they don't go down as fast as they go up."
Mr. Coughlin bought an environmental insurance policy for about $1,800, and his $2.6 million mortgage loan was processed by Legacy Banks of Pittsfield, Mass., within a day. Because Mr. Coughlin already owned the land and had completed construction, his use of the policy, specialists say, was among the safest ways to omit an environmental study and substitute an insurance policy.
The study he chose to forgo is called a Phase 1 environmental survey. These cost from $750 to $1,500 and take about a month. In performing them, environmental engineering consultants typically do visual site inspections, interviews, studies of the chain of ownership, Freedom of Information Act requests from state agencies and reviews of aerial photographs. They include pages of documentation of kinds of contamination that were not found, as well as problems that were found.
Critics of the reliance on insurance as an alternative to an environmental survey say that skipping the study can leave a buyer uninformed of and unprotected from the risk and liability of contamination.
"I just don't think it's a prudent thing when representing a buyer or a developer," said Jeffrey A. Moerdler, a member of the environmental group at the law firm of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo in New York. "Environmental insurance is really designed to work hand in hand with a buyer's due diligence. It's an add-on. It's a credit enhancement."
The insurance policies do not cover the buyer, they cover the lender, typically for the principal of the loan. And the policies typically require two conditions for payment of claims: Contamination must be found, and the loan must be in default. In effect, the insurance company is betting against the lender's willingness to foreclose and take control of a property with environmental liabilities.
Three major insurance companies -- the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, the Zurich Financial Services Group and the American International Group -- dominate the market for these policies. Officials with A.I.G. Environmental, a division of American International, estimated that $60 million to $70 million in premiums a year, covering at least $500 million in commercial real estate loans, are being written by the three companies and some smaller competitors.
The first claims are starting to arrive from lenders to insurance companies that wrote policies for the acquisition of gas stations and convenience stores, said Julie H. Hespe, chief underwriting officer for A.I.G. Environmental.
Lenders have shown varying degrees of comfort with the practice. The Wachovia Corporation has $3 billion in real estate assets protected by environmental insurance policies, while Washington Mutual has only $200 million in loans issued that way, out of a $30 billion commercial real estate portfolio.
"The key here is to be able to be flexible with our customers," said Malcolm D. Griggs, the director of corporate risk policy for Wachovia, stressing that the policies are much more appropriate for refinancing arrangements than for acquisitions.
Brian D. Walker, corporate environmental risk manager for Washington Mutual, said the bank was still proceeding cautiously into the market, partly because "we don't have a lot of experience knowing whether or how claims are going to be paid."
"I'm not real sure it works by itself as a due diligence replacement," Mr. Walker said.
An environmental risk official with a major national bank, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the policies were sometimes used to secure loans that banks would not otherwise approve. In a few cases where the banks know that the property involved has a high risk of being contaminated -- and would usually be disqualified from a loan -- the loans are still sometimes written when insurance coverage can be obtained, the bank official said. "We might want to make the loan from a customer-relationship policy."
Joseph L. Boren, president of A.I.G. Environmental, cautioned that the policies do nothing to protect the borrower and emphasized that A.I.G. did not encourage borrowers or lenders to use its policies as a substitute for environmental studies.
But David J. Jung, vice president in charge of the environmental group at Zurich North America, said his firm promotes the policies directly to lenders as a substitute for inspections.
"The product is a much better alternative to a Phase 1, because when you do a Phase 1, there's a time element," Mr. Jung said.
Debt rating agencies have put up significant resistance to the use of these insurance policies, and banks have been forced to listen because their loans usually become truly profitable only if they can be resold to investors as packages of commercial mortgage-backed securities.
"The issue of concern of substitution is something we've focused very intensely on," said Mary E. O'Rourke, a senior director of the commercial-mortgage-backed securities group at Fitch Ratings. Her agency has demanded that the policies cover the full balance of the loan plus 25 percent of expenses, like property taxes and unpaid interest, for the loan to receive a favorable rating for inclusion in a security.
No amount of insurance for lenders will protect the ultimate investors, the buyers of securities, from legal claims, said Abby L. Cohen, a partner in Philadelphia with the law firm of Dechert who specializes in real estate closings.
"If you're going to rely upon environmental insurance, you're not going to have information about the properties," said Ms. Cohen, who, along with Mr. Perry, leads a committee of the Mortgage Bankers Association that was established to study the use of these policies. "You're going to have a pool that will have more environmental issues and costs that the trust is going to absorb."
Mark H. Fackler, business development manager for ESA 1, a national environmental consulting firm based in Louisville, Ky., said that his firm had lost business to insurers, prompting it to develop yet another product, a hybrid of insurance and a stripped-down Phase 1 survey.
"There is a place for insurance, because there are limitations to due diligence," Mr. Fackler said. "To acquire a portfolio of gas stations with just insurance is foolish, but I've seen it happen. It has its place, just not on every deal."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
A Strong Rally Is Tempered by Doubts in Late Afternoon

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Shares closed higher yesterday for the first time in three sessions but pared earlier gains after a late-afternoon profit warning from the Philip Morris Companies, the cigarette maker, tempered the optimism. 
 Before the announcement from Philip Morris, the three major stock indexes had enjoyed a strong rally for much of the day, buoyed by rosy outlooks from technology bellwethers like Oracle and Cisco Systems and positive comments on an economic recovery from Federal Reserve officials. 
 "A lot of people came in today and said the market sold off yesterday, so they took the market up," said Todd Leone, a trader at SG Cowen. "And then around 3 o'clock, they said there is economic news coming out at the end of the week, Iraq is still weighing, the rate cut is over, earnings are over, there is not a lot to look forward to -- so let's take some money off the table." 
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 27.05 points, or 0.32 percent, rising to 8,386, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 6.76 points, or 0.77 percent, to close at 882.95. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index rose 30.37 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,349.56.
Shares of Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, weighed heavily on the Dow, plunging $5.95, or 13.8 percent, to $37.03. The company said it could not confirm its 2003 forecast because of soft domestic-tobacco volume. It cited an influx of cheap imported cigarettes. 
After the warning, the Standard & Poor's tobacco index slumped more than 13 percent, making it the worst-performing S.& P. industry group. 
Other losers included utilities, whose shares have been under pressure since at least seven companies said they had received subpoenas from a United States attorney in California investigating their roles in the state's power crisis. 
Shares of the Southern Company slid 8.5 percent, to $25.17, after it said it had received a subpoena. 
Shares of Cisco, seen as a benchmark for the health of American companies, rose 71 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $12.87 after the company said its backlog of orders was up from September. Analysts use such data to gauge future sales.
Oracle rose 45 cents, to $9.50, after the chief financial officer, Jeffrey O. Henley, said he expected a turnaround for the technology industry next year. He forecast a return to growth in 2003 for Oracle after two years of revenue declines.
Shares in Motorola, the maker of wireless telephones, rose 37 cents, to $8.75, after the company said it still expected to meet earlier forecasts for the fourth quarter. 
Federal Reserve officials played down worries about the future of the economy yesterday, setting an upbeat tone that economists expect the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, to echo today in comments before Congress. 
In response to questions from the audience after an address to an economic and investment conference in Pittsburgh, the Fed's vice chairman, Roger W. Ferguson Jr., said, "I remain optimistic that our aggressive policy will reignite a recovery that has showed signs of stalling."
Nevertheless, traders said issues like a possible military strike on Iraq and concerns about crucial economic data later this week had ultimately dampened the market's euphoria. 
"It was our first rally attempt, and hopefully we'll get some more attempts," said Donna Van Vlack, director of trading at Brandywine Asset Management. "There is enough incremental bad news that the weight is just the wrong way today."
In the bond market, Treasury prices were flat, losing strength to a rally in equities and the chorus of up-tempo comments from the Federal Reserve.
Much of the action was technical, with investors taking profits on longer-dated debt and unwinding a little of the huge curve-flattening trend seen in the last week.
Still, the risk of war with Iraq kept cautious investors in bonds, as did doubts about the ability of last week's rate cut from the Fed to revive the economy soon, no matter what officials may say.
The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 1/32, to 101 8/32. The yield was unchanged at 3.85 percent.
The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 108 29/32. The yield was also unchanged at 4.80 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Blackstone Group May Purchase Auto Parts Business From TRW 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
TRW, the military contractor that has agreed to be sold to Northrop Grumman, is close to a deal to sell its automotive parts business to the Blackstone Group for about $4.6 billion after months of stop-and-start negotiations, executives close to the discussions said yesterday. 
 The deal could be announced by next week, the executives said, though they cautioned that the talks could still fall apart. TRW came close to selling the automotive parts business in August for about $5 billion to Blackstone and the Carlyle Group, but the deal collapsed when the bidders had misgivings about the price. 
 Now that the asking price has come down and the Carlyle Group has dropped out, TRW and Blackstone have agreed to the deal in principle and are working out the details, the executives said. Blackstone and Carlyle decided to part company after several disagreements about how much they would bid, the executives said.
Northrop had planned to sell TRW's automotive unit itself once the deal with Northrop was completed, but the quick sale by TRW will make integrating the companies easier and will help it reduce debt more quickly. Northrop is still waiting for approval of its TRW deal from Pentagon and antitrust officials. TRW had agreed to sell its aeronautics business to Goodrich for $1.5 billion before its deal with Northrop to make itself even more attractive.
The auto parts business generated $10 billion of the company's $16.4 billion revenue in 2001, but it has faced increased competition in recent years in addition to a sluggish United States economy. 
After TRW rejected Northrop's initial offer and the bid turned hostile, TRW said in March that it would spin off the automotive unit within nine months. At the time, it said that it had begun preliminary talks with other companies that had expressed interest in buying all or part of the business.

HEADLINE: Retail Giant Asks Court to Protect Its Name 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Victoria's Secret, which sells women's lingerie and sleepwear through hundreds of stores and millions of catalogs, would seem to have little to fear from Victor's Little Secret, a gift and novelty shop selling sex toys and "Everything for Romantic Encounters" from a strip mall storefront in Elizabethtown, Ky.
 But "if there can be one store in Elizabethtown, Ky., there can be 1,000" similarly named stores around the country, ultimately diminishing the value and the very meaning of the Victoria's Secret brand, a lawyer for Victoria's Secret told the Supreme Court today in a major trademark case. 
 Victor Moseley, who opened the shop in 1998, named it Victor's Secret after himself, but changed the name to Victor's Little Secret a few months later in a futile effort to satisfy a sharply worded complaint from Victoria's Secret. Today, his lawyer urged the justices to "keep trademark law within proper bounds" by requiring Victoria's Secret to show that it had actually been harmed by the name of the smaller establishment. 
Mr. Moseley was appealing a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, which issued an injunction barring him from using the Victor's Little Secret name and leading Mr. Moseley and his wife Cathy, to call their store Cathy's Little Secret. The appeals court held that it was sufficient for Victoria's Secret to show "an inference of likely harm." 
The justices amused themselves by wondering aloud about such hypothetical variations on famous names as Kodak monkey wrenches, Budweiser bug spray and Delta peanuts. But no one doubted that there was a significant legal issue before the court: the justices' first opportunity to interpret a 1996 federal law, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. That law expanded protection for owners of trademarks by giving them a tool to use against behavior that falls short of actual trademark infringement but that dilutes the "distinctive quality" of a trademark.
The concept of "trademark dilution" appeared elusive, and the justices pressed in vain for a precise definition. Trademark infringement, which requires proof of consumer confusion, has been recognized by federal law for much longer and is not easy to prove. Victoria's Secret sued Mr. Moseley for infringement as well as dilution and lost on infringement, an aspect of the case that is not before the court.
James R. Higgins Jr., representing Mr. Moseley, said a company with a famous trademark should not be able to win a dilution case without showing "objective proof" that consumers' perception of the famous product had changed in a manner that had an adverse economic impact. The change in perception could be demonstrated by surveys, he said.
Mr. Higgins's argument was based on the text of the statute, under which the owner of a famous trademark can obtain an injunction against the use of a similar name that "causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark." By basing the injunction on speculation, he said, the Sixth Circuit achieved "a result contrary to the actual words, 'causes dilution.' "
Justice Stephen G. Breyer was sympathetic. "There is a pretty significant speech interest on your side of the case," he told Mr. Higgins.
Other justices sounded impatient. "Why is there not a public interest in saying you can't copy someone's name?" Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said, adding, "Your client doesn't come off well in this case."
Representing Victoria's Secret, Walter E. Dellinger said it was "critically important" to permit owners of famous trademarks to sue promptly at the first misuse. "The diminution of value may not be identifiable until it's too late," he said. "If you can't show that Victor's Little Secret produces a kind of harm, how can you stop the second, or third, or 500th?" 
The argument in Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc., No. 01-1015, included a historic moment, the 157th and final Supreme Court argument by Deputy Solicitor General Lawrence G. Wallace. Mr. Wallace, who has represented the government as a lawyer in the solicitor general's office for nearly 35 years, plans to retire. No one now alive has argued as many cases, and no career civil servant has ever argued as many.
On behalf of the Patent and Trademark Office, Mr. Wallace argued that a dilution claim did not require proof of economic harm but did require a showing that consumers were "diminished in their capacity to recognize the famous mark."
Before Mr. Wallace's argument, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted the occasion and congratulated him for his "many years of quality advocacy and devoted service." Then, looking up from his prepared remarks, the chief justice added: "That doesn't mean we are going to rule in your favor."

HEADLINE: Briton Is Indicted In 92 Hacker Cases 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va., Nov. 12 

 BODY:
An unemployed British computer system administrator was indicted here today on charges of hacking into 92 United States government computer networks, including some operated by the military and NASA.
 Government officials immediately said they would seek to extradite the Briton, Gary McKinnon of London. 
The extradition, if successful, would be a rare move in international cybercrime cases. 
 Mr. McKinnon, 36, was indicted on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity and one such count in New Jersey. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine for each count of the indictment.
"McKinnon is charged with the biggest hack of military computers ever detected," as far as the number of computers involved, said Paul J. McNulty, the United States attorney for the eastern district of Virginia.
Mr. McNulty said officials found no link between Mr. McKinnon, who they said used the code name Solo, and any terrorist group. While Mr. McKinnon was probably searching for classified documents, Mr. McNulty said, no such information was compromised in any of the attacks.
Mr. McKinnon gained access to information from networks on military bases throughout the country; two of the computer systems were at the Pentagon. One intrusion shut down the network that serves the military district for Washington for three days, officials said.
Federal officials in New Jersey said Mr. McKinnon was charged with tapping into a network of 300 computers at the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck, N.J.

PERSON: Vincent James Landano 

HEADLINE: Vincent J. Landano, 63; Cleared in 1976 Murder of Newark Officer 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
Vincent James Landano, who fought a successful 22-year battle to clear himself in the 1976 murder of a Newark policeman, died on Monday at a hospital in Toms River, N.J. He was 63 and lived in Manville, N.J. 
 The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Camille. 
 Mr. Landano had served 13 years of a life term in state prison when he was released in 1989 by a federal judge, who ruled that the prosecution had systematically withheld evidence. 
In 1994, a state appeals court voided the conviction and returned the case to Hudson County, which proceeded with a retrial. Mr. Landano was acquitted of the murder in the second trial, in 1998.
At the time of his arrest, Mr. Landano, known as Jimmy, was a 37-year-old Staten Island resident, an unemployed construction worker and a former heroin addict who had served prison time for theft.
He was accused of the shooting death of Officer John Snow during the robbery of a check-cashing office in Kearny, N.J., on Aug. 13, 1976. Officer Snow had been delivering $46,000 in cash to the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service. 
Mr. Landano, who at trial was implicated by co-defendants, was sentenced to life plus 15 years, and in the following decade he became a jailhouse lawyer, according to Neil Mullin, his longtime lawyer. When he was not pressing for an appeal, he was a leader in various social-awareness programs at East Jersey State Prison in Rahway, including those intended to steer young people away from crime.
In 1989, after long-stored and undisclosed documents turned up showing witness accounts that could have cleared Mr. Landano, a federal judge overturned the conviction and released him. Eventually, a new trial was ordered in state court in Hudson County.
In a second trial, Mr. Landano was acquitted of the murder charge amid suggestions that members of a motorcycle gang who were originally charged in the case had falsely implicated him to shield one of their leaders, a boyhood friend of Mr. Landano's.
Through it all, Mr. Landano became a symbol for frustrated police groups -- who sought justice for Officer Snow from a man they viewed as unrepentant -- and for civil rights lawyers who portrayed him as a victim of prosecutorial misconduct.
Besides his wife, Mr. Landano is survived by a brother, Andre DelCroix, and two sisters, Lucille Forissi and Roseanne Barone, all of Staten Island. Also surviving are two daughters from a previous marriage.

HEADLINE: Corporate Leaders Are More Pessimistic Than the Fed 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve officials expect the economy to improve soon, but corporate executives remain skeptical.
 Most chief executives of large companies plan to cut jobs next year to respond to economic growth that they predict will remain meager, according to a survey released yesterday by a prominent business group. 
 Offering a more optimistic view, several Federal Reserve officials gave separate speeches yesterday arguing that the economy was slowing gaining strength.
"There is no question that an economic expansion, an economic recovery, is under way," Gary H. Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a speech in La Crosse, Wis. 
Since the economy began weakening in 2000, executives have consistently offered more pessimistic forecasts than Fed officials or Wall Street economists have, and the executives have been more accurate so far. Last week, the Fed cut its benchmark short-term interest rate for the 12th time in the last two years, acknowledging that the recovery is weaker than it expected.
In the survey of executives, conducted by the Business Roundtable, 60 percent said they planned to eliminate jobs next year, and 11 percent thought they would add to their payrolls. The average company planned to reduce employment by almost 2 percent. 
"We're a pretty pragmatic crowd, and we're right in the middle of this," said John T. Dillon, the chief executive of International Paper, explaining the worries of executives. "And we recognize that our economy and our companies are operating at far less than potential."
Mr. Dillon, who is also chairman of the Business Roundtable, called the current growth rate anemic and said he was concerned by signs that consumer spending was slowing.
While very few executives foresee a new recession, almost two-thirds predicted that the economy would grow less than 2 percent in 2003, a rate that would almost certainly cause unemployment to rise.
Anthony M. Santomero, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said yesterday that he thought growth would be 3 to 4 percent next year. Private economists expect the economy to grow 2.8 percent, down from their earlier forecast of about 3.5 percent, according to Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter.
The economy could still fare better than the largest companies next year if small businesses or government agencies add many workers.
The survey, the first of its kind by the Business Roundtable, was conducted during the last two weeks, and about 125 of the group's 150 members responded. The members run many of the nation's biggest companies, including Citigroup, Coca-Cola, General Motors and I.B.M.
At a regularly scheduled meeting today in Washington, the executives will discuss how the government should stimulate the economy, Mr. Dillon said.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is scheduled to testify to Congress today about his view of the economy. When the Fed reduced its benchmark rate last week, by half a percentage point, to 1.25 percent, it signaled its concern about recent weakening but said it did not expect to lower rates again in the near future.
In their talks yesterday, Fed officials said that the continued overhang from corporate America's investment binge in the 1990's and the uncertainty of a possible war with Iraq had hampered growth in recent months. The Fed also released a survey of bank officers yesterday, showing a modest tightening of lending standards since the summer.
But the strength of the balance sheets of banks, the paring of companies' inventories, healthy increases in productivity, last year's tax cut and the interest rate reductions should all strengthen the economy in the coming year, officials added. 
Speaking in Pittsburgh, Roger W. Ferguson, the Fed's vice chairman, said, "The pieces are in place to engender a gradual strengthening in economic activity." He added that corporate investment in new factories and equipment "appears to have bottomed out and may be increasing."
Chief executives seem slightly less sanguine about such spending. Although almost three-quarters of them expect their sales to rise next year, only 19 percent say their investments will increase next year, and 24 percent project a decline. The remainder -- 57 percent -- say their capital-spending budget will remain roughly the same, according to the survey.

HEADLINE: New York's Law on Wine Is Ruled Unconstitutional 

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
A federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that New York's law barring the shipment of wine from outside the state directly to consumers was unconstitutional.
 The judge, Richard M. Berman of United States District Court, found the law, which requires out-of-state wineries to sell wine in New York only through wholesalers, to be discriminatory and intended to protect New York wineries. 
 He said the law provided "an impermissible economic benefit and protection to only in-state interests." 
The judge did not immediately strike down New York's alcoholic beverage laws and the system by which producers must sell through licensed wholesalers and distributors who sell to retailers who then sell to consumers.
But he scheduled a hearing for Dec. 5 at which he said he would entertain proposals on how to solve the constitutional problem. One possibility, he said, would be to eliminate the direct-shipping ban; another would be to eliminate exceptions in the law, like the one that allows wineries in New York State to sell directly to consumers.
But if the ruling stands, it would appear to clear the way for New York consumers to order wine from California, Virginia, and other states in person or on the Internet, and have it shipped directly to their homes.
"I'm thrilled," said Robin Brooks-Rigolosi, a Manhattan resident who was one of the plaintiffs.
"The most offensive part about the law," she said, "is that it was perfectly legal for me to order a bottle of wine from 400 miles away in New York State, but it was illegal from across the Hudson."
The plaintiffs were represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian advocacy group in Washington whose vice president, Clint Bolick, said the case was one "in which the wholesalers have really circled the wagons to protect their monopoly."
"This is a very good day for New York consumers," he said.
A spokesman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said, "We will review this decision, and confer with the governor and the Legislature as to whether they want us to appeal."
Lawyers for the wholesalers who were sued said they were reviewing their options. One lawyer, Randy M. Mastro, said, "New York's system, like that of most states, is an accountability system that makes sure that anybody who traffics in alcoholic beverages within the state is present and accountable in the state, and therefore can be held accountable for their actions."
Another lawyer, Howard Graff, said he felt a strong case had been made for the state's significant concerns "other than protectionism, but obviously the court disagreed."
In his ruling, Judge Berman made it clear that he felt the law erected an unconstitutional barrier against interstate commerce. He noted that the 21st Amendment allowed states to regulate the importation and sale of alcoholic beverages.
But he said that the legitimate state interests protected by the 21st Amendment, like promoting temperance, banning the sale of wine to minors and raising tax revenues, could be addressed through other nondiscriminatory means.
"One thing is certain," Judge Berman noted. "The central purpose of the 21st Amendment was not to empower states to benefit local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition."
One of the plaintiffs, Juanita G. Swedenburg, co-owner of a small family winery in Middleburg, Va., said she was delighted at the ruling. New Yorkers visit her winery, she said, and are unhappy that they cannot ship wine home. "A number of them are really very cross about it," she said. "You wouldn't want to hear what they say."

Yanks' Magic Number Is . . . Lower

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

DATELINE: TUCSON 

 BODY:
Brian Cashman says you will not see this number next year: $175,327,055
 "We were at a number last year," Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said yesterday. "We will not be at that same number this year. But what that number is, I'm not going to tell you." 
But the number will not be $175,327,055.
That was the Yankees' payroll this year, at least the payroll that will count when it is computed next year at this time. When it is, the Yankees will learn how much they owe the tax man. The competitive balance tax, which is what the commissioner's office calls it rather than the luxury tax, was not in effect this year. If it had been, the Yankees, based on the number the payroll won't be next year, would have paid $10,207,234.63. Combined with a revenue-sharing payment that is projected to be $45 million or more, the new labor agreement would cost the Yankees about $55 million next year. But the payroll won't be $175,327,055.
"Our payroll will be lower," Cashman said. "It just hasn't been determined how, whether it'll be via the trade market, via the free-agent market or a combination of the two. How, ultimately, we do it remains to be seen, but we will do it."
If Cashman has said it once this week at the general managers' meetings, he has said it hundreds of times. He has said it to every general manager he has talked to. He has said it to every reporter he has talked to. And he might have even said it to resort guests, desk clerks, bellmen and housekeepers. He has not said it to pool boys because he hasn't had time to spend at the pool.
In fact, when he received a call in his room yesterday from another general manager seeking a meeting near the pool, he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt and asked his caller if he minded meeting in casual clothes because it was the first time he had changed out of his everyday clothes.
Cashman is determined to cut the Yankees' payroll because he has been told -- no, ordered -- to cut it. George Steinbrenner is in a constant state of fuming over the new labor agreement and its economic implications for the Yankees. 
In a lobby conversation with a reporter Sunday, Cashman said, "Whatever I do, I have to cut payroll."
The reporter mentioned that baseball people snickered when they talked about the Yankees' cutting their payroll.
"Those are the same people," he said, "that dropped the collective bargaining agreement on us, and they were snickering and laughing after they did that."
The Yankees are taking it personally. But a look at the numbers shows why most of the other clubs were after the Yankees' money, justified or not.
Payrolls for competitive balance tax purposes cover each team's 40-man roster, are based on the average annual value of each contract and include $7.7 million in benefit costs. 
The Yankees' 2002 figure, the one you won't see next year despite rampant skepticism, was $45 million ahead of No. 2 Texas. The next largest difference between two teams was $10.6 million. The average difference between teams among the other 29 that followed in the payroll order was $3.1 million.
The amount by which the Yankees exceeded the Rangers' expenditure was more than either of the bottom two payrolls, those belonging to Tampa Bay and Montreal. Put another way, add either of those bottom two payrolls to the Rangers' payroll and the total falls short of the Yankees' payroll. Or this way: The Yankees' payroll was four times greater than the Expos' payroll.
"Our payroll is too high," Cashman said. "It doesn't need to be where it's at. It has no relationship to winning." How did it get there? "By a lot of hard work."
If baseball people weren't skeptical just at the idea that the Yankees would cut their payroll, they note that the Yankees didn't win this year -- at least not in Steinbrenner's definition of winning -- and suggest that the owner won't sit still if his lower-payroll team is falling short again. 
The tax threshold next year will be $117 million. Teams whose payrolls exceed that level will pay a 17.5 percent tax on the portion above the threshold. So even if the Yankees knocked $20 million off the number you won't see next year, they would still pay a tax of $6.65 million.
The approximately $3.5 million difference would hardly dent Steinbrenner's cash reserves. He has squandered more than that on a utility infielder.
Only two other teams this year had payrolls that exceeded next year's threshold. The Rangers would have paid $2,383,902 on their $130.6 million payroll, the Los Angeles Dodgers $526,609 on their $120 million payroll.
This year's World Series champions, the Anaheim Angels, ranked 15th in competitive balance tax payrolls at $77.2 million. The team they beat, the San Francisco Giants, was ninth at $96.2 million. Combined, their payrolls fell about $2 million short of the number you won't see next year.

HEADLINE: Ohio Firm's Woes Ripple Across Health Care Business 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL ONEAL 

 BODY:
The rapid collapse of National Century Financial Enterprises Inc., a large provider of cash flow financing, is sending hundreds of health care companies and their affiliates scrambling to avoid big financial trouble.
 Two of National Century's largest clients have sought Chapter 11 protection from their creditors, while the dubious status of two of the company's bond deals worth $3.3 billion has set off a spate of threatened legal action against National Century, J. P. Morgan Chase, Bank One and other firms involved in the asset-backed securities. Amid the meltdown, National Century's chairman and chief executive, Lance K. Poulsen, quit both posts on Friday and left the company, which is based in Dublin, Ohio. 
 Yesterday, the PhyAmerica Physician Group of Durham, N.C., one of the largest physician-management groups, announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 protection in Baltimore. The move followed a similar filing in Brooklyn on Friday by Tender Loving Care, a unit of Med Diversified Inc. and the nation's second-largest home nursing company. 
A spokeswoman for Med Diversified, based in Andover, Mass., said the parent company itself was close to bankruptcy. In an attempt to avoid a filing, it is planning to sue National Century, J. P. Morgan, Bank One and others for $1 billion in Massachusetts state court as soon as today. The company contends that the three companies failed to protect its interests in the two troubled bond deals. Another National Century client, Amedisys of Baton Rouge, La., said that it, too, planned legal action against National Century, Morgan and Bank One.
The legal free-for-all began in late October when National Century stopped making payments to hundreds of its clients amid its own financial woes. That called into question the value of $3.3 billion worth of bonds National Century had issued. Interest payments on those bonds are backed by health care receivables bought from companies like Med Diversified and PhyAmerica.
Red flags prophesying National Century's troubles -- from legal woes to management issues -- were in plain view for years. Yet until Oct. 25, Moody's Investors Service rated National Century's bonds AAA, the highest investment rating it had to offer. (Moody's has since downgraded the bonds to junk status.)
The company's bond sales also had the imprimatur of three of the nation's biggest financial institutions: Credit Suisse First Boston underwrote the bond sales, while J. P. Morgan and Bank One served as trustees. In addition, two J. P. Morgan bankers sit on National Century's board -- and one, Hal Pote, heads its audit committee.
Representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston, Morgan and Bank One all declined to comment.
National helped cash-short companies like Tender Loving Care pay expenses by purchasing their receivables -- future payments owed by insurers and government entities like Medicare or Medicaid -- and repackaging them into bonds.
The hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and other clients of National got weekly payments of cash -- about 80 cents on the dollar. The rest was split between bondholders in the form of interest payments and National Century, which took a cut for arranging the financing.
These kinds of bonds, called asset-backed securities, have been around for years, usually backed by mortgages, credit card debt or any other sort of asset with a regular stream of payments. In recent years, however, the assets being securitized have been ever more exotic -- like health care receivables and even truck- driving-school student loans.
Unlike mortgages, however, health care receivables are a dynamic, revolving pool of cash. Money comes in and out daily as health care companies deliver new receivables and old ones are paid.
The trustee bank is supposed to maintain a reserve fund worth 17 percent of assets to protect bondholders from defaults. This is a big reason for the bonds' investment grade rating.
This complex brew began to boil over in May when the Fitch rating agency warned that it might downgrade National Century bonds, which it did in July. It cited "increasing levels of defaulted and rejected receivables" and a lack of information from the company. This made it harder for National Century to issue new bonds, and the company soon ran into trouble finding the money to pay its clients.
In response, National Century began taking money from the reserve funds of two bond trusts -- NPF VI and NPF XII. When J. P. Morgan, as trustee for NPF VI, asked for documentation as to how this was acceptable, National Century stopped taking money from NPF VI and eventually replaced it. 
But the trustee of NPF XII, Bank One, is said to have made no such demand, so the company took about $300 million from that reserve fund, draining it to almost zero. At first, bondholders assumed the money went to buy new receivables. But in their motion filed in the Franklin County Court of Pleas in Columbus, Ohio, they say Mr. Poulsen admitted using it for other purposes.
Fitch pulled its rating altogether on Oct. 28. Moody's, which had affirmed its AAA rating after the initial Fitch downgrade, kept the bonds at investment grade until Nov. 6.
(Standard & Poor's Inc., the other big ratings agency, stopped following National Century's bonds in 1995 because "we didn't think there was adequate infrastructure to keep on top of the pool" of receivables, said Ted Burbage, a managing director in S.& P.'s structured finance group.)
There were other signs of trouble, too. National Century has been the co-defendant in several suits, one of them charging fraud; it was settled for $4.7 million. Moreover, public records as far back as 2000 show that National Century was advancing significantly more cash to one of its biggest clients -- PhyAmerica -- than it was due. In a press release Monday, Med Diversified claimed that it, too, was overfinanced, contending that National Century had advanced it an excess of money so that it could collect more fees.
National Century may have overfinanced its clients because the process is hard to manage. But the company or its board members also owned big equity stakes in many of them -- including a 33 percent stake in Med Diversified. The bondholder motion filed in Ohio on Friday claims Mr. Poulsen admitted that National and related parties own equity in 56 percent of the companies whose receivables it buys. If true, that would be a conflict of interest since it puts National Century on both sides of the transaction most of the time.
Investors are now questioning almost every figure released by National Century. In a conference call with Moody's on Oct. 30, bondholders were told that instead of turning over every 60 days as they had expected, the receivables in NPF XII were turning over every 180 days. There were significantly fewer performing assets in the trust than the $2.1 billion bondholders expected.
Outside experts are now trying to sort out the books. National Century's independent board members -- two J. P. Morgan bankers, including Mr. Pote -- have pushed the company to hire a turnaround firm called Alvarez & Marsal to manage the company. Bondholders have retained the investment bankers Houlihan Loke Howard & Zukin to perform a forensic audit of the receivable pools. But for the largely unregulated business of securitizing health care receivables, the damage may already have been done.
"You had one extremely bad apple, but there's going to be enormous disruption in the market," said an executive at a competing health care receivables company, who asked not to be named. That is a problem, since many health care companies face long delays in collecting claims and do not have the cash to operate until they are paid.
"Take away any kind of liquidity and a lot of companies will go out of business," the competitor said.

HEADLINE: A Walkout By Teachers Is Averted In Ridgewood 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: RIDGEWOOD, N.J., Nov. 12 

 BODY:
The Ridgewood school board and the union representing its teachers reached a tentative contract agreement late today, averting a strike in one of New Jersey's highest-achieving school districts.
 The agreement came during the second day of intense negotiations between the two sides. This morning, the union representing the district's 420 teachers, counselors and aides voted against striking today, telling its members to report for work because progress was being made in the talks. 
 The tentative pact ended two days of anxiety for many parents in this affluent Bergen County suburb who were steeling themselves for the prospect of the first strike in the district's history. 
Around 7:30 tonight, Karen Joseph, the chief spokeswoman for the union, the Ridgewood Education Association, quelled all talk of a walkout in the 5,200-student district by announcing that a deal had been agreed upon.
She declined to reveal the terms of the contract, saying they would be presented to union members at an early-morning information meeting on Wednesday. A ratification vote has not yet been scheduled, she said.
"The bargaining team is satisfied," she said.
Earlier today, school district officials said they were confident that an agreement would be reached. "Reasonable people can do reasonable things," said Bill Carbone, a district spokesman.
The major sticking points in the talks, which began before the last contract expired in June, were medical insurance and salaries. The union wanted its members to be covered by the New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan, which covers most of the state's teachers, police officers, firefighters and other public employees.
The school board's contract proposal would have required all newly hired union members, including teachers, to join a preferred-provider organization to receive medical benefits. Under that proposal, teachers currently employed by the district would be allowed to keep their insurance plans.
School board officials said the switch in benefits for new teachers would not save Ridgewood appreciable money in the short term. But some board estimates put future savings as high as $600,000 a year.
In the previous contract, the board won the right to have new employees join a preferred-provider plan for three years and then be eligible to choose a traditional plan. The board's most recent proposal would have eliminated that option.
The union countered that the state plan would also offer significant savings and said that a switch to that plan would alleviate high premiums for its members. Ms. Joseph, the union spokeswoman, would not say how that issue had been resolved. 
Wages have been another contentious issue. The district has proposed 4 percent pay increases in each year of a three-year agreement. The union has long argued that increases for the district's teachers, whose median salary is $65,000, should be comparable to recent raises in other district. It asked for increases of about 6 percent each year.
The contract talks have riveted this village of 18,000, where the school district, whose students consistently have among the highest SAT scores in the state, is a source of intense civic pride. The union and the school district have taken turns playing to the news media and selling their positions to the public in impromptu news briefings.
Many parents here were anxious about the possibility of a strike and some seemed resigned to the likelihood that one would be called.
"The teachers got to do what they got to do," said Liz Youmans, 42, who has three children in Ridgewood schools. "I support the teachers." 
Other parents noted that the current uncertain economic climate made such negotiations even harder. 
"It's a difficult situation," said Liz Gordon, the mother of three students in the district. "Both sides have some right in their positions. I just hope they can come to the middle."

HEADLINE: Japanese Growth Falls to 0.7%; Slower Pace Expected This Winter 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Japan's economic recovery slowed during the summer, with third-quarter growth dropping to 0.7 percent from 1 percent in the spring, figures released early today showed.
 And with growth in exports falling and consumer spending looking weak for the coming holiday season, economists predict that the summer's annual growth rate of 3 percent will evaporate this winter. 
 "The economy continues to pick up, but as I expected the pace has become more moderate," Heizo Takenaka, the minister for economic and fiscal policy, said today.
On Tuesday, his office scaled back its assessment of Japan's economy for the first time in a year, citing the slower exports and risks from a weakening in overseas economies. 
"We have hopes that the signs of improvement in the economy will continue, but there are various uncertainties that will require close monitoring," Mr. Takenaka said, adding that "concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy and continued depreciation in Japanese stock prices are increasing risks" to the nation's economy.
While today's figures showed a healthy 0.8 percent increase in personal consumption for the quarter, one forward-looking economic indicator -- private capital investment -- fell 0.9 percent. 
Economists predict a sluggish winter for Japan. In the United States, the most important export market for Japan, the sales of computer chips and cellphones have been soft, and electronics exporters like Sony and Hitachi have been trimming back their sales forecasts.
Making matters more difficult for exporters, the value of the yen has risen 5 percent against the dollar over the last three weeks. Alarmed, the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, threatened on Tuesday to take action to weaken the currency. "If the yen were to rise further, I think it would be unnatural," Mr. Shiokawa said at a news conference.
Consumer spending, which accounts for some 56 percent of economic activity here, is expected to decline further as workers receive shrinking December bonuses.
The stock market has been plumbing new 19-year lows, with the benchmark Nikkei index late this morning at 8,410.53. Unemployment is near a postwar high at 5.4 percent; insecurity about the future is prompting a nation of habitual savers to spend even less than usual.
Economists say that the pessimism gripping many Japanese is holding back entrepreneurship and growth. And that pessimism is deep, according to a survey of 1,061 people conducted last weekend for Kyodo News. Some 71 percent of those responding said the government's latest plans to combat deflation would not solve anything. Only 4 percent expressed any optimism that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi would succeed in improving the economy.
Mr. Koizumi has said that dealing quickly with the country's banking crisis -- substantially a matter of bad loans -- should be a top priority, even if that might harm the broad economy in the short term. But 61 percent of those surveyed said reviving the economy should come ahead of solving the bank crisis.
Last Friday, the Japanese financial services agency released figures indicating that bad loans at the 15 largest banks had reached $395 billion, 36 percent more than previously estimated.
Mr. Takenaka, whose plans for rapidly addressing the loan problem have been thwarted in recent weeks by bankers and their conservative political allies, also estimated that the banks would ultimately have to write off $128 billion worth of loans, 47 percent above the previous estimate. "The bad loans that the banks are publicly owning up to make up 10 percent of Japan's gross domestic product," Takeshi Kimura, a member of the government's task force on bad loans, told a foreign investment fair here over the weekend. "But there are experts who say the problem is actually five times as big. Even if bad loans are 15 or 20 percent of G.D.P., that's a crisis."
What progress there has been in shaping up the banks has come at a snail's pace. For example, the Mizuho Financial Group, an unwieldy product of a three-way bank merger, is taking three years to complete a reorganization that will prune its work force and branch network by 15 percent.
"The bad-loan problem will be solved, but in 10 years, not in 2," an American bank executive here said.
A history involving widespread political interference in the economy has left Japan with rigidities and inefficiencies that inhibit growth. Not least are the heavy subsidies for farmers, which now total 1.4 percent of the gross domestic product -- more than farming's total contribution to the economy, according to a World Trade Organization report released on Friday. "Sustained recovery would appear to hinge on structural reforms," it said, adding that an important element "is regulatory reform, particularly to reduce economic intervention in several sectors."
In an economy where many officials continue to think they can pick winners better than the market can, Mr. Shiokawa, the finance minister, estimated that the government would pump $83 billion into a new agency that is meant to rehabilitate deeply indebted companies.
Japan accounts for half the economy of East Asia, but most of its neighbors are growing and it is not. The World Bank estimated last week that East Asia as a whole would grow 5.4 percent this year and about the same in 2003, but that Japan would contract 1 percent this year and manage only 0.8 percent growth next year.
Still, even a stagnant Japan is wealthy by many standards. "Japan is often compared negatively with our neighbor, China," said Takahiro Miyao, an economist and media critic. "But journalists tend to confuse direction with levels. Japan has a very high level of income; in China, the per capita income is one-fortieth that of Japan."

HEADLINE: Age Counts in Hiring, the Older Jobless Find 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Robert Linn expects that each day could be his lucky day, though it was winter the last time he had a job, and the wind is blowing cold again.
 An accountant, Mr. Linn was laid off nine months ago as a controller at Aon Risk Services. He still has a monthly $2,600 mortgage and tax payment on his four-bedroom house in Winnetka, a suburb north of here, and the expense of raising a family. He and his wife, Fleury, who works part time, have a daughter who is a freshman in high school and are looking ahead to college costs. 
 Mr. Linn's savings and state unemployment benefits, he said, are enough to tide them over until he lands a new job, although continued news of layoffs and a saturated market of highly qualified, and younger, workers offers little solace. 
At 58, Mr. Linn -- like many other Americans 50 or older who have lost their career jobs in a new, less-predictable economy -- worries that he may never have another job as good as the one he had, which paid more than $100,000 a year. Like Mr. Linn, some of the older unemployed say their hard luck in job hunting has less to do with their qualifications and ability than with their age. 
Age is "very definitely a factor," Mr. Linn said. 
"There are very few ads that say 10-plus years of experience or 15-plus years of experience," he added. "In other words, if you have more experience than that it's a presumption that you're overqualified or they don't want people that are older." 
His resume does not hide his age, and he said, "I respond to those ads and get no responses."
Economists do not know whether the downturn affects those in their 50's and 60's more than younger workers. A study by the International Longevity Center-USA, a research group in Manhattan, showed that times were changing for older workers. In the recession of the early 80's, the study said, men ages 45 to 59 were less likely to lose their jobs than those 25 to 39. By the recession of the early 90's, seniority did not provide as much security, and older men were just as likely to be laid off as younger men.
If and when some older workers land jobs, some experts say, they tend to find lower-paying, more temporary, low-skill or impermanent service or consulting jobs instead of those that they have dreamed of, those they have spent their lives building reputations and careers.
The problem is not age alone, said Hilarie Lieb, a Northwestern University professor of labor economics.
"The economy is not as strong as it was in the past, and demographically, there are a lot more people hitting this age," Professor Lieb said about workers over 50. "People expect to earn more when they have more experience. So they tend to be higher-salaried workers, which can be a deterrent for employers."
Mayer Freed, a professor of labor and employment law at the Northwestern Law School, said that "it's not such an unusual pattern for people to lose their jobs" in a sputtering economy and at a point in their careers where it can be hard to find re-employment at comparable levels.
"There is probably some preference given by employers to younger workers, and in principle, that's illegal," Professor Freed said. "Federal law is quite clear that it is illegal to base decisions like that on age. But it is not easy to enforce that law."
Some employers may prefer younger people, he said, expecting them to stay longer after investing time and money training them. 
"It may also be a result of stereotyped thinking, that people are on a downward slope once they reach a certain age," Professor Freed said.
A result is that older prospects are often left out in the cold. George Putnam, an economist with the Illinois Employment Security Department, said laid-off workers 55 or older were in general 10 percent less likely than 35-year-olds to find work. 
That may be bad news in light of the figures that show the Chicago unemployment rate through September at 6.3 percent, up from 5.4 percent in 2001. Statewide, the rate was 6.3 percent, up from 5.6, and nationally it was 5.6, up from 5 percent. 
Workers across the spectrum have been affected. Bogdan Polowniak, a union bricklayer for 20 years, made $30.15 an hour until he was recently laid off. Mr. Polowniak, 47, wearing an American flag bandanna on his head at an unemployment office here, said he was wondering whether his best days were behind him. He is married with three children.
"There's work going on, but not enough for everybody," Mr. Polowniak said. "I think they're always looking for younger people. They're stronger, faster. The older you get, you slow down a little bit."
His friend Stan Puckowski, 51, who went to the office with him and is also a bricklayer, considers himself lucky not to have a family to worry about. But, Mr. Puckowski said, being jobless means that he has no money to send to relatives in Poland.
If not for his veteran's benefits, Charles Curtis, 51, an unemployed construction worker, said he would "be in trouble." Mr. Curtis said that his unemployment benefits had run out long ago and that he was living off food stamps. 
"I'm out here trying every day to work," he said. "It's just discouraging."
What is an older worker to do?
Like Mr. Linn, Tom Walsh, 60, has turned to Operation ABLE, which stands for Ability Based on Long Experience. The agency here helps unemployed workers, with emphasis for those over 50, in finding jobs and training. Mr. Walsh, a computer programmer, lost his job a year ago in layoffs at Sears, where he had worked for 15 years.
"I've had people tell me I'll probably never work in that field again," he said. "I'm a little more optimistic."
Mr. Walsh lives in suburban Park Ridge in a $300,000 house. He and his wife, a personnel manager, have two children. He figures that he is far better off than some people who have lost their jobs, because "in my case it's not a case of how we're going to put groceries on the table."
Meanwhile, Mr. Walsh continues to hunt, as well as hope.
The good and bad news, said Durant Hunter, president of Whitehead Mann, a recruiter based in New York City, is that people over 50 are hired every day, though he said that was the exception rather than the rule. 
"As an executive recruiter," Mr. Hunter said, "I have rarely had someone say, 'Can you find me someone over 50 for this job?' It is almost always, 'Find me someone 35 to 45.' "
Mr. Hunter added that most people did not have such notable success. 
Mr. Linn, an accountant at an insurance company for 19 years, until 1999, has had two jobs since then, including the one at Aon. He said he had not given up hope. Dipping into savings "probably means I'll just have to work longer," Mr. Linn said. 
He said he believed that "the economy is getting better," though he heard from a friend that an advertisement for a controller's position in a newspaper drew 800 responses.
He intends to keep looking, he said, figuring that someone somewhere is looking for "a participative and collaborative manager that gets things done and meets deadlines in a timely and accurate manner."

HEADLINE: Tornado Rips Tradition From a Town 

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN 

DATELINE: CARBON HILL, Ala., Nov. 12 

 BODY:
For people here, schools are not just buildings that can be rebuilt bigger and better. They are singular places, of community tradition, memory and pride.
 That is why it was so devastating this summer when Carbon Hill High School burned to the ground. That is why, five months later, teachers, parents and children feel about as uprooted as downed trees after a tornado on Sunday ripped apart the city's only other school, Carbon Hill Elementary. 
 It was not the fanciest building in town. In some ways, the aging brick campus on top of the hill looked kind of sad. "But I hear it every day, 'It was where I went and my daddy went and my daddy before that,' " said the school superintendent, Alan Trotter. "Already I'm getting pressure to rebuild the elementary exactly where it was. If we don't, all hell will break loose."
No power. No phones. No heat. These are practical worries in a post-tornado town. But as residents in Carbon Hill, a poor mining enclave in northwest Alabama, begin the slow crawl back to normalcy, it is the loss of institutions, like churches and schools, that is truly overwhelming.
Even the students, who should be ruling the streets thanks to the sudden godsend of a week off, seemed upset.
"It's good we don't have to go to school," said a seventh grader, Craig Tyndall. "But it's bad because we don't have a school."
He spent the day drifting around with a band of unwashed boys (many homes are without water), watching new power poles get planted in the ground.
The streets here smelled like fresh pine from all the giant trees split by the wind. Starting at daybreak, men in beat-up tractors came steaming in from the farmlands, volunteering to help. With cigarettes hanging out of their mouths they cut up tree limbs and dragged them away.
Around lunch, several women arrived in town with plastic bowls of food covered in sweating Saran Wrap. Others cooked beef stew at a Red Cross shelter.
According to Mayor James Richardson, half the homes in Carbon Hill were damaged by the tornados that swarmed the area on Sunday night. Ten people in surrounding Walker County were killed, most of them by falling trees. More than 50 people were injured.
But, looking ahead, it is the public schools, the mayor said, that pose the biggest problem.
"Kids got to be in class," Mr. Richardson said. "And it's like a bad omen. Losing both of our schools in one year? How are we supposed to handle that?"
In Carbon Hill, population 2,100, more than 60 percent of the students are on subsidized lunches. Many fathers are out-of-work coal miners, anchorless after the mines that gave Carbon Hill its name dried up. The city budget is around $2 million a year, less than half the cost of a new elementary school.
But the gritty economic situation is also a reason people here are so attached to their schools. College is not on everyone's radar screen. Many people who are born here stay here. In this self-contained world, the memories from the good ol' days are deposited just down the street.
"Oh, buddy, high school," said Tabitha Keene, a nursing student who used to go to Carbon Hill High. "If only these walls could talk. Maybe it's good they're not standing anymore."
This summer the first blow came.
It was June 27, around 9 p.m., when the high school burst into flames.
The cause was an electrical fire. The school, built in 1936, was destroyed.
Since then, the 330 high school students have been shoehorned into 18 aluminum trailers. For lunch they ate next door at the elementary school, which actually is K through 8, though everybody still calls it "the elementary."
But that all changed Sunday night. At 7:18 p.m. -- the yellowed wall clocks are frozen on the minute -- a tornado packing winds of 200 miles an hour arrived at the school with a vengeance. It sucked the roof away. It toppled brick walls. It grabbed gravel from the playground and hurled it through the school's windows, leaving so many neat little holes it looks as if someone peppered the school with a machine gun.
"It's a total loss," said Mr. Trotter, as he surveyed the 40-year-old school today. "We'll salvage what we can. We'll bulldoze the rest."
Mr. Trotter said that a few months ago when he suggested finding a new location for the high school, he received "a whole bunch of angry letters."
"Everybody in this community really identifies with these schools," Mr. Trotter said. "They are hubs. People don't want them to change."
The other hubs in the community are the numerous churches that dot the hillsides. Many were heavily damaged, including a rural Baptist church that was leveled and the oldest black church in the county, which now has an oak tree on its roof.
This evening, officials decided the only solution to the school problem was to have both the high schoolers and the 540 elementary students share the portable classrooms, at least until more trailers can be found. The younger students will go to school in the morning; the older ones will come in the afternoon. One idea for subsidized meals was giving the younger kids a sack lunch to eat on the bus ride home.
"It's been an unbelievable year," said the Walker County chairman, Bruce Hamrick.
As night fell on Carbon Hill, candles flickered in many windows. With more than 100 utility poles down, electricity is not expected back on for another week.
Without TV or video games, teenagers had little to do but stand in sweatshirts outside of cold homes and talk in the darkness.
One thing was kind of nice, though. The smell of wood-burning fires. If Carbon Hill has anything these days, it is plenty of freshly sawed firewood.

Chief Executive Is Replaced at CMR

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
David Peeler, the president and chief executive at CMR in New York, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending in major media, has left the company.
 The company said yesterday that Mr. 
Peeler, who had worked for CMR since 1995, was succeeded, effective immediately, by Steven J. Fredericks, 56, who had been president and chief executive at JassNet, formerly Yack Inc., an Internet program guide in New York. 
 Justine Carroll, a spokeswoman for CMR, said that the management of Taylor Nelson and Mr. Peeler had disagreed on various issues, and as a result, the company thought it was best to part ways.
Calls to Mr. Peeler at CMR were answered by an employee who said he was no longer with the company; Mr. Peeler did not respond to messages left on his cellphone.
Mr. Peeler joined CMR as a senior vice president and general manager of the Agency/Advertiser Group in 1995 and became president and chief executive in 2000.

Holocaust Survivors Relive Past In Case Against Swiss Banks

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
In his Manhattan office, Robert M. Kaufman thumbed a fresh photocopy of a list his father compiled in 1938 to comply with Nazi laws requiring Jews to itemize their property. Among the possessions in the family's Vienna apartment, his father told officials 64 years ago, were two baskets, 42 soupspoons and a 10-by-13-foot carpet.
 "This has brought back so many memories," said Mr. Kaufman, who is now 72 and a prominent New York lawyer. The details on the form he first saw this summer, he said recently, brought back images of a life long ago, before his family came to the United States as refugees in 1939. He could picture, he said, the apartment he last saw as a 9-year-old, with its big Viennese stove where he had once slyly warmed a thermometer to avoid school. 
 Robert Kaufman is among nearly 40,000 people who have filed claims under a $1.25 billion settlement of a class action suit in Federal District Court in Brooklyn in 2000. The suit was the definitive American legal case against Swiss banks on behalf of Holocaust victims for lost or looted Nazi-era accounts. Mr. Kaufman and about 500 others were among the first to receive payments this past year, which ranged from $1,200 to more than $4 million. 
But the process, some of the claimants say, has stirred up recollections of everyday life before the Nazi era. The judge in the Brooklyn case, Edward R. Korman, set up a tribunal in Zurich to review claims, and the lawyers there sometimes provoke powerful emotions when they call survivors to gather information.
"They are sitting in their house doing their everyday activities," said Dov Rubinstein, a lawyer who helps run the tribunal, "and then you call them and you take them back 60 years."
To make claims, people all over the world are reconstructing family histories and studying old documents, as Mr. Kaufman did when investigators sent him his family's property form. The histories are used to try to establish a family relationship to depositors who were victims of Nazi persecution.
Erna Frischer, an 83-year-old widow from Forest Hills, Queens, said in a recent interview that there were few days when she did not think of her father, who died as the war was beginning, or her mother, who was killed at Auschwitz. Even so, she said, the claims process "brought it all again to the surface."
An 80-year-old retired scientist, who loathes the attention that a sudden cash award will bring and insisted on anonymity, said a young lawyer at the tribunal helped him prove family lore that a bachelor uncle named Leo had a Swiss account. Recently, he received $160,000. (In many of these cases, the amounts of lost deposits cannot be determined precisely, so the awards are estimated based on a study of similar accounts and adjusted for inflation.)
"I accepted it," the retired scientist said, "as a gift from the time of darkness."
On file in the Brooklyn court are hundreds of award decisions that Judge Korman has approved so far.
"The claimant stated," one says, "that his cousin, who was Jewish, was sent to Auschwitz in May 1944 and that because he had a hunched back, he was sent to the crematorium upon arrival."
A woman submitted an aging postcard her mother had received describing an uncle's trip to Switzerland. Neither of them survived the war.
One man wrote that he went with his father to the Swiss bank where the father opened an account in 1933, and that he could describe the interior of the bank building. 
Another man recalled the password for the Swiss account. Several said parents told them the money in Switzerland was for their schooling.
Another woman wrote of her fear that the Nazis might torture younger members of the family to get information about Swiss accounts. In the decision granting her claim, it was noted that her mother "died from starvation in the Budapest ghetto in January 1945, never disclosing the account numbers."
The investigations uncovered lost family stories. A Czech woman submitted a claim for the account of her father, a Prague patent lawyer. Using databases of Holocaust victims and matching them to Swiss bank records, investigators at the tribunal showed that the woman's aunt also had accounts, seven in Lausanne, Basel and Zurich.
The aunt, a concert singer, was killed in a concentration camp in Poland. The tribunal concluded it was unlikely that any relatives had obtained the money because of Swiss banks' practice of "withholding or misstating account information in their responses to inquiries." The banks have argued that such misleading actions were aberrations, not policy. The award to the Czech woman, approved last week, was $4.8 million.
Mr. Kaufman's journey through memories of long-ago Vienna began when a distant relative told him that she had noticed the names of his deceased mother, grandmother and a maternal aunt on a published list of people who had once held Swiss accounts. He was astonished, he said. Though he had heard of the Holocaust lawsuit, he had no idea that it had anything to do with him.
"Sixty years and suddenly this appears," he said. "I think I had tears in my eyes all that day."
Mr. Kaufman, a partner at the Proskauer Rose law firm in Manhattan and a former president of the City Bar Association, began gathering documents. He sketched out the family tree. Death certificates had to be pulled out of files. In the stark terms of many of the claims, he described the trauma of those times. He and, later, his older sister, he wrote, had been sent to England on the rescue trains known as the Kindertransport. He was 9 when he traveled alone in December 1938.
His mother joined them in 1939 with his father, he wrote, "who had first been arrested and sent to Dachau because he was Jewish."
The toll on Mr. Kaufman's family continued even after their escapes. Although his uncle and aunt, the younger sister his mother fussed over, also made it to England, his uncle was placed in a psychiatric institution where he later died. In 1945, his aunt committed suicide by walking in front of a London bus.
The 60 employees of the tribunal in Zurich compare the information provided by claimants with unpublished bank records and government filings. When a tribunal lawyer sent Mr. Kaufman that Jewish property census form from 1938, his parents' handwriting and the detailed catalog of their holdings down to their saltshakers, transported him.
"I was picturing our apartment in Vienna," he said. "I hadn't thought of it in 30 or 40 years."
The image of the big stove where he had mischievously warmed the thermometer came back. The memories, he said, made him feel closer in particular to his father, who had painstakingly listed those items so long ago. Even in Vienna, Mr. Kaufman said, his father had been a remote man. "He was much more reserved when he came out of Dachau," he said.
Years after his father died in 1976, the English family who had taken in Bobby Kaufman from the Kindertransport sent Mr. Kaufman a letter that his father had written in 1945. It demonstrated his reserve.
"It was a sunny Sunday," his father wrote, "just a few weeks after I had been released from Dachau concentration camp and a few days after I had left Nazi-dominated Vienna, when the train carried me, a free man again, through the plains of England. And I shall never forget the change which Bobby had undergone, whom I had last seen half a year earlier, shy and timid as if ever expecting an insult or something worse. And whom I found a happy youngster."
Holding that letter, Mr. Kaufman said it had surprised him because his father had not actually visited with him at the time, but had only watched him, apparently, from a distance. "In a way," he said of the claims process and its unexpected legacy from his father, "this gave me much more of a connection than I had ever had before."
Once in the United States, he said, his father, a successful importer in Vienna, never seemed to adapt to the country he had been forced to adopt.
When Mr. Kaufman got a check this summer, he decided to use the money to benefit refugees and immigrants, like his aunt, mother and grandmother, who had opened those bank accounts in Switzerland.
Under Judge Korman's order, claimants under 75 are being paid 65 percent of the awards that are based on estimates until there is some indication that the $800 million set aside to cover the bank claims will be adequate. (The rest of the $1.25 billion settlement fund is being used to pay the claims of other Holocaust victims, including slave laborers who worked for German and Swiss companies and refugees who were denied entrance to Switzerland during the war. More information can be found at www.crt-ii.org, the Claims Resolution Tribunal's Web site.)
In the decision recommending that Judge Korman award Mr. Kaufman about $200,000, the tribunal said there was no evidence that his relatives had ever received their deposited funds. But the bank records, the decision said, suggested that "it is plausible that there was a coerced transfer to the Nazis" of money in at least two of the accounts.
It took more than 60 years, Mr. Kaufman said, for the small step of returning money to the people who owned it. "And almost all the people to whom it happened," he said wistfully, "are dead."

KODAK CLOSES PLANTS AND CUTS ABOUT 1,500 JOBS

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The Eastman Kodak Company is closing two manufacturing operations in New York and Mexico, as well an aerial imagery business in Canada, cutting up to 1,500 jobs as it struggles to rebound from a two-year slump in film sales it attributes to a downturn in the economy. Kodak said it would close its single-use camera plant in Rochester next July, laying off about 500 people. Production will shift to plants in China and Mexico. The company will also shut its sensitizing operation in Guadalajara, Mexico, next April because of overcapacity in the imaging industry. About 300 jobs will be cut, but the plant will continue to employ 3,000 people. Kodak also announced plans to cut 550 jobs in its global manufacturing and logistic units, 150 positions in research and development, and 140 jobs at its Citipix business in Quebec City, which it is closing.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Niagara Falls: Senecas Get $80 Million Casino Loan 

BYLINE:  By Iver Peterson (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez)

 BODY:
 The Seneca Nation of Indians has secured an $80 million loan for its planned casino, but at a high rate of interest. 
The five-year loan was obtained from a Malay casino developer, Lim Kok Thay, at 29 percent annual interest, Steven G. Horowitz, Mr. Lim's lawyer in Manhattan, said yesterday. The loan was first reported by The Buffalo News. The interest rate reflects the high risk, Mr. Horowitz said, adding that the casino has not been approved by all regulatory agencies, is not scheduled to open until New Year's Eve, and in temporary quarters at that. "The governor is a big supporter, and that makes a big difference," Mr. Horowitz added. Iver Peterson (NYT)

DICKINSON, EILEEN DURNING

 BODY:
 DICKINSON-Eileen Durning, who was President of the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) under Governor Hugh Carey, head business researcher for Time and Fortune magazines, and Chairman of the Time, Inc. unit of the Newspaper Guild, died peacefully on Saturday in PA. She was 82. Eileen Mary Durning was born in The Bronx in 1919. She graduated from the Horace Mann School for Girls in 1937, cum laude in Economics from Bryn Mawr in 1941, and received her M.A. in Economics from Columbia in 1942. From 1943 to '47 Mrs. Dickinson was Time's head financial and business researcher; Fortune head researcher 1947 to 1955. She traveled the world for Fortune and interviewed Albert Einstein among others. In 1955 Eileen headed the NY State Publicity Division of the Commerce Department. Governor Harriman congratulated Commissioner of Commerce Edward T. Dickinson Jr. "on obtaining the services of a woman with a national and world-wide background of industrial and financial writing experience". Commissioner Dickinson and Eileen married in 1957, had two children, Mary Elizabeth and Edward T. III, and lived in Garden City. Eileen stayed at home with the children for ten years. Her husband died in 1969. She returned to work in 1971 as Executive Assistant to the President of Ithaca College. She was one of the first women to serve on the Board of Directors of a publicly held utility (NYSEG). In 1975 she was appointed by Governor Carey as President of HESC, which distributes over one billion dollars annually in financial aid to NY State college students. 
She served there until Governor Cuomo appointed her as his Special Assistant to analyze the impact of decreased federal revenue sharing upon NY State programs. She served on the Boards of: The Catskills Center for Conservation and Development, the New York State Health Advisory Council, Columbia Opportunities, and the Onteora Club. She was the daughter of Harry M. Durning, Collector of Customs for the Port of New York, and Johannah Hayes. Her daughter Mary Elizabeth Dickinson, her son Edward T. Dickinson III, M.D., two grandchildren, Alexander and Stephen Dickinson, her brother Harry M. Durning Jr., and her sister Dorothy Malloy survive her. Eileen was loving, funny, feisty, brilliant without trying, kind, joyous, and an inspiration to all who had the good fortune to encounter her. She will be missed. In lieu of flowers the family would like donations to either Bryn Mawr College, 101 N. Merion Ave, Bryn Mawr PA. 19010, or the Democratic National Committee. Funeral will be at 10:30AM on Thursday November 14, at St. Patrick's Church in Malvern, PA. Wake on Wednesday, November 13 from 7-9 PM at the Mauger Givnish Funeral Home, 24 Monument Ave, Malvern PA, 19355.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook; 
Lofty Debut At Houston Theater

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Keith Reddin's provoking but uncertainly balanced new play, "Frame 312," seems to be about how a significant public event -- in this case the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 -- resonates in private lives, in this case those of a suburban family some 30 years later. It doesn't quite work; the unlikely connection to the assassination that Mr. Reddin imagines for the family doesn't entirely square with the family's problems. A frustrating result is that the playwright's idea of the relationship between past and present remains hazy. 
 Still, the play, which posits a conspiracy theorist's explanation for the unsatisfying conclusions of the Warren Commission, has a sexy "what if?" flavor. And when I saw the play at the Alley Theater here, people left excited and rightly tweaked. 
 "Frame 312" began performances recently at the Alley's second space, the Neuhaus Stage, which was rebuilt and reconfigured after a flood destroyed it in the wake of Tropical Storm Allison in June 2001. It is a worthy enough show, but no one would argue that it is the theater's most significant opening of the fall. (Nor was a second new play, "The General From America" by Richard Nelson, a drama about Benedict Arnold starring Corin Redgrave, which just completed a run on the Alley's main stage and will move to the Lucille Lortel Theater in Manhattan later this month.) 
The big news was the opening of the Alley's Center for Theater Production earlier this month. Capacious, well appointed and unusually situated, it is designed to help propel the 55-year-old Alley to the top rank of American regional theaters. 
The 75,000-square-foot center sits aerielike in five floors on top of a 13-story parking garage behind the Alley. It includes a mammoth scene and prop shop with a 56-foot-high ceiling, a spacious costume shop and three rehearsal spaces, as well as offices for administrative, artistic and production workers that will undoubtedly be the envy of cramped and cranky regional theater employees everywhere.
It is an oddity, for its size, sure, and for its peculiar visage; there are windows on the building's top five floors, but below that, the garage shows a 13-story concrete monolith to downtown. 
Perhaps more remarkable is that the center has been bought and paid for during a declining national economy, not to mention local scandal. (Enron was a major donor to the Alley.) Further, this is a state that is not exactly known for its generosity to the arts. 
"Not that we wouldn't welcome the help," said Paul R. Tetreault, the Alley's managing director. "But we don't really have government support for the arts down here in Texas. We plan on raising $50 million without it."
The Alley's success in fund-raising is a testament to a distinct inclination in this city toward philanthropy in general and the arts in particular. Just a few blocks from Alley, a new $92 million arts palace, the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, opened in the spring, finances largely in place, adding two theaters and more than 3,000 seats to a downtown arts district that already had 12,000. 
"There is no more viable fund-raising community in the country, as far as I'm concerned," said Bud Franks, the president and chief executive of the Hobby Center.
To wit, without public money (unlike, say, the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, which has been lobbying strenuously for state support for its new building), the Alley has raised $23 million (including the $10 million cost of the center) in two continuing campaigns. The center was relatively inexpensive because the Alley, which is alone among downtown arts institutions in owning its building, has also owned the five top floors of the parking garage since it was built on Alley-owned land in 1984. Initially, the theater wanted to put an auditorium in the space, and construction of a proscenium stage was begun, but it was halted in the mid-1980's when the oil business flagged and financing dried up. The space has been used largely for storage ever since.
The new center is "an absolutely unique situation," said Gregory Boyd, the Alley's artistic director since 1989. He added, "No other theater can do this unless they have 75,000 square feet in a downtown building sitting around unused."
For the next phase of expansion, the Alley expects to complete one of its campaigns -- for capital improvements -- by raising $9 million by the end of 2003. The money would help overhaul the building that houses the theater's main auditoriums. The renovation would expand the lobby and include a cabaret, cafe and bookstore, among other amenities, allowing the Alley to program performances and related events like classes and discussion groups and remain open from morning until after midnight. The goal is to function as a welcoming destination, something downtown Houston sorely needs.
The second campaign, a $20 million drive to increase the theater's endowment, is expected to allow the Alley to double the size of its resident acting company from 12 to 24 people and to commission plays for them. (Already raised is $2 million.)
All of this is aimed at what Mr. Boyd said he hoped would be a renewed commitment to the company aspect of a theater company, namely the development of actors, writers and plays. Theater companies have built a lot of buildings in the last decades, Mr. Boyd said, but are theater companies buildings? 
"Who are the actors who are 20 now who will play Lear in 20 years?" he said. "A focus on company means you choose your plays driven by how to develop your company of actors. You do 'Henry V' because you have an actor who needs to do 'Henry V.' And you have to encourage writers to write big. With a company of 24 actors, we can do that."
As cases in point, Mr. Boyd mentions a young company member, Ty Mayberry, who will play Hamlet at the Alley next spring, and the playwright Mr. Reddin, whose next play, an ambitious work about the 19th-century Luddite rebellion, was commissioned by the Alley and is being rehearsed by company members at the new center.
"Frame 312," Mr. Reddin's current play, opened in London in March and had its American premiere at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta earlier this fall. In the play, a contemporary family goes through the kind of squabbling that signals an ordinary dysfunction. The mother, Lynette (Carlin Glynn), is in her 50's and has just become a widow. Her grown children, who dislike each other, are Tom (Jeffrey Bean), the elder, who is in a marriage strained by financial problems and the unexpected difficulties of caring for twin daughters, and Stephanie (Jenny Maguire), who is an alienated, cynical, smart-mouthed depressive. They have gathered in the backyard of Lynette's suburban home to celebrate her birthday, an occasion that quickly grows acrid with bickering and resentment. The American family, late 20th-century version: fragmented, chafing, combustible.
But like the Neuhaus Stage, where the play is being presented, "Frame 312" makes most of its hay out of a historical moment. The Neuhaus was once a cramped box with seats surrounding the stage floor in the Alley basement. But when it was wrecked by the tropical storm, its reconstruction instantly became the first priority in the Alley's expansion plans. It reopened in January with a larger and more flexible space, more accommodating to contemporary playwrights not accustomed to envisioning theater in the round. The stage now has a back wall and the audience is on three sides. Its extended length is nicely exploited by the director of "Frame 312" Peter Masterson, who mimics the play's shuttling back and forth in time between the 1960's and the 1990's by setting the different decades at opposite ends of the floor.
The play turns on a secret. Lynette is based on a real woman, a secretary at Life magazine who was among the earliest viewers of the film of the Kennedy assassination taken by a now-famous bystander, Abraham Zapruder. In Mr. Reddin's imagination, she has become the only survivor of the film's initial viewing. And now, 30-some years after the event, Lynette also has incontrovertible proof that the conspiracy theorists have been correct all along about a second gunman. 
The play, which seems to promise some revelations -- or at least insights -- into the assassination, is disappointing in that regard, making references to familiar details from the Zapruder film and to various conspiracy theories but focusing mainly on the imagined tale of how Lynette became centrally involved. 
And just as Mr. Reddin does not seem to know what Lynette's predicament means, neither do the actors. In an otherwise well-directed and well-performed production, none of the characters manage to seem credibly thunderstruck when Lynette reveals that she, an ordinary housewife, has for three decades kept to herself the answer to one of the most provocative mysteries of the last half of the 20th century. 
The play's unsatisfying conclusion made me think about the responsibility of having a good idea. It is an advantage, but you have to exploit it. The Alley Theater, with its new center and its big plans, is in that very position right now.

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Praises Mexico As 'Safe Haven'in the Region 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
While some Latin American countries are suffering from severe economic problems, Mexico and Chile have remained "relatively insulated," apparently reflecting investors' feelings that these countries are committed to sound economic policies, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today. 
 Mr. 
Greenspan, in a speech delivered to financial experts in Mexico City, specifically singled out Mexico. The country has been faring much better, he said, since it put in place the North American Free Trade Agreement, instituted a floating exchange rate and developed stable fiscal policies. 
 "This country now seems to be viewed by international investors," Mr. Greenspan said, "as a relative 'safe haven' within the region." 
That was a turnaround from the two decades before 1995 when the Mexican economy was battered by several crises, he said. 
A copy of his prepared remarks were distributed in Washington. 
Meanwhile, Argentina has struggled with a recession in the last four years, and Brazil has faced its own economic woes, Mr. Greenspan said. Brazil's new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, campaigned on the promise of helping Brazil's poor. 
Mr. Greenspan, in his speech, did not discuss the course of interest rate policy in the United States or the state of its economy, which has been improving, but in fits and starts. 
He is scheduled to deliver his views to Congress on the outlook for the economy on Wednesday before the Joint Economic Committee.
Last week, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point, the first rate reduction this year and the 12th since January 2001. 
Policy makers hope the latest rate cut will energize economic growth by motivating consumers to spend more and businesses to ramp up investments.

HEADLINE: Rarity of Black-Run Businesses Worries South Africa's Leaders 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: RUSTENBURG, South Africa 

 BODY:
The white mining magnates huddle around the head table, sipping sauvignon blanc and talking commodities at a gala luncheon for the Anglo American Corporation's platinum mine here. Patrice Motsepe, the lone black businessman at the table, jokes about fitting in.
 He nods toward Barry Davison, the chairman of Anglo American Platinum, the world's largest platinum mining company. "He's from the good-looking side of my family," Mr. Motsepe quips and the table roars its appreciation. 
 In many ways, Mr. Motsepe is indeed part of the family. He owns three gold mines and employs about 5,500 workers; five months ago his company, African Rainbow Minerals, became the first new gold company to be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in more than a decade. 
But these days, Mr. Motsepe often seems a lonely pinstriped figure in a sea of white faces. 
Eight years after the end of apartheid brought black politicians to power and black-controlled companies to the stock exchange, South Africa is faltering in its struggle to build a successful class of corporate titans from its fledgling black elite. 
For many of southern Africa's young democracies, changing the complexion of the corporate world is the next challenge. Repressive white governments no longer control this region, but their legacy lingers in the low skills and the lack of capital of many blacks. White minorities in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe continue to dominate local economies and aspiring black business exectives continue to struggle.
In 1998, nearly 35 black-controlled companies were listed on South Africa's stock exchange, accounting for about 7 percent of the market capitalization. This year, 23 black companies account for about 2.2 percent of the market capitalization, a decline attributed to a stock market slump, spiraling debt and poor management. 
Whites, about 12 percent of the population, still control the economy, the mines, banks, factories and farms. Distressed by the slow pace of change, the government is enacting new legislation and stepping up pressure on industry to help increase the number of black-owned businesses and black executives. 
"We've got to open up and broaden the ownership of the economy," said Mr. Motsepe, 40, who is considering listing his company on the New York Stock Exchange next year. "In the boardrooms, I'm often the only one."
Members of South Africa's new black elite have enough cash to buy sprawling suburban homes and luxury cars, or join previously exclusive clubs to play golf, but they lack the money to acquire meaningful stakes in the biggest companies, which include some of the world's largest mining houses.
Officials say that must change. By 2014, President Thabo Mbeki's cabinet recently announced, South Africa's black majority should hold major (as yet largely unspecified) stakes in the economy, which is Africa's largest.
The news has left white business executives and foreign investors jittery; whites own more than 70 percent of the land and dominate the banking, manufacturing and tourism industries. White-run companies control 95 percent of the country's diamond production, 63 percent of platinum reserves and 51 percent of gold reserves, officials say. 
Everyone agrees that such lingering inequities are untenable. White executives often point to Zimbabwe, where long-simmering frustrations over glaring racial disparities in land ownership have exploded into violence. South Africa hopes to avert a similar crisis by setting up an orderly system to give blacks a more substantial slice of the economic pie. 
But no one -- least of all government officials, who must juggle competing priorities -- knows exactly how to achieve that goal without causing the kind of economic collapse now seen in Zimbabwe.
While trying to redress the effects of apartheid, which barred blacks from owning businesses and from quality education, officials must heed the concerns of anxious whites, who fill a large share of the tax coffers. 
Earlier this year, panicky investors sold off millions of dollars in mining stocks after they learned that the government was suggesting, in a confidential memo leaked to the news media, that 51 percent of the mining industry should be in black hands by 2010.
Business analysts say the target is impossible to meet, unless the government plans to force mining companies to sell their assets below market rates. The government denies any such plans.
Officials said the 51 percent figure was merely a position for the months of negotiations that yielded an agreement with white business executives in October to increase black ownership of the mining industry to 26 percent over the next 10 years.
The companies have promised to form joint ventures with black companies, to hire blacks to provide goods and services and to train blacks for management. The government has forged a similar agreement with the gas industry. Accords are also in the works for other sectors, including financial services, electricity and tourism. 
Also in October, President Mbeki signed into law a bill that will provide mining licenses to companies based on criteria that include whether they are working or planning to work with black companies.
Next year, Parliament is expected to vote on a bill that will call on industries to set specific targets for black ownership, define empowerment and set codes of conduct.
The notion of legislated black empowerment still jars many white industrialists, but the months of meetings with black officials, particularly in the mining sector, have alleviated most substantive concerns. In recent months, share prices have recovered as investors have regained confidence in mining's future.
"Much of the mistrust that existed is being dissipated, hopefully on both sides," said Mr. Davison at Anglo Platinum. He is also the president of the Chamber of Mines, which represents the largest mining companies.
"If we're to avoid the economic and social and political trauma in countries such as Zimbabwe, we have to assure that the issues that have arisen there don't arise in South Africa," he said in an interview.
"More people in this country have to feel that they are part of the system, that they are benefiting from the system, that the system is working with them and for them, and not excluding them. I don't think there's any doubt that government and industry are in total agreement on that issue." 
But he and other white executives are quick to point out the enormous challenges. First and foremost is the question of skills and capital. 
Most of the blacks who have snared controlling shares in companies have had to borrow to finance their deals. Between 1994 and 1998, banks and other institutions were eager to lend money and support to talented entrepreneurs and to prominent blacks who lacked management experience, to compensate for the damage of apartheid and to win favor with the new black government.
Big mining and insurance conglomerates began spinning off subsidiaries and handing them to people like Dr. Nthato Motlana, an old friend and personal physician of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black president, and to Cyril Ramaphosa, a trade unionist who helped lead the negotiations that led to apartheid's demise. 
The early performance of the newly black-controlled companies exceeded expectations. In 1997 the leading "black chip" companies outperformed the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Then came the 1998 crash. 
Plummeting stock prices and mismanagement ignited a shareholder revolt at Dr. Motlana's company, which in 1994 had become the first black company to be listed on the exchange. Five years later he was ousted and his company, New Africa Investments Ltd., was reorganized to offer more accountability to shareholders. 
New Africa Investments passed into white hands, as did other companies, and lending institutions became much more wary of such "black empowerment deals." Many companies that survived -- including Mr. Ramaphosa's media and cellphone conglomerate -- are stronger now, but they are small in number. 
Some analysts complain that ordinary blacks see little benefit from these companies because many black owners rely on white managers.
Others fear that the fierce competition among white businesses for the small pool of black partners will lead to a surge in the number of black front companies, which cover for white companies seeking contracts.
The minister of minerals and energy, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, spends much of her time trying to allay those fears. She says white businesses have promised to help raise money to help black entrepreneurs finance new deals. She emphasizes training to ensure the development of black managers. 
She firmly dismisses critics who say the government is moving too fast. Black voters are already marching and protesting unemployment and demanding economic advancement. The government, she says, must act now to avoid "an agitated society."
"If you are on the side of established business who are benefiting and have always been benefiting, it's easy to tell people it's fast," Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka said in a telephone interview from London, where she was meeting with mining analysts. "For people who have waited all their lives, it's not fast."
She said her efforts were already showing signs of success: white companies in the gas industry have begun to sell subsidiaries to black companies. In the beginning of 2001, blacks owned 5.8 percent of the industry; by the end of that year, they owned 14 percent.
The BusinessMap Foundation, which tracks black economic empowerment, points to such successes. "There was zero black participation at the mainstream corporate level before 1994," said Jenny Cargill, the founder of BusinessMap. "Now you have some substantive black companies in the economic mainstream of South Africa."
But whether South Africa can significantly de-racialize its economy by 2014 remains to be seen. Ms. Cargill said there was no precedent in Africa for such a dramatic change in a country committed to the free market. (After colonialism ended, many African nations simply nationalized white-owned companies, which resulted in the near collapse of some industries.) 
"It was a gamble the first time around," said Ms. Cargill of the early efforts to set up black-controlled companies quickly in a country that lacks significant black capital. "This time around, it will still be a gamble."
There was much applause in May when Mr. Motsepe's company was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. But Mr. Motsepe, who runs the chamber for black businesses, was keenly aware of the failures that preceeded him. He was also aware of his strengths.
He knows his industry, having worked as a lawyer specializing in mining. He has hired experienced and accomplished managers. His gold company, which he founded in 1997, has found a comfortable niche: buying older, underutilized gold mines from bigger companies and making them profitable. 
Mr. Motsepe believes South Africa will change. But he said black excutives must keep their eyes on the bottom line if they are to succeed. 
"We have to prove that we are competent and that we are realizing value," he said. "You are only as good as your last quarterly results."

HEADLINE: Under Mayor's Latest Plan, School Cuts Total $215 Million 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER and ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will announce plans to cut roughly $215 million in education spending when he outlines a battery of budget cuts later this week, city officials said yesterday.
 Some of the cuts were put in place during the summer and fall, while others will be rolled out during the rest of the fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
 City and school officials have vowed to keep the reductions from affecting classroom instruction, saying they would move to eliminate administrative costs and staff positions, possibly with some layoffs. Some educators questioned whether the cuts could be made without hurting after-school programs and counseling services. 
Bloomberg administration officials noted that they were not holding the Department of Education to their original target, which would have cut more than $350 million this year. 
The proposal calls for cutting about 4.5 percent of the $4.8 billion that the city contributes to the Department of Education's $12 billion budget, the rest of which comes mostly from the state and federal governments.
The mayor had initially called on all departments to cut their spending by 7.5 percent. Although the schools were spared some cuts, the education cuts will still be a fourth of the roughly $850 million that the mayor plans to cut out of the city's $42.3 billion budget tomorrow, officials said.
While it does not immediately affect teachers or other classroom personnel, the proposal threatens to re-ignite one of the biggest budget battles of last spring, when schoolchildren, the teachers' union, hip-hop artists and celebrities held repeated protests against education cuts.
The reductions are being sought by a mayor who has, to a great extent, staked his reputation on improving public education in New York City. In June, Mr. Bloomberg succeeded where many of his predecessors had failed when he won control of the school system. The old Board of Education was disbanded, replaced by a new Department of Education, answerable to him. The mayor even took the symbolic step of moving school administrators to the Tweed Courthouse, right in City Hall's backyard.
Now that the city is in a fiscal crisis caused by the slower economy, the effects of the attack on the World Trade Center and unsustainable levels of spending in recent years, officials, including allies and some adversaries of the mayor, say the mayor's hands are tied. The city faces a shortfall of up to $1 billion this year. That amount is projected to balloon to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. So the city must make significant cuts and raise revenues, and of the portion of the budget that the mayor can control, the biggest expenses are among the hardest to cut: the Education, Police and Fire Departments.
The Bloomberg administration is already asking the City Council to increase the property tax rate by as much as 25 percent, which would raise $1.2 billion in the second half of this year, and $2.5 billion next year. Council members, who are being asked to approve the tax increase before the January bills are sent out, are balking at its size. Cuts to popular core services like education will also be difficult to swallow for a Council that has made "Education First" its slogan.
Mr. Bloomberg's aides would not publicly confirm or deny the cuts. Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman, said only that the mayor would announce his plans tomorrow. 
The cuts come just months after the city agreed to a contract that raised the salaries of teachers by 16 to 22 percent, in part for agreeing to work longer days. Those raises were paid for this year largely with a one-time infusion of state money, and city officials have raised concerns about how they will pay for them next year, when the expense will remain but the state money will not.
The first $100 million in education cuts began over the summer, started by the former schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy, and put into effect by his successor, Joel I. Klein, who ordered an additional $50 million. They were aimed at long-term planning money, unspent summer school money and significant purchasing reductions, school officials said.
Last week, Mr. Klein asked superintendents to cut their budgets by 10 percent, expecting to save $16 million more. His memo told them that "actions cannot affect any school-based services or personnel." Officials said such cuts, which are due today, could eliminate 100 positions from district offices.
Until late last week, school officials said, they thought those cuts, totaling about $166 million, would be enough to satisfy the city. Then the department was told that it needed to cut an additional $40 million to $50 million, which officials said could affect after-school and counseling programs and could reduce as many as 400 positions from the central administration, mostly by attrition. One official said layoffs were possible.
Still, school officials said that, even with the difficult cuts, relations with City Hall were much better than they were before the mayor controlled the school system. 
The school system was spared the brunt of the cuts in the budget that the city adopted in June. Mayor Bloomberg had originally proposed cutting $358 million in education spending, which the City Council vigorously opposed. After the complicated deal that gave raises to the teachers and control of the schools to the mayor, the state provided aid to restore about $300 million of that proposed cut.
In that round of negotiations, Council members said they were unwilling to cut education until tax increases were considered. Now, with large increases front and center, it is unclear how the Council will receive the proposed cuts.
Chris Policano, a Council spokesman, said that he would have no comment on any proposed cuts until they were announced by the mayor. 
Councilwoman Eva Moskowitz, a Manhattan Democrat who leads the Council's education committee, said: "This is a system that is plagued by a certain amount of waste and inefficiency, and I am all for eliminating it. But I have yet to see a budget cut that gets to that inefficiency. It always seems to be the case that the chalk or the after-school programs or the things that are really critical get cut. My hope is that this will be different."
Bertha Lewis, executive director of New York Acorn, which led many of last spring's demonstrations, said her group would protest the new round of education cuts.
"This is outrageous," she said. "There has got to be something that is held harmless. If, in fact, he is the education mayor, why, why would he even look at education? We already know that our school kids are not getting their fair share."

HEADLINE: Full-Service, Full-Size: Big Stores in Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By MARIANNE ROHRLICH 

 BODY:
FOUR giant home-and-lifestyle emporiums best known to mall shoppers are opening in Manhattan, from SoHo to the Upper East Side. They offer one-stop shopping and the breadth of service that small "boutique" stores cannot easily deliver -- amenities like in-house decorating services and in-stock merchandise that can be delivered the same day.
 "The economics of the retail business today is based on scale," said Gordon Segal, the chief executive of the Crate & Barrel chain, which tomorrow will open its second Manhattan location, a 28,000-square-foot store, at the corner of Houston and Broadway, in an 1894 landmark building designed by McKim, Mead & White. 
 Mr. Segal signed the lease with some anxiety just after Sept. 11 but watched with relief as his business picked up and decided to reach out to a customer who "doesn't travel to Madison Avenue." 
"There is so much competition now you have to be able to develop your own product," Mr. Segal said. "It's a harder and more competitive environment than it's been in 40 years." 
The second floor is devoted to room vignettes, with an emphasis on apartment living, including storage ideas and well-designed sleep sofas, as well an area-rug department. 
Buy Buy Baby, a six-year-old chain, will open its first store in Manhattan on Monday, at the corner of 26th Street and Seventh Avenue in Chelsea. The chain, which stocks everything from pacifiers to nursery furniture for children up to 3 years old and promises same-day delivery, is owned by Jeffrey and Richard Feinstein (their father, Leonard Feinstein, founded Bed Bath & Beyond in 1971).
Jeffrey Feinstein cheerfully referred to his 40,000-square-foot store as filled with "category killers" -- vast arrays in each category of baby product. "For example, we have 24 running feet, floor to ceiling, of safety gadgets," he said. That includes cabinet locks, oven locks, cushioned doorknob covers, even toilet locks.
Uptown, Robert Villency and his son, Eric, are overseeing two new furniture stores. Eric Villency, the president of Maurice Villency, a chain of stores started by his grandfather in 1932, is running its sophisticated new store on Third Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets, with an expanded selection beyond contemporary furniture. Shoppers will find everything from leather trays to bed linens. Robert Villency, oversees the new Roche-Bobois store on Madison Avenue at 35th Street (formerly Maurice Villency), which sells modern furniture from France. To lure customers from smaller stores, both offer decorating services from window treatments to floor coverings.
While some New Yorkers are unhappy about large stores moving in, Murray Moss, owner of Moss, said he welcomed the diversity. He pointed to the origin of lower Broadway as a street of emporiums. "Some people confuse the presence of large stores with a mall," he said. "In a sense, Ladies' Mile, with its department stores on lower Broadway, was an early mall, and those big stores replaced the small millinery shops. Now we miss the early department stores. I like any store that has a point of view and strong visual merchandising."
Jeffrey Feinstein says mothers will delight in amenities like the private nursing rooms in his stores. Most important, he said, is the one-stop shopping only a large store can offer. "Once they see a big store with everything in one place and plenty of space to shop in, they are sold."

HEADLINE: Cable and Wireless Says Overhaul Will Be Costly 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Cable and Wireless acknowledged today that the cost of overhauling its money-losing data services unit would be far greater than analysts had anticipated. It also reported a $7.2 billion loss for the first half.
 Shares of Cable and Wireless plunged after the announcement. In London trading, the stock closed down 36 percent, to 83 pence. American depository receipts -- each representing three shares of the company -- closed down $2.20, to $4.05, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Since becoming chief executive of Cable and Wireless in 1999, Graham M. Wallace, has set about transforming the company, which was founded 130 years ago to supply telecommunication services to Britain's colonies. He has made it a provider of data services like Web-site operating and high-speed Internet connections for multinational corporations. Along the way, he made several acquisitions, including two recent purchases in the United States, the Web-site operating companies Digital Island and Exodus.
But the shift into data services came as the market began collapsing under the pressure of too much supply and a weakening economy that drove prices for these services down sharply.
A growing number of investors have called for Mr. Wallace's resignation in recent months, as they watched the value of their holdings dwindle. But Cable and Wireless ruled out the possibility of senior management changes today, when its chairman, Sir Ralph Robins, told a gathering of analysts that the board continued to back Mr. Wallace and his restructuring efforts.
The centerpiece of the plan, intended to stem losses in the data division, known as Cable and Wireless Global, is to scale back operations in the United States and Europe by eliminating services to small and medium-size businesses in those regions, and instead focus solely on large multinational corporations. The changes will save about $:400 million ($650 million) a year, the company said.
Some analysts said they were disappointed that Cable and Wireless had not left the United States market entirely.
"A complete exit from the U.S. may turn out to be the preferable strategy," Richard Barker of Credit Suisse First Boston said. "But there is an awful lot of money and management credibility invested in this global approach, and that makes it hard to pull back completely."
The reliability of Cable and Wireless executives suffered a further setback today, analysts said, when the company disclosed that revamping its data business, including the elimination of 3,500 jobs and the closing of 19 of 42 data centers, would cost $:800 million ($1.3 billion), about double what some had predicted.
Most of the extra cost is related to exiting lease obligations, which turned out to be far more expensive than the company had estimated, Michael Williams of WestLB Panmure said.
"One of the big issues with this company is credibility," Mr. Williams said. "Once again, they've undermined their own credibility."
Cable and Wireless also said today that it lost $:4.5 billion in the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $:567 million a year earlier. Revenue fell 6 percent.
At one time, Cable and Wireless had a cash surplus of roughly $8 billion. But after making recent acquisitions, and buying back shares, the company said its cash reserves had declined to $3.6 billion.
Cable and Wireless is not alone in being caught by the downturn in demand for data services, Mr. Williams said. "But they misjudged, as did rivals, how ugly the market could get."
