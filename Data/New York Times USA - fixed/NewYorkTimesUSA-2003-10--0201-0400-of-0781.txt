WEIRTON STEEL PLANS TO CUT PENSION BENEFITS FOR 10,000

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 The Weirton Steel Corporation plans to cut 950 jobs and terminate pension and health care benefits for about 10,000 former workers and their dependents. 
Under a revamping plan filed yesterday with the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wheeling, W.Va., the company said it would create a new pension plan for remaining employees. Weirton said it hopes to remain an independent producer, but it is pursuing strategies to ensure its long-term survival in some form. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in May. Weirton, which is based in Weirton, W.Va., employs about 3,500 people.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: China: Foreign Exchange Rate 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 Trading in some foreign-exchange instruments involving the Chinese currency, the yuan, suggest that the government might be ready to let the currency appreciate in value. 
The United States Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, has been encouraging China to be more flexible regarding the value of its currency to reduce the United States' trade deficit with China. James Malcolm, a currency strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase & Company in Singapore, wrote in a report that he expected China to widen the limits on its currency gradually. Currency traders said an increase in the value of a derivative known as the 12-month forward contract rate indicated that a change might be possible in the next year.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE GOVERNOR; 
For Gray Davis, Great Fall From the Highest Height

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
The year that he ran for lieutenant governor, 1994, Gray Davis earned the distinction of winning more votes than any other Democratic candidate in America and was touted as a possible presidential candidate.
 Now, less than a decade later, he has earned another, less lofty, distinction -- he is only the second governor in American history to be recalled by the voters of his state. 
 "Tonight the voters have decided it's time for someone else to serve, Governor Davis said on Tuesday night. "I accept their judgment." He asked his supporters "to put the chaos and division of the recall behind us and do what's right for this great state of California." 
It was an ignoble end for a 60-year-old striver, a man who always showed promise, as a graduate of Columbia Law School, a decorated captain in the Army in Vietnam, and in 1998, the newly elected governor of the largest state in the country.
In office, he became mired in problems not necessarily of his own making: the dot-com collapse, the electricity debacle, the stalled economy and a budget deficit of $38 billion. But an underlying reason for his ruin, political analysts said, was a failing of political character: he was, essentially, a loner.
He did not talk to voters. He did not talk to legislators. He did not attend political dinners. He was not, in the vernacular, warm and fuzzy. He got his start in politics behind the scenes, and that was where he was comfortable.
Mr. Davis was a technocrat and a relentless fund-raiser. He made a virtue of not being a glad-handing traditional pol, saying that instead of bonhomie, he offered steady judgment and expertise.
But when the state was charred by an energy crisis and racked up billions of dollars of deficits, he had nothing to fall back on. He acknowledged that he was slow to respond to the crises, but he also blamed President Bush for a sour economy that has hurt all states. That did not sit well with voters, many of whom never warmed up to Mr. Davis in the first place.
"He is a politician who has won numerable statewide elections in this state without ever developing a reservoir of goodwill and trust," said Tim Hodson, director of the Center for California Studies at California State University at Sacramento.
He met his fate Tuesday night with a certain recognition of inevitability.
"It wasn't my happiest moment," he told CNN of seeing his name on the recall ballot when he stepped into the voting booth. "But I knew it was coming for a long time."
Mr. Davis started his political career behind the scenes by raising money for Tom Bradley, the former mayor of Los Angeles, and became chief of staff to Gov. Jerry Brown in 1976 at age 32. He represented Los Angeles in the state assembly and served as state controller for eight years.
As he struggled over the last 77 days of the dizzying recall campaign, he tried toreveal his biography in a personally compelling way. He did not make the baseball team when he was eighth grade. But he listened to his coach, and by the time he was a senior in high school, he was captain of the team.
"I grew up in the 50's when they taught you to keep your feelings to yourself; now I am in the world of Oprah and Jerry Springer," he said in August as he began to campaign in earnest to save his job. "It is tough. Here is this guy in the 50's trying to live in the world in 2000. All I can say is, we are doing the best we can."
Mr. Davis made obvious mistakes. He vetoed an overhaul of the workers' compensation system three times, vetoed a bill that would have outlawed racial profiling and angered the powerful teachers' union by proposing teacher testing and other measures they opposed. He signed a bill to allow illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses, after vetoing it twice.
But his problems were not just a bad bill here and a bad bill there. He was elected after 16 years of Republican rule in California, and Democrats had high expectations that he would reverse those policies. But he proved himself more conservative than they thought.
Garry South, a political adviser to Mr. Davis, said of Democratic activists, "The message that will come out of this is that unless you go right down the line and give them every single thing, they're going to crucify you."
He conceded that some of Mr. Davis's problems stemmed from "his own personal failings, personality deficiencies, being a loner. there's some truth in that, but the major political lesson is that there is no percentage and no future in being a moderate."

HEADLINE: As It Tries To Cut Costs, Wall Street Looks to India 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
Global companies have long taken advantage of India's large college-educated, low-cost work force. Now Wall Street firms, including J.P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, are joining the chase for more highly skilled Indian labor.
 J.P. Morgan, the investment banking arm of J.P. Morgan Chase, plans to hire a few dozen researchers in Bombay by the end of the year. Morgan Stanley, which already has investment banking and mutual fund operations in India, will employ a similar number of researchers this year, also in Bombay. Both teams will consist of junior-level analysts collecting data, analyzing balance sheets and working on basic financial models. 
 This shifting of more sophisticated work to India comes on the heels of a rush of call center and other back-office nonmanufacturing jobs here, and is seen by many experts as yet another phase in the latest drift of jobs to low-cost countries that began in the early 1990's with Silicon Valley companies. 
 Some Wall Street firms are just observing the research trend for now, though they already have a presence here. Merrill Lynch has an investment banking, brokerage and asset management joint venture in India as well as a technology development center to build proprietary software for its global operations. 
 And Goldman Sachs plans to establish an Indian unit with 250 employees working on operations and technology. But neither firm has moved any financial research to the country.
 Other skeptical firms are, however, being drawn in. Among them is Lehman, "though we are not big fans of business process outsourcing," said Peter Nag, vice president and global program management officer for Lehman in New York. Lehman has cautiously started a few pilot programs in Bombay for research-related tasks like data cleansing and creating presentations. The programs, which began a couple of months ago, are run by boutique Indian firms set up by former Wall Street employees.
 Other financial giants, like Citigroup, are expanding the Indian side of their corporate and investment bankingactivities. Citigroup executives did not respond to requests for comment on research being shifted to India. But the company's Web site says: "Citigroup's global corporate and investment bank has expanded in India rapidly over the last two years. Currently, the firm has more than 40 staff based in Mumbai working in investment banking, equities, and equity research departments." Mumbai is the local name for Bombay.
 There are two main forces behind the experimentation with research operations in India, experts say. Wall Street revenues are well below where they were when the market peaked, so cost-cutting is imperative. And the investment advice scandal involving 10 big securities firms that was resolved with a $1.4 billion settlement this spring has resulted in a heightened awareness of the need for fair and untainted research.
 "The downturn in the capital markets has collided with cutthroat competition among Wall Street firms to create pressure on costs," said Christopher Gentle, the research director at Deloitte Consulting in London.
 Such pressure is being felt across a broad spectrum of industries in the United States, and the farming out of all kinds of work once done only or largely domestically has been increasing rapidly.
 The total outsourcing of business-process jobs by American companies is expected to grow to $136 billion by 2015, from $4 billion in 2000, and create 3.3 million jobs, according to Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. An estimated one million of these jobs will move abroad -- a trend that dismays some American workers.
 China, India, the Philippines and Russia are expected to gain most of the work. And many people expect India to snare much of the highly prized jobs, like the kind Wall Street is starting to export.
 "India will see increased outsourcing of research in equities, economics, derivatives and debt research because of cheaper talent as well as language skills," said Andrew Holland, executive vice president for DSP Merrill Lynch in Bombay, a firm 40 percent owned by Merrill Lynch.
 India's low real estate costs and salaries make it possible for investment banks to sustain the necessary round-the-clock coverage. On Wall Street, salaries constitute as much as three-quarters of total research costs. But, Dushyant Shahrawat, a senior analyst at TowerGroup, a financial services consulting firm in Needham, Mass., said "a junior sell-side research analyst from an Ivy League school costs $150,000 a year to the company, while an Indian equivalent from a top business school would cost $35,000 a year."
 Hiring inexpensive junior-level researchers in India will free J.P. Morgan's highly paid senior analysts to spend more time with the companies they cover and with investors, a J.P. Morgan spokeswoman, Joanne Shephard, said.
 The number of Wall Street research jobs in India is still small compared with the thousands of back-office jobs being added each year. The National Association of Software and Services Companies, the industry trade group known as Nasscom, estimates that only 200 such jobs have been created in India so far.
 Sunil Mehta, vice president of Nasscom, said the movement of services jobs followed the model perfected by the auto industry.
 "In the auto industry, the engine could be built in Brazil, parts could be sourced from India and China, and the assembly line could be in Michigan," Mr. Mehta said. And now, he said, "global corporations, including Wall Street firms, are obtaining portions of the service wherever it is available at the lowest price."
 But shifting research is not as easy as shifting many other types of work, Mr. Shahrawat of TowerGroup said, and the trend will be slow growing, particularly for more senior research work.
 Among the impediments, he said, is that research analysts need to be in close touch with management of the firms they cover. 
 "An analyst sitting in Bombay will find it very difficult to do a competent job writing a report that values Wal-Mart's stock if he has never even been to Wal-Mart and doesn't have a close relationship with Wal-Mart's management," he said.
 He and other analysts foresee thorny regulatory issues in sending research abroad. "If it is anything more than basic number crunching and comes even remotely close to investment advice," Mr. Shahrawat said, "Indian researchers will be required to be registered as investment advisers, and have other accreditations." 
 There are other concerns as well. "The feasibility and risk mitigation aspects require much greater due diligence before we make any outsourcing commitments," Mr. Nag of Lehman Brothers said, although the firm's due diligence last year showed that India had a large pool of skilled workers.
 Still, experts see the trend accelerating. Mr. Gentle of Deloitte Consulting, which has forecast that financial services companies will move a million jobs, mainly back-office and technology-related work, to India by 2008, said, "I see a significant increase in research jobs as well." 
 That, he added, would put the total "in the thousands rather than hundreds." And some consultants say that higher-end and more complicated tasks could eventually shift overseas.
 At top Indian business schools, like the Indian Institute of Management, the prospect of a job with Wall Street firms has students excited.
 Gayatri Srinivasan, 24, in the graduating class of the institute's Bangalore campus, says she dreams of a job with a top American investment bank; she will be competing for her dream job with at least 50 of the 200 students on her campus. 
 "Imagine working directly for a Wall Street firm while continuing to live in India," said Ms. Srinivasan, who interned this summer at Lehman's office in Tokyo.
 Entry into the institute's four schools is highly competitive -- only 1 percent of applicants get in, said Ganesh Prabhu, chairman of placement at the Bangalore campus. Still, the average entry-level salary for graduates last year was just 600,000 rupees, or $13,226, for jobs in India.
 The jobs may not transport them to Wall Street, but Ms. Srinivasan and her peers feel that does not detract from the glamour of it all."It is not the location," she said, "but the job and the bank that matters."

HEADLINE: Seattle Paper Seeks Appeal of Ruling 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
The Seattle Times asked a state appeals court on Tuesday to review a lower court's ruling that prevents the newspaper from dissolving its 20-year-old operating arrangement with The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
 Last month, Judge Greg Canova of King County Superior Court ruled that The Times could not use losses sustained in 2000, a strike year, to justify ending its joint operating agreement with The Post-Intelligencer, which is owned by the Hearst Corporation. 
Under the agreement, The Times handles the business operations and the distribution for both papers. 
 Frank Blethen, publisher of The Times, whose family controls 50.5 percent of the paper, said Judge Canova's ruling jeopardized the paper's survival. "We have no choice but to appeal because the ruling threatens the economic health of our newspaper," he said.
A spokesman for Hearst said he expected Judge Canova's ruling to be upheld. "Mr. Blethen will not be able to achieve the goal he has had since 1985, to put The Seattle Post-Intelligencer out of business," the spokesman, Paul Luthringer, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Smart Money Is on Two For Nobel in Economics 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
If the bettors are correct, a man named Ed is likely to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science this morning.
 In the annual betting pool, with each entry costing $1, professors and graduate students in the nation's top economics programs have made Edmund S. Phelps of Columbia and Edward C. Prescott of the University of Minnesota the two favorites for the prize. 
 Professors Phelps and Prescott are among a group of macroeconomists -- people who study government policy, unemployment and other aspects of the broad economy -- who have the shortest odds in this year's pool. 
"Macroeconomics has completely changed," said David Romer, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who founded the pool in 1982. "And the only person who has been recognized is Lucas." He was referring to Robert E. Lucas Jr., who won in 1995.
Over the last 30 years, advances in the field have provided a much more realistic picture of the ways that tax policy or interest rate changes, for example, actually affect businesses and workers, economists say.
The most highly regarded macroeconomists also tend to be older than the most prominent academics in two other areas seen as likely to produce Nobel winners, the study of international trade and the study of auctions, said Siva Anand Anantham, a graduate student at Harvard who now oversees the betting. Nobels are not awarded posthumously.
Of the approximately 250 entries submitted, 35 listed Professor Phelps, who is 70 years old and perhaps best known for his work in the 1960's that described the idea of a "natural rate" of unemployment and its relationship with inflation. 
Mr. Anantham said 32 entries picked Professor Prescott, who has argued that pauses in technological innovation, as opposed to higher interest rates, can cause recessions. 
Robert J. Barro (26 entries) and Martin S. Feldstein (25), both macroeconomists at Harvard, come next on the list. Professor Feldstein, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan and mentor to a handful of top-ranking advisers to the current President Bush, is probably the best known, and most controversial, of the favorites. No other economist received more than 15 votes.
Participants in the pool can enter more than once, with the winning entries splitting the pot.
In each of the last two years, the winners of the prize have appeared near the top of the list of favorites, Mr. Anantham said. Over the history of the pool, the favorites have not usually won the prize in any given year, but have won it eventually.
"Almost everyone who's done extremely well in the pool has gotten the prize," Professor Romer said. "And almost everyone who has won the prize has gotten some activity in the pool."
Established in 1968 by the Bank of Sweden, the Nobel in economic science has been awarded to one to three economists each year since 1969.

HEADLINE: 2 Envoys Urge West to Stay Course in Balkans 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
War and bloodshed are much more riveting than peace, a basic fact of geopolitics that haunts the land that once was Yugoslavia.
 So with the United States focused on Iraq and Afghanistan, the two ex-diplomats most identified with peacemaking -- and publicity-getting -- in the Balkans swooped into the region to plead long-distance with the United States not to cut and run. They pressed Europe to pay attention and the Balkan leaders themselves to get on with meaningful reform. 
 For most of the 1990's, the world was riveted by four wars and the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II, claiming close to 250,000 lives. But the American-led campaign against terrorism, the postwar trauma of Iraq and Afghanistan, even the intensifying crisis between Israelis and Palestinians, have shifted the attention of the United States away from Europe. 
Just as bad for the Balkans, the expansion of the 15-country European Union eastward to admit 10 new countries -- most of them post-Communist nations that once admired a much more developed Yugoslavia -- will leave the region behind, deepening a black hole smack in the middle of the Continent. Preoccupied with absorbing these new members and writing a constitution, European countries have little energy, attention or largesse for laggards.
"We don't need you," Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who once administered Kosovo for the United Nations, said in Sarajevo. "You need us."
It would be hard to find two more hard-charging and media-shrewd envoys than Mr. Kouchner, the doctor who spent two years here, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the former American ambassador to the United Nations who negotiated the 1995 Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia.
On their five-day visit to the region via private jet, which was underwritten by two private foundations, the diplomats charmed and cajoled, lectured and hectored their various audiences, locking arms and proclaiming their friendship a la Casablanca along the way.
For Mr. Holbrooke, the most important issue was to keep America in the Balkans.
"Our troop numbers in Bosnia and Kosovo are relatively small, but their symbolic importance is great," Mr. Holbrooke told the legislative assembly of Kosovo on Monday. "Withdrawal would put the policies we embarked on four years ago at risk and send the wrong message to Afghanistan and Iraq: that Americans, impatient as always, do not finish the job."
In a less guarded moment, Mr. Holbrooke said an American withdrawal would encourage enemies in places like Iraq and Afghanistan to kill even more Americans. "The Bush administration is profoundly wrong," he said. "I want to take them on."
For some, Mr. Holbrooke had a personal agenda as well. "He's bringing back Dayton. He's bringing back himself," said Ivan Vejvoda, executive director of a new Balkan project under the German Marshall Fund, one sponsor of the trip. Still, Mr. Vejvoda added, "he is the major figure in the U.S. who can raise the Balkans."
The United States has about 130,000 troops in Iraq but only 5,000 in the Balkans, including 1,700 of 12,000 foreign troops in Bosnia and 2,500 of 21,000 foreign troops in Kosovo.
But that Western presence is profoundly symbolic in a place like Serbia, where the reformers who ousted President Slobodan Milosevic three years ago this week are still suffering the aftereffects of assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in March.
After 13 years of Mr. Milosevic's rule, Serbia is still caught between the desire to be embraced by Europe and the United States and a dependence on organized crime and war criminals, as well as a determination to hold on to Kosovo, Serbian in name but primarily Albanian in population, that make the embrace impossible.
There is widespread disbelief and resentment that historically less developed countries like Bulgaria and Romania, which still send farmhands to work the Serbian potato fields, are far ahead in the queue to join the European Union .
"We will have to stay in the black hole of Europe until we change the final status of Kosovo," said Mladjan Dinkic, an economist who returned to post-Milosevic Serbia from a well-paid job in London to help -- and this year was squeezed out of his post as head of the Central Bank.
The "State Union of Serbia and Montenegro," which has replaced what remained of Yugoslavia, is also a problem -- its two parts are not even integrated economically, a precondition for joining the European Union.
There is no national flag, no national anthem, and the name is so long that people refer to it as "Sam." "It's a disaster," Mr. Dinkic added. "Nobody screams for 'Serbia and Montenegro' at soccer matches."
In Bosnia, ethnic rivalries have subsided eight years after the war, but large-scale unemployment and corruption cripple the landlocked country. A bureaucratic structure created by the peace agreement divides political power and the military among the Muslims, Serbs and Croats but is so redundant that its sometimes functions like a Saturday Night Live skit.
"Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, it is very moving for us to be back in Sarajevo," was how Mr. Holbrooke opened the news conference after his meeting with the three co-equal presidents of Bosnia.
Mr. Holbrooke acknowledged just how flawed the Dayton agreement was, but noted that it was all that was possible in 1995 -- and that it could now be altered, if the will was there. Suleiman Tihic, the Muslim president, complained about the multiple armies; Mr. Holbrooke replied, "I agree with that -- it was the biggest mistake of Dayton." But the multiple military structure was a NATO demand, he said.
Farther south, it has been four years since the NATO bombing campaign turned Kosovo into a United Nations protectorate that has afforded the Albanian majority the freedom denied under Mr. Milosevic.
But here as elsewhere, the end of bloodshed has not built strong state structures or healthy economies. No matter how many billions of dollars and how much effort and how many troops are poured into the region, without political commitment on all sides, the investment has only partly paid off.
In Bosnia, for example, per capita spending by foreign donors hovers at about $1,400 a year (compared with $54 a year in Afghanistan). Nonetheless, said Paddy Ashdown, the Briton who administers Bosnia under the Dayton agreement: "We failed to extend the rule of law. Criminality infects every fiber and cell and bone marrow in the country."
In Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian majority has become increasingly frustrated over the inability to control its own affairs. The Serbian minority, meanwhile, charges that it is the victim of revenge ethnic cleansing by the Albanians.
When Mr. Holbrooke told Oliver Ivanovic, a leader of the Serbs in Kosovo, that Serb leaders in Belgrade were beginning to discuss in private the possibility of partitioning the province, Mr. Ivanovic balked. 
"Can I speak to you honestly?" Mr. Holbrooke then asked Mr. Ivanovic. "You are living in the past. You are a very smart man. We take you seriously and will continue to take you seriously. But history is going to sweep you aside. The Serbs have changed. They want to join Europe."
Mr. Holbrooke appeared to make little impression on Mr. Ivanovic. But the American envoy's combination of pressure and flattery of all sides was on display throughout the trip -- making it easy to understand why he is appreciated by some here.
In Pristina, for instance, there is a bar named "Tricky Dick" in his honor. "Some people win prizes," he said. "I have a bar named after me."

HEADLINE: When Prudery Kills 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
Here on the ground where President Bush's big anti-AIDS program is supposed to unfold, it looks as if the program was drafted more to win American votes than to save African lives.
 "We have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease," Mr. Bush told the nation in his State of the Union address. But we're busy missing that opportunity. 
 Mr. Bush was happy to bask in the praise that his announcement of the AIDS program attracted. But now he is delaying some of that spending, holding back $1 billion in the first year, at a time when three million people die of AIDS annually and five million are newly infected. 
In fairness, Mr. Bush is doing more about AIDS in Africa than President Bill Clinton ever did. But one can hail these advances and still recognize that administration officials are taking only baby steps. 
"They've been in office three years, and they've done almost nothing to get the sick and dying on treatment," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist and expert on public health. "Despite a lot of talk and one famous speech, and one plan that isn't in operation, they've essentially accomplished nothing."
"It's utterly inexcusable," Mr. Sachs added, "that 7.5 million people in Africa have died on their watch, and they've not yet reached even 500 Africans on treatment in U.S.A.I.D.-supported programs. They've talked and procrastinated and dissembled while millions of impoverished people have died. Ultimately, history will judge them very severely."
In his State of the Union comments on AIDS -- which were deservedly praised -- Mr. Bush pledged $15 billion for AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean over five years. But instead of $3 billion for the first year, Mr. Bush backtracked to just $2 billion (much of it already in the pipeline). He's also trying to cut urgently needed contributions to the Global Fund, an international partnership to fight AIDS.
The administration is also fumbling the AIDS initiative by requiring that one-third of AIDS prevention funds do nothing but encourage sexual abstinence until marriage. This is the kind of stipulation set by people who sit in Washington and have never actually set foot in an African village.
In fairness, there is a growing body of evidence that promoting conservative religious and social mores can reduce the scourge of AIDS. But the only religion that does this effectively is Islam. Muslim parts of African countries like Nigeria tend to have much less promiscuity and much less AIDS than Christian parts.
Somehow I doubt that the lesson that conservatives will take from this is that we should buy veils, encourage stonings and build fundamentalist mosques across Africa.
Frankly, it's going to be very hard to change sexual mores, and pious lectures aren't enough. Countries like Uganda and Thailand that have enjoyed some success in preventing AIDS suggest that abstinence campaigns can be effective, but only in conjunction with straight talk about condoms -- not with the administration's approach of beginning and ending the conversation with abstinence.
Restricting funds to abstinence, and nothing more, makes it look as if the administration is more interested in showing that it shares the Christian Right's sexual squeamishness than in fighting AIDS. All over Africa you see heartbreaking evidence both that sex kills, and that so does this kind of blushing prudishness. 
Incredibly, young men in Botswana pay more to play Russian roulette: several prostitutes there told me that the basic price for sex is $6.50 with a condom or $11 without.
One study found that only 42 percent of at-risk Africans can easily get condoms. Dr. Marlin McKay, a Johannesburg AIDS doctor, described the need to promote condoms as well as abstinence: "This isn't condoning sex. It's condoning life."
Sibulele Sibaca, a 20-year-old AIDS orphan from Capetown, put it this way: "I don't think that wasting a lot of money on abstinence is going to work. It's like saying, 'AIDS kills.' So what? The government had billboards saying, 'AIDS kills,' and AIDS just went up and up."
After he announced his AIDS initiative, Mr. Bush was praised as a humanitarian. But unless he delivers on his promises, it will all look like the most cynical of gestures -- using the great health tragedy of our age as a cheap photo-op to drape the White House with compassion.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: MISSING WEAPONS; 
U.S. CAN'T LOCATE MISSILES ONCE HELD IN ARSENAL OF IRAQ

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
The United States military has been unable to locate a large number of shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles that were part of the arsenal of Saddam Hussein, officials say, compounding the security risks for airports and airlines in Iraq and around the world.
 The lack of accounting for the missiles -- officials say there could be hundreds -- is the primary reason the occupation authorities have not yet reopened the Baghdad International Airport to commercial traffic, officials said. The terminal has been rebuilt and the runways repaired, and Australian soldiers are running the air traffic control system. 
 But portable missiles were fired at incoming planes several times in recent weeks, one senior official said. Most of those incidents have not been reported to the public. The missiles missed their targets widely, suggesting that the people who fired them had not been extensively trained. 
United States military officers do not know exactly how many of the missiles are unaccounted for, because they do not have precise estimates of how many Iraq once possessed.
"We just don't know," said an allied official, turning up his palms for emphasis.
The American military is pressing the search for the missiles, offering a reward of $500 for each one. The Pentagon has been surprised how many of the weapons, mostly Russian-designed SA-7's, Iraqis have turned in, another coalition official said.
Virtually every day, Iraqis are walking up to United States military posts to hand over portable missiles, and sometimes they have led Americans to small caches. 
All together, 317 shoulder-fired missiles have been handed over to the military since May 1, according to unclassified United States military figures. The military has paid more than $100,000 in rewards, the figures show.
United States troops have also found several hundred shoulder-fired missiles, many in weapons dumps the locations of which remain secret, another allied official said.
But occupation officials remain concerned, because there is a vibrant international black market for the missiles in which an SA-7 can fetch as much as $5,000 -- far more than the United States military is offering. 
The missiles are easy to smuggle, with a weight of 30 pounds or less and a length less than six feet, and Iraq's borders are highly porous at the moment.
In general, the operator of a shoulder-fired missile aims it at a low-flying plane or helicopter, then pulls a trigger, launching the projectile, which locks in on the heat emitted by the aircraft's engine. The United States and other advanced militaries have developed effective defenses like flares; their heat deceives the missile.
United States officials have discovered that Mr. Hussein's overall conventional military arsenal was much larger than American prewar estimates. The C.I.A. has estimated that the weapons dumps found so far in Iraq hold 600,000 tons of all kinds of ammunition and weapons.
The missiles believed to be available on the world black market include highly sophisticated American-made Stingers, nearly one thousand of which were given by the C.I.A. to the Islamic guerrillas who fought the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980's.
In December 2000, two Stingers were found on a North Korean ship smuggling drugs into Japan, according to American officials. The ship was sunk by the Japanese coast guard in a shootout. United States Navy divers secretly took the Stingers off the ship. It was raised, the drugs were displayed and the boat was put in a museum -- all without public mention of the Stingers.
American officials said they had not been able to determine where the missiles were being sent.
Afghan-era Stingers are widely believed to be inoperable because of their age. But military experts say that while the Stinger's official military shelf life is seven years, with good maintenance and care they can be fired long after that.
In Bangkok, police and security officials said an intense search began last week for at least six shoulder-fired missiles after the police received information that the weapons had been smuggled into Thailand from Cambodia. Later this month 20 world leaders, including President Bush, are to fly into Bangkok for an economic summit conference.
In recent weeks at least two airlines have scrambled the times of their flights in and out of Bangkok's international airport after receiving intelligence reports from the United States that Al Qaeda operatives were planning missile attacks, diplomats and security officials there said.
Moderating security fears is the fact that the portable missiles cannot be fired effectively without training. American soldiers go through a seven-week course to qualify to use the missiles and then are required to requalify quarterly.
The SA-7 was developed by the Soviet Union in the late 1960's, and there are Chinese versions as well. It is the most widely available shoulder-fired missile.
Experts estimate that there are about 100,000 shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles in existence globally. In the last 15 years, more than 50,000 have been sold to governments of developing countries, according to Clive Williams, director of terrorism studies at the Australian National University in Canberra. 
At least 30 insurgent and terrorist groups possess this kind of missile, Jane's Terrorism Intelligence Center reported in August.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
One Victim When Jobs Go Overseas: U.S. Office Space

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Operating out of a 200-square-foot, three-employee office in Times Square, Chris Graham tries to persuade companies to take their cue from Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase and farm out some of their research needs to a developing country where educated employees usually earn a fraction of what Americans are paid.
 "Our delivery team," Mr. Graham, the director of business development for Irevna North America, which describes itself as a research services outsourcing company, recently wrote one potential client, "is based in Madras, India, and is comprised of finance M.B.A.'s and C.P.A.'s with deep finance, accounting and analytical skills." 
 Pitches like Mr. Graham's are working. These days, in a trend that could have serious real estate implications, both Fortune 500 corporations and smaller companies are outsourcing not just their call centers to low-wage countries like India and the Philippines, but also operations like data collection, Web site inquiries, tax preparation, programming and quantitative analysis. 
 And the trend is accelerating, according to many analysts. Forrester Research, a technology research company in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that by 2017, 3.3 million back-office jobs in the United States will migrate to other countries, including China and Russia. Gartner, a research company in Stamford, Conn., describing offshore outsourcing as "an irreversible megatrend," said recently that as many as 500,000 information technology jobs might disappear from this country by the end of 2004. Of the people whose jobs are moved, the study said, fewer than 40 percent will find other work with their current employers.
 Citing these forecasts, real estate specialists say the offshore migration could slow the recovery of the struggling United States office market. The average office vacancy rate nationwide is about 17.6 percent, PNC Real Estate Finance and the Grubb & Ellis Company reported last week.
 Using Forrester's figures, Dale Anne Reiss, the global director for Ernst & Young's real estate, hospitality and construction practice, calculates that the demand for office space (based on an estimate of 220 square feet per employee) will drop by about 50 million square feet a year as jobs move overseas. In recent months, she said, 31,000 United States jobs have been lost to India. That number of office workers would normally occupy 7 million square feet, or an area the size of the central business district of Tampa, Fla.
 Fortunately, call centers and other back offices are not concentrated in a single area or region. As a result, Ms. Reiss said, the loss of jobs will not necessarily be devastating to any one community but is likely to be felt most in what she described as marginal locations, casting a shadow over the market in general. 
 "It's just going to take longer to get the numbers down to palatable percentages," she said, referring to the vacancy rate.
 A recent report by Torto Wheaton Research, a company owned by CB Richard Ellis, agrees that as job growth continues to slow in the United States, office vacancies will continue to increase slightly. Since early 2001, 105 million square feet of office space has emptied, said Raymond G. Torto, the company's managing director.
 But as time goes on, Mr. Torto predicted, developers will adjust by simply building less space. "There will be minimal effects in the long term," Mr. Torto said. "It's a relatively small piece of the overall demand for office space."
 The Torto Wheaton Report also said that offshore outsourcing could wind up benefiting some American employees. By getting some of their work done in India, companies may be able to "stretch their research budgets and keep people on staff in New York and London during times of shrinking budgets," the report said.
 Taking issue with the forecasts, King R. White, a senior vice president for global site selection at Trammell Crow, said that he thought that fewer jobs would be lost to India in the future. "We've seen the initial rush in the last two years," he said. "Now there's a follow-up rush, but it's not going to compound annually." 
 In Mr. White's analysis, the vacant space resulting from exporting jobs offshore is more likely to amount to 10 million square feet a year, rather than 50 million.
 Of the 146 new call centers employing at least 100 people that opened around the world in 2001, Trammell Crow found that 24 percent were in India and 5 percent in the Philippines. Last year, the Philippines again accounted for 5 percent of 166 new call centers, but India had only 14 percent, the report said.
 Trammell Crow is one of several real estate companies based in the United States helping corporate clients locate and develop space overseas. Mr. White said his company recently found four floors of office space in Quezon City, Philippines, for RMH Teleservices, a large call-center outsourcing company based in Philadelphia, and helped get the building reclassified to make the tenant eligible for tax relief.
 John B. Coppedge III, managing director for international operations for Cushman & Wakefield, said that corporations were increasingly demanding space overseas, in India and China, especially, but also in Eastern Europe. "If you were to take a snapshot," Mr. Coppedge said, "that business is three times what it was 18 months ago."
 Peter Barge, the chief executive Jones Lang LaSalle Asia-Pacific, said his company was involved in 25 projects in India, most of it for back-office processing rather than high-technology functions. But he said costs in India were rising. "If the demand gets ahead of the supply," he said, "the costs go up and the competitive advantage narrows a bit."
 Lower wages are not the only reason that companies are shifting jobs overseas. Technological advances have made it possible to offer round-the-clock service from different time zones. 
 In addition, a number of foreign governments offer tax relief and other incentives, and many companies are dispersing operations to avoid disruptions from a terrorist attack or other disaster. "Initially, it was to save money," said Daniel Malachuk, a senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis Consulting who advises corporations on where to locate their offices. "But now," he said, "it's also to have a portfolio of locations. People are saying, 'I want to spread my bet."' 
 Mr. White of Trammell Crow said the cost of space in India and the Philippines is not much cheaper than it is in the United States, when building improvements are taken into account, but leases tend to be much shorter, 3 to 5 years, instead of 10, giving greater flexibility.
 If offshore outsourcing has already had repercussions in the United States, they have not occurred in Salt Lake City, which has a heavy concentration of call centers, said William K. Martin, a co-owner of Colliers Commerce CRG, a commercial real estate company in that city. After the collapse of the dot-com industry, about 350,000 square feet of call-center space emptied out, but about a third of it has since been filled, Mr. Martin said.
 "We're not feeling the offshore issue," he said.

HEADLINE: A U.S. Gas Tax To Help Iraq? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Real Patriot Act" (column, Oct. 5):
 I applaud Thomas L. Friedman's proposal for a $1-a-gallon gasoline tax to raise money for the Iraq reconstruction. 
 Because of market failures, the current price of gasoline in the United States improperly excludes externalities created by its consumption: localized air pollution, environmental damage from oil drilling, global climate change and American military and foreign policy developed to protect our interests in oil-producing nations. 
In addition, proper pricing of gasoline would provide an incentive for the development of alternative energy sources.
By adjusting our current prices of gasoline to account for these externalities, not only would we be paying for the true cost of gasoline, we would improve our standing in the world.

To the Editor:
Re "The Real Patriot Act" (column, Oct. 5):
 As a Republican, an upper-middle income earner and an owner of a late-model, premium-gas-guzzling German automobile, I agree with Thomas L. Friedman's opinion, and I would be proud to do my part by paying an additional $1-a-gallon gasoline tax. 
 If this simple act of patriotism would go a long way toward repaying the cost of the Iraqi reconstruction, bring us in line with the Kyoto protocols, improve our reputation with the Europeans and put a dent in the Saudi ability to finance Islamic radicals, then I say it is the least that every American can do.
Further, if it can be offset by tax rebates for low-income families and independent earners who rely heavily on gasoline consumption for their livelihoods, then there is absolutely no downside to such a tax, and no reason for any truly patriotic politician to fight against it.

Re "The Real Patriot Act" (column, Oct. 5):
 Thomas L. Friedman should try to bring some novel ideas to the table on the discussion of rebuilding Iraq rather than more taxes for the American people. 
He suggests levying a high gas tax to help finance the expensive job of democratizing Iraq as well as to restrain the "gluttony" of American citizens. 
 Rather, he should appreciate the value of free markets and democracy and, instead of taxing and manipulating the consumer, leave the market forces alone to determine the best outcome rather than blaming Americans for our way of life. 
Isn't that the type of free and prosperous society we'd like to see emerge in Iraq?

New Leader, New Tumult

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
Arnold Schwarzenegger won an extraordinary victory on Tuesday, riding a wave of voter rebellion. But he will quickly have to show that he has the ability to pull together a fractured state facing many of the same problems that stoked Gov. Gray Davis's immense unpopularity.
 At the top of the agenda is the state's fiscal difficulties and crippling budget deficits. Polls of voters indicated deep anger over the state of the economy. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, an actor with no political experience, must find a way to balance the budget, reined in by his own suggestions that he will not raise taxes and facing a Democratic-controlled legislature resistant to spending cuts.
And to succeed in such a politically polarized climate, Mr. Schwarzenegger will have to appeal to the political center, transcending the endemic Democratic-Republican acrimony.
"He will meet legislators who will be glad to be rid of Gray Davis, that includes Democrats and Republicans," said John J. Pitney Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.
"But it is a legislature controlled by liberal Democrats, and hence he has a challenge of reaching out to the other party," Mr. Pitney said. "He likes to emphasize he's married to a Democrat and his relationship to the Kennedy family may be just as important a training ground to him as a Hollywood career."
The very nature of how Mr. Schwarzenegger got elected makes his task more difficult.
It took 32 tries since 1936, with other prominent targets like Ronald Reagan and Edmund G. Brown dodging the bullet, for Californians to get a recall of a governor on the ballot. But as they toppled Mr. Davis less than a year after his re-election, Californians were deeply conflicted over whether the recall represented democracy at its best or worst.
For with their vote, they made the recall an accepted and potent political weapon, opening the door to repeated efforts to unseat governors. Indeed, some Democrats vowed to use the recall against Republicans.
Troubling for California and its next governor is a series of Field Polls over the past three months that shows a deepening partisan schism, with most Democrats viewing the recall as a bad thing and most Republicans regarding it as a good one.
"The recall further divides the electorate, certainly in California and perhaps nationally, and is a harbinger of ill in our system, " said Douglas E. Schoen, a pollster who worked for President Bill Clinton. "Usually we have debates about issues and try to build a consensus. Now it is basically slash and burn."
Indeed, the low-road finish to the recall election campaign, with charges of dirty tricks flying between the camps of Mr. Davis and Mr. Schwarzenegger, threatened only to make matters worse.
The survey of voters at polling places showed recall supporters and opponents split largely along ideological lines. Three-fifths of those who said they voted to recall Mr. Davis were Republicans and almost half described themselves as conservative. Two-thirds of recall opponents were Democrats and more than half called themselves liberal.
 The increasingly bitter standoff reflects a broader problem with the political environment in California that an election to remove a governor does not address.
Much as the impeachment of President Bill Clinton demonstrated in Washington, the recall has heightened the viciousness of the state's Democratic-Republican dialogue. Combined with the quirkiness of the state's tradition of "direct democracy" initiatives, that makes California a confounding place to govern.
A look at the map shows how thoroughly split the state is along a "red-blue" spine. Most coastal counties vote Democratic, while most inland counties vote Republican. The north-south cultural divide has been superseded by an east-west division.
"What is happening now in California is what has been happening in Washington," said Mel Levine, a former congressman and state assemblyman from Los Angeles. "The California legislature and the U.S. Congress find it much more difficult to achieve common ground and the type of compromise that is essential for the legislative process."
Mr. Levine, who left Congress a decade ago, is one of those who believe the recall election injects partisan poison in state that has already ingested a nearly lethal dose of it.
Redistricting, term limits, closed primaries and strong party discipline have all helped to turn deliberations in the Legislature into an endless series of party clashes. Both sides tend to attract lawmakers from the extreme wings of their parties, making compromise difficult.
"There is no constituency for a centrist," said Garry South, a longtime aide to Governor Davis. "He tried to do it from the middle, threw his body in front of the train, lost support among constituency groups, and when they came to get him, there was nobody to speak up for him. It is a very vivid lesson."
It was a particularly difficult one for Mr. Davis, whose political career has spanned three decades and who was elected to statewide office five times. No matter how hard he tried to humanize himself in the final weeks of the campaign, Californians would not give him another chance.
Mr. Davis is not the first elected official to become entangled in California's bizarre electoral web. The state's voters have a history of taking matters into their own hands. Between 1978 and 2000, more than 600 initiative petitions were circulated; a quarter concerned how the state raises and spends money -- in essence, cutting legislators out of the budget business.
This so-called ballot box budgeting continues unchecked. Mr. Schwarzenegger successfully led an initiative last year for after-school financing. Another measure on Tuesday's ballot, Proposition 53, would set aside up to 3 percent of general revenues for infrastructure spending.
In 117 attempts since 1913, four state officials have been removed. In 1986, a move to recall the State Supreme Court's chief justice, Rose Bird, and several of her liberal allies on the court failed, but Ms. Bird later lost a confirmation election.
"A lot of us feel the political system here in California is a dysfunctional system," said Jaime A. Regalado, executive director of the Edmund G. "Pat" Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University in Los Angeles. "Despite the 135 candidates and the certain circus nature of it, something serious is happening here."
The partisan poison of the recall permeated its very formation. Democrats argued that the movement would never have gone beyond the wishful thinking of a small group of Republican consultants and antitax crusaders had a millionaire Republican, Representative Darrell Issa of San Diego, not provided a huge infusion of money to hire professional signature gatherers.
Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, said over the weekend that some members of her party already plan to mimic Mr. Issa's formula.
"I know people who have money who say that is what they would do," Ms.Lofgren said. "I don't think there is any way to stop it."

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE OVERVIEW; 
DAVIS IS OUT, SCHWARZENEGGER IS IN BY BIG MARGINS IN CALIFORNIA RECALL

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
In an emphatic end to an extraordinary campaign, Californians voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to recall Gov. Gray Davis and chose as his replacement Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born bodybuilder and movie actor making his first run for office.
 With nearly 30 percent of the votes counted, the recall question on the two-part ballot was passing 55 percent to 44 percent, closely mirroring results from a survey of voters conducted for The New York Times and other news organizations. The interviews with more than 4,000 voters showed deep dissatisfaction with Mr. Davis's performance in office and a profound desire for change in direction in California, the nation's largest state. 
 In the contest to replace Mr. Davis, Mr. Schwarzenegger led his nearest competitor, Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, 50 percent to 31 percent, with 27 percent of the vote counted. 
In an appearance before cheering supporters late in the night, after being introduced by the talk show host Jay Leno, Mr. Schwarzenegger thanked his wife, Maria Shriver, saying, "I know how many votes I got because of you."
Mr. Davis called Mr. Schwarzenegger shortly before 10 p.m. Pacific time to concede the election. Addressing supporters in a Los Angeles hotel ballroom a few minutes later, Mr. Davis said, "Tonight the voters decided it's time for someone else to serve. My friends, we've had a lot of good nights over the last 20 years, but tonight the people did decide it's time for someone else to serve, and I accept their judgment."
When he said California would soon have a new governor, his supporters began to chant "Recall, recall," perhaps a portent of further instability and bitterness.
But he urged his supporters "to put the chaos and the division of the recall behind them."
In interviews conducted as part of the survey, voters rendered a sharply negative verdict on Mr. Davis, who has spent most of his adult life in politics and who was re-elected just 11 months ago. Nearly three of four of the voters disapproved of his job performance, and four of five said they thought the economy was "not so good" or poor.
Mr. Schwarzenegger was viewed favorably by half of voters, even though many who said they voted for him also said he had not put forward a specific enough plan for addressing the state's problems, the poll found. Mr. Schwarzenegger did not do significantly worse among women than among men, despite repeated reports in recent days of sexual misconduct by him. In fact, the vast majority of voters surveyed said they had made up their minds on whom to vote for more than a month ago. Even those who decided in the last week chose Mr. Schwarzenegger over all other candidates.
Mr. Schwarzenegger would take office only after Tuesday's election results are certified by the California secretary of state. The process typically takes four to five weeks, meaning that a transfer of power may not take place until early November.
Tuesday's vote concluded 77 days of political mayhem unlike anything this state has seen. The race featured a crazy quilt of 135 candidates, any of whom, under the unusual rules of the recall, could have been elected with a simple plurality. But it ended in a close-in brawl between a seasoned political gut-puncher, Mr. Davis, and a willful newcomer, Mr. Schwarzenegger. In the end, however, Mr. Davis simply had no strength left to overcome his rival's momentum and celebrity.
The race generated enormous interest in California and around the world because of the novelty of a recall and the star power of Mr. Schwarzenegger, whose most recent movie, "Terminator 3," was released weeks before the race began. Californians followed the 11-week contest with an intensity usually reserved for freeway car chases and Oscar night. 
The candidates spent $83 million, more than $40 million of it on a downpour of television advertising in the race's closing weeks. The biggest single source of campaign money -- $10.3 million -- was Mr. Schwarzenegger's personal bank account.
Secretary of State Kevin Shelley estimated the turnout on Tuesday at 9.25 million voters, about 60 percent of the state's 15.4 million registered voters, compared with about 50 percent last November and 71 percent in the 2000 election. If the estimate proves accurate, it will be the state's highest voter participation in a nonpresidential election since 1982.
Mr. Davis cast his vote in a real estate office on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood late Tuesday morning, the same place where Larry Flynt, the self-described "smut-peddler with a heart" and one of the candidates on the replacement ballot, cast his ballot a few minutes earlier. Mr. Davis was accompanied by his wife, Sharon, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has appeared several times on Mr. Davis's behalf to try to rally disaffected Democrats. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger voted in the garage of a big, gated house in the Pacific Palisades of Los Angeles, near his home, trailed by a battalion of reporters and photographers. He put on glasses to study the ballot, which was several pages long.
"I just went through the pages,"Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "Instead of going through two pages, I just went through 10 pages, and you always look for the longest name."
His wife was by his side, as she has been almost constantly since last Thursday when new reports of sexual misconduct threatened to derail Mr. Schwarzenegger's march to Sacramento.
Discontent with Mr. Davis and the direction of the state was palpable at polling places from one end of this sprawling republic of 35 million people to the other.
Californians are deeply pessimistic about the state's economy, with only about 20 percent calling it good or excellent, according to the survey of 4,172 voters conducted through the day by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for The Times and other news organizations. Last November, when Mr. Davis won re-election, more than half of voters characterized the state's economy as good, according to a poll conducted by The Los Angeles Times.
The interviews with voters also found that a majority had rejected Proposition 54, the so-called racial privacy initiative, which would bar state and local governments from collecting most data on race, religion and ethnicity. Ward Connerly, a University of California regent and longtime opponent of affirmative action, sponsored the initiative. 
The survey conducted on Tuesday includes questionnaires filled out by voters leaving polling places throughout the state, as well as a telephone poll conducted over the past week of those who said they submitted absentee ballots.
"Gray Davis really made a mess out of California, so I was definitely yes on the recall," said Robin Cruse, 45, a stay-at-home mother from San Clemente. "Arnold, I'm not 100 percent on him, but I thought he was still my best choice."
Marc Vasquez, 58, said after casting his ballot in Fresno: "The recall is something that we're privileged to have in this state. It's high time we have officials realize that they can be held accountable."
Even among those who voted against the recall, there was broad unhappiness with the direction of the state and Mr. Davis's stewardship. Almost half of the recall opponents disapproved of the governor's job performance and three-quarters said the state's economy was in bad shape.
Mr. Schwarzenegger and his chief Republican rival, State Senator Tom McClintock, are viewed favorably by the voters, Mr. Schwarzenegger by half the voters and Mr. McClintock by about 55 percent, the poll found.
More than 70 percent of those polled said they disapproved of the job Mr. Davis was doing as governor, with a quarter saying they approved. Mr. Bustamante, the only prominent Democrat on the ballot, was viewed unfavorably by nearly 6 in 10 voters. 
It may be some time before the effect of last-minute reports that Mr. Schwarzenegger groped more than a dozen women on movie lots and elsewhere can be fully measured. But at least some voters dismissed the charges as an act of desperation by Mr. Davis and his allies.
Skip McCown, 56, a Republican from San Diego, voted for the recall and for Mr. Schwarzenegger. "It's curious that this spate of accusations came out three or four days before the election," Mr. McCown said. "If anything, it makes me want to vote for him more. This is a Davis ploy. He's the king of dirty tricks."
While Democrats hold a substantial edge in voter registration in California, Mr. Davis had trouble winning their loyalty. The voter poll found that about 18 percent of those who voted to recall Mr. Davis were Democrats.
Deborah Gittes, 42, a school administrator in Coronado, is a registered Democrat who voted tooust Mr. Davis and replace him with Mr. Schwarzenegger. "Davis just messed things up," Ms. Gittes said. "It's good to see Californians empowered themselves." 
As for the charges of sexual misconduct against Mr. Schwarzenegger, she said, "There's all this debauchery in the film industry, and it's all brought up at the last minute when he's ahead in the polls."
California has a long tradition of direct democracy, the legacy of Gov. Hiram Johnson of the Progressive Party, who introduced the initiative, referendum and recall to the state constitution in 1911. The state's voters have passed hundreds of laws by initiative over the last 90 years.
Groups have tried 31 times to invoke the recall to remove California governors, including the Republicans Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson, but this is the first attempt to qualify for the ballot. The last governor to be recalled was Lynn J. Frazier of North Dakota, in 1921.
Shortly after Mr. Davis was elected to a second four-year term -- scoring a surprisingly narrow victory over a political novice, Bill Simon Jr. -- Republican political consultants and an antitax crusader named Ted Costa began exploring the possibility of recalling the governor.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The poll of voters was based on questionnaires completed yesterday by people as they left polling places throughout California. Questionnaires were offered in English or Spanish.
The poll was conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J., and Mitofsky International of New York City.
The results are based on 3,772 voters in 60 randomly selected precincts across California, interviewed as they were leaving polling places.
In addition, 400 self-identified absentee voters, reached at random telephone numbers, were also interviewed, and their results have been added to the poll. 
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus two percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview everyone who cast a ballot in the California recall election.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion at polling places, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Sometimes the Best Route To Progress Is a U-Turn

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
It is essential for performing arts institutions to challenge and change themselves regularly to foster artistic growth. But the collapse of the proposed merger between the New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall is one instance when a return to the status quo may be the best result for everyone involved.
 To many minds, the merger never made sense. Looked at solely from the perspective of the New York Philharmonic, the primary advantage was obvious: instead of being a tenant in the acoustically challenged Avery Fisher Hall, the orchestra would have become a co-resident at America's most storied and acoustically excellent auditorium. 
 But it was much harder to see how Carnegie Hall was supposed to benefit from the merger, unless you viewed it essentially as a business venture that would have combined two endowments and two subscriber bases at a time of economic uncertainties. Artistically, though, Carnegie Hall, a dynamic institution that is reinvigorating itself for the 21st century, was tying itself to a staunchly traditional institution that seemed unwilling to consider even small changes to things like the weekly subscription series format, which is looking more and more outmoded.
From comments that Zarin Mehta, the executive director of the Philharmonic, made in recent months, it seemed clear that he was not going to be content simply to claim dates for his orchestra's concerts and leave the rest of the programming to Carnegie Hall. Mr. Mehta intended to be a forceful and equal partner in every aspect of Carnegie's operations.
Even if Mr. Mehta had restricted his input, the Philharmonic's mere presence would have profoundly altered the weekly offerings and the essential character of Carnegie Hall.
So what now? Things could not be going better for Carnegie Hall at the moment. As usual, this season in the main hall, Stern Auditorium, you can hear the great artists and ensembles of the world. While downstairs the new Zankel Hall has already become a hotbed of contemporary music from the classical, jazz and ethnic traditions. 
Meanwhile, after leaving Lincoln Center in the lurch the Philharmonic must reconcile itself to staying at Avery Fisher Hall. Even in the hall's current state, its acoustics are not thatbad. The sound may lack warmth and body, but it is still essentially bright and present. On a good night during an exciting program few audience members sit through a Philharmonic concert thinking about acoustics.
The best way for the Philharmonic to give itself the artistic jolt it needs is by finding the right successor to Lorin Maazel, whose contract ends with the 2005-6 season, when he will be 76. 
If the orchestra is hoping to bring in someone younger, a musician with close ties to the new generation of composers and performers, it better have begun the search process already. You can bet that younger maestros who are appearing with the orchestra this season, like David Robertson, Antonio Pappano, Alan Gilbert and Osmo Vanska, are going to be sized up for the job.
You have to feel for the Philharmonic, which must be terribly envious of the new home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Disney Hall, which is getting raves from architecture and music critics even before its official opening later this month. 
But Avery Fisher Hall was originally named Philharmonic Hall after the orchestra it was built for, and Lincoln Center makes little sense without the Philharmonic as an anchor. So let the peace talks begin. The extensive renovation of the Seattle Opera House, which reopened in August, offers proof that an auditorium with only adequate acoustics and a cramped lobby can be turned into an inviting, spacious and acoustically top-notch facility.
Despite the brave talk of Jane Moss and other artistic planners at Lincoln Center, who tried to spin the desertion of the Philharmonic as an opportunity for Avery Fisher Hall to reinvent itself as a happening place, they have to be relieved. Lincoln Center is already offering some very innovative programming. There is no reason this cannot continue with the Philharmonic in residence.

HEADLINE: Carrier Layoffs Spotlight Syracuse's Battle to Rise From Dependence on Manufacturing 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
Since the late 18th century, when its first settlers turned brine sucked from deep wells into salt, Syracuse has been a city that made things.
 It never had Buffalo's steel mills or Troy's collar factories, but its location at the confluence of transportation innovations -- first canals, then railroads and now highways -- has made it an attractive place for manufacturing. And over the years everything from cars to plastic bags has rolled off assembly lines here. 
 The announcement made on Monday that the Carrier Corporation, Syracuse's best-known company, would no longer make air-conditioners here -- closing its plants and ending 1,200 jobs -- was a terrible blow, local officials said. But in many ways the closings signal the end of an era that was already winding down. Like most upstate cities that once depended on heavy industry, Syracuse has steadily lost manufacturing jobs over the last two decades. 
But unlike many upstate communities that withered as their industrial power faded, Syracuse has added 10,000 jobs in the last decade, the officials said. By drawing a handful of employers in the financial, technology and insurance fields, and revitalizing its downtown, Syracuse has weathered a tough time with more grace than many other upstate cities.
"I'm not going to lie to you -- losing 1,200 jobs hurts, no matter what community," said Irwin L. Davis, president of the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York. "But we're resilient."
From his office on the 19th floor of an Art Deco office tower in downtown Syracuse, Mr. Davis has a sweeping view of the city, and much of what he sees is good news, he said. That news includes the thousands of jobs added over the last decade, even as other upstate communities saw little or no job growth. It also includes the transformation of Syracuse's downtown.
Even at the street level, Syracuse does not look like a dying upstate city. Historic squares and parks have been refurbished, their fountains returned to splendor and their monuments gleaming. This year a chic hotel opened downtown, the Marx Hotel and Conference Center, after a $22 million renovation of an old 20-story Holiday Inn. With its sleek granite and cherry-wood guest rooms and its high-tech amenities, the hotel was built in anticipation of a Syracuse renaissance. Armory Square, a historic neighborhood built around a science museum housed in an old armory, is filled with bars, expensive restaurants and boutiques.
Nicholas Pirro, the Onondaga County executive, said the Syracuse area was better equipped than most upstate communities to deal with the decline of the manufacturing sector.
"We've had a good deal of diversity, with high-tech, financial and defense firms coming here," Mr. Pirro said. "We have a combination of a good work force, a lot of colleges and universities and great transportation infrastructure."
But the loss of such an important employer as Carrier is significant.
"We have made a lotof progress," said Matthew J. Driscoll, the mayor of Syracuse. "Still, it feels like we take one step forward, then two steps back."
The new jobs and the new life in the city's downtown have not brought good prospects to everyone. Dave Bednarski, 46, said that if central New York State was experiencing a renaissance, he had yet to see any evidence of it.
He runs the Tuscarora Golf Club in Marcellus, 10 miles southwest of Syracuse.
"When economic times were great, in the 90's, we had a waiting list for memberships," Mr. Bednarski said as he waited for a table at Dinosaur Barbeque, a popular restaurant downtown. "This year our business is down 20 percent. It hurts."
Mr. Bednarski, who was a prison guard before taking over the golf club his father had run, said many of his former high school classmates who had pursued blue-collar careers were having a rough time.
"A lot of folks I know are out of work," he said. "There used to be a lot of blue-collar jobs that paid well in this city, but they are mostly gone." 
Chris Farley, a Carrier employee for five years, said the new jobs in Syracuse usually either pay too little or require skills that workers at the plant do not have. Fields like biotechnology and information architecture, which city development officials promote, are out of most workers' reach.
"We are skilled workers," Ms. Farley said as she left a union meeting with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at the union hall of the sheet metal workers' union. "We put together air-conditioning units and chiller units. Biotech is not even in the same ballpark."
Despite the success in bringing new businesses to the region, officials here said they would fight to hold on to every manufacturing job. Speaking with reporters after the meeting, Senator Clinton said manufacturing should always remain at the heart of the American economy.
"You have got to make things," she said. "You have got to have men and women like those who work in this plant, who really understand how you make something, at the core of your economy. That is what you are losing. I look down the road and see disintegration of every other kind of economic opportunity if we don't try to reverse this loss of manufacturing jobs."

IN the spirit of sheer nosiness, the impulse is strong to visit Alma Nugent in her Upper East Side apartment. Ms. Nugent is, after all, the newly elected president of the New York chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers.
 And she must have some good dish on the proliferation of home decor television shows, Internet sites and Home Depot-style stores that make everyone and their mother assume they are experts in her profession. 
 But Ms. Nugent hesitates, her melodious voice dropping low on the telephone. "It's not fancy," she says, before acquiescing to a conversation in her Carnegie Hill apartment, three blocks from her small commercial and residential business, Nugent Designs. 
She is right. The 25th-floor apartment is large and sparely decorated, with an expansive view of Central Park and the reservoir. Elegant, yes. Low-key, definitely. Fancy, no. Much like herself. Abstract paintings and African sculptures are tastefully arranged in the living room, which has walls and carpet the color of vanilla custard.
"I like a lot of open space," she says. "I don't like a lot of clutter around. I want to come home and feel free."
Ms. Nugent, who is 64, sinks her slender frame onto a light-green sofa. (It's a shade called sea-foam these days.) She is a bit nervous about the interview. But her voice remains steady, soothing. One can imagine her as the nurse she once was, supervising the nursing staff of the pediatric and adult emergency rooms of Mount Sinai Hospital more than two decades ago.
She loosens up, though, when talking about the state of her current profession.
"We have to change because it's changed already for us," she says. "So we have to meet the challenges that are out there by changing the way we do business."
Ms. Nugent is championing the establishment of state-mandated uniform standards for interior designers. She wants legislation requiring certification for all interior designers, rather than simply having it available, as it has been since the early 1990's. She says only 77 out of 1,000 interior designers are certified in her chapter, which includes New York City, Long Island and Westchester County.
"It really upsets me that anyone can put out a shingle and call themselves an interior designer," she says. "It waters it down."
The ailing economy also has done a number on her profession, she says, prompting people to take designing matters into their own hands.
"It's challenging," she says. "There was a time when we planned the space and specified everything and got work done, and now the clients do their own shopping and come to us with stacks of information. It doesn't make it easier when they are coming to us with all this information. It sort of stagnates us. It takes away some of the freedom and creativity."
But isn't that view to be expected of someone in her position? She just smiles.
"The cost of having an interior designer plan your space saves a lot of money in the long run," she says. "We prevent mistakes."
So what are people craving? She says home theaters are big; the kind of screening rooms with 60-inch, flat-screen or plasma televisions and comfortable seating.
"I think it started before 9/11, but with that, more people stay at home," she says. "I think families feel closer together and safer at home."
All right. Confess! What's her take on those reality home-decor shows? She grimaces. "They are not realistic, not at all," she says. "They make it look as if you can do so much for $1,000 and you can't do so much for $1,000. They do a disservice to the profession."
MS. NUGENT gets up to offer a late breakfast of pastries and figs. It is laid out on a large rectangular glass table. She sits on a banquette upholstered in earth tones.
She is not a celebrity interior designer. She leans over to say she wouldn't mind being one, though. Still, she hasn't done badly. She designed the interior of a corporate jet for Reginald F. Lewis, the late Wall Street lawyer and financier who was one of the nation's richest businessmen. "It was a lot of fun," she says.
Ms. Nugent, who is married to Seymour Reiner, the owner of a floor-covering company, says her clients tend to be wealthy but she won't give many clues about them.
She also does not want to make a fuss about race. The profession remains largely white, and she is the first African-American to head the chapter.
But she does say racial discrimination led her in part to start her own company in 1976 after her first job interview. "When they saw who I was, the job was gone," she says.
The daughter of a train conductor and a restaurant proprietor, Ms. Nugent was born in Costa Rica and raised in Nicaragua. She moved to New York at age 23 to work as a nurse, but says she always knew she would try something else. She juggled full-time nursing while studying at the New York School of Interior Design and the New York Institute of Technology.
Ms. Nugent joined the interior design association in 1972, serving as a vice president, a board member and the chairwoman of various committees. She says she was asked before to run for the presidency but declined.
"I didn't feel I had the time to devote to it," she says.
She adds quickly that she is busy in her work but she could be busier.

HEADLINE: Osaka Journal; 
Tokyo's Rival Says 'the Real Japan' Is Right Here

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
The rivalry between Osaka, the capital of western Japan, and Tokyo over the soul of Japan has survived even though Osaka was eclipsed economically and politically by its enemy out east.
 Culturally, at least, Osaka (along with the rest of western Japan) regarded itself as the heart of the country. Tokyo tries to be cool and sophisticated; here, humor and warmth are prized. Calling someone "baka" in Tokyo amounts to saying "idiot"; the preferred word here is "ahou," which is closer to "foolish" and carries with it a generous understanding of human frailty. 
 Sometimes the differences have no meaning except that Osaka is the anti-Tokyo. In Tokyo, people stand on the left side of escalators and pass on the right; here, it is the opposite.
Perhaps the clearest indication of Osaka's cultural pride is that people here refuse to drop their dialects when they go to Tokyo. Other Japanese, awed at being in Tokyo, tend to do so very quickly.
"Even inside the subway in Tokyo, you can overhear people from Osaka talk in the Osaka dialect in a loud voice," said Koichi Otani, the author of "The Study of Osaka" and a former president of Tezukayama Gakuin University here. "Culturally, we don't feel we are second to Tokyo. Real Japan is in Osaka. Tokyo is more like an American colony."
This baseball season, the rivalry tilted ever so slightly in Osaka's favor when its ne'er-do-well team, the Hanshin Tigers, clinched a league championship for the first time in 18 years, and the Yomiuri Giants of Tokyo, the equivalent of the New York Yankees, fell into a slump.
In recent years, however, Osaka has become more like Tokyo in one fundamental way: a lack of haggling. In Osaka, a city built by merchants, haggling over prices was a time-honored practice. In Tokyo, a city built by samurai disdainful of money, haggling is considered unseemly, and is rarely done.
Shoppers here haggle much less than before. Young people regard it as unfashionable. And as Osaka has been hit much harder than Tokyo by the long recession, many mom-and-pop stores have closed and been replaced by Tokyo-based chain stores that, naturally, do not allow haggling.
"I usually haggle when I go shopping, but I didn't here today," said Miyuki Osoegawa, a 37-year-old homemaker, who was shopping at the local outlet of Yodobashi Camera, a Tokyo chain. "It's a Tokyo store, so haggling doesn't work here. But when I go to other shops in Osaka, I negotiate prices, even in large stores. We haggle while smiling and tricking each other, and we make them give us discounts. If you live in Osaka, you'll do it. It's something you're born with here."
It was two years ago that the Tokyo-based Yodobashi Camera opened a gigantic, multilevel superstore in the heart of Osaka, visited by more than 60,000 people daily. It offers a membership reward card.
By contrast, customers were scarce recently in Nipponbashi, the center of local electric appliance shops. There are 58 such stores, compared with 103 in 1992.
Like many shop owners in Nipponbashi, Shigeharu Okashita, 58, said fewer than half of his customers haggle nowadays.
"Haggling has really declined in the last decade," said Mr. Okashita, whose family has owned his shop, Naniwa Denkishoukai, for 60 years.
Yasuo Uchida, 45, who has worked at Sawada Denki for 26 years and is now its manager, used to talk with customers with a calculator in his hand. "I used to enjoy conversations with customers when they tried to haggle," he said, as he watched over a store with only a couple of customers. "It was just like a comic banter between people. We played our role and the customers knew how to play theirs."
Nowadays, he keeps a distance of five feet from customers. "If I take one step toward them, they move away one step.
"In Tokyo, I understand people don't want to haggle over prices because they think it's not cool. They check prices from place to place before actually buying something. This Tokyo style is spreading in Osaka, too. Yodobashi Camera is a major reason."
Until the late 19th century, about 70 percent of the country's wealth was concentrated in Osaka. Even though Tokyo was the capital, Osaka's economic might made it a true rival until the 1920's, Mr. Otani said. Then, especially after World War II, all power flowed to Tokyo. Big companies transferred their headquarters there. The 14-year economic slump, which has hurt the medium and small businesses based here most, has widened the gap. 
"In some ways, the rivalry is one-sided now," Mr. Otani said.
Masahiro Takeshita, 37, Yodobashi Camera's manager, said not all Osaka people liked haggling. Though the store's employees are mostly locals, they are required to speak standard, or Tokyo, Japanese. "Because this is a chain, the standards have to be the same everywhere," he said, in standard Japanese.
Others clung to their Osaka ways.
At Naniwa Seikatsu-kan, Satoshi Yamamoto, 44, the manager, joked with a longtime customer, Fumio Sanada, 76, with a familiarity rare in a chain. Mr. Sanada had negotiated the price of a washing machine manual down from about $5 to $4.
"Everything's awfully cheap here," he said in his perfect Osaka dialect. "I don't go to any other place. I never compare prices. I just know they're great here -- so kind and so cheap."
Mr. Yamamoto smiled: "Tokyo is cool. Osaka is love and affection. When I'm asked for a discount by a customer whom I like, I can't help giving it."

HEADLINE: The Charm From Beijing 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
In his first major outing with his Asian colleagues, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China this week unfurled what has clearly become a basic tenet of Beijing's foreign policy: friendly, even superfriendly, relations with the neighbors.
 That Mr. Wen's presence drove much of what was accomplished at this year's summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as Asean, is without doubt. What was striking was the style and manner in which he brought it about. 
 Again and again, Mr. Wen sought to reassure his colleagues that China's fast growth and expanding trade meant only the best for the region. He signed a menu of agreements, proposed a variety of people-to-people exchanges and offered a special expo in China next year for Southeast Asian businesses.
From China's point of view the display of affability was intended not only for the regional audience but for the wider listening gallery, particularly the one in Washington.
"He wants to show the West: 'See we're trusted in our own neighborhood,' " an Asian diplomat said at a signing ceremony on Wednesday, which featured China and the 10 Asean countries.
China's president, Hu Jintao, is to meet with President Bush in 10 days at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit conference in Bangkok, and Mr. Wen is to make his first visit to Washington in early December.
The Chinese prime minister exercised what was referred to at the meeting at this resort on the Indonesian island of Bali as his "charm offensive." He had the field to himself.
Though the United States has been the dominant power in the region since World War II, it is not a member of the Asean group and, unlike Japan, South Korea, India and China, takes no part in its discussions.
There were only a handful of American business people at a meeting of business leaders that accompanied the meeting of the government leaders, and there were no American diplomats observing the proceedings.
After Japan, the United States remains the biggest investor in Southeast Asia, but in the past several years American investment has declined. Further, Washington is perceived as being consumed by its agenda, emphasizing the campaign against terror and problems in the Middle East.
"I have never seen a time when Southeast Asia is in so much transition and open to ideas, and never seen a time when the United States is so distracted from the region," said Ernest Z. Bower, the president of the United States-Asean business council that represents big American corporations in the region. In contrast, he said, "China is focused on the region like a laser beam."
Mr. Wen's charm offensive is part of what some Asian diplomats are calling China's decision to take a "strategic pause" abroad while it concentrates on rapid domestic growth and modernization.
To achieve that growth with the minimum of disruption, the Chinese leadership is intent, these diplomats say, on securing smooth relations with the rest of the world, including its own backyard.
Last year China dropped its militant stand on a dispute over islands in the South China Sea. Instead, it is opting, "for the time being," said the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia, Lu Shumin, for a "cooperative" solution.
Many nations in the region are rich in the natural resources that China needs to fuel its economic growth. 
It is no accident that President Hu is addressing the Australian Parliament on Oct. 24, a day after President Bush. Australia recently won a sizable contract to sell liquid natural gas to China, and Australia sells China large quantities of iron ore and alumina.
Similarly, China is forging close diplomatic and political links with Indonesia, which has deep reserves of oil as well as liquid natural gas. Until a few years ago, China's Communist government was considered an almost hostile power in Indonesia, and Beijing was upset by what it considered the Indonesian government's discriminatory policies toward the ethnic Chinese in its population.
But now Ambassador Lu is accorded first-rank status by the Indonesians. 
For some, Mr. Wen's performance here was just one more illustration of China's regional comeback. Centuries ago, Chinese settled along the northern coast of Java, now the main island of Indonesia, as part of China's great epoch of Asian trade.
No one expects the Chinese comeback in quite those terms. But Mr. Bower said: "I do feel the Chinese Monroe Doctrine is being built here in the region. As the Chinese get their act together and play on the world stage, this region is the first of a series of concentric circles."

HEADLINE: Dominicans Gaining on Puerto Ricans in City 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
If present population trends continue, Dominicans will surpass Puerto Ricans as the city's largest Hispanic group before the end of the decade, a study has found.
 The mushrooming growth of Dominicans -- their population increased by 51 percent during the 1990's to 554,638 -- would very likely alter the city's political landscape, where Puerto Ricans dominate the Hispanic leadership, one of the study's authors said. It would also have a subtler impact on education, where, for example, the 21,600 Dominicans are already the largest nationality at the City University of New York. 
 The analysis, written by Dr. Ramona Hernandez and Dr. Francisco L. Rivera-Batiz for the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute and based on United States Census data, also found that Dominicans are spreading beyond their base in Washington Heights, attracted by cheaper rents and larger apartments across the Harlem River in the west Bronx. The number of Dominicans in the Bronx doubled during the 1990's, and there are now almost as many Dominicans in the Bronx, 181,450, as there are in Manhattan, 185,808.
Ever since they began arriving to New York in great numbers in the 1940's, Puerto Ricans have been the city's most visible Hispanic group, producing politicians like Herman Badillo and Fernando Ferrer, transforming public schools with bilingual education, and flavoring the city's music, literature, theater and cuisine.
The turnabout in the city's Puerto Rican population -- it fell 12.8 percent to 789,172 in 2000 from 896,763 in 1990 -- has been evident for several years as Puerto Ricans moved to the suburbs or retired to Puerto Rico. What was less clear was the Dominicans' comparative ascendancy, a shift documented in census data by the CUNY study and attributed to steady immigration and the growth in children born to Dominicans here.
Dr. Felix Matos Rodriguez, director of the Center of Puerto Rican Studies, expressed some skepticism about the predictions, noting that the Dominican surge of the 1990's was fueled by a robust economy and a relative freedom of travel, conditions that have not been replicated after 9/11.
Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president, said that it was less important whether the city's population was increasingly Puerto Rican or Dominican than that the Dominican growth might eventually produce the city's first Hispanic mayor.
"I think that every Latino will connect with, say, a Freddy Ferrer not because he's Puerto Rican, but because they have a representative that gives them a place at the table," he said.
In the United States as a whole, the Dominican population almost doubled during the 1990's to 1,041,910, and if those growth rates persist, Dominicans will by the end of the decade surpass Cubans as the nation's third-largest Hispanic group. Mexicans and Puerto Ricans will still be larger nationwide.
The study found that Dominicans are still among the poorest New Yorkers, with 32 percent qualifying as poor compared with 19.1 percent for New Yorkers over all. A major reason, the study said, was the prevalence of families headed by single women.
Over all, native Dominicans do not have high rates of high school and college education. But in 2000, close to 60 percent of all Dominicans born here and older than 25 had some college education.

HEADLINE: Visions of Doom Endure in Queens; 
Prophecy, and a Rift, at a Shrine

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
One recent Saturday evening, several hundred Roman Catholics wearing white gloves and clutching rosary beads gathered in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens for a candlelight vigil.
 They knelt before a makeshift shrine: a granite bench covered with candles, roses and banners of Catholic saints surrounding a portable statue of the Madonna illuminated with a large flashlight. The pilgrims, including busloads from Maryland, Boston and Pittsburgh, chanted the rosary together as cars sped past on the Long Island Expressway. 
 The site is a monument to the Vatican Pavilion from the 1964-65 World's Fair and was blessed by Pope Paul VI during his visit to New York in 1965. But these devotees consider it sacred ground for another reason. It was here, they say, that a Queens homemaker named Veronica Lueken relayed hundreds of messages and prophecies from Jesus and Mary. 
It is known as the Our Lady of the Roses shrine, or the Lourdes of America, and it attracted thousands when Mrs. Lueken appeared there regularly. But since her death in 1995 at age 72, her followers have split into two factions, waging legal battles and disputes that continue today.
Regular attendance at the shrine has been dwindling, so it might not seem the best time to be a Luekenite. But there are a lot of knowing, told-you-so smiles around the Flushing shrine these days.
After years of enduring ridicule, followers say, Mrs. Lueken's far-flung vision of doomsday redemption seems to be coming true, as witnessed by the terrorist attacks on the United States, the recent blackout, economic recession, abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church, hurricanes, and the war in Iraq. 
Mrs. Lueken said that because the world had become so engulfed in sin, a "great chastisement" -- an apocalyptic nuclear war, earthquakes and a comet acting as a "ball of redemption" -- would come, killing billions. 
According to Michael Mangan, a leader of one of the factions, there is every indication that the end is near.
"Nine/eleven was awful, but that's what Our Lady prophesied," said Mr. Mangan, 44, president of St. Michael's World Apostolate, which includes a lay group of celibate men who guard the shrine and lead regular prayer services there. "We kind of knew it was coming. But 9/11 is going to pale in comparison to what's coming down the pike, and it's imminent."
Gary Wohlscheid, of Lowell, Mich., runs perhaps the most popular shrine Web site, Virgin Mary's End-Times Prophecies: tldm.org.
"You can see it coming true now," Mr. Wohlscheid, 63, said. "Look at the tornadoes, the hurricanes, earthquakes, blackouts. She predicted all this. It's coming, believe me."
The Web site prints, among other things, some of the messages that Mrs. Lueken said were relayed to her. One message, dated Oct. 1, 1988, is transcribed as follows:
"My child and my children, I must ask you this evening to remember that there are many messages that have not been read by all. It has been 18 earth years since I first appeared here, and much has been given and much has been forgotten. Therefore, we ask all of our children to obtain copies of the back messages from Heaven, because we are now in repetition. Because what can we say, my children and my child? If I could show you what is in store for mankind, you too would be shedding tears of sorrow."
Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, which includes Queens, said on Tuesday that the church investigated Mrs. Lueken's claims years ago.
"It was determined that no credibility could be given to claims by Veronica Lueken that something of a supernatural nature was taking place," he said.
But her followers scoff at this, saying the church has grown overly tolerant of a society grown rife with sin. Examples of this, they say, include pornography, homosexuality, the wearing of slacks by women, abortion and rock music. God specifically chose to appear in New York City, they say, because it is an especially sinful place.
Mrs. Lueken lived a quiet life with her husband, Arthur, and their four children in Bayside until Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on June 5, 1968, in Los Angeles. Mrs. Lueken said that as she prayed for Kennedy's soul, she had her first visitation from the Virgin. Soon after, she said another came -- the head of Christ with a crown of thorns -- as she pushed her shopping cart down Springfield Boulevard in Bayside.
She began repeating what she said were the Virgin's divine messages onto tapes and selling them. Followers began coming in droves to St. Robert Bellarmine Church in Bayside to meet the woman they called the "voice box" for Jesus and Mary and to witness what they believed were her ecstatic visions. In May 1975, the group grew too large and moved to the Vatican Pavilion site, where Michelangelo's "Pieta" was exhibited during the World's Fair.
Mrs. Lueken would sit in front of the shrine and, followers believe, slip into a trance and repeat the Virgin's words into a public address system powered by a car battery. Remarkable individual visions have become part of the lore, as have testimonials from followers who say they were miraculously cured of cancer or regained their sight or hearing at the shrine.
After Mrs. Lueken's death, her husband, Arthur Lueken, won a court decision to become president of Our Lady of the Roses on Christmas Eve in 1997. Mr. Mangan, who was Mrs. Lueken's main assistant, was ousted from the group and formed his own group. After Mr. Lueken died last year, Vivian Hanratty of Flushing became the leader of Our Lady of the Roses. Each group claims to be Mrs. Lueken's posthumous favorite.
Mr. Mangan maintains that he was "prepared by Heaven" to lead her believers ("I have 99 percent of the following and she has nobody"). Ms. Hanratty countered that membership numbers mean nothing, adding, "How many people were at the cross when Jesus died?"
The city's Parks Department has played referee by allowing each group to gather at the shrine on alternate Sundays, while the other group prays nearby. The occasional evening vigils are also split.
At a recent vigil, two women, Mary Hilton and Lita Conaman, stood together chanting the rosary, along with the shrine guards.
Ms. Conaman, who lives in Los Angeles, learned about the shrine in a newspaper article in 1988 and has been coming frequently since. Mrs. Hilton, 78, from Topeka, Kan., said she heard about Mrs. Lueken on a radio program and "came here to disprove it to myself." Instead, she said, the shrine cured the chronic arthritis in her right shoulder.
Rosemarie Sibley, 56, a retired secretary from Eagleville, Pa., said she had been coming to the shrine monthly since she became a believer in 1983. The shrine cured her mother's ovarian cancer, she said, and cured her own knees so she could walk without leg braces.
"My doctor said, 'Your knees are cured,' but he didn't believe it was Mary who cured them," she said.
Ms. Sibley held a Polaroid Land camera with rosary beads wrapped around it. Mrs. Lueken advised followers to take photographs of the shrine with Polaroid cameras and examine pictures that come out distorted, with streaky flashes of light and color.
"We call them miraculous photographs," said John Benevides, 33, a shrine guard with St. Michael's.
"The Holy Ghost works through the person with the camera to send a message," he said, leafing through an album of photographs showing pictures with light streaks resembling doves and various letters and faces of saints.
"That's the miracle," Mr. Benevides said. "It's the hand of God working in the background."

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
A team of World Bank economists has concluded that, as a practical matter, Iraq can absorb only about $6 billion in aid next year for its infrastructure needs. That conclusion sets a target that Bush administration officials said Wednesday could be met from American and international assistance. 
 The $6 billion figure for Iraq has been circulating among policy makers at the World Bank, the United Nations and the Bush administration as they struggle to plan for an international donors' conference this month that they fear could be judged a failure for lack of pledges. 
 Underscoring those fears, an administration official said Spain, the conference host, had suddenly become worried about the growing possibility that the United States might delay plans to obtain a United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq's future government until after the conference takes place Oct. 23 and 24 -- or even abandon the resolution altogether. 
A concern in the administration was that without a resolution, Spain might wish to postpone the conference, as other European countries had suggested earlier in the year.
But other American officials said there was new confidence that the conference could be portrayed as a success, or at least not a failure, in part because the figure for what Iraq could actually spend had been lowered to a more realistic level that reflects the time it takes to solicit bids, award contracts and get the work under way.
A month ago, administration officials said they would have a difficult time raising more than $1 billion for Iraq for 2004 at Madrid. Now officials say Japan itself is considering roughly $1 billion for next year and several billion in later years. 
"The Japanese are talking in the billions," said a senior administration official. "The Europeans are revisiting their earlier numbers. They're all beginning to look at this as a security issue, not a development issue, and they're scrounging for money from other places in their budgets." 
Administration and international aid officials say that after intense American pressure, the initial European pledge of $230 million could expand to several hundred million dollars. If that happens, one official said, the administration will press the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia "to make sure they are not left behind," one official said. The administration's senior Middle East envoy, William J. Burns, visited the United Arab Emirates last week to press them for greater contributions.
Even a sum of a few billion dollars for 2004 -- only a fraction of the $55 billion identified as needed by Iraq over the next four years -- could be trumpeted as a success if it is accompanied by a World Bank report that says that only about $6 billion could be spent on Iraq. In developers' jargon, the $6 billion figure rests on calculations of Iraq's "absorptive capacity," meaning that it takes months or years to plan for projects. 
"The aid figures that have been published for Iraq are reasonable as a measure of what Iraq needs," said an official involved in planning the Madrid conference. "Where the numbers are not so reasonable is the time frame for how much can be spent. This money cannot be spent overnight." 
At a meeting in Madrid last week, those planning the conference decided that the donors would be asked to pledge grants for the first year and to make multiyear commitments for subsequent years, according to officials who attended.
The meeting also agreed to set up a special trust fund so that donors could contribute to the reconstruction without giving money directly to the American occupation authority or to an Iraqi interim government that lacked legal legitimacy. 
The issue of Iraq's needs and where the money will come from has been a source of confusion in recent weeks. The World Bank and the United Nations have identified $36 billion in needs over the next four years. Separately, the American-led occupation has estimated a different set of needs as costing $19 billion.
The $55 billion that results from combining the two estimates has become the figure used to designate what Iraq needs to rehabilitate itself, its oil fields, its infrastructure and its domestic police forces. If Congress passes the administration's current request of $20.3 billion, that will bring the total amount needed down to about $35 billion. 
Some American officials are unhappy over any suggestion that Iraq cannot "absorb" more than $6 billion in the first year. These officials argue that the World Bank and United Nations economists are overlooking the fact that construction of power plants, water and sewage lines and the training of security forces can be carried out quickly.
"You have to have a rapid disbursement to create the necessary conditions for everything else to happen in Iraq," said a senior administration official. "You can't get the country back on its feet until the power is back on."

HEADLINE: Medicare Bill Hits New York The Hardest 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The debate in Congress on adding drug coverage to Medicare has largely obscured a parallel fight over whether the bill should cut or add billions of dollars in Medicare payments to hospitals, particularly teaching hospitals. New York has far more money at stake in that struggle than any other state.
 Depending on how various House and Senate proposals are resolved, hospitals nationwide could see a net loss of up to $5.4 billion in Medicare payments over 10 years, compared with 2002 levels, $2.1 billion of that in New York, according to an analysis by the Healthcare Association of New York State, a hospital lobbying group. Part of that reduction would come from a cut of roughly 15 percent in payments made only to teaching hospitals, which are most heavily concentrated in New York. 
 Some Republican lawmakers called those figures exaggerated, but they agreed that the numbers are in the billions and that New York stands to lose the most.
The fight has pitted legislators from rural areas, whose hospitals would be helped most by the proposed changes, against urban colleagues whose hospitals stand to take the biggest cuts. And it has put several Republican congressmen from New York and a few from other Northeast states at odds with their House leaders, with some saying they might be forced to vote against the bill, drug benefit and all. The House passed its version of the bill in June by a single vote, along party lines, so defection by a cadre of Republicans could threaten final passage.
"We genuinely want to get a bill, but we have to make sure New York is protected," and so far, there have been so such assurances, said Representative Peter T. King, a Republican of Nassau County. Mr. King is one of the Republicans who said he might vote against a House bill that he called "a real, serious blow to New York" in its present form.
The Medicare bill that the Senate passed in June, with bipartisan support, makes fewer cuts to hospitals than the House version, and Senate leaders in both parties have expressed an interest in making the final bill still more generous to hospitals. The issue has gone to a joint conference committee, but its fate remains in doubt, as the two houses still have major differences in their treatment of drug benefits, patient co-payments, hospital payments, states' own drug subsidy programs, competition between Medicare and private health plans and many other issues.
Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, an influential Republican who represents seven western New York counties, is among those trying to nudge some of the House's position in the Senate's direction, by "trying educate people who are either conferees or are in a position to have opinions to conferees."
"I go on the assumption that we'll have to pass it with Republican votes," without Democrats, Mr. Reynolds said. "I'm an optimistic guy to believe that we can get there, but this will be the most difficult bill since I've been here."
The Northeast is not well represented on the 17-member conference committee, a fact that hospital officials and some representatives from that region say worries them. The only New Yorker on the panel is Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, who, as a member of the Democratic minority, has little sway in a House marked by a sharp partisan divide. The only other member from the Northeast is Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican of Connecticut.
This is partly the revival of an old fight, over the Balanced Budget Act of 1996. Medicare has long paid more to teaching hospitals than it pays to other hospitals for treating the same patients with the same ailments. The balanced budget law sought to shrink that added payment, in a series of steps over several years.
On Oct. 1, 2002, the differential dropped from 6.5 percent to 6 percent, and under the budget law, it dropped to 5.5 percent this Oct. 1, though officials say the latter decline is effectively postponed, pending the passage of a bill. The House version of the Medicare bill, and House Republican leaders, want to adhere to the balanced budget law and go ahead with the reduction to 5.5 percent.
The Senate version of the bill inserted a slight increase from that level, to 5.53 percent. Senators in both parties said that provision was meant merely to signal their intent to bring up the issue in a conference committee, and that in fact, they hoped for a much larger increase.
Some Democrats have called for a return to the 6.5 percent differential of last year. According to the Healthcare Association of New York State, the difference between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent would be $9.5 billion nationally over 10 years.
The House bill would reduce the annual increase in Medicare payments to hospitals to cover rising costs, to 3.1 percent from 3.5 percent for each of the next three years; the Senate version would leave it unchanged. Even if the adjustment were to return to 3.5 percent after three years, the Healthcare Association says the House's reduction would amount to $10.4 billion over 10 years.
House leaders, especially Representatives Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority leader, and Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and co-chairman of the conference committee, have so far insisted on both the lower inflation adjustment and adherence to the Balanced Budget Act cuts, maintaining that the hospitals can absorb them.
Both houses have agreed on increased payments to rural-area hospitals, more than $14 billion over 10 years in each version, according to the association.
The net effect of all the changes, the Healthcare Association says, would be $5.4 billion less for hospitals over a decade, but it would be spread very unevenly. New York, with 110 teaching hospitals and relatively few rural ones, would lose $2.1 billion compared to the 2002 formulas, by the group's analysis, New Jersey $711 million, and Connecticut $399 million. In 22 states, mostly in the South and Midwest, hospitals would see a net gain.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Medicare bills in Congress that could affect billions of dollars in payments to New York's hospitals misstated the timing of earlier cuts to teaching hospitals. They took effect on Oct. 1, 2002, not in two phases on that date and again on Oct. 1 this year.

HEADLINE: Cosmic Soccer Ball? Theory Already Takes Sharp Kicks 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE 

 BODY:
In an unusual logjam of contradictory claims, a revolutionary new model of the universe, as a soccer ball, arrives on astronomers' desks this morning at least slightly deflated.
 In a paper being published today in the journal Nature, Dr. Jeffrey Weeks, an independent mathematician in Canton, N.Y., and his colleagues suggest, based on analysis of maps of the Big Bang, that space is a kind of 12-sided hall of mirrors, in which the illusion of infinity is created by looking out and seeing multiple copies of the same stars. 
 If the model is correct, Dr. Weeks said, it would rule out a popular theory of the Big Bang that asserts that our own observable universe is just a bubble among others in a realm of vastly larger extent. "It means we canjust about see the whole universe now," Dr. Weeks said. 
But other astronomers, including a group led by Dr. David Spergel of Princeton, said a continuing analysis of the same data had probably already ruled out the soccer ball universe. They promised to post their results soon on the physics Web site arXiv.org/list/astro-ph.
"Weeks and friends are making a dramatic claim, perhaps one of the biggest science stories of the century," said Dr. Neil Cornish, a physicist at Montana State University, "but extraordinary claims require extraordinary support."
For now, the two groups, who have been in intense communication the last few days, disagree on whether the soccer ball universe has been refuted. What is amazing about this debate, they all agree, is that it will actually be settled soon, underscoring the power of modern data to resolve issues that were once considered almost metaphysical.
"This is what got Giordano Bruno burned at the stake," said Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania. "Is space infinite or not?"
In Nature, Dr. Weeks and his colleagues write: "Since antiquity, humans have wondered whether our universe is finite or infinite. Now, after more than two millennia of speculation, observational data might finally settle this ancient question." The other authors are Dr. Jean-Pierre Luminet of Paris Observatory; Dr. Alain Riazueleo of the French atomic energy center CEA, in Saclay, France; Dr. Roland Lehoucq of the Paris Observatory and CEA; and Dr. Jean-Phillippe Uzan of the University of Paris.
The evidence for and against a finite universe resides in a radio map of the baby universe produced last February by a NASA satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. It shows that 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the event in which space and time emerged, the universe was laced with faint waves and ripples, which are the origin of modern galaxies and other cosmic structures. In an infinite universe, according to theory, waves of all size should appear in the sky, but in the Wilkinson data there was a cutoff: no waves larger than about 60 degrees across appeared in the sky.
If the universe were a musical instrument, it would be inexplicably missing its low notes, perhaps, some cosmologists have suggested, because it is too small to play them. The universe is finite rather than infinite, they speculate. Like a violin that cannot produce deep cello notes, the universe cannot produce waves larger than itself.
In such a universe, if you went far enough in one direction, you would find yourself back where you started, on the other side of the universe, like a cursor disappearing off the left side of a screen and reappearing on the right.
One simple example of this is a torus, or a bagel shape, which is what you get when you wrap the left and right and top and bottom sides of the screen around so that they meet.
In the Nature paper, Dr. Weeks and his colleagues propose that three-dimensional space has 12 sides, like a soccer ball, or more technically a dodecahedron. This model would fit with the cutoff of large waves observed in the Wilkinson satellite data. Each face is "glued" to its opposite number. (Don't try this at home.) A spaceship crossing one face or panel of the soccer ball would enter the other side of the ball. After traveling 74 billion light-years it would find itself back where it had started. 
While the lack of cosmic low notes is suggestive, cosmologists say there is a definitive test of finite universes in the Wilkinson map. When the cosmic radiation intersects the edges of the universe, it would make identical circles, like a balloon squashed in a box, on opposite sides of the sky. In the case of a bagel, there would be two circles in the map, on opposite sides of the sky. In the case of Dr. Weeks's dodecahedron, there would be six pairs of circles, each about 35 degrees in diameter.
"This is a much higher bar to clear," Dr. Cornish said. 
Dr. Tegmark said: "What's nice is it's so testable. It's the truth or it's dead. The data is even out there, on the Internet. It's just a question of sifting through it."
But so far the circles have not showed up.
Earlier this year, Dr. Tegmark and his wife and colleague Dr. Angelica Oliveira-Costa, Dr. Mattias Zaldarriago, of Harvard, and Dr. Andrew Hamilton of the University of Colorado, searched the Wilkinson data for oppositely matched circles. The results, they said, ruled out the possibility that the universe was shaped like a bagel, no doubt disappointing New Yorkers who would like to have imagined a cosmic connection with their breakfast.
Dr. Tegmark said that the results also ruled out Dr. Weeks's dodecahedron. "We ought to have seen those circles in our study," he said.
Meanwhile, a more thorough analysis of the data, looking for all possible circles, has been undertaken by Dr. Spergel, who was part of the original Wilkinson team, Dr. Cornish, and Dr. Glenn Starkman of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. The study, about two-thirds complete, had already eliminated many simple models of so-called "small universes," including a dodecahedron when the Nature paper hit their desks last week, Dr. Spergel said.
"No soccer ball, no doughnuts, no bagels," he said.
But Dr. Weeks said there were potential gaps in the circle search methods. For one thing, if the dodecahedron were slightly larger, he said, the circles would be smaller and would not show up in Dr. Spergel's search. But until all the papers are posted on the archive or published where everybody can read them, these claims cannot be evaluated.
Dr. Weeks said that astronomers from both teams would join this fall to test the circle search, using simulated data. If the models are false, they could be ruled out as early as November, he said.
Dr. Cornish said that, although it was the scientific community that would ultimately decide, his team was confident of its results. "I don't see any wiggle room," he said.
But because it is such a "truly spectacular claim," he said, they are planning in the next few days to run a special test focused on the particular model. The test could detect very small circles. "We can push it to where there's no chance," Dr. Cornish said.
The prospects for the finite universe, he added, look bleak.
The stakes for cosmology, should the soccer ball or some other variety of small universe prevail, are not small at all. A small universe, everybody agrees, would present severe problems for the prevailing theory of the Big Bang, known as inflation, which posits that the cosmos underwent a burst of hyperexpansion in its first moments. 
Moreover, Dr. Weeks said, a small universe would eliminate one popular variant of the theory known as eternal inflation, in which bubble universes give rise to one another endlessly in what some cosmologists call a "multiverse."
"This puts the whole universe in view," he explained. "It wouldn't rule out other universes. There could be others. They would be totally unrelated, without any contact between them."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 14, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the debate among astronomers over the shape of the universe misspelled the name of a Harvard scientist whose research helped rule out the possibility that it is shaped like a torus, or bagel. He is Dr. Matias Zaldarriaga, not Mattias Zaldarriago.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Giving Shape to the Universe"Radiation left over from the Big Bang, right, seen by the WMAP satellite in February, depicts the early universe. Scientists expect the data to determine whether the universe is finite or infinite. Which shape best predicts the patterns that were seen by the satellite? Some computations suggest it is a dodecahedron, a 12-sided object. In this scenario of a finite universe: 1. Space travelers leave the dodecahedron across one face. 2. They would return from the opposite face. The observer's line of sight wraps around the universe in the same way, producing the illusion of a cosmos repeating along a dodecahedral latticework, at right, like a house of mirrors.

HEADLINE: House Backs Temporary Shift on PensionFunds 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
The House voted on Wednesday to allow businesses to pay less into workers' pension plans over the next two years, saying the $26 billion in relief was needed to enable companies to keep plans afloat and protect benefits for future retirees.
 Supporters said that the bill, which was approved 397 to 2, would give breathing space to companies and defined-benefit pension plans that have been hurt by a combination of low interest rates, the economic slowdown, stock market losses and an increase in retirees. 
 Unions, fearing that some companies might otherwise terminate or default on pension plans, supported the bill. 
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, an agency that guarantees the pensions of 44 million Americans and is financed primarily by pension fund premiums, estimates that the entire system is underfunded by $350 billion. The agency says about $80 billion of that is in plans in such severe condition that the obligations might have to be assumed by the Guaranty Corporation, which itself has a $5.7 billion deficit.
While allowing a temporary 10 percent reduction in corporate contributions to pension plans in 2004 and 2005, the measure commits Congress to come up with a permanent solution that more accurately matches plan contributions to long-term liabilities.
Backers said the bill, while putting off a solution to the underfunding problems, will give two years of relief both to companies having trouble meeting their payment obligations and businesses that, because of the current payment formula, are paying more than they need to. 
The White House welcomed the House bill, saying it was "an important first step toward providing a permanent replacement for the interest rate now used to determine pension liabilities."
The House bill is less sweeping than a measure approved by the Senate Finance Committee last month.
The Senate version would give corporations three years of reduced contributions before putting in place a more permanent and tougher system for calculating payments.

HEADLINE: Two Professors, Collaborators In Econometrics, Win the Nobel 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
An American and a Briton have won this year's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for developing statistical methods that allow researchers, policy makers and Wall Street traders to better analyze stock prices and other long-running series of data.
 Robert F. Engle, who was born in Syracuse, and Clive W. J. Granger, who is a native of Wales, spent much of their career working together at the University of California at San Diego, doing their seminal work in the 1970's and 80's. Professor Engle joined the faculty of New York University three years ago. 
 Their research has enabled others to study the relationship between variables, like personal wealth and consumer spending, in ways not possible before. A more sophisticated understanding of those relationships -- what is cause and what is effect, for instance -- has led to a richer understanding of how the economy works and better forecasts, economists said. 
"It's not that they have looked at a specific problem and solved it, as has been the case with other prizes," said Lars Calmfors, a member of the prize committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which administers the Nobel awards, and a professor of international economics at Stockholm University. "This is really basic research. It's a methodological prize."
In a telephone interview yesterday from a house he owns in eastern France, Professor Engle, 60 years old, said: "I'm in the town of Annecy, France, and it's late afternoon, and it's a beautiful day. How they tracked me down here, I'm not sure. It's pretty far from the big financial centers."
Professor Granger, working this semester in New Zealand, was awakened at 3 a.m. on Thursday with the news, he said.
The two will share prize money of about $1.3 million. The economics prize is the only one not established by Alfred Nobel's will; it was created by Sweden'scentral bank in 1968.
Professor Engle and Professor Granger were among a group of a few dozen economists considered potential winners in coming years. But the two were not seen as favorites this year because two other people from their field -- econometrics, which is the use of statistics to study the economy -- received the prize just three years ago.
"I kind of thought I had a chance," Professor Granger, 69, said, "but I wasn't expecting it."
Before the two published their work, economists often had to assume that a variable was no more likely to move in one direction than the other, even when the evidence -- such as the rise in stocks over the last 200 years -- showed otherwise. Statistical models simply offered no alternative.
In the late 1970's, however, Professor Granger developed ways to analyze the relationship between two statistics that had both a long-term trend and an element of randomness. The month-to-month fluctuation in consumer spending, even as driven more broadly by changes in household wealth, is one example.
Professor Engle's primary work improved the understanding of volatility, particularly in the stock market, and enabled economists to make more accurate forecasts. Previously, researchers were often forced to assume that volatility did not change over time.
"We worked together quite a bit," Professor Granger said. "We helped each other, but we had a different focus."
The details of their work are highly technical, but its applications have spread well beyond the academy.
Allan M. Malz, head of research at RiskMetrics, a financial and software company in New York, said Professor Engle's methods had spawned hundreds of new tools for analyzing stocks.
Dale Jorgensen, an econometrician at Harvard, noted that the Nobel-winning work also led directly to research on "irrational exuberance" by Robert J. Shiller of Yale that has seeped into the public consciousness. Working with John Y. Campbell at Harvard, Mr. Shiller argued in 2000 that the stock market was overvalued, well before its decline began.
Professors Engle and Granger began working together on the La Jolla campus of U.C.S.D. in the mid-1970's and helped build one of the world's best-known econometric programs. Both became emeritus professors on June 30 but continue to work with graduate students on campus. In addition, Professor Engle holds an appointment at the Stern School of Business at N.Y.U.
Professor Granger attended the University of Nottingham as an undergraduate and doctoral student and spent most of his first two decades as a teacher there. Professor Engle, who came to San Diego just a year after his co-winner, studied physics at Williams College before earning a Ph.D. at Cornell and teaching for seven years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Each man considers the other a friend, but they are hardly carbon copies of each other, economists said yesterday.
Yesterday afternoon in France, Professor Engle joined his wife at a cafe, where he ate a grilled sandwich of ham, chevre and Reblochon cheese, before running a short errand, he said. He returned home to hear his wife tell him the prize committee had called.
"The prize money will be nice," he said. Still, he added, "I plan on pretty much doing what I'm doing."
"I love the research. I love working with students, and I plan to continue all that."
When Professor Granger first received the call, he wondered whether it was a hoax, he said, and was sure it was not only after he heard the voices of Royal Academy members whom he knew. He and his wife planned to celebrate this weekend by attending an important late-season rugby match between Canterbury and Auckland and going out to dinner.
For the first six hours as a prize winner, however, he had time to do little but answer e-mail messages and return phone calls, he said, "from everybody I ever knew and some people I didn't."
One person he had not yet managed to speak with, as of nighttime in France, was Professor Engle.

Judge Says Minnesota Cannot Regulate Net Calls
A federal judge in Minnesota has ruled that the state's public utility commission cannot apply its telecommunications regulations to Vonage Holdings, a start-up company that allows consumers to place voice calls over the Internet.
 The case is the first to scrutinize the legal status of the tiny but fast-growing business of shifting voice communications from highly regulated telephone services to the largely unregulated realm of the Internet. Page C8.

HEADLINE: Big Retailers Are Upbeat On Prospects For Holidays 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
In whispers, perhaps not quite daring to believe their own words, retailers have begun to say that this year's holiday season is more promising than those in the recent past. 
 The evidence so far is mostly anecdotal. Back-to-school shopping in August was better than expected and store executives, citing a momentum perceived among consumers who have not had to confront a major international crisis in recent months, think that sales growth and profits will outshine those of the last three years. 
 Gap's holiday lineup, which includes brightly colored toggle coats, gloves and Fair Isle sweaters, all of which seem to hark back to the Johnson administration, reflect a shift among shoppers, away from gloom, according to the retailer. 
"Over all, consumers feel more upbeat, and we feel confident about our merchandise," said Rebecca Weill, a spokeswoman for Gap. "We should be in pretty good shape for the holidays." 
Similar sentiments are expressed by Wal-Mart Stores executives, who have been saying for some time that they expect sales to rise during the second half of this year more than they did during the first half. In August, sales at Wal-Mart stores open at least a year jumped 6.6 percent. 
"In terms of Christmas, you're looking at crystal balls," said Tom Williams, a Wal-Mart spokesman. But he added: "We've planned Christmas season with the idea that Christmas always comes, mainly because it revolves around the little ones. We do expect to be busy." 
In one closely watched sign of that optimism, some stores are hiring more holiday workers than usual. Others are holding steady on the employees, but deploying them differently or increasing training hours, in hopes of winning customers. 
Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores, plans to put more holiday workers in its 31 stores this year than it did last year, a spokeswoman said, "based upon business." The move, which includes increased training, comes after a year of stagnant employment for the chain. At Gap, employees are being required to train twice as long -- eight hours instead of four -- and new hires are being added in waves to handle the holiday crush. 
Retail employment has fallen from its peak of 15,379,800 in February 2001, to 14,958,700 in August, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the percentage loss was smaller than during the last recession, said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist for Deloitte. Meanwhile, retail added some 10,000 jobs in September, more than at any time since July 2002. 
"Generally speaking, employment follows profitability," Mr. Steidtmann said. "Our expectation is that it's going to be a pretty good holiday season." 
At Sears, Roebuck, 35,000 to 40,000 people have been hired for the holiday season, said William Donahue, the company's director for recruitment and staffing. That number is slightly lower than last year, mainly because Sears stores have been redesigned around a central checkout area, a spokesman said. 
At Wal-Mart, managers are hiring workers who will report to work at the end of October or early November, a spokesman said, though the totals will not be known until next year. Limited's stores, which include Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works and Express, plan to add 75,000 workers for the holiday season, beginning in October. At Limited, workers are being enticed with 30 percent discounts on merchandise they buy at the chain where they work, along with guaranteed shifts, said Toyin Ogun, vice president for stores. The hiring is about the same as last year, he added, but "because of the economy, we are getting a higher caliber of associate." 
Still, hiring is taking place cautiously. Most retailers say they have planned to add workers in waves as the December holidays draw closer. Instead of having people come to work in early October, Sears has told many of them not to report until Halloween or later, Mr. Donahue said. That reflects the last-minute nature of many people's shopping patterns, often driven by bargain-hunting. "The customer seems to be shopping later," he said. 
With payroll the second-biggest cost for retailers, after inventory, those who hire workers gradually have more flexibility if the market happens to take a turn for the worse. "If the season didn't fulfill their expectations, they could stop hiring," said Daniel Butler, vice president for retail operations at the National Retail Federation in Washington, "but I think this is going to be a good season." Projected sales for the third and fourth quarter are all up from last year, he said, and perceptions of an economic turnaround are making an impact on shoppers. 
Compared with the holiday season two years ago, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, this year seems radiant, he added.
"After 9/11, people were much more guarded about what they were spending, and they were hunkering down and staying home for a while," Mr. Butler said. "Now they are branching out and shopping, and traveling a little bit more."
"Everybody is trying to be optimistic," said Michael Keefe of Hilco Merchant Resources, a consultant. "The retailers that are reliant on the holiday season are very hopeful that sales will be strong enough to carry them forward."
But not everyone is. Andy Moser, senior managing director for retail finance at GMAC Commercial Finance in Boston, believes there will be gains of 3 or 4 percent, up from last year's increase of 1.5 percent. "It's probably going to be a challenging next 12 months, through the next election," he said. "There are too many things that people are worried about today that they don't know the answers to." 
Retail experts say that momentum began in August, when the back-to-school shoppers exceeded some, although certainly not all, of the retailers' expectations. 
"They were ready to put their proverbial toes back in the water," said Wendy S. Liebmann, chief executive of WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm in Manhattan. 
Beyond that, "sales have been improving for retail in the last 12 weeks, over a year ago," said Barbara Johnson, managing partner for Shopper Trak, which follows the retail industry by examining traffic in stores, malls and casinos. "They've had a good back-to-school season, and Labor Day was strong. It would suggest that the holiday is one that should be promising."
But the fighting in the Middle East, along with fears of more terrorist attacks and the uncertain state of the economy continues to cast a long shadow over shoppers. Ms. Liebmann said that another crisis could wipe out that confidence. 
"There is guarded optimism, but it is very circumstantial," she said of shoppers she has interviewed. "Something from Iraq or something from Afghanistan would definitely have people crawling back into their caves, and taking their wallets with them."

HEADLINE: Currency Rumors in China Shake Hong Kong 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Speculation that China will be forced to let its currency rise has sent a flood of money into the Hong Kong dollar, pushing up its value and inflicting heavy losses on traders while driving short-term interest rates here almost to zero.
 The Hong Kong dollar is often described as having been pegged at 7.8 to the American dollar for the last two decades. But as currency traders have been reminded lately, to the anger of many, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is only committed to maintaining a floor of 7.8 but has not set a ceiling for the currency's value. 
 Money has poured into east Asia since late September, and the currency has inched up, briefly approaching 7.7 Hong Kong dollars to the American dollar in spot trading, and 7.76 in one-year forward contracts. The Hong Kong dollar retreated slightly on Wednesday, to about 7.709. 
 Many currency traders were betting on a devaluation in the Hong Kong dollar because of deflation and economic stagnation. But they did not hedge against the possibility that the Hong Kong dollar could appreciate past 7.8, and have sustained losses estimated in currency markets at as much as $250 million in the last two weeks.
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has sold Hong Kong dollars for other currencies in the last two weeks, but has done so only on a modest scale that has not been enough to stem the rise.
 As the Hong Kong dollar has strengthened, money has flooded into banks here. Interbank lending rates for periods as long as three months have fallen below two-tenths of 1 percent.
 William A. Ryback, the new deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which essentially functions as the central bank here, said at a news conference on Wednesday evening that low lending rates would have "some effect" in crimping banks' profit margins, but added that he was not concerned. The monetary authority is preparing to release a formal paper that had been under preparation even before the recent rise in the Hong Kong dollar, Mr. Ryback said. The paper will urge banks to analyze the extent of their exposure to shifts in currency movements, he said, while adding that to the best of his knowledge, they are not taking extra risks.
 Mr. Ryback declined to discuss details of monetary policy, saying that he was mainly responsible for bank supervision, which had been his area of expertise at the federal reserve in Washington until his retirement there at the end of June.
 The Hong Kong dollar is not alone in appreciating against the American dollar, with the yen also continuing to rise. Zembei Mizoguchi, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, said on Wednesday that the dollar's fall was the result of speculation, and not the United States current account deficit, which many economists and officials elsewhere see as the problem.
 But it is the Hong Kong dollar's appreciation that appears to have inflicted especially heavy losses on speculators. Because the currency was viewed as effectively pegged, trading desks often borrowed heavily to finance very large bets on a devaluation, and did not take steps to protect themselves against a sustained rise in the Hong Kong dollar.
"Most people hadn't realized that this thing could actually move against them to this extent," said James Malcolm, a currency strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase in Singapore.
 Mr. Malcolm estimated that traders had reduced their bets on a devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar by only a third, with many still holding large positions in forward contracts. If the monetary authority does not push the Hong Kong dollar back to 7.8 soon, speculators who do not have bets against the Hong Kong dollar could jump in and try to make the currency even more valuable in the spot market, which could hurt monetary stability, he said.
 "They're actually playing a very dangerous game by letting it stay below" 7.8, he said.
 But traders' losses now could discourage some from betting against the Hong Kong dollar the next time it shows weakness. Joseph Yam, the monetary authority's chief executive, said in an opinion column on the authority's Internet site on Oct. 2 that, "We are in the business of ensuring exchange rate stability, not bailing out currency speculators."
 Traders have also been placing aggressive bets on an appreciation of the Chinese currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, in the hope that international pressure will force Beijing to widen the range in which the People's Bank of China allows the currency to trade. The yuan is effectively pegged in a very narrow band at about 8.28 yuan to the dollar, but forward contracts for the yuan suggest that it could be worth 7.78 to the dollar a year from now.
 Indeed, the value of the yuan briefly surpassed the Hong Kong dollar's value in forward contract trading on Tuesday.
 The trading suggests that the yuan will be worth about the same as a Hong Kong dollar a year from now, and has reawakened years of discussion over whether it might make sense for the Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese yuan to have the same value, especially since Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.
 But Hong Kong allows investments to flow in and out freely and a free-market economy characterized in recent years by slow growth and falling prices, while China still controls investment flows, has many government-owned enterprises and has enjoyed rapid economic growth combined with occasional bouts of inflation. So economists say there is little argument beyond aesthetics for the Hong Kong dollar and the yuan to have the same value.
 "There really isn't too much economic logic to convergence," said Vincent Low, a currency strategist in the Singapore offices of Merrill Lynch.
 There is also a strong political argument against parity for the Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese yuan. Parity could undermine the separateness of Hong Kong's economic system from China's, something that Beijing and Hong Kong have tried to maintain even as cross-border trade has expanded.
 Shiu Sin-por, the executive director of the One Country Two Systems Research Institute, a group here with close ties to Beijing, said that Beijing did not want to intervene in Hong Kong's monetary policy.
 Hong Kong officials have long been extremely leery of changing the peg, refusing to do so even earlier this year when struggling with consumer prices that were falling by as much as 4 percent a year. Devaluing the Hong Kong dollar would make the territory less costly as a base for foreign companies doing business in China and could stop deflation because imported goods would tend to become more expensive here.
 But the peg is politically sacrosanct. When the Hong Kong dollar plunged in September 1983, it touched off a riot by taxi drivers upset at paying higher prices for fuel, and prompted the government to peg the currency at the level of 7.8 to the American dollar that has been maintained ever since.
 Devaluation would also hit hard the many middle-class and wealthy families here who have bought second homes in the United States, Australia, Canada and elsewhere over the years. Second homes are popular for retirement or as places to flee in case Beijing ever pursues a political crackdown in Hong Kong.
 But the mortgages on those second homes, denominated in American, Australian or Canadian dollars, would be costly to service for residents here if their Hong Kong dollars became worth less in terms of other currencies.
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has formidable foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency, announcing on Tuesday that it held $112.1 billion in American currency, more than any entire country except Japan, mainland China, Taiwan and Korea.

HEADLINE: A Boy From Graz 

BYLINE:  By Anneliese Rohrer; Anneliese Rohrer is foreign news editor for Die Presse, an Austrian daily.

DATELINE: VIENNA 

 BODY:
While Californians were voting on Tuesday, Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser of Austria ended a television interview here about budget deficits and European Union economics with an emphatic "Good luck to Arnold Schwarzenegger."
 Mr. Grasser, like Austrians in general, has been pumped up with pride over Mr. Schwarzenegger's accomplishments. That's the case even though, or maybe because, Arnold Schwarzenegger's life -- from lower-middle-class boy in the bland town of Graz to governor of California -- is as alien to the mentality of the average Austrian as a recall vote is to an Austrian political system in which official careers proceed like clockwork. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger's career, by contrast, has all the elements that the average Austrian -- with his dreams of a tenured job in the bureaucracy that leads to early retirement, with his love for his 38-hour work week and his five weeks of holiday per year -- would despise: venturing into the unknown, enduring hard work and physical pain, testing the limits of body and mind, and drawing a road map to the top.
On the other hand, there is enough in Governor Schwarzenegger that Austrians can recognize and admire, or so they think: a touch of machismo, a moving admiration of one's mother, a bit of a sly dog, a cheeky view of the country's Nazi past, and generally what is known in Austria as "Schmah," inadequately translatable as "patter."
So the hype here around California's recall was understandable, but there is something else at work, too. The frenzy is a result, at least in part, of one of the main features of the Austrian national character: the art of transference.
In Vienna in 1972, Austrians held their biggest demonstration since the Allies ended their occupation. The cause was not an end to the arms race or any of the other usual issues of the era. Instead, they were protesting the expulsion of the alpine ski champion Karl Schranz from the Olympic Games in Japan for violating his amateur status. Schranz was supposed to be our hero, winning gold medals for Austria. His being barred from certain success brought an outpouring of frustration by his countrymen, who perceived themselves as victims of dark international forces.
So, too, Arnold Schwarzenegger represents a success the average Austrian would have neither the stamina nor the inclination to pursue. Nor is he the only object of transference. The stunning success in 1999 of the right-wing politician Jorg Haider -- wrongly viewed in the United States as a full-fledged Nazi -- was possible only because voters transferred their protest against a rigid political system to him. The individual reluctance to openly oppose Austria's two major political parties, which had pooled their power in a joint government in 1986 and dominated every aspect of public life, was transformed in the secrecy of the voting booth: Jorg Haider should do the job of breaking up that system instead. Austrians could express sentiments without being publicly known for having them.
The admiration that is showered on Mr. Schwarzenegger now in Austria has a parallel in the devotion that the country's elite and public have for Frank Stronach, another Austrian who did well overseas, in his case by founding a Canadian auto-parts company. To the Austrian eye, Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Stronach are larger than life -- or at least larger than any Austrian would conceive himself. And that touches a chord in the Austrian soul and stirs memories of the time when there was an emperor -- and an empire for that matter; when the country was a force to be reckoned with, not an insignificant spot on the map of Central Europe, squashed between the powers of Germany and Italy and up-and-coming countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic, which once were dependents in the Hapsburg Empire.
Besides, Austrians love vindication, and Mr. Schwarzenegger's victory is certainly seen as one: for the humiliation Washington dealt Austria by putting Kurt Waldheim (president of Austria from 1986 to 1990) on its "watch list" of undesirable aliens; for Jorg Haider's being called a Nazi in the United States and Europe; for the disapproval when the conservative People's Party and Mr. Haider's Freedom Party formed a coalition government in 1999.
Thus Mr. Schwarzenegger's victory is seen as a signal to the world: look here, we too are somebody. A country like Austria that has been downsized by history vacillates between a national inferiority complex and exuberance. Now these are days of compensation.
The anxiety with which some Austrians watched the American reaction to reports that Mr. Schwarzenegger made positive comments about Hitler was proof of the uneasiness about any possible new rebuke of the country of his birth. His defeat at the polls would have been seen as further evidence of a global misconception about Austria. The country would be a victim again.
In Austria, Mr. Schwarzenegger was not criticized for any Hitler comments or for his groping. Here, neither is seen as reprehensible: on Hitler the attitude is, let bygones be bygones; on groping, it is not a criminal offense -- yet (a new law is before the national legislature). Neither slip has damaged the career of any Austrian politician in recent history.
Still, despite our pride over Mr. Schwarzenegger's election, there is open agreement, and relief, that it would have been impossible here. Stars, whether from entertainment or sports, have all failed politically in a country where party politics is a lifetime profession. This is not a land of self-made men who can take positions on issues contrary to their own party. And Mr. Schwarzenegger's one-liners (and those of the other candidates) would have been perceived as a sign of an inferior intellect.
Austria is basking in Mr. Schwarzenegger's California triumph. We are enjoying the moment. But although we admire Mr. Schwarzenegger for what we are not, unlike Americans, we'd never elect him.

Governor Schwarzenegger

 BODY:
The results of the California recall are giving us pause, beyond the difficulty of adjusting to the phrase "Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger." New York, after all, also has a governor who concealed the bad news about the state's impending deficit until he was safely re-elected, along with a State Legislature that gives a whole new resonance to the word dysfunction. But no one seems to be trying to replace George Pataki with Robert DeNiro. 
 New York, like most states, makes it difficult for voters to indulge in fits of pique at politics as usual by installing an action hero in the governor's office. Alienated citizens can't rush in and register to vote on Election Day, as they did in Minnesota when Jesse Ventura was elected. They don't have the option of a recall, as Californians do. The political tradition in New York might best be described as antipopulist. On Tuesday night at least, that didn't seem entirely bad. 
 California's system is actually the worst of all evils. The voters micromanage the state budget through one referendum after another. But they are generally deprived of real choice in picking state officials. Right-wing Republicans have been able to control their party's nominating process, forcing a moderate-to-liberal populace to accept whatever slate the Democrats deign to offer. Mr. Schwarzenegger, a moderate-to-liberal Republican, would have had a much tougher time in a primary than he did in this race, where he was able to insert himself onto the ballot without the party's screening.
The final days of the race were dominated by charges from a growing crowd of female accusers that Mr. Schwarzenegger was, at best, a boor when it came to dealing with vulnerable women. The voters seemed in the main to ignore the issue, demonstrating once again that a politician's private sins bother the citizenry only if they clash violently with his public image. There isn't much in Mr. Schwarzenegger's film career that would have caused people to be shocked by the news that he has behaved like a sexist and a bully off camera.
The exit polls did not shed much light on the California voters' feelings, except their profound sense of irritation. A sizeable chunk of the Schwarzenegger voters said they had voted on the issues, but agreed that he had not really addressed them.
Now everyone wants to see what happens next. California is famously difficult to govern, and Mr. Schwarzenegger will not have any more options than Gray Davis did when it comes to balancing the state's budget. Perhaps the voters understand that, and simply want to stagger through their current economic woes with a chief executive who is more diverting than the dour Mr. Davis. During the campaign, Mr. Schwarzenegger had a huge advantage in the low expectations that everyone had about him. In politics, it is better to be lucky than to be good. But Mr. Schwarzenegger already knew that from his movie days.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush Plans Appearance With Schwarzenegger

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush will appear at the side of California's governor-elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger, during a fund-raising trip to the state next week, a Republican close to the White House said on Wednesday, even as some religious conservative supporters of Mr. Bush said they were troubled by accusations that Mr. Schwarzenegger had engaged in sexual misconduct. 
 But the conservatives said their concerns would not spill over to Mr. Bush. It was unthinkable, they added, that a Republican president would not stand with a newly elected Republican governor on a trip to the state, particularly one the White House hopes to win in 2004. 
 "The president is a politician who is running for re-election, and given that California could be the key to 2004 and that the vote was resoundingly for Arnold I don't think the president feels he is embracing Arnold in all of his manifestations," said Robert Knight, the director of the Culture and Family Institute, a Washington conservative group.
White House advisers pronounced themselves elated with the election's outcome, and insisted that the accusations that Mr. Schwarzenegger had groped women were politically motivated. The accusations would not, they said, affect Mr. Bush, who has made conservative family values a part of his political appeal. 
"This is a sea change in California," a Republican close to Mr. Bush's top political advisers said. "The people have rejected attack politics, so I don't think you'll see anything but support for the new Republican governor."
Mr. Bush called Mr. Schwarzenegger on Wednesday to offer congratulations, said Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary. Next Wednesday or Thursday, Mr. Bush is to appear with Mr. Schwarzenegger in Fresno or Riverside, between fund-raisers for his re-election campaign. 
Many Republicans have said for weeks that Mr. Schwarzenegger's victory would give Mr. Bush a strong organizational and fund-raising foundation in a traditionally Democratic state. Democrats, and some Republicans close to Mr. Bush, have countered that Gov. Gray Davis, the unpopular incumbent Democrat who was ousted on Tuesday, would have been an ideal foil for Mr. Bush and might have inspired high turnout among Republicans.
Mr. Schwarzenegger, they added, will be of little help to Mr. Bush's re-election if he proves unable to handle the state's financial crisis that was a major factor in Mr. Davis's defeat.
White Houseadvisers said that Mr. Bush had favored Mr. Schwarzenegger in the recall effort, though he was loath to say so publicly to avoid accusations of meddling in the election. Mr. Schwarzenegger was known as a loyal friend of the Bush family who had campaigned for the first President Bush. 
Former President Bush returned the favor, Mr. Schwarzenegger said, with a $1,000 contribution to his campaign for governor.
On Wednesday night, the current President Bush collected $14 million at a fund-raising dinner for the Republican National Committee at the Washington Hilton. At the dinner, donors could give the party up to $25,000, the annual maximum allowed by law. The money can be used for television advertising for Mr. Bush and other Republican candidates.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Are Insisting Money for Iraq Be Loans 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
In the last week or so, Representative Zach Wamp, a conservative Republican from Tennessee, has said no to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, to Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and to Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director. 
 And on Wednesday, when President Bush summoned him to the White House to say that Iraq must be given $20.3 billion in reconstruction money, Mr. Wamp also said no. Like a growing number of Republicans in the House and Senate, he wants the administration to lend rather than give all the money to Iraq, and he is unafraid of defying the White House on the subject. 
 "Obviously we've got their attention on this one," he said. "But I think we're doing the right thing, and I respectfully take issue with them. And believe me, the people of Tennessee are cheering me on as we do this."
Members of Congress from around the country say they are underintense pressure from their constituents to scale back the nation's generosity to Iraq at a time when domestic unemployment and deficits are at high levels. The idea of granting money to Iraq with no hope of repayment has become particularly unpalatable for many lawmakers, several of whom have written amendments that would require some form of a loan.
A few of the measures are vague on the nature and terms of a loan, but others are explicit that Washington must eventually be reimbursed. The White House has been negotiating with some members on the exact language of the amendments, a move that is seen on Capitol Hill as an indication that the administration recognizes the depth of public concern about the reconstruction money.
"My constituents are proud of this president, but they are as adamant as I am that we want our money back for reconstruction, just like we were promised," said Representative John A. Culberson, Republican of Texas, an old ally of the president from their Austin days, who planned to propose a loan amendment but dropped it Wednesday under pressure from the White House. 
Mr. Wamp, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, plans to introduce loan amendments at Thursday's committee meeting that would give half the $20.3 billion to Iraq immediately, and would lend the rest once some form of permanent Iraqi government is established. 
Opponents of the loan plans -- who include Republican leaders supporting the president's position and some liberal Democrats -- say that some of the amendments are simply intended to make reconstruction more palatable for constituents without really diminishing America's role.
"I think a number of these amendments are designed to essentially appeal to politics back home," said G. William Hoagland, budget director for the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist. "They won't change the fact that we still have to appropriate the money, and that there really isn't a government entity in Iraq right now that anyone can lend money to." Administration officials told the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday that a loan would remove American control over the reconstruction.
Representative Rahm Emanuel, an Illinois Democrat who has been critical of the reconstruction plan, said the loan provisions would backfire once the public learned that the United States would be last in line to be repaid, behind creditors like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, France and Russia, which together are owed $200 billion. Other House Democrats, including Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, said Wednesday that they planned to oppose the entire $87 billion spending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan that includes the reconstruction money.
The chairman of the appropriations committee, Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, predicted that all the loan amendments would be defeated, but Republican officials said similar plans had a strong chance in the Senate. One Senate proposal that has gained significant bipartisan support would require that half the $20.3 billion be repaid, but would allow that amount to be forgiven if Iraq cannot make such a payment.
"If Iraq isn't successful in rebuilding the economy, then we wouldn't expect them to return the money," said the amendment's sponsor, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas.
The White House has worked hard to get Republicans to drop or weaken their proposals, inviting several members to meetings with the president or other top officials to get them to change their mind.

HEADLINE: Putin's Democratic Present Fights His K.G.B. Past 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
There is a question that irritates President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and it is the one about his past as a foreign intelligence operative of the K.G.B.
 "They cannot forget about that agency," he replied, seemingly to his aides, when asked a version of it in an expansive interview at his wooded presidential estate outside of Moscow. He chuckled, but not warmly. 
 Does the president of a newly democratic Russia -- or, as some say, an increasingly autocratic one -- regret any part of the K.G.B.'s history? 
"No, of course not," he said brusquely and, surprisingly, personally. "There was absolutely nothing that I could be ashamed of." 
The question, and his answer, lie at the heart of today's Russia, because fairly or not, much of what is happening here is viewed through the prism of Mr. Putin's first career: the war in Chechnya, government control of news organizations and elections, the growing role of former security officers like himself in all ranks of government. 
But there is another side to Mr. Putin, too, the one molded by his second, post-Soviet career as an apparatchik in a democratic, reformist government of St. Petersburg, the city built as Russia's "window to Europe" and the birthplace of the revolution that slammed the window shut after 1917. 
"We remember, and we are obliged to remember, everything negative, everything horrible that we encountered in the 20th century," Mr. Putin said. "We should draw conclusions from this. We have paid a very great price for this. Millions of people died in the camps. The totalitarian regime brought the country to a national catastrophe and to the collapse of the Soviet Union. And we are fully aware of this, and the people of Russia have drawn conclusions for themselves."
And so, he ended, "We firmly stand on the path of development of democracy and of a market economy."
After meeting him for the first time in 2001, President Bush famously said he had looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, got "a sense of his soul" and liked what he saw. To most Russians, Mr. Putin's "soul" remains a far more complicated, conflicted question.
A wealthy businessman who is close to him -- and spoke anonymously to remain that way -- said there were in fact two Putins, a security agent and a democrat, struggling for equipoise. Or as Viktor Erofeyev, a writer who was and still is something of a dissident, put it: Mr. Putin has "a dark angel" on one shoulder and "a light angel" on the other.
In the four years since Russia's first president, Boris N. Yeltsin, plucked him from political obscurity and anointed him the second, Mr. Putin has steered Russia onto a stable, democratic and Western-looking path that he said was irreversible, if still incomplete. 
At the same time, he has overseen what his critics call a steady erosion of democratic rights.
His press ministry closed the last independent national television network in June and gave its frequency to a government-owned sports channel. His government pushed through new election rules this summer that, taken literally, prohibit media coverage of candidates and anything they say or do. 
Russia, 12 years after the collapse of the Soviet state, still has an opaque judicial system. It still has closed cities, where foreigners and even most Russians cannot go. Its security services again wieldsignificant power.
The businessman said Mr. Putin's conflicting instincts -- between freedom and state -- mirror the struggle within his government and country. This struggle will dominate his second term, his re-election next March being considered a given. While the outcome could determine the country's course, he said Mr. Putin himself might never resolve it. 
"I believe that the struggle within Putin will go on until the end of his life," he said.
In person, Mr. Putin comes across as exceedingly disciplined and concentrated. His office at the compound in Novo-Ogaryovo, a stylish suburb of Moscow, reflects a focus on power, not its trappings. It is ornate, but sparsely decorated.
The president, who turned 51 on Tuesday, listens intently and builds lengthy, meticulously constructed answers. He has a strong command of detail and a sense of humor, albeit a sardonic one.
The interview, which took place Saturday, was conducted in Russian and English, through a translator, with Mr. Putin occasionally interjecting in English.
At several points, he sought to draw moral equivalencies between Russia and the United States in the same way Soviet leaders once did -- and as before, some were simply strained. 
He avoided a direct question about the growing influence of the security officials -- known as siloviki -- by saying he had simply restructured law enforcement agencies the way the Bush administration created the Department of Homeland Security. "To talk about a return to the Soviet times in connection with would be like talking about the times of McCarthy, referring to the ministry of homeland security in the United States," he said. "This is rubbish that has nothing to do with reality."
Of his own service in East Germany in the last years of a dying Soviet empire, he expressed pride. He derided "various cliches and labels" -- presumably meaning those applied to him -- as "very ineffective" and "even primitive."
"You know, we haven't fallen from the moon," he said at another point of those who, like him, served in the security services. "We were born in this country. We live here. We are products of the time in which we lived. That is a fact."
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union -- and the secret services that kept it in power -- represented the state itself, intertwining "more than 20 million people," including himself, into its bureaucracy but not necessarily into its historic culpability, he argued.
"And what now -- must all of these 20 million people cover their heads in ash and whip themselves?" he said.
Referring to Mr. Yeltsin, he said: "The former president, the first president of Russia, was a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee. Meanwhile, he probably is the person who has done the most important thing in the contemporary history of the country. He gave it freedom."
That is the essence of Mr. Putin. He, like Russia, he has sought to reconcile the past and the future. He portrays himself as part of a new generation, one shaped by the past, but looking forward.
Addressing the issue more directly perhaps than he ever has, Mr. Putin described what he called the "very harsh, black periods" of Soviet history -- the Stalin-era purges. He acknowledged that the "state security apparatus served as the main tool of these repressions." At the same time, however, he insisted the security services that became the K.G.B. he worked for were only a tool wielded by the controlling hands of the real power, the Communist Party. 
"This was in the 1930's -- in the last century -- but continued practically until the death of Stalin in 1953," he said. "I will draw your attention to the fact that I was born in 1952."
Mr. Putin noted that he had studied law at St. Petersburg University, an institution known, he said, for "its democratic traditions." He also studied a foreign language, German, and is learning English now. Perhaps because of that, perhaps because his roots lie in "a window to Europe," he spoke of a vision of Russia closely intertwined with Europe, economically, socially and politically. 
He does not ascribe to theories of Russia's unique Eurasian character -- nor of a Russian claim of exclusivity when it comes to establishing democratic freedoms.
"By their mentality and culture, the people of Russia are Europeans," he said. 
Mr. Putin curtly dismissed the notion that his -- and Russia's -- commitment to democracy was still somehow wavering, even as he frankly acknowledged shortcomings in elections and press freedoms. 
"Of course many things are still in a stage of evolution," he said. 
When he first came to power, he said he hoped to create a "dictatorship of law," a phrase that received more attention for the first word rather than the last. In the interview, he said the most important lesson from his education was "respect for the law."
Whether Mr. Putin adheres to that lesson, and whether the rest of Russia embraces it, remains to be seen. Russia is a place where corruption is rife and where few share a sense of civic responsibility. 
Mr. Putin clearly desires order, and to him that means a strong central government. Asked about reports that ExxonMobil was negotiating to buy a large share of the newly merged YukosSibneft, Russia's largest oil company, Mr. Putin said Russia welcomed foreign investment. Then he added that the government ought to have a say in so significant a deal. 
"I think it would be the right thing to do to have preliminary consultations with the Russian government on this matter," he said. 
On Tuesday, an official in Mr. Putin's government amended his remarks, the Interfax news agency reported, saying there was in fact no legal obligation requiring any foreign investor to consult the government.

HEADLINE: Dean Says President Bush Is Setting the Stage for the 'Failure of America' 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Howard Dean, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, on Wednesday offered perhaps his most overarching critique yet of the Republican incumbent, saying, "I think what the president is doing is setting the stage for the failure of America."
 "If you look at what's happened to other great countries," Dr. Dean said over lunch with reporters and editors of The New York Times, "they get in trouble when they can't manage their money -- and this president's certainly proven himself adept at that -- and they get in trouble when they overstretch their military capabilities." 
 "This country's a great country, and the reason it's an important country is not just because I'm an American and proud to be an American," he continued. "America is the beacon of hope for the rest of the world. We are the last country on earth where cynicism doesn't pervade government. Americans really hope that things are going to get better in the world and they can make things better, and Americans believe more than any other people that we can make things better by sheer will and money and hard work." 
Dr. Dean said he expects jobs to be the primary issue in next year's general election, and he expects Ohio to be the critical swing state. But he spent most of the interview answering questions about foreign policy, attacking President Bush on Iraq and North Korea and promising to send former President Bill Clinton to the Middle East as a peace broker.
President Bush, Dr. Dean said, is "particularly poorly suited" for foreign policy "because he has a black and white view of the world, and foreign policy depends on enormous understandings of nuances and trade-offs."
As the former governor of Vermont who got a medical deferment to avoid service in Vietnam, Dr. Dean said he would combat criticism of his national security bona fides by surrounding himself with people who could inspire confidence in such issues. 
Though he declined to speculate on cabinet appointments or potential running mates, Dr. Dean, who has lately spent much time attacking his Democratic rivals as Washington insiders who have, collectively, spent more than a century on Capitol Hill, said he would also pick people who could navigate the Beltway.
"The most important criteria for whether you're going to be any good at foreign policy or not is judgment and patience, both of which are in short supply in this presidency." Dr. Dean said. "The major mistake that governors make when they come into Washington is they think subconsciously that the relationship between the Congress and the president is somehow like the relationship between the legislature and the governor," he added, predicting that "getting someone who understands the levers of power in Washington is going to be important as well."
Regarding Iraq, Dr. Dean, who opposed the American invasion this spring, promised to bring National Guard and Army reserve troops home, leaving 70,000 American troops, and to add about 110,000 international troops, mostly from Muslim and Arab nations. Some experts say that is probably unrealistic, considering the military capabilities of American allies in the Middle East.
Other than urging repeal of recent tax cuts to pay for reconstruction, Dr. Dean refused to say how he would vote, were he in Congress, on the $87 billion financing proposal. 
"I'm not running for Congress, I'm running forpresident," he said.
 On North Korea, Dr. Dean said Mr. Bush had bungled the situation by announcing at a news conference with Kim Dae Jung, the former president of South Korea, that he planned to pursue a policy of isolation toward North Korea. While the news conference was not as explicit as Dr. Dean described, Mr. Bush and the South Korean leader split sharply on Korea policy at that meeting early in Mr. Bush's presidency, and their relationship never recovered.
Dr. Dean said he would conduct bilateral negotiations on the principle of constructive engagement -- "that in return for a verifiable ending of their nuclear program," he explained, "they would be back in the community of nations."
"You will improve the behavior of rogue nations and have more leverage to do so if they're inside the tent than if they're outside the tent," he said. "The president and his neocon advisers decided they were going to teach the North Koreans a lesson, and unfortunately, North Korea has the power to inflict a fairly painful lesson on us." 
Dr. Dean declined to discuss the other Democratic rivals except to say "they all come from Washington, which I think, this year, is going to be a problem for them." Though he said it was too early to draw broad lessons from the California recall, he said the message is change which he painted as positive for his campaign.
"My strategy is, we're better than this, we can do better than this," he added. "America's always been the country of hope and of high moral principles and ideals. Let's hope again."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 11, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about Howard Dean's candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination and his assertion that President Bush is "setting the stage for the failure of America" referred incompletely to the medical deferment Dr. Dean received during the Vietnam War. While he did indeed request a physical examination, he said he did so after receiving a low number in the draft lottery, to determine his options for the military, not explicitly to avoid service.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE BALLOTING; 
Signaling Voter Unrest, Schwarzenegger Cut Deep Into the Democrats' Base

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MARJORIE CONNELLY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Arnold Schwarzenegger pulled together a vast coalition of dissatisfied voters from across all demographic groups in California's recall election on Tuesday, winning among all age groups and, perhaps most ominously for Democrats, appearing to make inroads into their traditional base, surveys show.
 In a major sign of voter unrest in this Democratic bastion, one-quarter of the people who identified themselves as Democrats voted to recall Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and 18 percent voted for Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger also won 31 percent of Hispanic voters and 17 percent of black voters, doing significantly better with both groups than did Bill Simon Jr., the Republican candidate for governor in 2002.
And despite the last-minute accusations about unwanted sexual advances toward women, Mr. Schwarzenegger narrowed the gender gap that Republicans traditionally face, winning the votes of 49 percent of the men who voted and 43 percent of the women.
The numbers are based on interviews with nearly 4,000 voters as they left the polls conducted by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for The New York Times and other news organizations.
In fact, Mr. Schwarzenegger did almost as well with women as Mr. Davis, as measured by the 49 percent of women who supported the Democrat by voting against his recall.
More women tend to be Democratic than Republican, and this is particularly true in California, an overwhelmingly Democratic state. Here, only 36 percent of women describe themselves as Republican, and 71 percent of them voted for Mr. Schwarzenegger. So did 20 percent of Democratic women.
Mr. Schwarzenegger won pluralities of women in all age groups. He did the worst with women under 30, but still got 41 percent of their votes. His strongest supporters were men ages 30 to 44.
In addition, Mr. Schwarzenegger demonstrated enough strength to fend off any criticism that he had become governor with only a minority of the vote. Even with 135 candidates on the ballot, Mr. Schwarzenegger won more votes in favor of his candidacy (4,358,000, with 99.8 percent of the votes counted) than Mr. Davis won against the recall effort (3,541,000). And that was more than the 3,533,490 votes Mr. Davis won last November, when he was re-elected to a second term.
Combining Mr. Schwarzenegger's votes with those for another Republican, State Senator Tom McClintock, about 60 percent of those who voted on Tuesday did so for Republicans -- possibly good news for the White House, which now has plausible reasons to see California as up for grabs in 2004, although President Bush's approval ratings in California are at 51 percent, no better than the rest of the country (but no worse, either). Mr. Bush is scheduled to meet with Mr. Schwarzenegger next week.
"The Schwarzenegger campaign excited Republicans, Hispanic voters and union-member households," said Ed Gillespie, chairman of the Republican National Committee. "The Democrat Party and the Democrat presidential candidates should take heed."
Democrats looking for any signs of hope might find them in the fact that Mr. Schwarzenegger's weakest support was among people with advanced degrees and people making less than $50,000 a year. And his assertion during the campaign that he would draw new voters into the party did not materialize significantly. Only 3 percent of voters said they had never voted before, and another 3 percent said they rarely voted. Of those two groups of voters, Mr. Schwarzenegger won about half of them.
The surveys also showed that more than two-thirds of the voters had made up their minds more than a month before the election. As a result, the intense publicity in the last week of the campaign about accusations of Mr. Schwarzenegger's unwanted sexual advances appeared to have had little effect on how women -- and others -- voted.
Surveys indicate that the sputtering economy remains an overriding concern for California voters.
A full 83 percent said the economy was in bad shape. That number shows a serious erosion of confidence in the state's economic health since Governor Davis was re-elected 11 months ago. At that time, 47 percent perceived the economy to be in bad shape, according to a survey by The Los Angeles Times.
Various surveys have shown that a vast majority of voters believe the state is on the wrong track, an important signal of discontent in electoral politics, and that voters have been alarmed about the state's plunging credit rating, the exodus of more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs and a budget deficit of billions of dollars.
The surveys also suggest that Mr. Davis misinterpreted the economic anxiety in his state or did not appreciate it. This was evident in his signing of a bill to allow illegal immigrants to get drivers' licenses, a move that the survey found was opposed by 70 percent of voters. Interviews with voters have shown that many Californians perceive the drivers' license issues as less a social issue than an economic one. By giving licenses to illegal immigrants, many voters say, the state would attract more illegal immigrants who would be a drain on already strained resources like schools. Mr. Davis had vetoed the measure twice before signing it this summer.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The poll of voters was based on questionnaires completed by people on Tuesday as they left polling stations throughout California. Questionnaires were offered in English or Spanish.
The poll was conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J., and Mitofsky International of New York City.
The results are based on 3,814 voters in 60 randomly selected precincts across California, interviewed as they were leaving voting places.
In addition, 400 self-identified absentee voters, reached at random telephone numbers, were also interviewed, and their results have been added to the poll. 
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus two percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview everyone who cast a ballot in the recall election.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion at polling places, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the composition of the California voter coalition that made Arnold Schwarzenegger the governor in the recall election misstated the number of votes he won. It was 3,744,132, not 4,358,000.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "California's Recall Vote"Californians voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to recall Gov. Gray Davis and chose as his replacement Arnold Schwarzenegger. The most emphatic yes for the recall came from counties in the center of the state as well as those in the northern- and southern-most parts. Mr. Schwarzenegger picked up his support from the same areas and drew the least from the Bay Area. Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante finished second among the replacement candidates.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE GOVERNOR-ELECT; 
Seizing the Moment, and Defying Expectations

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Perhaps Jay Leno was right. "Tonight is a testament to just how important one appearance on the 'Tonight Show' can be," he said on Tuesday night, before introducing Arnold Schwarzenegger at his victory party.
 Every campaign has what is called "the moment," the convergence of events where a candidate is either built or broken. For Mr. Schwarzenegger, that moment may well have been his surprise Aug. 6 announcement of his candidacy on Mr. Leno's "Tonight Show." 
 For all the high-priced professionals that Mr. Schwarzenegger employed to give him a cram course in politics -- he spent more than $10 million of his own fortune for the campaign -- it was his flair for the dramatic, his larger-than-life personality and his preference for big-production campaign events that seemed, more than anything else, to lead him to this extraordinary place in history. 
It was widely thought that Mr. Schwarzenegger was going to announce that evening that he would not enter the recall race, admitting that he needed two years to study the crosscurrents of California before taking a run at the governor's office. He held his cards so close to the vest that even his most intimate advisers and a close friend, Richard J. Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles, did not know of his decision. 
His chief strategist, George Gorton, stood backstage at the taping of the Leno show holding a news release that explained the actor's decision to stay out. Instead, Mr. Schwarzenegger said he was in, inflaming a media frenzy that American politics has seldom seen.
"I have to admit I felt embarrassed," Mr. Gorton said later. "But he didn't tell anyone. It was a masterstroke in political theater. The only problem was, it put us behind the eight ball. We had no organization put together to carry the ball from that moment."
He suffered for the humor. It was not the stuff of serious politics, his critics complained. His campaign stumbled through the first two weeks as a staff was cobbled together and as Mr. Schwarzenegger was subjected to seminars on issues from water policy to workers compensation.
The expectations for a vigorous and entertaining campaign that Mr. Schwarzenegger engendered with his announcement began to erode his credibility when he retreated from public view. The news media portrayed him as an actor on a vanity project and a badger hiding in his hole.
"We got out of the gate slowly because we didn't have a team in place," Mr. Gorton said.
The introduction of Mr. Schwarzenegger the politician came three weeks later when he assembled a group of advisers including Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, and George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state, for an economic policy forum. It proved a defining day for the neophyte candidate. He had finally added some heft, even if it was rented, to a campaign that until then was running solely on celebrity.
As he addressed reporters that day, a few important lessons were learned. For one, Mr. Schwarzenegger found the voice and cadence he would employ on the stump. "I feel the people of California have been punished enough," he said in a rehearsed statement. "From the time they get up in the morning and flush the toilet they're taxed. When they go get a coffee they're taxed. When they get in their car they're taxed. When they go to the gas station they're taxed. When they go to lunch they're taxed. This goes on all day long. Tax. Tax. Tax. Tax. Tax."
With each punctuation, the flash bulbs fired in syncopation, and Mr. Schwarzenegger's physical stature swelled before the cameras. His chunky English charmed and the details of policy quickly drifted away. 
Something else was learned there too. Forget the garish suits. Wear conservative ties. No more alligator shoes. Stick to the script. No ad-libs. 
When asked for specific budget cuts, he said, "The public doesn't care about figures."
That line brought ridicule from academics and editorial writers, and caused his aides to cringe. But, as Mr. Schwarzenegger said, the public did not seem to care.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, marveled at Mr. Schwarzenegger's avoidance of specifics and his ability to get away with it. "You hold a press conference and you answer their questions," Ms. Feinstein said. "If you don't answer their questions, they let you know it. That didn't happen this time." 
She added: "He was able to insulate himself and maybe that is what is reserved for celebrity and really not for the rest of us. He did not have one specific program outside the car tax as far as I know."
The strategy in the Schwarzenegger camp came to be known as "Let Arnold Be Arnold." 
A senior Schwarzenegger adviser, Todd Harris, said that the campaign deliberately avoided most interviews with mainstream news organizations, preferring instead the more gentle ministrations of Oprah Winfrey and Larry King.
"A lot of thought was given to the idea that we had the ability to expand upon the traditional outlets that tend to cover politics and take our message directly to a segment of the population that frankly isn't the 'Meet the Press' crowd," said Mr. Harris, who was an adviser to the 2000 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. "Because of who our candidate was, we could take advantage of that."
Peter Ragone, who directed news media strategy for Governor Davis's effort to battle the recall, said that Mr. Schwarzenegger could afford to run a cautious campaign. 
"He didn't do too much, but he didn't have to," Mr. Ragone said. "Because of the role celebrity plays in our society, people had an image of him. He had unlimited financial resources to maintain that perception. And he had a deep economically driven anxiety among the electorate that left the people of the state hungry for change. And so to the extent they ran a campaign that didn't upset any of those things, it was successful."
Though Mr. Schwarzenegger is famously disciplined, he occasionally strayed from his script and made statements his spokesmen had to erase. On the "Tonight Show," Mr. Schwarzenegger said he had "plenty of money myself" and did not need to accept contributions from others. As large amounts of cash from corporations and wealthy individuals began pouring into the campaign, Mr. Schwarzenegger amended his comment to say that he would not take money from "special interests," which he defined as labor unions and Indian tribes that operated casinos. They were not contributing to his campaign in any event.
He spoke of closing down the state Environmental Protection Agency. His aides were dispatched to tamp out the fires.
The apex of his campaign came in his only debate, in Sacramento. He skipped all the other candidate forums and debates, saying he was saving himself for the "Super Bowl," which also happened to be the only debate in which the questions were provided in advance.
His aides said that evening that all he needed to do was string a noun, a verb and a few statistics together to address any lingering concerns about his competence and cement his victory. 
The actor did a bit more than that, reciting the lines a joke writer had written for him. When Arianna Huffington goaded him on the similarity of his views to those of President Bush, for instance, Mr. Schwarzenegger said, "Arianna if you want to campaign against Bush, then go to New Hampshire." That provoked a few laughs. Then he told her, "You need a little more decaf."
After the debate, Mr. Schwarzenegger surged in the polls, padding his lead over his only credible challenger, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat.
Mr. Harris said Mr. Schwarzenegger had met the minimal requirements of the debate, presenting a vision for the state without getting bogged down in facts or a dispute over how to balance the budget.
"Vision will trump specifics eight days a week in a campaign," he said. 
With the debate safely behind him, Mr. Schwarzenegger embarked on the final leg of his star turn, a bus tour planned by Mr. Harris and Mike Murphy, the strategists who conceived the McCain "Straight Talk Express" bus tour of 2000. He drew tremendous and enthusiastic crowds across the state, even as Mr. Davis was speaking to tepid gatherings at union halls and schools. 
The night before the tour was to start, however, the cellphones of Mr. Schwarzenegger's senior staff members began to buzz. The Los Angeles Times had just posted on its Web site a long article detailing the accusations of six women that Mr. Schwarzenegger had sexually manhandled them, charges that were familiar but had remained muted during the previous weeks of the campaign. At 6:45 a.m., the candidate's news staff conferred by conference call about how to respond, even though they had not heard Mr. Schwarzenegger's explanation for the incidents. They agreed that some public acknowledgment and apology was probably going to be required.
Mr. Murphy boarded Mr. Schwarzenegger's Gulfstream-4 jet at 8 a.m. on the day the article was published for the half-hour flight to San Diego, where the bus tour was to begin. He spoke with Mr. Schwarzenegger about how he should respond to the charges.
Mr. Schwarzenegger decided himself that a blanket apology was in order, aides said, and he issued it extemporaneously.
"Yes, it is true that I was on rowdy movie sets," the actor and former bodybuilder said. "And to those people that I have offended I want to say to them, I am deeply sorry about that and I apologize because this is not what I'm trying to do."
While he took a momentary dip in the polls over the weekend, Mr. Schwarzenegger remained calm and seemingly above it all as more women stepped forward to accuse him. At a rally in a town called Pleasanton, a radio talk show host encouraged the crowd to seek out a Los Angles Times reporter and beat him up. A group of heckling women were pelted with bottles and placards. At one stop, a woman obviously untroubled by the sexual misconduct charges yelled, "You can grope me, Arnold!"
But in the end the accusations mattered little and by Tuesday night, Mr. Schwarzenegger had accomplished what many thought impossible -- uniting the state's fractious Republican Party and returning the governor's office to its hands.
At the victory celebration men in tailored suits drank Scotch and smoked Cuban cigars in the Century Plaza hotel and laughed at the misfortune of Gray Davis.
One giddy Schwarzenegger aide said, "Only in California, can you take down a sitting governor and be home by 11:30." 
Meanwhile Mr. Schwarzenegger swaggered around the penthouse Tuesday night, surrounded by hangers-on. It was the sort of scene reserved for movie stars and a very few newly elected leaders.

HEADLINE: EBay Founder Raises Foundation Endowment to $300 Million 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Jeffrey S. Skoll, a founder of eBay, the online auction company that is one of the few still successful Internet icons, has raised the endowment of his foundation to $300 million from $117 million.
 Although he is Canadian, Mr. Skoll has fast become one of this country's most active young philanthropists. He has given $15 million to support "social entrepreneurs," people operating nonprofit business ventures whose aim is to help the needy help themselves and in doing so, help society at large. 
 "I've been sort of operating on the installment plan," Mr. Skoll, who is 38, said jokingly in an interview at the Hotel Chelsea in New York, where his new film production company was shooting a movie. "I've been incubating the foundation, and now it's ready to move to the next stage."
While foundation assets grew rapidly during the 1990's, the weak economy and seesawing stock market have chipped away at endowments for the last three years. "The proportional increase in the value of this foundation's assets at this time is really unusual," said Steven Lawrence, director of research at the Foundation Center.
Mr. Skoll's stake in eBay is valued at $3.6 billion, and he said he intended to keep expanding his philanthropy. The most recent infusion will allow the foundation to help underwrite the replication of successful programs. 
For instance, the Skoll Foundation has pledged $300,000 over two years to ApproTEC, a nonprofit business to help subsistence farmers in Africa become small businessmen with the help of simple technology. 
ApproTEC makes a variety of human-powered machines that help small farmers make their land more productive. One of its best-sellers is the Super Money Maker irrigation pump and its more plain-vanilla cousin, the Money Maker Plus, which operate somewhat like a Stairmaster and sell for $75 and $40, respectively.
"Using the Super Money Maker, a poor farmer can irrigate up to two acres of land in the dry season and cultivate high-profitability fruits and vegetables to generate cash," Martin Fisher, ApproTEC's executive director, said. "Without a pump, it's really only possible to irrigate about one-eighth of an acre with a bucket."
Mr. Fisher described Janet Ondiek, a widow with six children and two acres of land in western Kenya. She saved for a year to buy the Super Money Maker, made $3,200 in profit in the year after she bought it and employs two people, he said.
ApproTEC wants to replicate its success in Kenya and Tanzania in six other African countries over the next three years and create 100,000 businesses like Ms. Ondiek's. The Skoll Foundation's grant has allowed it to register as a tax-exempt organization in the United States and lease an office from which it can do its fund-raising, with the goal of pulling in the $28 million it needs to get to the next level.
"What I realized was that with these people and others like them," Mr. Skoll said, "just a little bit of money can go quite a long way and make quite a big difference." 
His foundation also works to create links between social entrepreneurs so that they can exchange ideas through an online system, and his movie company, Ovation Entertainment, is producing documentaries about them as a means of educating others about their activities.
"Their stories are often as dramatic and inspiring as any you would see at the movies, yet people were going to see Scooby-Doo and Spider-Man," Mr. Skoll said.

HEADLINE: No More Secretary Nice Guy 

 BODY:
President Bush has been famous for avoiding public squabbles among his top officials, mindful of the fratricidal wars of his father's White House and the Clinton administration. Until now. Suddenly, everyone seems mad at everyone else, even though the administration tried to calm things down yesterday. 
 Last week, the White House and the C.I.A. started pointing fingers over who had leaked an operative's name to a conservative columnist. Now Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is upset with the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and he has shared his annoyance with the world. The State Department is gloating about Mr. Rumsfeld's being chastised for botching postwar Iraq. And the White House is trying to spin the mess any way it can. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld's rebellion was touched off by David Sanger's report in The Times on Monday that the White House was reorganizing the control of postwar Iraq and Afghanistan under the wing of Ms. Rice. That did not sit well at the Pentagon. It saw the switch, correctly, as an attempt to suggest that the hawkish Mr. Rumsfeld was being edged aside in the face of criticism that Mr. Bush does not have an adequate plan for Iraq.
Pentagon officials say there is less here than meets the eye. But Mr. Rumsfeld took the trouble in an interview, with newspapers in Europe no less, to make his disdain for the White House power grab quite clear. Mr. Rumsfeld said he had known nothing of the reorganization until he read news accounts. He dismissed Ms. Rice's memo describing the move as a restatement of the obvious, which is that the National Security Council is supposed to "coordinate" (translation: not run) this sort of thing.
But White House officials say Mr. Rumsfeld did know about the change and bristled at his swipe at Ms. Rice. Well, Pentagon aides said in reply, Ms. Rice may have sent a memo. But she sends so many memos, how can a busy defense chief remember them all? Someone at the White House, they say, is lamely trying to mute criticism of postwar policy at Mr. Rumsfeld's expense. Secretary of State Colin Powell's team is delighted. While Mr. Rumsfeld has insisted on total control in Iraq, Mr. Powell's aides see the Rice memo as giving him more say.
As entertaining as all this is to fans of Washington psychodramas, there are important decisions to be made about postwar Iraq and not a lot of reassurance so far that they are being made correctly. If Ms. Rice's memo signals a real attempt to exercise political control over the violence and instability in Iraq, that would be welcome. But so far, the grandly named Iraq Stabilization Group seems more like an attempt to substitute title-building for nation-building -- reminiscent of this administration's announcement that it was dealing with unemployment by creating a new assistant secretary post at the Labor Department.

HEADLINE: Inventories Fall To a Low Point In Sales Terms 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Businesses unexpectedly reduced wholesale inventories in August to the lowest percentage of sales ever, selling from stockpiles to meet demand, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
 The decrease of 0.2 percent in inventories, to a value of $288.6 billion, may set the stage for a pickup in economic growth and production this quarter as companies restock. 
 Sales by distributors rose 0.4 percent after gaining 0.5 percent in July, the report said. 
 "Inventories are very lean," said Richard Davidson, chief executive of Union Pacific, the biggest United States railroad company. "People are waiting until they see the whites of their eyes before they ship. For the last year or two, every quarter has not started out strong."
 Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, said inventory rebuilding was projected to contribute a percentage point to the economy's growth this quarter.
 Economists had forecast a 0.1 percent rise in August inventories after no change in July.
 Supplies of durable goods at wholesalers in August fell 0.5 percent, led by autos and auto parts, hardware, machinery and electrical supplies. Durable goods sales dropped 0.7 percent after rising 0.2 percent in July.
 Inventories of nondurable goods -- which include such things as drugs, groceries and petroleum -- increased 0.3 percent in August after gaining 1 percent the month before. A 4.5 percent jump in petroleum supplies led the increase. Sales of nondurables increased 1.5 percent.
 The inventory-to-sales ratio for August dropped to 1.2 months from the previous record low of 1.21 months set in July and March.
 Wholesalers account for about 25 percent of all business inventories. Retailers and factories make up the rest. The decline in the amount of unsold goods subtracted 0.74 percentage point from second-quarter economic growth of 3.3 percent. In the first quarter, when the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent rate, inventories subtracted 0.82 percentage point, Commerce Department figures showed last month.

HEADLINE: Shock Waves From a Political Earthquake 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I hope that this resounding victory by Arnold Schwarzenegger (front page, Oct. 8) will be the beginning of the end of the smear tactics of the Democratic Party and some of its constituencies. 
 I was nauseated by the depths to which the liberal media stooped to try to destroy Mr. Schwarzenegger in the last week of this election -- and this is what they did to a socially moderate Republican who is pro-choice and pro-gay rights! It backfired on them. 
 This election puts a moderate Republican in the governor's seat and in the national spotlight. I hope that both parties learn the lesson of moderation from it.
We now have a realistic chance of avoiding a financial meltdown in the state, reducing the size of a bloated government and making the state business-friendly, something that is needed for a sound economy and a sound government.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE OVERVIEW; 
SCHWARZENEGGER LAYS FOUNDATION FOR A TRANSITION

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Arnold Schwarzenegger moved quickly Wednesday to prepare for governing, naming a prominent Republican congressman to run his transition and strongly suggesting that he would call on President Bush to provide federal aid to California, now in Republican hands.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, who will become only the second governor in United States history to win office in a recall election, reached out to prominent Democrats and set a tone of confidence, good humor and reconciliation at his first news conference since his election. 
 "I made it very clear in my campaign that I will be the people's governor," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "That is the most important thing: governor for the people, not for special interests, but for everybody." 
The movie-star governor-elect, whose celebrity helped drive his victory, said he would place his businesses in a blind trust and stop making films. Yet he still used movie terminology, telling reporters with relish that a final campaign appearance had been "a good visual." 
He largely avoided specifics about his plans for dealing with the state's biggest problems, including its chronic budget deficit.
But he repeated promises made during the campaign not to raise taxes, to repeal the recent tripling of vehicle registration fees and to rescind a law signed last month by Gov. Gray Davis that allows undocumented workers to apply for driver's licenses. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger's unusual rise to the state's highest office and his unconventional resume made his first 24 hours after the election a spectacle unlike any other for a newly elected governor.
He spoke on the telephone and took congratulations from national and international figures, including President Bush, Mr. Bush's father and Nelson Mandela. His news conference here attracted hundreds of journalists. 
Representative David Dreier, who along with former Gov. Pete Wilson was a chairman of the Schwarzenegger campaign, was named transition chief, with the task of assembling a staff of nearly 200 political appointees who would need to be in place before the end of next month.
Aware that he must work with Democrats, Mr. Schwarzenegger also conspicuously reached across the aisle to some of them, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, one of Mr. Davis's staunchest supporters.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's election in a state long controlled by Democrats gave the president an important beachhead for 2004. And Mr. Schwarzenegger made clear Wednesday that he expected his state to benefit from his relationship with Mr. Bush. He noted that California did not get its fair share of federal aid, and of the president, he said, "He promised me that he will do everything possible to help California, so I'm looking forward to working with him and asking him for a lot, a lot of favors." 
Mr. Schwarzenegger added that the two men might meet as early as next week, when Mr. Bush makes a fund-raising trip to California. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger expressed unbridled optimism that he would be able to work with the Democratic legislature.
"The legislators up there have gotten this message last night, that the people of California want change," he said.
And he touched all the right political bases, as evidenced by his phone call to Ms. Feinstein, the state's senior Democrat, who had to interrupt a news conference to take it.
"He is extraordinarily enthusiastic, as I think comes through, wants to get cracking, wants to do the job," she said.
Yet even as he was speaking, and as Ms. Feinstein and other top Democrats pledged their cooperation with his new administration, plans were afoot in Sacramento to call a special session of the Senate so that dozens of Democratic appointments to state boards and commissions could be confirmed before Mr. Schwarzenegger takes office.
And though Mr. Davis pledged a smooth transition, a spokesman said the governor was busily dealing with about 100 last-minute appointments as well as 279 bills from the recent legislative session.
Mr. Davis made no public appearances on Wednesday, and phones in his Sacramento office were switched to voice mail much of the afternoon as most of his nearly 200 staff members attended a session where they learned about unemployment benefits, retirement packages and other severance issues. 
The precise date of Mr. Schwarzenegger's inauguration is uncertain, but election officials expect it to be sometime before Thanksgiving, after the results have been certified.
"This quite possibly is the highest-profile gubernatorial election in American history," said Doug Stone, a spokesman for the secretary of state, the chief election officer. "There's going to be a desire by local elections officials to make sure that their reports are as complete and thorough as possible before they transmit it to us." 
Unofficial results show the recall of Mr. Davis passing by 55.4 percent of the vote to 44.6 percent. 
On the replacement ballot, Mr. Schwarzenegger finished first with 48.6 percent, or 3,744,132 votes. Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, a Democrat, came in second with 31.6 percent, or 2,434,484 votes.
Two other measures on the ballot failed by wide margins. Proposition 53 would have set aside up to 3 percent of the state's general revenues for spending on infrastructure improvements, while Proposition 54 would have banned the state's collection of certain types of racial data.
Contrary to statements Mr. Schwarzenegger made during the campaign that he would spend only limited time in Sacramento, on Wednesday he indicated that he would essentially become a fixture in the state capital to help push through his legislative program.
While working out on his exercise equipment this morning, Mr. Schwarzenegger took a call from State Senator John Burton, one of California's most senior and influential Democrats. 
He also tended to family matters, assuaging the fears of his four children about his new life as an elected official, explaining to a son that it would be much like making a film.
"I promised him that I will see him as many times as possible," he said. "And it's like being on a movie set or on a movie location, that sometimes I'm home and sometimes I'm not home, so they understand, they're much calmer now about the whole thing."
Mr. Schwarzenegger instructed his transition team to begin work immediately and to set up headquarters in the state capital as soon as this weekend. 
The transition effort, unlike any in California history, will be performed at least at the beginning without the normal state appropriation -- which amounted to $650,000 during the 1998 transition from Mr. Wilson to Mr. Davis -- though Senator Burton said he was confident that the Legislature would make emergency financing available before too long.
Tensions around the handover of power, already heightened because of the partisan nature of the recall, were expected to be worse than usual because of the rare occurrence in California of a governor being forced from power by the electorate. 
It was the first time since Ronald Reagan defeated Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. in 1966 that a governor seeking to stay in office was dealing with a transition involving a new governor responsible for his ouster.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's campaign team has already begun to work behind the scenes on his biggest and most immediate task: he will be expected to have a budget proposal for next year prepared in just two months, and with an $8 billion shortfall carrying over from this year, he will be faced with an immediate list of draconian cuts.
The job will become even more difficult if Mr. Schwarzenegger fulfills one of his main campaign promises -- repealing the $4 billion increase in the state's vehicle tax. Mr. Schwarzenegger said at his news conference that one of his first acts as governor would be to invite independent auditors to review the state's books and help find areas to cut. He also hinted that the deficit might be much worse than expected, perhaps as large as $20 billion. 
"I want to open the books to the people of California, so that they can see the waste, where the billions of dollars are," he said.
But as a backdrop to all of it, Mr. Schwarzenegger must deal with continued ill feeling among hard-core Democrats, some of whom are considering a recall of their own. 
Ms. Feinstein said she would oppose such an effort, but she acknowledged that some Democrats were already poised to bankroll it.
"I think it should be held in abeyance," Ms. Feinstein said. "This is a very hard thing, and virtually every action in this arena brings on a reaction."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Does Drawing Still Matter? A Show That Suggests Some Answers

BYLINE:  By KEN JOHNSON 

 BODY:
There was a time when the idea of a visual artist who did not know how to draw would have been unimaginable. It was through drawing -- especially drawing nudes -- that artists learned how to fine-tune their visual perceptions and mirror truthfully with handmade marks the mercurial vagaries of psychological experience. It was the foundation that no career in painting or sculpture could be securely built without. 
 Countless artists still draw. It could be that we are in a golden age of drawing; "Drawing Now," a show last year at the Museum of Modern Art, barely hinted at the wealth and variety of what is out there. But drawing is not the foundation of many big careers these days. Conceptualists, performance artists, photographers, assemblagists and even many kinds of painters and sculptors do not need traditional drawing skills. They may produce plans, diagrams, collages, cartoons or rudimentary visual notes that will be marketed as drawing, but rarely anything like the kind of draftsmanship you associate with artists from Leonardo and Michelangelo to Ingres, Degas and de Kooning. 
 That the Drawing Center, an institution nominally dedicated to drawing, defines drawing not in terms of manual representational skills but according to support material -- i.e., anything made on paper qualifies -- is a reflection of this development. 
Does the marginalization of drawing matter? Absolutely, though only cranky conservatives seem to complain much about it.
If you are interested in pondering the question, a place to begin might be "A Fine Line: Drawings by National Academicians," a modest show of drawings at the National Academy of Design Museum by present and past members of the academy. The exhibition was organized by the Photo Realist painter Robert Cottingham.
It is not a great drawing show. All 33 works, most dating from the last two decades, are professionally competent, and some are impressive, but there is not a single unforgettable piece. Rather, the show functions best as a catalog of the varieties of line artists may put into play. In this sense it is an academic production, the kind of thing drawing instructors might take their beginning students to. 
The varieties of line are indeed diverse. They include the almost microscopically fine description of trees and a placid stream in ink by the Hudson River School painter Jasper Cropsey; all-over charcoal squiggles in an Impressionist-style landscape by Luise Kaish; scrawled, brightly colored pastel lines describing a masklike face by Irving Kriesberg; the delicate delineation of cliffs in Arizona by Kathleen Zimmerman; the jerky, primitivistic charcoal lines of a nude by Charles Cajori; the graceful, machinelike curves of a geometricized nude, made with repeated strokes of a light pencil by Philip Grausman; the pale, feathery hatching in a highly finished still life by William Bailey; the graphically definitive sketches of people, dogs and cakes from Wayne Thiebaud's notebooks; the sinuous, lifelike pencil lines in Mary Frank's sketches of giraffes or in Harvey Dinnerstein's small drawing of a nursing newborn; and much more. 
So within its own conservative terms -- those of the National Academy, that is -- there is pedagogical value here. It would be nice, by the way, to have a sequel to this show that would explore varieties of drawing by some of today's more adventurous artists. Still, the question of the larger importance of drawing remains. 
In an introductory essay posted on the wall, Mr. Cottingham talks in familiar terms about drawing, extolling its immediacy, intimacy and economy. More interestingly, he finds in drawing an unrivaled transparency: "Each line of a drawing," he observes, "besides contributing to the final image, stands as a unique record of the artist's thoughts at the exact moment that the line was brought into existence." At a time when more and more artists leave the execution of their works to machines, this legibility in drawing is worth remembering.
Something else, which Mr. Cottingham doesn't talk about, comes to mind. As you look around the exhibition, you will notice that each drawing, however true it may be to an individual's thinking, is also bound by a particular set of conventions: a style. Hudson River School, Impressionism, Cezanne, Cubism, Expressionism, Pop. Artists do not learn to draw only by recording pure, uncontaminated perceptions; they learns by also imitating other artists and then strive to make something distinctively individual out of the generic templates that they internalize.
A good drawing is more than just a feat of hand-eye or mind-body coordination. It's an exemplary struggle with society and culture: at best, a victory over forces that most of the time keep most of us from having the courage of our own originality.

"A Fine Line: Drawings by National Academicians" will remain at the National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through Jan. 4.

 BODY:
 A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

"ABOUT TIME: 700 YEARS OF EUROPEAN PAINTING," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, permanent installation. After three years in storage, the museum's European painting collection is back on view. Brooklyn owns some classy material, from Renaissance altarpieces to a clutch of smashing Monets. In this reinstallation, works from various periods have been linked with the theme of time, a good idea. The refurbished Beaux-Arts Court, with its large skylight, presents problems as an exhibition space, namely glare bouncing off Plexiglas-covered paintings. An exquisite small installation of early Italian painting from the collection is on the fifth floor. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; students and 62+, $3 (Holland Cotter).

"ANSEL ADAMS AT 100," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400, through Nov. 3. This exhibition of 113 of Adams's photographs, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of his birth, has been traveling around the world for two years. In these warehouse galleries it has a strangely random and homely feel. The photographs look small and lost. Maybe it's the setting. Maybe it's because the show, organized roughly thematically -- austere peaks, plants, peaks with plants, grand vistas, rocks -- doesn't have a clearly focused concept. Or maybe it's because the curator wanted to tamp down Adams's bombast and replace it with something quieter, smaller and subtler. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $8.50 (Sarah Boxer).

* LOTHAR BAUMGARTEN, "Origin of the Night: Amazon Cosmos," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 30. The first New York screening of this overlong but mesmerizing film from the late 1970's offers another piece of the expanding puzzle of post-Minimalism. Up close and impersonal, it explores a busy day in the life of an Amazon tributary, offering close-ups of flora, fauna and shimmering water accompanied by written and spoken words and a marvelous musical soundtrack. Inspired by an ancient creation narrative, it is mostly a lyrical meditation on the facts of film, nature and language and the erosion of the wilderness by industrial progress. And, as its setting is really a trashy swamp somewhere in Germany, it establishes Mr. Baumgarten's importance to 1980's setup photography. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Roberta Smith).

* "THE DAWN OF PHOTOGRAPHY: FRENCH DAGUERREOTYPES, 1839-55," Metropolitan Museum of Art, FifthAvenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 4. Silvered sheets of copper, sensitized with iodine and developed in heated fumes of mercury, daguerreotypes are alchemical objects of ethereal physicality. The show, although a little too large and repetitive, lucidly tracks the brief evolution of daguerreotypy in France, where the medium lasted barely two decades after its invention in 1839. The best daguerreotypes remain weirdly unlike any other photographs, with their own mysterious sense of space. From this, photography got the seeds of its talismanic aura: most people wouldn't casually rip up photographs of their loved ones because it is still commonplace to believe, if only unconsciously, that photographs somehow contain tidbits of the souls of their subjects. That is completely irrational and superstitious, of course. But you can see where it comes from when you look at daguerreotypes. They are perfectly true to life and somehow not of this world. Hours: Sundays, this Monday (Oct. 13) and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).

* "EL GRECO," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 11. The world is full of second-class El Grecos, but they are not in this first-class show. The portraits are fresh, true to life and understated. Elsewhere, El Greco emotes. The pitch hardly varies or drops. It's no wonder people tend to fall in love with him when they are young. Modern artists especially love him, as if he were a protomodernist. As the Belgian painter Luc Tuymans says of El Greco's work: "Everything goes upwards. That's its mystical meaning. It's about the evaporation of material life." The show is also gorgeously installed. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* "GEORGE INNESS AND THE VISIONARY LANDSCAPE," National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through Dec. 28. Inness's achievement hovers in the background of 19th-century American painting with all the mysterious haziness of his tantalizing, startlingly simplified late landscapes. This taut 36-work summary of his development shows an artist whose artistic virtuosity was given substance by a religious vision of nature and an equally deep faith in the autonomy of paint as an expressive material. Distilling the examples of the German Romantics, the Barbizon artists and the Hudson River School, Inness forged a less-is-more conception of pictorial unity that was years ahead of its time. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.50 (Smith).

* "PASSION FOR THE MOUNTAINS: 17TH-CENTURY LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS FROM THE NANJING MUSEUM," China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, through Dec. 20. The focus of this exquisite show is on the southern city of Nanjing between the defeat of the Ming dynasty in 1644 and the subsequent consolidation of the Qing dynasty. The scrolls, album paintings and fan paintings on loan from the Nanjing Museum distill both the verve of that cosmopolitan city and the mood of fatalistic nostalgia that has long defined classical Chinese art and was particularly acute in periods of political transition. A hand scroll titled "A Thousand Cliffs and Myriad Valleys" by Gong Xian, one of the great Nanjing artists, is a standout. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $3 (Cotter).

"THE PERFECT GAME: AMERICA LOOKS AT BASEBALL," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through Feb. 1. This sweet and nearly pitch-perfect show is not a documentary of the sport. It is an elaborate illustration of a shared love affair with a game, expressed, as love often is, through art. Joe DiMaggio and Cy Young do not tip their caps anywhere in it. But George Sosnak does. A retired minor league umpire, he intricately decorated baseballs with India ink, elaborately annotated, in his spare time. John Tracy, a Union soldier in a Confederate prison, carved baseball scenes onto a cane to pass time and keep himself from going nuts. Ray Materson sewed pictures of his favorite Yankees while serving a 15-year sentence for armed robbery. And David Mellor, who is in charge of the grounds at Fenway Park in Boston, rolls the grass into fantastic patterns. Call it folk art for the masses, which is not a bad definition of baseball, by the way. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., until 7:30 p.m. Fridays. Admission: $9; students and 62+, $7 (Kimmelman).

* "STRANGERS: THE FIRST I.C.P. TRIENNIAL OF PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0090, through Nov. 30. The center's first triennial is that rare case: an instructive, topical show. The theme, strangers, is nebulous enough to be a catchall for different brands of photography and video (works by Luc Delahaye, Rineke Dijkstra, Collier Schorr and Susan Meiselas, among others). Not many of these are discoveries, but the range is wide enough to accommodate the dissimilar tastes of the four curators and the diversity of photographic work being made today. The title is also specific enough to mean something. After 9/11 the subject of strangers has gained traction, and most of what's here expresses a cautionary view that the world is full of people who are strangers to one another. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

ADAM DANT, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338, through Oct. 18. This idiosyncratic English artist blends elements of comic books, illustration and graphic design into the fictive Bureau for the Investigation of Subliminal Imagery. It is a form of art-about-art that, loosed upon the museums of Europe, deepens into an examination of the complex process of visual perception (Smith).

LOTHAR OSTERBURG, "At the Edge of the Real," Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500, through Oct. 17. Conjuring monumental phenomena with minimal means, Mr. Osterburg presents picturesque photogravures of events like a zeppelin over Timbuktu or a landing craft's approach to a celestial body. But the settings and props are all contrived in his studio using mundane materials like twigs, toothpicks, peanut butter and wee electrical parts. Photographed through a magnifying glass or a macro lens, his pictures are given a romantic, retro look through photogravure. Blowing up small objects and settings to make large-scale photographs is nothing new, but Mr. Osterburg's skill in constructing his scenes and suffusing them with nostalgia is quite special (Grace Glueck).

RICHARD POUSETTE-DART, "Mythic Heads and Forms: Paintings and Drawings From 1935 to 1942," Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Nov. 5. At the ripe old age of 19, and without any formal training, Pousette-Dart (1916-1992) turned out paintings of surprising strength and confidence, whose daring abstract idiom put him among the best of the first-generation New York School. Among the more powerful images in this small selection of oils and works on paper are "Head" (1939), a skull-like presence whose complex black-on-white linear markings seem a synthesis of African and American Indian art, and "The City" (1939), a big, thickly textured black-and-white-and-gray evocation of urban rhythms that is Picassoid in its sophisticated play of linear and biomorphic forms (Glueck).

SAMUEL ROTHBORT, "Direct Carver," Hollis Taggart, 48 East 73rd Street, (212) 628-4000, through Oct. 25; "Twilight Fantasies," Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 343-2161, through tomorrow. Rothbort (1882-1971) was a Russian immigrant and self-taught modernist who made colorful, Ashcan-style paintings and sculptures carved from found pieces of wood and stone. At Hollis Taggart, animals, self-portraits, mothers and children, and other motifs are realized with appealing rough immediacy. Some have Brancusian simplicity; some are surrealistic and some look like backwoods folk art. Vibrant watercolor and ink works on paper at Luise Ross have a playful, almost combustive visionary energy (Ken Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

"AMERICAN EXPRESSIONISM: ART AND SOCIAL CHANGE, 1920'S-1950'S," Kennedy, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 541-9600, through Nov. 1. A group show of artists pegged by the show's curator, the art and cultural historian Bram Dijkstra, to the hopes, desires and economic troubles of the working classes in the Depression and afterward. The show's concept has been stretched to a one-size-fits-all cover for an improbable mix of artists whose styles run from the in-your-face injustice imagery of Charles White and Harry Sternberg to the poetic modernism of Marsden Hartley and John Marin. Top-flight artists have been lumped with those who at best were mere illustrators. Yet nostalgia buffs who remember the socially concerned art of the 1930's and 40's will get a charge from some wonderful relics, like as Peter Blume's punchy "The Eternal City" (1934-37), with its Mussolini jack-in-the-box; Paul Cadmus's rip-roaring satire, "The Fleet's In" (1934) and Alice Neel's "Synthesis of New York: The Great Depression" (1933) (Glueck).

MARILYN BRIDGES, Throckmorton, 145 East 57th Street, (212) 223-1059, through Nov. 1. Ms. Bridges's subject is monumental art and architecture seen from an extraterrestrial perspective. Through aerial photography, she uses distance, angle of vision and natural light to clarify the form, scale and sometimes the possible meaning of ancient sites. A pyramid at Giza seen from sky is dwarfed by its huge shadow. Borobudur in Java becomes a colossal mandala. Most fascinating are so-called Nazca line drawings in Peru, with gigantic images formed from narrow troughs incised in the earth. From ground level they are all but invisible; from the sky they have an imaginative grandeur and whimsicality that leaves most other art looking earthbound (Cotter).

PATRICIA TOBACCO FORRESTER, A.V.C. Contemporary Arts, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-1122, through Oct. 18. Nature reaches out to Ms. Forrester, and vice versa, begetting these lush, dense watercolors of flowers, plants and trees. Alive with intense color and Expressionistic shapes, they are painted from life in mostly exotic locations, but through the interpretive lens of the artist's emotions. A large triptych, "Beech/Birch," crawls with densely tangled forest growth partly reflected in water; several vertical panels of floral effusions in stirring color, like "Waterlily Slice," bring complex interplays of leaves and blossoms close to the viewer's face (Glueck).

"THE 1940'S: MODERN AMERICAN ART AND DESIGN," Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, through Nov. 1. Set up like the living room of a sharp-eyed collector of Modernist antiques, this exhibition gathers paintings by Mark Rothko and Dorothea Tanning; sculpture by Alexander Calder and Jose de Rivera; furniture by Charles and Ray Eames and Frank Lloyd Wright; and much more. In another room, Charmion von Wiegand's colorful, abstract gouache paintings, titled "Improvisations: 1945," are lightweight but infectiously playful. (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

FRED EERDEKENS, Spencer Brownstone, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through Oct. 25. In the darkened gallery, a spotlight shines on clumps of puffy cotton hanging from the ceiling, casting a shadow picture of a dramatic partly cloudy sky. Out of it emerges, like a divine revelation, the phrase "Neo-Deo." It's a neat, funny and mysterious trick (Johnson).

PHILIP GUSTON, BRUCE NAUMAN, RAYMOND PETTIBON, Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212) 925-4338, through Dec. 21. Converging from three directions -- Abstract Expressionism, Process Art and California Pop -- three artists arrive at a zone of mordant existentialism. Consisting almost entirely of black-and-white prints, the exhibition sets up an absorbing, triangular conversation by Guston's studio nightmares, Mr. Nauman's harsh wordplay and Mr. Pettibon's mix of hare-brained erudition and comic book illustration (Johnson).

"INTERNAL EXCESS," the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through Oct. 18. Highlights of the Drawing Center's latest selection of emerging artists include Arthur Aghajanian's sly charts analyzing familial relations; Mie Yim's pastel pictures of stuffed bears and bunnies in anxiety-fraught situations; Lamar Peterson's coolly surrealistic cartoon images of middle-class blacks; Douglas Florian's idiosyncratic abstractions painted on paper towels; Christine Hiebert's elegantly airy mural made of blue tape; and Astrid Bowlby's bewilderingly complex accumulation of cutout cartoon fragments (Johnson).

ALEX KATZ, "Cartoons," Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Nov. 15. "Cartoons" in this case refers to an old master technique for transferring images to canvas, wall or panel. Mr. Katz's elegant charcoal drawings of trim, good-looking people on large sheets of brown paper are richly atmospheric, in part because of the burnt sienna pigment he dusts over the fine perforations that follow the drawing's contours. Seeping through the pin pricks, the brown dust creates a ghost of the drawing on the underlying canvas for the painter (Johnson).

"O907," Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 925-2035, through Oct. 25. Three neo-Duchampians: Francis Baudevin makes elegant, hard-edged, geometric wall paintings exactingly based on actual corporate logos; Mathieu Mercier glues toothpaste, candy and roach-trap boxes together into abstract, Constructivist-style structures; Nic Hess created an expansive, faux-brick wall from brown plastic packing tape (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

JANINE ANTONI, "To Draw a Line," Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through Oct. 25. Ms. Antoni's portentous installation consists of two giant industrial spools with a thick rope of blond human hair stretched between them; onthe floor is a big pile of raw hair into which the artist fell during a preopening, tightrope performance. If Ms. Antoni were making fun of artistic narcissism, it would be amusing, but she seems to be in earnest (Johnson).

* LYLE ASHTON HARRIS, "Memoirs of Hadrian," CRG, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, through Oct. 18. The large-format photographs in this New York artist's first local show since 1996 were inspired by Marguerite Yourcenar's fictional autobiography of the aging Roman emperor. At the heart of the story is the figure of Antinous, Hadrian's young lover, who drowned and was posthumously deified by imperial order. Their relationship is described in the book as a power struggle, with the emperor fixated on his lover's physical beauty and un-Roman exoticism. The focus of Mr. Harris's pictures is a young black boxer, played by the artist, an object of intense public fascination, but one routinely cast in racist terms of hero, villain and victim (Cotter).

JULIAN LETHBRIDGE, Paula Cooper, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through Oct. 18. Mr. Lethbridge paints with a rough immediacy that calls to mind Terry Winters and harks back to the all-over gesturalism of Pollock and de Kooning. In grays or two-color palettes, he creates busy fields of short straight lines, which seem to circulate in response to invisible electromagnetic currents over more broadly and loosely painted lower layers. The paintings have frontal authority; what they want is more adventurous unpredictability (Johnson).

* MARILYN MINTER, Fredericks Freiser, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6555, through Oct. 18. One of several artists of the 1980's whose work links the often-disparaged Photo Realism of the 1960's and 70's with the style's current stampede, Ms. Minter continues to cultivate multiple ambiguities in lush, close-up images (both paintings and photographs) of heavily made-up mouths and eyes. Sweat, acne and peach-fuzz add unexpected twists, confusing not only sex but also age, and sharpening these examinations of artifice and desire with the suggestion of vulnerability and threat (Smith).

ARPITA SINGH, Bose Pacia Modern, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074, through Nov. 1. The psychological and the political merge in paintings by the New Delhi artist Arpita Singh. So do everyday life and allegory, Expressionism and ornament, historical sources from Bengali folk painting to Marc Chagall and a formal approach that is at once gauche and poised. Many pictures focus on the figure of a middle-age, worn-looking, often nude woman who may and may not be the artist. She occupies a dreamlike world of free-floating numbers and untethered objects: teapots, fetuses, knives, bright pink flowers. Toy-sized warplanes fly like sharks through the air; a lotus serves as her pillow; men in dark suits stare or weep (Cotter).

Other Galleries

"FILM REVIVAL," Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long island City, Queens, (718) 937-6317, through Nov. 10. Four artists draw on marginal elements of film to make semiabstract paintings, works on paper and sculpture. Todd Brandt creates optically arresting fields composed of hundreds of 35-millimeter film canisters; Stefana McClure produces Minimalist rectangles by layering the foreign language subtitles of films by famous auteurs; Jesse Amado turns words from movie scripts into compacted typographic sculptures; and Carter Potter makes film and painting hybrids by wrapping 70 mm. film stock around wooden stretchers (Johnson).

Last Chance

* "THE AMERICAN EFFECT: GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE UNITED STATES, 1990-2003," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Sunday. Exploring ways that artists throughout the world react to the United States as a superpower, this show of documentary films, videos, installations, photographs, paintings and objects by 47 artists and filmmakers and 3 collaborative groups runs from sunny side up to deep despair. There are reflections on American military and industrial might, its treatment of minorities, its consumerism, its justice system, its marketing strategies, its religious evangelism, its celebrity worship and its interference with other governments. There are also expressions of admiration for the freedoms, the opportunities and the material achievements of a country unfettered by ancient traditions. The show has its weak spots but is provocative and visually compelling over all. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* TOM ANDERSEN, Bill Maynes, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-3318, through tomorrow. Mr. Andersen's compact, airbrushed, semiabstracted harbor scenes, cityscapes, surrealistic cartoons and college dorm snaps, presented inside color-coordinated flocked frames, are materially and conceptually craftlike imitations of kitschy decorations for the home. At a deeper level, he moderates an inner debate between ironic sophistication and poetic sentimentalism (Johnson).

* ROGER ANDERSSON, Sara Meltzer, 516 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-9330, through tomorrow. Mr. Andersson, a young Swedish artist, uses the letters of the alphabet and a hyperpolished illustrational style to create a corrupt version of fairy tales. Each letter is painted large and embellished with tiny figures and emblems that refer to adolescent politics, pop music and drug culture, and with minutely observed depictions of Scandinavian flora. The primer format, executed in Delft tile blue and white, is a clever if small-scale idea, but Mr. Andersson's smooth, sweet virtuosity gives it some bite (Cotter).

* PHILIP-LORCA diCORCIA, "A Storybook Life," Pace/MacGill Gallery at PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000, through tomorrow. An unusually personal show from a master of the baroque of everyday life, this show arranges 75 photographs from 25 years into a loose (but not chronological) narrative that intimates an artistic development, an array of personal ties and a penchant for fusing the artificial and the natural in pictures whose emotional and formal resonances seem to unfold in real time (Smith).

* RINEKE DIJKSTRA, Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through tomorrow. The Dutch artist presents two remarkable series of photographs tracing the progress of new soldiers, one an Israeli woman, one a Frenchman in the Foreign Legion, whom we see grow up over the course of the works. Ms. Dijkstra's subject is life in transition: the cusp of adulthood, parenthood, a new job or a refugee settling in a new country, passages through which people become themselves and in the process reveal themselves. Her photographs are simple, head-on figures against plain backdrops, the subjects staring passively at the camera, presenting themselves as they wish, or trying to, alert but just on the edge of fatigue or distraction, which means their guard is almost down (Kimmelman).

GROUP SHOW, Monya Rowe, 242 South First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (646) 234-8645, through Sunday. This new gallery -- possibly the smallest white cube in the New York art world -- announces its arrival with a show of works on paper by four promising young artists: Kevin Christy, Tina Gauthier, Larmar Peterson and Suzanne Wright, whose world views are each infused with a distinctive sense of fantasy and color. The scale of the space is perfectly geared to looking at drawings (Smith).

TAKASHI MURAKAMI, "Reversed Double Helix," Rockefeller Center, (212) 980-3942, through Sunday. At the center of Mr. Murakami's eye-grabbing outdoor sculptural tableau sits Mr. Pointy, a giant sluglike cartoon character in colorful molded plastic who meditates with Buddha-like complacency upon a pair of hovering 33-foot black balloons emblazoned with winking eyes. Surrounded by pudgy, cherubic guards and flanked by patches of giant mushrooms, which serve as seats for weary parents and gymnastic pedestals for toddlers, Mr. Pointy might be a beneficent god of child-centric fantasy or a Pied Piper of contemporary digital oblivion (Johnson).

"NOGUCHI: THE BOLLINGEN JOURNEY, PHOTOGRAPHS AND DRAWINGS, 1949-1956," Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum (temporary space), 36-01 43rd Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 204-7088, through Monday. More than 100 photographs and drawings recreate Noguchi's travels from 1949 to 1956, on a grant from the Bollingen Foundation. The project was for an ambitious book (never completed) on the religious, monumental, classical and communal spaces and structures of familiar and less-documented societies. Besides providing an elegant travelogue, the photographs give some idea of the many sources that Noguchi drew on for his work. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 65+, $2.50 (Glueck)

* JUDY PFAFF, "Neither Here Nor There," Ameringer & Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0051, through tomorrow. Given the ubiquity of the installation-piece-as-planned-chaos, Ms. Pfaff should get more respect. "Neither Here Nor There" shows her fluency with a newly transparent, levitating compositional approach, which more than ever offers a seamless melding of drawing, painting and sculpture. It provides a global tour of architectural traditions, materials and motifs, mixing past and present, East and West, decorative and structural, into an elegantly articulate global reverie (Smith).

"REMEMBERING THE FORGOTTEN ONES: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF MILTON ROGOVIN," New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Sunday. Mr. Rogovin, who is 93, has been photographing the residents of Buffalo's Lower West Side, a largely black, Latino and immigrant neighborhood, since the 1950's. Wonderful images have emerged: a benignly smiling elderly man pushing a baby in a carriage; alert kids dressed in cool street styles; a teenage mother standing with her infant in front of a wall bearing the chalk-written words "I love you God." At regular intervals, Mr. Rogovin has rephotographed some of his original subjects, and he displays the updates in four-picture sequences that he calls quartets. In them couples marry and have families; change homes, partners and eras; gain weight, gain perspective, disappear. Sad, traumatic or sweet, these visual versions of oral history are the highlight of the show. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 65+, $3 (Cotter).

PERSON: Arthur Berger 

HEADLINE: Arthur Berger, Composer and Music Critic, Is Dead at 91 

BYLINE:  By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
Arthur Berger, an American composer whose rugged, economically scored music straddles Neo-Classicism and Serialism, and who established a sideline career as a thoughtful writer and critic, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Boston. He was 91 and lived in Cambridge, Mass. 
 Mr. Berger was part of the wave of Paris-trained composers whose work helped establish a contemporary American style in the 1940's -- one that, in the spirit of American culture, morphed to accommodate new interests and techniques. 
 Like Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson, with whom he was associated, Mr. Berger was fascinated in his early years by Stravinsky's music, and he adopted aspects of Stravinsky's rhythmically pointed style, as well as the textural clarity that was central to Stravinsky's Neo-Classicism.
Mr. Berger's work maintained a gritty urbanity that gave the impression of greater abstraction, and held popularity at arm's length, unlike Copland and Thomson. He magnified that distance in the late 1950's by incorporating 12-tone techniques into his music, which retained its Neo-Classical contours. 
Popularity was never an issue for Mr. Berger. "If Serialism's detractors mean that it has not become big-time box office," he wrote in a 1987 article in The Boston Review, "they should be reminded that there are other audiences, not at all negligible, besides the big ones." 
Arthur Berger was born in New York on May 15, 1912. He began playing the piano when he was 11, and wrote his first compositions while in high school. Although he enrolled at City College in 1928, he did not begin his formal studies in composition until he transferred to New York University, where he completed a bachelor's degree in 1934. 
He also became friendly with Copland, and joined Copland's informal Young Composer's Group. 
With the composer Bernard Herrmann -- who had not yet made his name as a film-score composer -- Mr. Berger published the Musical Mercury, a magazine devoted to contemporary and traditional music. He edited the magazine for three years, while also studying composition with Walter Piston, Hugo Leichtentritt and Archibald Thompson Davison at Harvard, where he earned his master's degree in 1936.
In 1937 he moved to Paris for two years of study with Nadia Boulanger, the French theory and composition teacher who had been a crucial influence on Copland. Upon his return from Paris in 1939, Mr. Berger joined the faculty of Mills College in Oakland, Calif., where he also continued his composition studies with Darius Milhaud. He later taught at Brooklyn College, the Juilliard School, Brandeis University and the New England Conservatory, retiring from teaching in 1999. 
Mr. Berger also contributed reviews to The Boston Transcript and The New York Sun in the mid-1940's, and joined Thomson as a critic at The New York Herald Tribune. In 1962 he helped found Perspectives on New Music, a scholarly publication, which he edited briefly.
His autobiography, "Reflections of an American Composer," was published by the University of California Press in 2002. 
Mr. Berger's musical output includes works for orchestra, solo voice and choir, but his most durable and varied compositions are for chamber ensembles and piano. His first major work, the Quartet for Winds (1941) -- a lively Neo-Classical piece dedicated to Copland -- is still performed regularly. A series of duos -- for violin and piano (1948), cello and piano (1951) and oboe and clarinet (1952) -- continue to sound vital and fresh, and there is much power and beauty in his piano music.
He is survived by his wife, Ellen.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Vietnam Agree on Direct Air Travel 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
Vietnam and the United States agreed on Thursday to allow direct passenger and cargo flights between the two countries for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War.
 The agreement was initialed in Hanoi by Thamvu Hien, deputy director of Vietnam's Civil Aviation Administration, and Laura Faux-Gable, deputy director of the Office of Aviation Negotiations at the State Department. 
 Vietnam's relations with the United States have broadened since a bilateral trade agreement went into effect in December 2001. The pact significantly increased trade between the two countries, but negotiators had been unable to reach an agreement on air travel. 
At present, American carriers must have sharing agreements with other airlines that operate there, and passengers flying betweenthe two countries have to change planes in some country that flies to Vietnam. 
No details were available on when direct commerical air service between the two countries would begin.
"The two countries have been waiting for this agreement for a long time," said Le Dang Doanh, an economist and adviser to Vietnam's minister of planning and investment. "This is a new step forward in bilateral relations." 
Vietnam has said the American market accounts for 10 percent of its aviation business, and that would likely increase with direct flights. 
More than 1 million ethnic Vietnamese live in the United States, many of whom have begun traveling back to their homeland.
Negotiations on an aviation agreement broke down three years ago but resumed earlier this year. Details about the talks have not been released, but Vietnamese news reports have said that a major sticking point involved regulations for passengers or cargo to change flights during stopovers at major airport hubs.
The American delegation at the talks, in addition to government officials, included representatives of several large American carriers and San Francisco International Airport.

HEADLINE: A Kosovo University With an American Accent 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS WOOD 

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
When Kathy Schneider tells a joke, it comes as a surprise to her students. Humor is one of the last thing students expect here in Kosovo when they enter a classroom.
 That, however, is something Ms. Schneider and her colleagues at the newly opened American University in Kosovo hope to change as they seek to fill a gap left by a state education system still influenced by Yugoslav-style Communism. 
 "I want to see the light bulbs come on," said Ms. Schneider who heads the school's language program, " I want them to come up with ideas." 
Statements like these are unusual in Kosovo's higher education system, where Ms. Schneider, who is from Springfield, Mass., and has more than a decade of experience teaching English as a foreign language, says students are treated all too often like unruly youths who should be seen and not heard.
The university, where classes started Monday, joins dozens of private schools and institutes that have sprung up in Kosovo since the end of the war in the Serbian province in 1999.
Many of these schools are looking to the United States as an example, and in particular at institutions that maintain close links to business and industry.
"People wanted an American university, both as a model for education but also as a vehicle for economic development" said Louis Sell, the executive director of the American University in Kosovo Foundation, which raises money for the school.
The university is financed almost entirely by Kosovo Albanians, and at the start, offers a two-year associates degree in business and economics. Classes are in English. 
The Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, N.Y., is managing the academic program for the school, which is starting with about 60 students. It plans to expand to four-year programs in the next two years. Mr. Sell said one goal is to provide students with an education that is relevant to the workplace. Students can expect to spend substantial time in work-study placements with local businesses.
"It was always a dream for people here to study in a world-class university," said Meliza Haradinaj, a 19-year-old entering student from Pristina, the Kosovo capital. "So this is a brilliant opportunity to study without having to go away." 
The annual fee for the course is $5,500, not inexpensive in Kosovo, where the average wage for those who have a job is about $150 a month. But the costs, Mr. Sell says, are small compared with sending a student to study elsewhere in Europe or the United States.
The local state-run university in Pristina, with more than 20,000 students, used to have the monopoly on higher education, but critics say the courses there are increasingly irrelevant to student needs.
"I call the University of Pristina a mirage," says Akan Ismaili, 29, a former student. "It was desperate. People didn't analyze anything." Mr. Ismaili said that, when he attended, students in the school's information technology course had little or no access to a computer. 
Frustrated with his own experience, Mr. Ismaili help set up what is now Kosovo's leading center for computer studies, partly financed by an Internet service provider. 
Inside their sleekly designed offices in the Pristina national library, nearly five miles of cable enable students to set up and dismantle Internet servers and networks. Courses, most operated in cooperation with Cisco Systems, an American company, cover marketing, graphic design and finance.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
On Tiny Plot in Chelsea, A 12-Story Condo Rises

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
Think "sliver" and what comes to mind -- at least in real estate parlance -- is a needle-thin building that pierces the skyline and dwarfs its neighbors.
 At first glance, the Paradigm, a 12-story residential condominium going up at 146-148 West 22nd Street in the heart of Chelsea, bears little resemblance to the structures shoehorned into narrow plots by developers in the early 1980's. 
 Technically, though, it qualifies as a sliver because it sits on a lot that measures less than the 45-foot minimum width required by a zoning law passed in 1983 to halt the proliferation of the slender structures. But the building does not not violate the law, because of a provision that permits construction to a height equal to the tallest abutting wall if it fronts on a wide street, or to that of the lower adjacent wall on a narrow street. 
"Our plot is 40 by 90 feet, and when you have frontage that small, you are not allowed to build a tall building," said Kenneth Horn, the president and owner of Alchemy Properties, the developer of the site. But the shorter of the two buildings flanking his is 158 feet, so he was allowed to go that high, providing that a setback start at 95 feet. At 135 feet high, the Paradigm falls well within the limitations.
"Had the building next door been 70 feet, I could only have gone up 70 feet, and it wouldn't have made economic sense," Mr. Horn said.
Plans for the structure sailed through the approvals process last year. Built within allowable limits on a block that does not have landmark status, it required no special permits or variances, nor did it have to be approved by the community board. 
"They filed for new building approval on June 28, 2002, and got it on July 9," said Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings.
There was no opposition expressed to the project. "In fact, we have gotten a great response because the existing structure, which had been occupied by beverage and toy distributors in the past, was extremely derelict," Mr. Horn said.
"It did pose a design challenge," said Marvin H. Meltzer, the architect and a partner in the firm of Meltzer/Mandl, referring to the historically commercial nature of the area. "In communities or neighborhoods that never had a predominantly residential character before, as an architect you can either make it look like the rest of the buildings that are not residential or you can seize the opportunity to introduce a new architectural vocabulary." 
His goal for the project, he added, was not to design a seamless continuation of the street wall. "You don't recreate something that was built in the late 1800's," he said. "You design something contemporary that reinforces the 1800 buildings, making its design stronger through contrast."
His first plan for the site -- all colors, curves and aluminum panels -- provided a dramatic contrast to the existing buildings. "The client asked us to do something more in keeping with the block," he said. 
He gave up the idea of curves, choosing instead to produce a sleek facade of steel gray granite punctuated by eight-foot windows. Mirrored glass lining the recesses that rise from the third to the ninth floors on the edges of the building's facade will reflect the building's stonework and that of its immediate neighbors. "This little move of mirror glass separating it from the existing buildings is key," Mr. Meltzer said. "It pops the building out." 
The first floor will be retail space, and the floors above will have one apartment each. Eight of the 12 units have three bedrooms and three bathrooms; the rest have two bedrooms and two baths. Living rooms are all positioned at the front facing West 22nd Street.
All the apartments have at least two balconies, and four have terraces, the largest of them 1,035 square feet. Prices range from $1.4 million to $2.2 million.
Asked why he had named the building Paradigm, Mr. Horn said: "We were creating a model of what we thought a new building should look like. We wanted to show that good clear thought went into it and it is not just a pile of bricks." And besides, he said, "I wanted people to ask what it means."

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
U.S. Team's Ironwoman Nears the End of the Road

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
If she is the oldest member of the United States national team at age 35, Joy Fawcett is also its ironwoman, the only player not to miss a minute of the past three Women's World Cups or both Olympic soccer tournaments. 
 She joined the national team in 1987, became the top American defender and later a co-captain, playing with a fluid economy and a swooping speed that produced 26 career goals. She also remained in the lineup while having three children, keeping remarkably fit during her pregnancies. After her daughters were born, she breast-fed them in the locker room at halftime. 
 "It's hard," Fawcett said of maintaining her fitness while pregnant. "You're tired all the time. You don't want to get out there. My love of the game has kept me going."
On Saturday, when the United States faces Canada for third place at the Home Depot Center in nearby Carson, Calif., Fawcett will play in her 23rd and final Women's World Cup match. She hopes to play in the 2004 Athens Olympics, then plans to retire from soccer, gain her master's degree and become an elementary school teacher.
"You think about it, but you try not to think too much," Fawcett said of her final World Cup appearance.
This is not the way Fawcett, Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy and Kristine Lilly expected this tournament to end. They planned to play in the final on Sunday, not in the consolation match on Saturday, wanting a third World Cup title to gild their golden careers. But the United States lost, 3-0, to Germany in the semifinals, and the American players were left with the bitter solace of playing for third place instead of first.
"It's definitely hard, but there's nothing you can do," said Fawcett, who made the all-tournament team.
A number of theories have been expressed to explain the American defeat: lack of technical skill, tactical inadequacy, an aging team, fatigue, a poor choice of substitutes.
Twice, Fawcett was beaten late in the semifinal as the United States pushed forward in attack and risked using only three defenders. Fatigue was not a factor, Fawcett said, adding that the team was fit from having just completed a full season in the Women's United Soccer Association. She acknowledged that playing five games in 15 days "is a lot of games at a high level in a short period of time."
On a tactical level, Fawcett said, "I think they did a better job possessing the ball than we did."
After defeating Norway in a quarterfinal, United Staes Coach April Heinrichs called Fawcett "the glue to our back line." Fawcett has played with a calm, quiet brilliance, often unnoticed by others but indispensable within the team. And she has been in the vanguard of gaining for athletes the child-care rights that many women have obtained in the corporate workplace.
Beginning with the 1999 Women's World Cup, the United States Soccer Federation paid Fawcett a stipend for a nanny, paying for the nanny's transportation costs and providing the players private rooms on the road. Until then, Fawcett paid her own child-care costs. Her husband, Walter, relocated and gave up his job to care for the couple's children so Joy could continue her soccer career.
At first, Fawcett said, she questioned whether the traveling was good for her children -- Katelyn, 9, Carli, 6, and Madilyn Rae, 2. But she said: "They are well behaved and adaptable; they can sleep anywhere, eat anything. They really don't complain too much."
With little direction on how a pregnant elite athlete should remain fit, Fawcett improvised. During her first pregnancy, Fawcett said, her doctor was alarmed to learn that she was still sprinting and running stadium steps midway through her term and asked her to stop. More assured during her second and third pregnancies, Fawcett kept running, doing stair-step exercises and lifting weights until just before giving birth.
"You get a lot of weird looks when you're lifting weights," Fawcett said, adding, "No one's been brave enough to say, 'You're crazy.' "
Three weeks after Katelyn was born, Fawcett showed up to watch practice, and Anson Dorrance, then coach of the national team, suggested she join in team drills. "I didn't want to lose my spot on the team, so I had my mom watch the baby," Fawcett said.
Nine years later, Fawcett is also breaking ground in another area -- headgear, which is being allowed for the first time in this World Cup. A padded headband provides a shock absorber for heading balls and is designed to minimize injuries when players collide while jousting for balls in the air.
"It takes all that worry away," Fawcett said. "You can have more confidence against big players."
Just as her teammates have confidence that she will be available every minute of every game.

HEADLINE: Claims Filed By Jobless Show Decline 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless aid fell last week to its lowest level in eight months, the government said on Thursday.
 First-time filings for unemployment benefits fell 23,000, to 382,000, in the week ended Saturday from an upwardly revised 405,000 in the previous week, the Labor Department said. 
 The drop brought both initial claims and a closely watched four-week average of claims to their lowest levels since early February.
The four-week average smooths weekly volatility to give a better reading on trends. It fell 11,500, to 393,500, its first drop below the crucial 400,000 level in six weeks.
Economists say claims above 400,000 suggest a deteriorating jobs market, while claims below that signal improvement.
Economists were cautiously optimistic, saying the data -- which came after a report last week showed that employers added 57,000 workers to their payrolls last month -- at least suggested a long stretch of job losses could be over.
"What it indicates is that perhaps the labor market is starting to gain some traction," said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
Although the economy emerged from recession in November 2001, it has lost more than a million jobs since then. Economists, including officials at the Federal Reserve, say a recovery spurred by a strong jobs market is essential to ensure the sustainability of the expansion.
In the only other postwar recovery without the benefit of a strong jobs market -- the slow crawl back from the 1990-91 recession -- it took 14 months for the number of employed to get back to where it stood when the recession ended.

HEADLINE: Hotel Owner's Suit Accuses Marriott of Mismanagement 

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

 BODY:
The owner of a Midtown Manhattan hotel operated by Marriott International filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday, contending that Marriott's hotel-management practices forced the move.
 The owner, 866 3rd Next Generation Hotel, a New York limited liability company, said in an accompanying affidavit that Marriott had engaged in mismanagement and commercial bribery and taken kickbacks while managing the property, the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown East. The hotel, in the former Macmillan Publishing headquarters, is on Third Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets. 
 In the affidavit, the owner said its "financial collapse is largely attributable to Marriott International's repeated breaches of its fiduciary duties, mismanagement and malfeasance." In April, the owner defaulted on a $55 million loan from a German bank, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank, to develop the hotel, which opened in 1998 with 307 rooms and 8 suites and caters to business travelers. The owner is an affiliate of the Witkoff Group, a real estate investment firm in New York. 
Roger Conner, a Marriott spokesman, said yesterday that Marriott had not seen the filing and could not comment. But he said the hotel had been "substantially outperforming its competition in the market" with regard to revenue per available room, a crucial industry measure.
The Chapter 11 filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York is the latest sign of increasing tensions between Marriott, based in Bethesda, Md., and the owners of hotels it manages.
Marriott has been the defendant in at least five lawsuits in recent years from owners who contend it engages in mismanagement and fraud, overcharges for supplies and services, unfairly pockets vendor rebates and withholds financial records. Some lawsuits have been settled or dismissed, but two, from CTF Holdings of Hong Kong and from Strategic Hotel Capital of Chicago, appear headed for trial sometime next year.
Marriott has denied all accusations in the lawsuits.
Marriott manages more than 2,500 hotels on behalf of more than 500 separate owners, handling all operations from reservations to accounting. It earns management and incentive fees and also makes profits on its procurement of goods and services for some hotels. 
In its affidavit, 866 3rd Next Generation Hotel said it had "fallen victim to a scheme designed by Marriott International to facilitate acts of commercial bribery with regard to kickbacks and hidden profits from the purchases from vendors and the management of the hotel." It cited two Marriott affiliates -- Avendra, which buys supplies, and Marriott Design and Construction -- as having conducted transactions detrimental to the hotel's financial health. 
Marriott, the affidavit said, provided misleading and false projections of the hotel's profitability and inflated the hotel's net profits to receive a higher incentive fee. "In fact, the hotel was losing money in some periods when it was shown as earning a profit by Marriott International," the affidavit said. 
The owner hopes to refinance the hotel through the Swiss bank UBS and convert it to longer-term residential use, according to the affidavit. A bankruptcy judge must rule on the reorganization plan.
The affidavit said that 866 3rd Next Generation Hotel was also asking a court to permit it to pay Marriott through escrow accounts until it has a clearer picture of the hotel's finances and how Marriott uses them. It also wants the court to force Marriott to disclose how it uses revenue and payments from owners and provide financial records.
Marriott reported yesterday that its third-quarter net income dipped to $92 million, or 37 cents a share, from $103 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. The drop, which met Wall Street expectations amid lower room rates in the struggling economy, came despite an increase in revenue, to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 11, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A headline in Business Day yesterday about a hotel owner's accusations of mismanagement by Marriott International misstated the forum in which they were made. It was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, not a lawsuit.

Shares Push Higher on Jobs Data and Earnings

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index to their highest levels in more than a year, as falling jobless claims and earnings from Yahoo encouraged investors. 
 "What we have here is an accelerating economy," said Buzz Zaino, who manages about $2 billion for Royce & Associates in New York. "Fewer people are being laid off and that means there's going to be more money in the hands of people to spend. There will be lots of positive earnings surprises." 
 The Dow jumped 49.11 points, or 0.5 percent, to 9,680.01, surpassing this year's closing record of 9,659.13 reached on Sept. 18. It closed at its highest level since June 2002.
The Nasdaq increased 18.12 points, or 1 percent, to 1,911.90, a 19-month high. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 4.95 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,038.73 and is up 34 percent since touching a five- year low a year ago. It pared gains after rising as much as 1.4 percent.
"The market just ran out of steam," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at SG Cowen Securities. Investors were reluctant to bid stocks higher until they got more quarterly results from companies like General Electric, which reports today.
More than eight stocks rose for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.56 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 17 percent more than its three-month daily average.
Consumer-related stocks had the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500 after retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Federated Department Stores reported better-than-expected September sales.
Shares of Yahoo advanced 10 percent, for its biggest gain in 11 months, after the company said third-quarter profit more than doubled on higher advertising sales.
Other Internet-related stocks gained. EBay, the Web auctioneer, touched a record, surpassing the level reached on March 24, 2000, during the height of the Internet bubble. Amazon.com Inc. rose 5.1 percent.
First-time claims during the week that ended Saturday dropped to 382,000 from a revised 405,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said. The last time claims were lower was the week ended Feb. 8, when the total was 378,000. The four-week moving average also fell to the lowest since February.
"The economy now is starting to confirm it's growing strong," said Joseph C. Williams III, who helps manage about $10 billion for Commerce Bancshares. "We're going into some strong earnings."
Yahoo jumped $3.96, to $42.75, for the biggest increase in the S.&P. 500. The company said third- quarter profit rose to $65.3 million from $28.9 million a year ago. .
EBay added $1.78 to $60.25. Amazon.com, the Internet retailer, climbed $2.16, to $57.86.
Hewlett-Packard added 79 cents, to $21.04, after its chief executive, Carleto S. Fiorina, said it would "absolutely" have a profit in each of its four main divisions. The stock fell 10 percent Aug. 20 after the company reported third- quarter losses in its PC and server units.
The rally lifted the Dow average within 232 points of 10,000, a level not seen since May 31, 2002. The advance confounded skeptics like the money manager David Tice, who predicted a year ago that the Dow would drop below 5,000.
"The things we saw before are all still true," said Mr. Tice, manager of the $422 million Prudent Bear Fund, which is down 9.8 percent this year. "We see this as a continuation of the asset bubble andcredit creation being out of control."
Retail shares rose on the strong sales numbers. Wal-Mart rose 44 cents, to $58.96; Federated added $1.20, to $45.60; Sears gained $1.45, to $50.18; and Dillard's jumped $1.37, to $16.07.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasury prices rattled lower yesterday as a fall in jobless claims signaled that the jobs market may at last be picking up, reigniting hopes for an economic recovery and giving equities an added lift.
A government auction of reopened 10-year inflation-linked paper did attract decent demand over all, but a less-than-expected turnout from foreign central banks.
By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note fell 15/32, to a price of 99 20/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.30 percent from 4.24 on Wednesday. And the 30-year bond lost 26/32, to 102 10/32, as its yield jumped to 5.22 percent from 5.16 percent.

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger Wants Davis to Stop Filling Posts and Signing Bills 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
California's governor-elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger, asked Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday to suspend action on all pending bills and to stop appointing judges and members of state boards and commissions.
 At a news conference in which he named the director of his transition team and bipartisan 65-member transition advisory panel, Mr. Schwarzenegger said the voters had decided Mr. Davis's fate, and he called on him to live up to his promise to cooperate fully in the transfer of power. Recently, Mr. Davis has filled scores of judgeships and other appointed positions and is acting on hundreds of bills passed in the final days of the legislative session. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger also swatted away a question about when he would address accusations of sexual misconduct that arose near the end of the campaign. He said last weekend that he would answer the matter after the election. But on Thursday he dismissed the accusations as "old news" and refused to discuss them further as he strode from the room.
Mr. Schwarzenegger introduced Representative David Dreier, an 11-term Republican member of Congress from the Los Angeles suburb of San Dimas, as the chairman of his transition team.
He also named Donna Arduin, 40, a devotee of supply-side economics who is on leave as Florida's budget director, to audit the state's finances. Ms. Arduin said she would complete her work by mid-January, when the new governor must submit a budget.
Mr. Schwarzenegger, who will be sworn in as soon as the official canvas of votes is completed in a few weeks, acknowledged that Mr. Davis retains the constitutional authority of the governor's office until that day. But he said he would prefer that Mr. Davis refrain from acting on laws and personnel matters.
"He has the right to do so, but I, of course, would like it if he doesn't make any appointments, and I would like it really if he doesn't sign any more bills," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "But we will be working on that, and I'm absolutely convinced that when the governor says that he wants to have a smooth transition, that we will in fact have a smooth transition."
Steven Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said that Mr. Davis would continue to exercise all his powers until he left office and suggested that Mr. Schwarzenegger still had some things to learn about how Sacramento operates. About 230 bills were awaiting the governor's action, Mr. Maviglio said, and Mr. Davis was continuing to name judges and other appointed officials.
"Until the secretary of state hands the new governor his election certificate," Mr. Maviglio said, "Governor Davis will continue doing the job the Constitution requires him to do." 
He added that the deadline for signature or veto of all pending legislation was Oct. 12 and that if Mr. Davis did not act on the bills, they would automatically become law.
"I don't know if Arnold understands that," Mr. Maviglio said.
He added that former Gov. Pete Wilson made 435 appointments in the two months between Mr. Davis's election to succeed him and his inauguration in January 1999. Mr. Wilson also appointed 31 judges during that period, Mr. Maviglio said.
Mr. Schwarzenegger described his transition advisers as a diverse group representing "the best and the brightest" in California. He said they would guide him on appointments and fiscal and social policy.
The group includes such prominent Democrats as Mayor James K. Hahn of Los Angeles; Mayor Willie L. Brown of San Francisco; Susan Estrich, manager of Michael S. Dukakis's presidential bid in 1988; and Eli Broad, a billionaire philanthropist and one of the Democratic Party's biggest contributors. All of them opposed the recall of Governor Davis.
Among the leading Republicans on the list are Bill Simon Jr., whom Mr. Davis defeated last November; former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles; former Governor Wilson; James L. Brulte, the minority leader in the State Senate; Dave Cox, the minority leader in the State Assembly; and Matt Fong, an unsuccessful candidate for United States Senate in 1998.
Mr. Schwarzenegger said there was "no White House connection in our transition team." But one of its members is Gerald Parsky, a top Bush fund-raisers and the White House's point man in California.
The group will do most of its work by e-mail and conference call, a Schwarzenegger aide said. It appears designed to offer the public assurance that the new governor intends to seek advice from a wide range of sources. Many of Mr. Schwarzenegger's top campaign advisers were aides to former Governor Wilson, leading some Democrats to speculate that they would play a large role in the transition and the new government. But Schwarzenegger aides said that only a handful of Wilson veterans would serve.
Mr. Wilson served as co-chairman of Mr. Schwarzenegger's campaign.
Mr. Broad, who contributed $100,000 to Mr. Davis's antirecall committee, said Mr. Dreier had asked him to serve on the transition team. He said he agreed because he believed that Mr. Schwarzenegger was not a rigid ideologue and they shared a common interest in public education and urban redevelopment.
Barry Munitz, who directed the Davis transition in 1998, called the Schwarzenegger team "a symbolic statement of a broad umbrella of opinion, not a functioning, people-finding, agenda-setting transition team." Those jobs will be performed by a much smaller group of close advisers, Mr. Munitz said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Martha Stewart Magazine Cuts Ad Rate Base as Readers Decline

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Martha Stewart Living, long a leader among cooking and home decorating magazines, is cutting its rate base for the first time since the magazine began 12 years ago, because of declining readership. 
 In recent days, company executives have begun telling advertisers -- in the October issue they included General Motors, L. L. Bean, Campbell Soup and the Tylenol division of Johnson & Johnson -- that the rate base will fall nearly 22 percent, to 1.8 million from 2.3 million, as of January. The rate base is the number of subscriber and newsstand copies a magazine guarantees. 
 Suzanne Sobel, executive vice president for advertising and marketing, said in an interview that the basic price for a one-page, four-color advertisement would drop to $107,640 starting with the January issue, from $129,766. 
"We have made a conscious strategic decision to take our rate base from 2.3 million to 1.8 million," Ms. Sobel said, calling it the right move "for the future of our magazine and the future of our company." 
The decline follows more than a year of turmoil at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, the publisher, that began when Ms. Stewart came under government scrutiny for her sale of ImClone Systems shares. She was indicted in June on five criminal charges, has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to stand trial, beginning Jan. 12. Profits and the company's share price have spiraled downward since the investigation became public in June 2002. 
The reduction also comes as the magazine has experienced steep drops in advertising. Its readers are overwhelmingly women, with a median age of 42.7 and a median annual household income of $65,320.
Competition from other magazines for those readers in a sluggish economy has eroded loyalty, said Sharon Patrick, chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Ms. Patrick also blamed what she called "this time of uncertainty" resulting from the investigation of Ms. Stewart. 
Advertising pages have fallen 33 percent at Martha Stewart Living for the first 10 months of this year, said Laura Richardson, an analyst for Adams Harkness & Hill, an investment bank in Boston, citing figures from the Media Industry Newsletter. By comparison, advertising pages have risen 44.5 percent at Real Simple and by 9.6 percent at Better Homes and Gardens, which is considered Martha Stewart Living's biggest competitor.
Those rivals have also maintained or increased circulation. According to figures for the six months ended June 30, the latest available, Real Simple's paid circulation has increased 31.3 percent to 1,375,355 over last year and Better Homes and Gardens' has held steady at 7,611,005.
The cut in the rate base at Martha Stewart "is not a sign the company sees its business trends improving," Ms. Richardson said. "It is a sign they are trying to react to some challenging business trends." 
Still, one media executive said the reduction was not necessarily a bad thing. "When they wring out that weak circulation, it's better for them and better for us," said Stacey Lippman, managing director at Carat USA, a media planning and buying agency. "One of the big issues in the magazine business right now is, How solid is your circulation?" While some advertisers might react and not advertise, saying that the audience was fleeing, "that's not necessarily true," Mr. Lippman said. 
Ms. Patrick called the reduction "a very good example of the management philosophy of this company." The decision was made to ensure that advertisers reach what she called "our core group of loyal readers."
"We have chosen not to dilute the value of our demographics by going after marginal readers," she said. Like many publishers, the company has tried to attract subscribers with special rates and other marketing efforts that are costly if readers do not continue their subscriptions. 
Another executive said the company's explanation could raise eyebrows among advertisers and lead to more expenses for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. 
"It's a real risky rationale," said George Sansoucy, managing director of Initiative, a media planning and buying agency in New York that has bought space in the magazine. "Maybe we should ask them to rebate us for the readers they now say were not very valuable Martha Stewart Living readers. I might say, you want me to buy ads going forward, maybe you should rebate me for what I bought in the past." 
Asked about rebates, Ms. Sobel said she could not be specific about "what package we will put together for each advertiser." In her conversations with advertisers, she said, they had offered support. "One advertiser said to me, '1.8 million, that ain't chopped liver,' " she said. 
Jerry Buckley, a spokesman for Campbell Soup, said it regularly evaluated its advertising purchases in the wake of cuts in rate bases. "The Martha Stewart Living demographic is right for us," Mr. Buckley said. "We view this as a significant drop." 
The reduction will not affect the cover price of Martha Stewart Living magazine, which sells for $4.75 on newsstands.
And, despite the decline in circulation, the cost advertisers pay per thousand readers, known as the C.P.M., will actually increase under the new structure. "We are raising it by 6 percent, from $56.42 to $59.80," Ms. Sobel said. 
Mr. Sansoucy questioned the fairness of that as well. "They're not exactly in a position of power," he said. "Drops in readership, those are not signs of power. Those are signs of retreat."

HEADLINE: The Candidates' Views In Their Own Words 

 BODY:
John Edwards
On reaching out to the middle class
 I want this president to explain to the American people why multimillionaires sitting by the swimming pool, getting a statement each month to see how much money he's making, is paying a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher, a firefighter, a secretary. 
The second reason that this is wrong is because he is putting the burden on the very engine of our economy, which is working people and the middle class. Our economy grows when working people and the middle class grows. 
It's happened historically. This president believes if you put more money in the pockets of people at the top, somehow we are all going to do better. 
He's wrong. He's -- we are going to prove he's wrong in 2004, and the middle class needs to hear this message.

Howard Dean
On his positions on Social Security and Medicare
First of all, I've never said I didn't change. I'm a strong supporter of Medicare. I'm a strong supporter of Social Security. I think Medicare is a badly run program, and I've said so repeatedly. We are not going to take away Medicare or Social Security. That was part of the social contract passed with Lyndon Johnson and F.D.R.. What we are going to do, however, is change those programs so they can do better.

John Kerry
On winning the election
I think there has been a problem in the last election, certainly, and part of it was not of the making of the party, it was the cleverness of the Republican administration and Karl Rove in exploiting national security. They brought the Iraq issue in September for a purpose. Andrew Card said you don't introduce a new product in August. And they introduced their product and they wiped other choices off the stage.
But that's one of the reasons why it's so important to have a nominee of our party who will have the ability to stand toe-to-toe with them. 
They used to think their strong suit was national security. They can't find Osama bin Laden, they can't find Saddam Hussein, they can't find even find the leaker in the White House.

Joseph I. Lieberman
On Iraq
This is a very important discussion because each of the nine of us want to be the commander in chief of the United States military and protect the security of this country. 
That requires a clarity of judgment and the courage to stick by the judgment you've made. Dennis Kucinich, Howard Dean, Al Sharpton, Carol Moseley Braun, they were clear and consistent against the war. I was for it, clearly and consistently. But I respect them for that clarity. I must say that I've been very disappointed, since Wes Clark came into this race, about the various positions he has taken on the war against Saddam Hussein.

Richard A. Gephardt
On Iraq

The president is failing in his responsibility to get us the help that we need. It is four months since he landed on the aircraft carrier in his flight suit and said the war was over. We've almost lost 800 soldiers to injuries since then. We've almost lost 100 who have been killed.

Wesley K. Clark
On Iraq

Let me tell you what my story is. I always supported taking the problem of Saddam Hussein to the United Nations and bringing international resolve to bear. I would never have voted for war. The Congress made a mistake in giving George Bush an open-ended resolution that enabled him to go to war without coming back to the Congress. And that's the simple answer to it.

Carol Moseley Braun
On Iraq

I wouldn't see sending in more troops than we have there already, but certainly to provide relief to those soldiers and provide them every support they need in the field, so that our men and women are not sitting ducks and so that they are not just out there without the kind of support they need to do the job they're there to do.

Dennis J. Kucinich
On Iraq

Unfortunately, in the case of Iraq, our involvement in Iraq was based on lies. This administration tried to tell the American people that Iraq had something to do with 9/11, with al Qaeda's role in 9/11, with the anthrax attack; that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; that Iraq had the intention and the ability to attack this nation. All those things are not true. So I think that the cause of defending this country must, first and foremost, be truth.

Al Sharpton
On Iraq

The president went to the U.N. and said, "Help us on my terms." If I were president, I would go in and say, "We were wrong." Tony Blair and George Bush had a meeting; acted as though it was a world summit -- two guys in a phone booth, acting like the whole world had met. And they made a wrong move. I think if we were not inflexible, we could get more support in withdrawing.

HEADLINE: Mexico's New Energy Chief Faces EntrenchedMonopoly 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MOODY 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Mexico's new energy minister, Felipe Calderon, faces the same challenges his predecessors did in the struggle to overhaul the decaying government-owned oil and electricity monopolies and open these industries to more foreign investment.
 He comes to the job with impressive political credentials, having spent the last three years as the congressional leader of the National Action Party of President Vicente Fox. And he will need all of his connections to succeed against a politically potent opposition. What may help just as much, though, is a growing consensus -- even among opponents -- that change is necessary. 
 The problems ahead for Mexico's energy industry are clear, Mr. Calderon said in a recent interview. He estimated that his oil-rich nation needs more than $150 billion in investment in the next decade to stem a rising tide of natural gas, petrochemical and gasoline imports, since the government does not have the cash to do it.
Allowing private companies in, however, would probably require constitutional changes that many Mexicans liken to treason and that Congress has repeatedly rejected. But without such changes, and soon, the country, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, could find its economic stability threatened by the rising debt from investments in production needed to keep up with domestic energy demand.
"I think time is running out in Mexico for the important changes," Mr. Calderon said.
The United States could suffer, too, since Mexico is one of its main suppliers of crude oil.
Mr. Fox has floundered in Congress not only on energy proposals but also on changes to tax and labor laws aimed at increasing government revenue and making it easier to lay off workers. Without the changes, many analysts and economists say, the Mexican economy may continue to limp along at growth rates of 1 percent or 2 percent a year.
The appointment of Mr. Calderon, a career politician and a lawyer, signals a change in strategy by President Fox. He replaces Ernesto Martens, a businessman who had previously run the country's largest glassmaker and the national airline company, but who had no experience in politics.
Mr. Calderon, on the other hand, pushed the last three budgets through a divided legislature. The hope is that he can do the same with energy reform.
The first challenge is to get the politicians to even talk about the issues. "If you put energy on the agenda in the Senate, no one will rise to speak," said Demetrio Sodi, a senator for the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution, one of the parties that opposes constitutional change of the energy sector. Mr. Sodi is also a member of the Senate energy committee, which has not met in the last 15 months.
He added, however, that many people who publicly defended the oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos in the past "say in private that they agree private investment is needed."
The reason people are thinking the previously unthinkable is simple. Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, has been importing a lot of gasoline from the United States -- sometimes more than 100,000 barrels a day -- to meet domestic demand. In addition, its natural gas imports have sometimes reached a billion cubic feet a day in 2003 because Pemex has failed to develop its own vast reserves and continues to burn off gas in its offshore southern oil wells since it lacks the infrastructure to get it ashore. Mexico also imports close to $10 billion a year in petrochemicals; the country had a total trade deficit of $7.9 billion in 2002. 
Pemex is one of the most inefficient oil companies in the world. According to "Pemex: An Uncertain Future", a recent book by the oil industry analyst David Shields, Pemex produces 87 barrels a day of oil per employee. By comparison, he said, Petroleos de Venezuela, another state-owned oil company in Latin America, produces 195 barrels a day per employee, and Royal Dutch/Shell turns out 300.
Pemex also pays more to the government than it makes in profit, financing about a third of public spending. In 2002, it had a net loss of $2.96 billion after paying taxes of $28.5 billion. To keep up, it is borrowing more and more. By the end of 2002, its debt reached $58.7 billion.
The Mexican government itself also has big foreign debts, totaling $76 billion.
Argentina's economy, which is about two-fifths the size of Mexico's, collapsed in 2002 under the weight of $95 billion in foreign debt.
Pemex's problems have multiplied even as the company reached record oil production of 3.4 million barrels a day after the United States invaded Iraq.
The state-owned electric utilities, the Federal Electricity Commission and Central Power and Light, are no better off. They need more than $5 billion a year in new power plants and delivery infrastructure just to keep the lights on in Mexico. With an annual federal budget of about $150 billion for all programs including pressing needs like poverty relief and education, the government cannot spare even the $5 billion.
Mr. Calderon, who as president of the National Action Party, was one architect of Mr. Fox's 2000 presidential victory, is aware that the task of overhauling these industries is a daunting one.
"I feel an enormous burden; it won't be easy," he said. Still, he said, "having been in Congress in such difficult times makes everything else seem easier."
He has already begun talks with pivotal politicians. "My job is to open the political dialogue and look for understanding," he said. "This reform is subject to certain ideas and restrictions that are very sensitive in Mexico." 
School textbooks here still eulogize the 1938 nationalization of oil as a symbol of the country's ability to stand up to the United States. Such sentiment makes privatization unthinkable, so perhaps the most Mr. Calderon will get is an easing of restrictions to allow more private investment -- perhaps joint ventures like the 50-50 partnership Pemex has with Shell in the Deer Park refinery in Texas, something it could not do in Mexico under current laws.
Even that would need a shift in public opinion here.
"How do we adapt society to the new reality?," Mr. Calderon said. "How do we adapt Mexicans to the deficiencies we have? It's a new situation and it has to be explained to people."
With demand for natural gas, electricity and gasoline all set to rise as much as 5 percent a year, according to government estimates, Mexico will increasingly have to import much of its energy from the United States unless he can succeed.
"The reforms in the energy sector," Mr. Calderon said, "could mean the difference between a developed Mexico and an undeveloped Mexico."

HEADLINE: Democratic Candidates Fix on Clark in Phoenix Debate 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the newest entrant into the Democratic presidential contest, was repeatedly upbraided by his rivals at a debate here on Thursday night for what they said was a muddled position on whether he would have supported the Congressional resolution granting President Bush the authority to invade Iraq.
 Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who until now had been the primary target of attacks from the other candidates, first noted that General Clark had advised a candidate for Congress last year to support the resolution and then appeared to change his view. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut followed up by saying he had been "disappointed" in General Clark and recited a litany of apparently alternating views. 
"The American people have lost confidence in George Bush because he hasn't leveled with them," Mr. Lieberman said. "We need a candidate who will meet the test of reaching a conclusion and have the courage to stick with it."
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts joined in, criticizing General Clark not only for his views on the war but also for appearing at a Republican fund-raiser in May 2001.
General Clark, who has soared to the top of some polls in his first three weeks as a candidate, responded by saying, "I'm not going to attack a fellow Democrat," then proceeded to deride everyone on the stage.
"I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership of this country," he said, "and can't get their own stories straight."
Clarifying his position, General Clark said: "I would have voted for a resolution that took the problem to the United Nations. I would not have voted for a resolution that would have taken us to war."
He added that he had praised President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain "for sticking with the offensive in Iraq once it had begun." But, he said, they did not send in enough forces, "there was not a plan to deal with it afterwards" and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was not an imminent threat.
Under fire at another point in the 90-minute debate, General Clark, who is retired from the Army, said, "People want straight talk and they want leadership."
He called on the candidates who are in Congress to stop President Bush's doctrine of pre-emption, warning that it could lead to even more explosive situations around the world. Stopping the doctrine, he said, could not wait until the 2004 election.
This debate, the second with General Clark, had several heated exchanges, and Dr. Dean did not escape unscathed. At one point, Judy Woodruff, the moderator, noted that Mr. Kerry's operatives were distributing material suggesting that Dr. Dean had tried to end prescription-drug coverage for the elderly. 
Dr. Dean said that was "silly," explaining that he had only threatened the Republican-controlled Vermont Legislature that the elderly would lose their prescription coverage if they did not pass a cigarette tax, which they eventually did.
Mr. Kerry said, "It's not silly, it's what he said."
The questioners from CNN, which sponsored the event at the Orpheum Theater, tried to delineate differences among the candidates, starting with questions to Senator John Edwards of North Carolina about whether his blue-collar roots, which he frequently invokes, made him a more legitimate candidate than blue bloods like Dr. Dean and Mr. Kerry.
"When I lay out a college-for-everyone plan, that's personal to me," Mr. Edwards said. "I was the first person in my family to go to college."
Mr. Kerry followed by citing a favorite personal detail. "When I was serving in Vietnam on a small boat, the one thing I learned was nobody asked you where you came from," he said. "You fought together, you lived together and you bled together."
Dr. Dean ignored the question of his background, saying that the important question was what kind of president each candidate would make, and then took another dig at General Clark for supporting the Iraq war resolution.
Much of the discussion -- and the answers -- concerned allegiance to the Democratic Party, highlighting General Clark's conversion on the road to announcing his presidential candidacy on Sept. 17.
In a nod to the rough treatment, Mr. Lieberman said, "The first thing I want to say, Wes Clark, is, welcome to the Democratic presidential campaign." 
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, citing the Clinton administration's economic policies, said, "If you want to live like a Republican, you've got to vote for the Democrats."
Dr. Dean repeated his contention that the Democratic Party had lost power because its leaders failed to stand up for the party's values. Both he and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who voted against the Iraq war resolution, blamed the others on the stage for giving President Bush unchecked power.
"The problem is that we empowered the president to run roughshod over us in the last election because nobody stood up to him on the October vote," Dr. Dean said.
Later, he added, "The minute you're willing to say whatever it is to get elected, you lose, because the people in America are not nearly as dumb as the people in Washington think we are."
Referring to Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Kucinich said, "The reason why people don't trust the Democrats is because our Democratic leadership stood with the president in the Rose Garden, and now stands on this stage and attacks him on the war."
The sniping prompted the Rev. Al Sharpton to refer to the election victory of Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday. "We are 48 hours away from watching an actor that couldn't win an Oscar win to be the governor of California," Mr. Sharpton said. "We need to deal with how we beat George Bush in 2004."
After an hour of questioning by CNN correspondents, the candidates took off their jackets, several rolling up their sleeves, and took questions from undecided voters in the first three rows. One was a soldier recently returned from Iraq. Another was a stroke survivor.
"Karen, how long have you been without any kind of coverage for your prescription drugs?" Mr. Edwards asked Karen Dickinson, the stroke victim, who said she had to choose food over drugs for six months.
Responding to the soldier's questions, several of the candidates promised to improve health care for veterans and housing and pay for enlisted personnel.
"Every single one of us up here would believe we're tired of hearing Tom DeLay and Dick Cheney and others throw patriotism at us," Mr. Kerry said. "We're taking back the flag for the United States of America."

HEADLINE: Bush Vows to Stay Course on Policies 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Oct. 9 

 BODY:
Returning to a state where he lost the last primary but went on to eke out a victory in the general election, President Bush on Thursday engaged in his most overt campaigning yet for a second term and said he would stick to the course he had set despite mounting criticism of his foreign and economic policies.
 In a retooled and more assertive stump speech, Mr. Bush struck a theme sure to be central to his reelection effort: that he had acted aggressively both to ensure national security and restore prosperity. 
 His two appearances here were focused primarily on countering assertions by Democrats that he had exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and underestimated the difficulties the United Stated would face after a war in Iraq. 
"There is only one decent and humane reaction to the fall of Saddam Hussein: Good riddance," Mr. Bush told a cheering crowd of military reservists and their families in Portsmouth.
But in a state that, like many others, has suffered a loss of jobs since Mr. Bush took office, he also cited signs that the economy was bouncing back, and he credited his push for big tax cuts with fueling the recovery.
"We've been through a lot," he said. "But we acted. We led."
The trip here, to the state that will hold the first presidential primary next year, on Jan. 27, was officially nonpartisan. But the visit, Mr. Bush's first here in almost a year and the first since the 2004 campaign unofficially began, was suffused with political overtones. 
Mr. Bush even swooped down from the commanding presidential heights usually staked out by incumbents to engage in some of the one-on-one campaigning that is all but mandatory in New Hampshire. As his motorcade roared into downtown Manchester around lunchtime, he stopped at a pizza place.
Campaigning like one of the nine Democrats who are seeking his job -- all of whom were in Arizona on Thursday for a debate -- he ran inside to chat with diners and employees, help serve a hamburger with fries and order a slice to go.
But the contrasts to his travels here four years ago were stark. During this month in 1999, Mr. Bush was competing for votes, media attention and campaign contributions with five other Republican candidates, one of whom, Senator John McCain of Arizona, beat him in the primary. 
This time he arrived on Air Force One, facing no primary challenge and well on his way to amassing $170 million or more in campaign contributions that he can put toward an advertising onslaught likely to begin early next year. Although his central political goal was to shore up support in New Hampshire, where he beat Al Gore by only 7,211 votes in 2000, it also amounted to an incursion into the home turf of two of his leading Democratic rivals, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
With the presidential campaign heating up, Mr. Bush's broad message was that he had set the nation on a particular course and did not intend to embark on a new one in response to his declining poll numbers or what his critics say is a lack of results at home and abroad.
"When you become the president, you cannot predict all the challenges that will come," Mr. Bush said. "But you do know the principles that you bring to the office, and they should not change with time or with polls."
The White House had billed the speeches here as part of an intensified effort to build support for Mr. Bush's policy in Iraq. The substance of his message was little changed from the speeches he has been giving for months. But the language was more direct and often folksier and was clearly intended to help break through what Mr. Bush has characterized as the "filter" imposed by the news media.
"I acted because I was not about to leave the security of the American people in the hands of a madman," Mr. Bush said in his appearance at the Pease Air National Guard Base in Portsmouth. "I was not about to stand by and wait and trust in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein."
He sought to frame the debate over the war as centered not so much on Iraq's possession of banned weapons or on whether he had planned adequately for what would happen after a conflict, but on whether the world was better off without Mr. Hussein running Iraq.
"Who can possibly think that the world would be better off with Saddam Hussein still in power?" Mr. Bush said.
The United States, Mr. Bush said, "is approaching a choice" about how to proceed in the campaign against terrorism, driven by a temptation to assume the danger made real by the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, had passed. Even as he acknowledged that it would take time, he urged sticking with "an orderly plan" to reach the goal of an Iraq that "will no longer be a threat to the Middle East or the United States" and that is built on democratic institutions that can "stand the test of time."
Failing to continue acting aggressively, he suggested, would be the wrong course.
"America cannot retreat from our responsibilities and hope for the best," he said. "Our security will not be gained by timid measures."
From New Hampshire, Mr. Bush flew on to Lexington, Ky., where he attended a fund-raiser for Representative Ernie Fletcher, a Republican who is in a tight race for governor.

HEADLINE: Audit Faults Past Spending At City Agency 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
A quasi-public city agency has been used to pay for everything from sport utility vehicles for top city officials to $6,000 in ceremonial keys to the city for athletes, according to an audit released yesterday.
 The expenses came to light yesterday when the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., released the audit of the Economic Development Corporation, a public benefit corporation that tries to keep jobs in New York City and foster business development. The corporation raises money by selling and leasing city-owned properties. 
 All told, the audit lists $288,405 worth of expenses as questionable -- a small amount given the city's roughly $44 billion budget. But it raised new questions about the city's and the state's reliance on public benefit corporations and public authorities, the agencies that were created to do the work of government with public money but with less government oversight than a city agency. 
Mr. Thompson's audit does not accuse anyone of walking away with the corporation's money. But it examined what the corporation spent during the last year and a half of the Giuliani administration and the first six months of the Bloomberg administration. It found that the corporation had picked up the tab for $30,000 in hats and jackets bearing the city's logo, a $5,200 alarm system for the mayor's office and a $1,123 trip to Las Vegas.
The comptroller said that it appeared that the corporation had been used to buy things that the mayor's office did not want to count against its own budget. "It's a way of being able to say that gee, you didn't expend the dollars yourself," he said.
Among the expenses cited are the cost of ceremonial keys to the city that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani used to give to celebrities. The keys cost $60 each, the audit found.
The Economic Development Corporation also paid for three Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicles to ferry senior Bloomberg administration officials around town, at a total cost of $130,000.
The audit also found that the corporation footed the bills last year for going-away parties for two of its former top officials: $7,000 on one for Catherine Giuliani, a cousin of Mr. Giuliani who was the chief of staff, and $11,222 on one for Michael Carey, a son of former Gov. Hugh L. Carey who was the corporation's president.
"If it is an agency that is supposed to generate business development for New York, it should be doing that," Mr. Thompson told reporters after releasing the audit, "and not in fact providing luxury trips and parties for other people." 
The audit comes as similar questions are being raised about other public corporations and authorities. Russell A. Harding, who was the president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation, is facing criminal charges that he used the agency's money to pay for vacation travel, gifts, parties for friends, and other personal expenses. And the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was accused this year of misleading the public about the state of its finances when it raised fares.
The comptroller's audit covered the two-year period from July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2002. Bloomberg administration officials said that while the expenses for the parties and the Tahoes were incurred on their watch, they had simply been following the practices of the Giuliani administration, and they said that since then, they had changed those policies.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that his office would no longer get the development corporation to pay for its vehicles. "When we first came in, one of the staffers followed a procedure that apparently had been in place for a long time," he said at a news conference in the Bronx, "where automobiles for the mayor's staff were acquired through E.D.C. After that came to our attention, we stopped that practice."
The Tahoes are used by Deputy Mayor Marc V. Shaw; Peter Madonia, the mayor's chief of staff, and Jonathan Greenspun, the commissioner of the mayor's Community Assistance Unit. 
A city official said Mr. Bloomberg had shrunk the size of mayor's fleet by 37 percent. The official said that under the Giuliani administration, the development corporation bought at least 11 cars for the mayor's office. A spokesman for Mr. Giuliani declined to comment. Michael Carey, who left the corporation to become a special assistant to Mr. Bloomberg, and then left government for a law firm, did not return a call for comment yesterday afternoon. 
Andrew M. Alper, who became president of the corporation in February 2002 -- after the going-away party for Ms. Giuliani but before the one for Mr. Carey -- said that he changed corporation policy months ago to limit party expenses to $200 per event.
Mr. Alper said that the agency did not agree with all of the comptroller's findings -- it does not even agree with Mr. Thompson on how much money the corporation transmits to the city each year, he said -- but added that he had already changed several policies since taking office.
"We are trying to be totally open, transparent," he said. "We want to make sure everything's done with an eye towards return on investment. And it's also a different economy that we're in, frankly. We're in tough times and I want to make sure that we really look at every dollar we spend, to make sure it goes to the public's benefit." 
The audit put Mayor Bloomberg in an awkward position. While city officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the Giuliani administration and the fog of the transition were to blame for many of the expenditures, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Giuliani have a sort of nonaggression pact between them. So while Mr. Bloomberg sometimes seemed tempted to blame his predecessor, he stopped short of doing so. 
"There were a lot of things that were done in the past with E.D.C. that now are just -- things are different," he said. "We have a different set of policies."

HEADLINE: A Market Revival, and Less Turmoil, at American Air 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
Gerard J. Arpey has been gliding through a long, sweet honeymoon. In the six months since he became chief executive of the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, the company has quelled a worker revolt, sharply cut operating expenses and bolstered cash reserves.
 Instead of worrying about the airline filing for bankruptcy, investors now expect that it could come close to a profit in the third quarter, recently ended. And since late March, its stock price has skyrocketed, rising more than eightfold. 
 But while many people in and outside the company acknowledge that American is in much better shape now than it was in the spring, they cannot agree on whether Mr. Arpey is responsible. And the true test is still to come, when he has to confront the traditionally slow winter travel season and the company's huge pension deficit. 
"They say luck is 90 percent of your career," said Raymond E. Neidl, an analyst at Blaylock & Partners, an investment bank in New York. "He came in just at the right point, just at the very low point, at the end of the Iraq war and at the bottom of the economy. It's easy to make a reputation in an up market rather than a down market."
Certainly, American, the world's largest airline, is a different beast from what it was when Mr. Arpey took over the top job from Donald J. Carty. It has reversed course and is now offering less legroom in coach on many flights. It will soon route fewer flights through St. Louis. And it has begun selling food at some gates at three airports.
Employees are cashing smaller paychecks -- if they avoided the several rounds of layoffs that have reduced American's work force by about 10,000, from 109,000 at the end of March.
And investors are rejoicing at the surge in the value of the shares, which closed at $14.85 yesterday, up $1.50, and way above a price of $1.58 late in March. Some analysts are again recommending purchase of AMR shares -- something unthinkable a half-year ago.
It is evident that the single biggest factor contributing to American's resurgence are the $1.8 billion a year in labor cost cuts that took effect on May 1. Those cuts, though, were won by Mr. Carty, even if he almost scuttled the deal by not telling the unions during negotiations that the board had approved retention bonuses for senior executives and that the company had made a large payment to an executive pension fund. The uproar that followed led to Mr. Carty's resignation in April.
Lower costs, including $2.2 billion in annual savings beyond the labor deals, and the improving economy have given Mr. Arpey some breathing room. But he faces significant problems, several experts say. The most pressing are the continued reluctance of business travelers to pay high last-minute fares and a substantial shortfall in the company pension plan. Mr. Arpey has yet to address either problem in any broad manner, the experts said.
Mr. Arpey, as is his custom, declined to be interviewed for this article. A spokesman said he wanted to wait until AMR's third-quarter conference call on Oct. 22 to talk to reporters.
The most prominent initiatives Mr. Arpey has pushed through so far have been repudiations of Mr. Carty's treasured ideas. This month, for example, the airline is adding two rows of seats to economy class in almost a quarter of its aircraft, generally those on routes popular with leisure travelers. This change, which will squeeze legroom by several inches, acknowledges that Mr. Carty's "more room in coach" marketing campaign -- where coach seats were removed in all planes -- failed to generate revenue.
Dan Garton, executive vice president for marketing, said American had no plans right now to add seats back on the rest of the fleet. But industry experts said they thought that the airline was almost certain to pare legroom in all its planes.
"Carty, I like as a friend, but he made some critical errors," said Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington University. "I kind of see Arpey as someone who wouldn't have made these mistakes, who's perfectly willing to make a very tough decision and do it quickly. Everything that's going on right now is a correction of something that was done wrong previously."
Travelers, especially those who fly a lot for business, are not likely to welcome Mr. Arpey's move. But Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, a fliers' advocacy group, said the removal of the extra legroom was probably necessary, given the two-year slump in air travel.
Mr. Arpey's other prominent initiative has been to reduce operations at a St. Louis hub that American acquired in its buyout of T.W.A. in 2001. During the acquisition, American indicated that T.W.A.'s home base in St. Louis would continue to serve as a hub. But in July, the company said it would route most of the St. Louis connecting flights through Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth, cut half of the 420 daily flights from St. Louis, close a ticket office in the city and eliminate more than 2,100 jobs. The new flight schedules will take effect on Nov. 1.
American has also begun selling food at the gates of some airports rather than give away hot food on board, as it did before the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. At Kennedy International Airport, for example, it offers a full breakfast for $7 and a roast beef sandwich or a salad for $10. The concessionaire keeps all the revenue, but American hopes that the service will build loyalty among its passengers. It is too soon to tell whether the food sales have made any difference. 
Some of Mr. Arpey's changes are not evident to passengers. He is, for example, more of a team builder than previous chief executives, said David L. Boren, a board member and president of the University of Oklahoma. At a recent board meeting, Mr. Arpey brought along half a dozen other senior executives to give a slide presentation of a new business strategy and invited them to expound on the ideas -- something that happened rarely under Mr. Carty, who preferred to give presentations alone. "It's an approach that really invites the management team and the board to openly share thoughts and ideas, and it's very refreshing," said Mr. Boren, who was the only director to publicly call for the resignation of Mr. Carty in April.
"What I see as a board member is more strategic thinking about the future going on from the leadership than we've seen in recent years," he added. "Some of the strategic thinking, trying to blend practices of low-cost carriers while maintaining our service niche, is much more creative than in the past."
Trying to lead by example, Mr. Arpey said at the annual shareholders' meeting in May that he would not take a salary increase or stock awards this year despite his promotion from chief operating officer. Still, he has come in for some criticism from labor unions.
The Transport Workers Union, which represents mechanics and other ground workers, urged its members last month to bombard Mr. Arpey's office with e-mail messages asking him not to close any of American's maintenance bases. The company had said it was adding work at its base in Tulsa, Okla., but is still trying to decide what to do with those in Fort Worth and Kansas City, Mo.
George Price, a spokesman for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said the union has asked American to give cabin crew members longer breaks between flights. The union had agreed to a shorter minimum rest period in the concessions, helping American squeeze more work from each attendant, he said, but many flight attendants found themselves worn out. American will recall 390 attendants as it increases flights, Bloomberg News reported, quoting a recorded message from the union to members. 
Mr. Price did praise Mr. Arpey for agreeing to have senior executives meet regularly with union leaders, something he said did not occur under Mr. Carty. 
Some industry experts said Mr. Arpey could have moved quickly over the summer to wring out more productivity changes from labor and from other parts of the company, but failed to do so. An industry consultant, Robert W. Mann, of Port Washington, N.Y., said Mr. Arpey should have figured out months ago how to cut back on the maintenance bases.
Looming even larger are the challenges of dealing with the airline's complex fare structure and its big pension debt. Recent surveys show that businesses are still unwilling to spend as much as they did on air fare in the late 90's boom. Business travelers have taken to low-cost carriers in droves because their fares are simpler and their last-minute tickets less costly. Mr. Garton, the marketing executive, said American was very aware of the threat from low-cost rivals and was investigating whether "there are different pricing regimes that will improve revenue."
Like other airlines, American is grappling with an underfunded pension plan. In July, the company reported that its pension liability as of late April was $8.345 billion and that it did not have funds to cover 36 percent of that -- a gap of more about $3 billion. The surge in its stock price in the last two quarters will have narrowed the gap somewhat. The company has also said it would pay $120 million to the pension plan in the third quarter, and $500 million to $700 million in 2004.
But those payments will drain cash, and besides pension expenses the company will have about $760 million in debt due next year. In mid-July, it reported $2.7 billion in cash. Last month, it raised $300 million through a convertible-bond offering.
"I would point to looming cash obligations as a source of continuing concern for the company," said William T. Warlick, of Fitch Ratings. The pension liability, he said, is "a serious problem -- not as serious as some of the other airlines, but definitely something worth flagging."

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
A Soviet Victim Works to Shape a New Russia

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
ELENA NEMIROVSKAYA had a lot of reasons to hate the Soviet Union. It sent her father to a labor camp and forced her mother, an enemy of the state by association, out of her factory job. She survived, in part, by sewing mittens. It mangled her young daughter's health. It terrorized her husband with interrogations. 
 She emerged from Soviet life filled not with hate, but with a ferocious desire to tear the Soviet heart out of the new Russia. Ms. Nemirovskaya, a former art historian, chose to take on one of Russian society's biggest post-Soviet deficiencies: its lack of civic life. 
 "Russians have no feeling or trust for public spaces," she said in a recent conversation. "The Soviet system did not allow real public discussion. Public space was filled with artificial political slogans no one believed. The problem is very deep." 
Soon after she stood outside Russia's government building during a coup against Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1991, one of thousands of Moscow citizens who rushed to protect it as part of a human shield, the idea came to her. She would start a school to teach Russians about public spiritedness and democracy.
She wanted Russia to have block associations, co-op boards and activist groups. She wanted Russians to trust one another outside the bounds of their own families and friends. The lack of public trust was a legacy from Soviet times, when everything from labor unions to women's rights groups were simply platforms for the Communist Party.
With a grant from the Council of Europe, which champions human rights, she started the Moscow School of Political Studies in a complex that in Soviet times was the meeting place for trade unions. Her first class, in 1993, had 25 people. (She has 100 now.) Students are primarily elected officials from Russia's regions, but also include business people, the treasurer in Russia's Ministry of Finance, a speechwriter for President Vladimir V. Putin. 
The aim was to expose the young, emerging elite to Western ideas to encourage a clean, uncynical approach to politics. In short courses and seminars, students talk with speakers like Richard Pipes, a Harvard professor of Russian history, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, former United States national security adviser. 
The school set an age limit for students -- no older than 35 -- so the ideas would fall on flexible minds. Courses, financed by European and American grants, and by money from the American billionaire George Soros -- are free.
"The question is how to make democracy work here, how to make government modern," said Ms. Nemirovskaya, between swallows of cold beet soup in her school's cafeteria. "These are not abstract questions. Living in freedom means risk and responsibility. People need to begin with themselves. To understand that they can't just wait for the state to take care of them."
BORN in 1939, during Stalin's worst terror, Ms. Nemirovskaya knew the cruelties of the Soviet system firsthand. She was the only child of an airplane factory economic planner and a civil engineer. Her father and uncle were sent to a prison camp in the late 1940's. Her mother, as the wife of a political prisoner, was fired from her factory job and forced to forage for odd jobs to survive. 
"You feel totally unprotected, without any rights at all," said Ms. Nemirovskaya, describing the feeling of being a Soviet citizen. "You're humiliated and put down. It's like an uncontrollable force of nature. You can only step back or burn up. And then a very disgusting feeling emerges. It's called fear. That was the Soviet regime."
In 1978, Ms. Nemirovskaya faced another trial: her daughter Tatyana was mistreated with a hormone that caused her to lose the ability to walk for five months. Hospital managers refused to say which treatment had been used. Italian friends later helped Tatyana to Italy. Her mother, however, was not allowed to leave Russia, and did not see her daughter -- who now lives in England, in weak health -- for nine years. "In the Soviet health care system, doctors could never acknowledge they had prescribed the wrong treatment," she said. "Mistakes just did not happen. We could not talk about it to anyone or consult other doctors. It was terrible."
"They weren't bad people," she said of the doctors, "but they killed something."
WHEN the Soviet Union fell, Ms. Nemirovskaya was glad to leave behind hollow-sounding slogans and secrets. But the initial euphoria evaporated quickly. A deep cynicism set in as economic chaos battered society. Communism, the all-consuming ideology force-fed for decades, dissolved, leaving confusion and disorientation in its wake.
The cynicism, in turn, has stunted democracy. One student, Irina Serbina, a journalist from the Kemerovo region in Siberia, where a dictatorial governor and a handful of aluminum barons rule supreme, said her once active friends and neighbors had given up on politics, put off by the rampant corruption and growing feeling of powerlessness. 
"Why do we have such a terrible situation in Kemerovo?" Ms. Serbina mused during a coffee break at a school session. "Everyone is afraid. They don't think they can change anything. So they take what they can get. They'll do anything for an extra loaf of bread."
The 5,200 former students have created a network across Russia of people who think honesty in government is important, Ms. Serbina said. Students find like-minded people for help in their own regions; when Russian tycoons began buying property in Kemerovo, Ms. Serbina called a former student in the tycoons' home region to ask if they could be trusted.
"I go home and everyone there plays by bandit rules," she said. "I don't want to live that way. The school helps me keep going. It's not an ideology, it's really more like a spirit."
The problem with Russia today, she says, is that its institutions, court system, police force and Parliament are still extremely weak. While an American accused of a crime can be relatively sure of a fair trial, in Russia the accused is usually sure only that the judge is highly susceptible to pressure from the local governor or tycoon.
"In Russia, the presidency and the Parliament are not institutions," she said over tea in her rambling apartment in central Moscow on a recent Sunday. "They are personalities. They can be manipulated or act irrationally, and there are no checks and balances."
Ms. Nemirovskaya, 63, acknowledges sheepishly that when school is not in session, her preferred activity is getting her nails and hair done at a beauty parlor. She still lives in the apartment her parents occupied in Soviet times. Her grandmother's furniture -- a bed, an ornate oval table -- give some rooms a prerevolutionary feel.
Still, Ms. Nemirovskaya sees gradual improvements. Russians, especially young people, are slowly warming to democracy. Year after year, students stream in.
"It's just the beginning, but we're moving forward," she said. "We're starting to be part of the rest of the world. In two or three generations, Russia will be much more developed."
"Each year," she added, "is a very important year."

HEADLINE: FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; 
Tapestry of a Family and Its Home State

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
To describe Ross McElwee's documentary film "Bright Leaves" as a study of the tobacco industry in his native state of North Carolina would be a little like calling a Virginia Woolf novel a manual of etiquette. By the end of this reflective, wise, often hilarious movie, you feel as though he has slapped a huge chunk of raw, palpitating life onto the screen.
 Birth, death, illness, family and social history, childhood and old age, moviemaking, geography and commerce are among the topics Mr. McElwee weaves into a dense but surprisingly orderly bundle of information, memory and conjecture. As a photographer, he has a knack for studying a weather-beaten face and instantly discovering the soul inside. Whether he's recording a family gathering, contemplating the beauty of the coastline and his young son happily frolicking in the surf, or surveying a tobacco field, Mr. McElwee conveys a sensuous appreciation of life. 
 Mr. McElwee, who has made seven feature-length documentaries, is really an American humorist in a tradition that extends from Mark Twain through Garrison Keillor. Narrating the movie in the laid-back drawl of an affable Southern storyteller, he turns personal experience into a speculative personal mythology that is meant to be taken with a big grain of salt.
The filmmaker is continually connecting the past and present, meditating on what film can and cannot capture of experience, and on the relationship between family history and his own personal changes. Family members (alive and dead and at various ages) and friends appear in vintage clips like vivid flashes of recollection.
Like an expert yarn-spinner, Mr. McElwee practices a kind of narrative sleight of hand. Although he pretends to be a modest, nearly invisible observer of the life around him, he also plays God by turning his experience of the world into an unfolding home movie. Even when he can't discern direct connections between seemingly random phenomena, he is more than happy to invent them just to fill out the structure.
The quest he undertakes in "Bright Leaves" is rooted (as his movies often are) in his own family background. His great-grandfather was a tobacco king who created the brand known as Bull Durham, then lost his fortune to a rival clan, the Dukes, who became North Carolina royalty. Through a cousin who collects vintage films and movie memorabilia, he becomes fixated on a 1950 black-and-white melodrama, "Bright Leaf," about the tobacco wars of the late 19th century, starring Gary Cooper, Lauren Bacall and Patricia Neal.
McElwee family lore has it that the movie, directed by Michael Curtiz and adapted from a novel by Foster Fitz-Simons, is the story of his great-grandfather. And it prompts Mr. McElwee to embark on an eccentric quest to document the connection. He obsessively reruns the movie and interviews a film scholar, Vlada Petric, along with Ms. Neal and the original novelist's widow.
But that search is only the spine of a movie that also explores the history and mystique of tobacco, incorporating interviews with smokers of every stripe, from teenagers to dying cancer patients. Mr. McElwee comes from a family of doctors who have treated countless patients for smoking-related illnesses. Some of the film's most sobering moments are Mr. McElwee's uneasy reflections on tobacco as a killer versus its beauty as a plant and its vital role in the economy of North Carolina.
He visits a museum devoted to tobacco and learns that it was the Duke clan's refinement of a cigarette rolling machine that may have given it the decisive advantage over his great-grandfather. Late in the movie, he attends the 50th annual North Carolina Tobacco Festival, which, because of the bad reputation tobacco has accrued, is about to change its name to the blander Farmers Day Parade.
Because the movie, which the New York Film Festival is screening tomorrow evening, is not a screed against tobacco, some may find it irresponsible for soft pedaling a life-and-death issue. In any case, "Bright Leaves" leaves you feeling invigorated by the boundless curiosity, humor and high spirits of its creator.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Taking a Breather, Shares Close Virtually Unchanged

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks finished virtually unchanged yesterday as investors mulled a profit warning by General Electric and avoided major bets a day after indexes reached new 52-week highs. The three main gauges posted weekly gains.
 Trading was light as many investors took the day off ahead of Columbus Day on Monday, when the bond market will be closed. The stock market will be open. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 9,674.68. The Dow's 49-point advance Thursday took the average to its highest close since June 18, 2002.
Other indexes ended mixed. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 3.41 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,915.31 -- its highest level since March 11, 2002. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.67 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,038.06.
For the week, all three main gauges finished higher, with the Dow up 1.1 percent, the Nasdaq rising 1.9 percent and the S.& P. up 0.8 percent. It was the third winning week in four.
Analysts said the market was catching its breath after the recent run-up in stock prices.
"We've had a pretty good surge, actually quite an impressive surge," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist for Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn. "Once you punch out to new record highs you're vulnerable to pulling back, consolidation and taking a little bit of a rest."
The leveling in stocks coincided with the release of two reports on the economy.
The Commerce Department said that the trade deficit declined to $39.21 billion in August, the smallest gap in six months, as imports of cars and oil fell. Analysts were expecting a wider deficit.
The Labor Department reported that prices at the wholesale level in September rose 0.3 percent, which was higher than expectations. 
Positive financial data, from government reports to third-quarter earnings results, have lifted stock prices this week, but analysts say investors remain cautious as they look for further evidence that the economic recovery can be sustained.
Russ Koesterich, a strategist at State Street in Boston, said investors were hesitant to put money in stocks until more companies had reported third-quarter earnings and updated their outlooks for the rest of the year.
"We're caught in a tight range today," Mr. Koesterich said. "There was a lot of disappointment that we couldn't hold on to gains yesterday following positive job numbers and results from Yahoo."
G.E. declined 81 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $29.32 after it reported third-quarter results that were in line with expectations, but said that full-year earnings would be $1.55 to $1.57, the lowest range of analysts' estimates. 
G.E. also announced plans to buy Amersham of Britain for $9.5 billion in stock. The American depository receipts of Amersham climbed $8.33, or 15.1 percent, to $63.40.
JetBlue Airways fell $2.75, or 3.9 percent, to $67.51, after UBS cut its rating to reduce from neutral.
Computer Associates International fell $2.45, or 9.4 percent, to $23.50, a day after it forced out three executives, including its chief financial officer, after a review of its accounting practices.
The price of Treasuries rose yesterday.
The 10-year Treasury note gained 11/32, to a price of 99 31/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 4.26 percent from 4.3 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 17/32, to 102 27/32. The bond's yield declined to 5.18 percent from 5.22 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Drop in Car and Oil Imports Aided August Trade Deficit 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit declined to $39.21 billion in August, the smallest gap in six months, reflecting a big drop in imports of cars and foreign oil, the Commerce Department reported Friday. 
 America's trade deficit with China, however, surged to a record. 
 The Commerce Department reported that the August deficit was 2.1 percent lower than a revised July imbalance of $40.03 billion. That caught analysts by surprise because they had been forecasting the deficit would widen in August. 
The improvement reflected big declines in imports of cars, auto parts and oil, which helped to offset a smaller drop in United States exports. That was a result of a big plunge in shipments of civilian aircraft. 
The decline in August represented the fifth consecutive month that the country's trade deficit has improved after hitting a record monthly high of $42.98 billion in March. Even with the string of declining deficits, the overall imbalance through the first eight months of this year is running at an annual rate of $433 billion, which would surpass last year's record of $418.04 billion. 
In a second report Friday, the Labor Department reported that inflation at the wholesale level rose by a higher-than-expected 0.3 percent in September, after an increase of 0.4 percent in the Producer Price Index in August. 
Last month's rise in the index, which measures price pressures before they reach the consumer, was led by a 2.3 percent jump in food prices, the biggest increase in eight months. This reflected big increases in the costs of many fresh vegetables, including broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce and squash. 
Energy prices, which had soared 1.2 percent in August, posted a tiny 0.1 percent increase in September. Gasoline costs were up 2.2 percent last month after rising 6.3 percent in August. 
Outside the volatile food and energy areas, the so-called core rate of wholesale inflation was unchanged last month. 
"If you take out food and energy, wholesale prices are up just 0.1 percent from a year ago," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. "That's about as close to price stability as you can get," 
The $824 million decline in the overall trade deficit reflected a 2.7 percent drop in United States exports, a sign of weakness in many of America's major export markets. 
Imports, which had hit a monthly record in July, retreated 2.5 percent in August, to $122.9 billion.
For August, the trade deficit with China rose 3.2 percent, to a monthly record of $11.7 billion. For the year, the deficit with China is running 22 percent higher than last year's record imbalance of $103 billion. Since 2000, the biggest deficits have been with China. For decades before that, the biggest deficits were with Japan, but the imbalance with Japan actually shrank by 18.2 percent in August, to $4.84 billion.

In Tokyo, More Steps Toward Fixing the Economy

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Japan announced some steps to address several of its economic and financial problems on Friday when the Bank of Japan agreed to pump more money into the economy and one of the country's largest banks, under pressure from regulators, disclosed the full extent of its bad-loan problems.
 The decisions, incremental as they were, suggest that policy makers are more squarely confronting the ills that plague the economy. The steps also suggest that lawmakers are trying to assure investors they are doing everything they can to keep the current recovery from losing steam. 
 After a two-day meeting, the Bank of Japan's policy board raised the amount of money it can pump into the markets, to 32 trillion yen ($293 billion) from 30 trillion yen, an effort to help the economy by damping rising interest rates and the yen. A weaker yen could erase worries that Japan's recovery is in danger of stalling and help Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who on Friday dissolved Parliament and called for elections next month. 
Mr. Koizumi has also pledged to clean up the troubled banking system. In May, the government effectively nationalized the fifth-largest lender, Resona Holdings, which had dangerously low capital. On Friday, the bank said it would probably lose 1.76 trillion yen ($16 billion) in the half- year ended Sept. 30 as it writes off more problem loans.
The loss is equal to about 90 percent of the emergency funds the government pumped into the bank earlier this year. Thanks to the government's bailout and the bank's aggressive write-offs, Resona can more quickly return to health. With the government's finances stretched, though, much of the burden of reviving the economy has fallen to the Bank of Japan, which, in theory, has limitless resources to print money. Financial authorities have intervened in the foreign exchange markets to increase exports by trying to reverse the yen's nearly 10 percent rise against the dollar since August.
That direct strategy has angered Japan's major trading partners, who are under pressure to weaken their own currencies and placate manufacturers in their countries. By flooding the economy with extra money, the Bank of Japan's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, may weaken the yen and remove the need to intervene directly in the financial markets, where the authorities have spent an estimated 13 trillion yen buying dollars this year.
"This was the Bank of Japan's alibi to stop the rise of the yen," Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, said of the bank's actions. "Fukui is trying to head off pressure from politicians and the Finance Ministry to do more to weaken the yen."
The bank's action, which was not entirely unexpected, comes a week ahead of a visit to Japan by President Bush. When he visits Tokyo starting Oct. 17, Mr. Bush is likely to reiterate his opposition to Japan's intervention in foreign exchange markets to weaken the yen and bolster its exports.
In addition to pumping more money into the economy, the central bank's policy board also said that it would keep pushing short-term interest rates to zero until consumer prices either stopped falling or started rising. The renewed commitment was also designed to allay fears that the Bank of Japan was halfhearted about addressing the yen's rise and the deflation it creates. 
"Financial markets do not view the B.O.J.'s claim to be fighting deflation as credible," Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Securities in Tokyo, said of the new move. "With the yen breaking through 110 to the dollar, so far it is not having much success."
Mr. Fukui couched the move in terms of ensuring that the recovery continued to gather momentum. But he said that "the yen's rise will pose a strong risk" to the recovery, which is currently being led by the nation's biggest exporters. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said Friday that 80 percent of manufacturers in a survey this month said that if the yen remained at its current value into next year it would hurt their profits, according to a report on the Nikkei news service.
Still, many analysts do not believe that adding a few more trillion yen to the money markets will do much for growth or to reverse the yen's rise.
Indeed, the 2 trillion yen rise in the central bank's new liquidity target is less than half the 4.5 trillion yen the bank spent in September trying to stunt the yen's strength. Investors saw Friday's announcement as a symbolic act that telegraphed the Bank of Japan's thinking, but one that did not back up that thinking with substantive cash ahead of Mr. Bush's visit.
The yen weakened slightly after the central bank's policy change was made public, but quickly resumed its upward trend. After the announcement, the dollar fell, touching 108.28 yen, a three-year low. It closed in New York at 108.51.
One reason the yen has strengthened so quickly in the last three months is that the economy has gathered steam. Growth in Japan's economy outpaced that of the United States in the second quarter, surprising many investors.
Japanese stocks have also received a boost from the government's bailout of Resona in May. The decision signaled that lawmakers would act to keep the financial industry from collapsing. As part of the clean-up effort, the government has pushed Resona to clarify the full extent of its problems.
On Friday, Japan's chief banking regulator, Heizo Takenaka, said that Resona's stricter accounting methods and more forthcoming disclosure of its problems were a big first step toward repairing the bank's health. The bank said it planned to write off 1.26 trillion yen ($11.5 billion) in the first half of the fiscal year, more than eight times what was initially forecast.
The bank will post its final results for the first half some time in late November.

Carolyn G. Heilbrun, a retired Columbia University literary scholar whose extensive writings included pioneering books and essays in the feminist canon and a dozen highly erudite detective novels under the pseudonym Amanda Cross, died at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 77.
 Professor Heilbrun, who had written of taking her own life in a 1997 book, "The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty," committed suicide, said her son, Robert. She had not been ill, he noted yesterday. "She wanted to control her destiny," he said, "and she felt her life was a journey that had concluded." 
 Aside from serving as an instructor at Brooklyn College in 1959-60 and as a visiting lecturer or professor at Yale, Princeton, Swarthmore and other colleges, Ms. Heilbrun spent her entire academic career at Columbia, joining the faculty in 1960 as an instructor of English and comparative literature and retiring in 1992 as the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities.
But she was best known as the author of nine scholarly books, including "Toward a Recognition of Androgyny," "Reinventing Womanhood" and "Writing a Woman's Life," and scores of articles that interpreted women's literature from a feminist perspective, and as the author of the Kate Fansler mysteries. Her heroine, like her creator, was a professor of literature and a feminist.
The novels were ostensibly murder mysteries whose amateur sleuth sometimes sought clues in literary texts and a killer's motives in academic politics. Most were well received by readers, but some critics said the plots were thin and the social commentary thick, and that the real subjects were women's changing social positions, relationships with one another and struggle for independence.
The books offered scathing depictions of academic backbiting, observations on Ivy League social pretensions and thinly veiled, unflattering portraits of Columbia colleagues, including one professor who seemed to have been modeled after the writer Lionel Trilling.
Some critics complained that satiric wit and clever talk filled half a book before the victim fell dead, and that some of it sounded like an imitation of Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw. But devotees said it was all good fun, and some compared her work to the cerebral puzzles of Dorothy L. Sayers.
Fearing that her mystery writing might be seen by colleagues as frivolous and might even jeopardize her chances for tenure, Ms. Heilbrun concealed the identity of Amanda Cross for six years. In 1964 her first novel, "In the Last Analysis," was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. "Winning would have blown my cover," she recalled.
But after the 1970 publication of "Poetic Justice," with its recognizable depiction of Columbia University's atmosphere after the student revolt of the late 1960's, Ms. Heilbrun's friends began to guess that she might be Amanda Cross, the author of three novels, including "The James Joyce Murder." Later novels included "Death in a Tenured Position," "No Word from Winifred" and "The Puzzled Heart."
Carolyn Gold Heilbrun was born on Jan. 13, 1926, in East Orange, N.J., the only child of Archibald Gold, an accountant, and Estelle Roemer Gold, who, her daughter would recall, "sat at home and was bored out of her mind." The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Heilbrun was 6, and she became a voracious reader, devouring Nancy Drew and Judy Bolton mysteries and, as a teenager, the novels of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather.
She graduated from private schools in New York and from Wellesley College in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in English. She was married in 1945 to James Heilbrun, a Harvard student who became a professor of economics at Fordham University. In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, and her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Margaret Heilbrun, of Brooklyn, and Emily Heilbrun, of Eugene, Ore., and two grandchildren.
Enrolling in graduate school at Columbia, Ms. Heilbrun received a master's degree in 1951 and a doctorate in 1959. Her first notable essay was "The Character of Hamlet's Mother," a 1957 article in Shakespeare Quarterly. It portrayed Gertrude as clever, not shallow, lucid rather than silly: ideas that were forerunners of feminism at the time, but hardly startling when the essay was reprinted in 1990 as part of "Hamlet's Mother and Other Women." 
On the Columbia faculty, Ms. Heilbrun rose through the ranks: assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1967, full professor with tenure in 1972, Avalon Professor in 1985. In 1986 she became the first director of the university's Institute for Research on Women and Gender, which promotes feminist scholarship.
Her academic specialty was British modern literature, roughly from 1890 to 1950, an era that included Yeats, Conrad and Eliot, with a particular focus on the Bloomsbury group, made up of Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster and other writers.
Although she was widely respected by feminist scholars, she complained when she retired that she was isolated by her male colleagues at Columbia. "When I spoke up for women's issues, I was made to feel unwelcome in my own department, kept off crucial committees, ridiculed, ignored," she told Anne Matthews in an interview for a New York Times Magazine article in 1992.
Throughout her academic career, and afterward, Ms. Heilbrun continued to write books and contribute articles to professional journals, newspapers and magazines. She wrote numerous book reviews and essays for Hers, a former column in The Times.
Her 1973 book, "Toward a Recognition of Androgyny: Aspects of Male and Female in Literature," brought her to prominence in the academic feminist movement. Rejecting traditional ideas of male and female and using examples from Greek literature, the Bible and other writings, she urged women to escape from what she called the prison of gender.
Ms. Heilbrun drew on her long interest in biography and autobiography for her 1988 book, "Writing a Woman's Life," her first best seller, which focused on women writing about themselves and other women. Even accomplished women, like Virginia Woolf and Eudora Welty, tended to judge themselves on how well they fulfilled traditional expectations, she concluded.

HEADLINE: Following New York Signs Is Long Way to Nowhere 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
The seasoned motorist or indefatigable road-tripper, even the operator of a taximeter cabriolet, must at some point face that dark, despairing moment of hapless reckoning, staring dumbfounded at some of New York City's street signs.
 The moment often comes when the time is wrong for contemplation, when the driver is late and harried and cursing at the windshield. But the motorist is not to blame. It is an open secret that many street signs here point to routes that are circuitous, confusing, counterintuitive, outdated, illegal or just plain strange. 
 There is, for instance, a sign on the northbound Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Brooklyn Bridge exit that says "Flushing Meadows Corona Park." Options for reaching that destination, where tennis players bring glory upon themselves in the United States Open and where the Mets also play, are paralyzingly numerous from this starting point. The choices include, among others, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and taking the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to connect with the Long Island Expressway, a roughly 12-mile, somewhat-less-than-direct jaunt. 
And because the choice is yours, the sign amounts to little more than a blithely encouraging reminder: You're in the right city, Pumpkin, just keep on driving.
The same can be said of the nearby sign marked "Yankee Stadium." This one points north. Now, it is an incontrovertible fact that Yankee Stadium is north of Lower Manhattan, but having absorbed that little piece of information, you would still have some navigating ahead of you. This sign seems to serve no purpose other than to be equitable to both baseball teams.
"To a New Yorker, you'll sit there and go, 'What is this about?' " said Thomas Cocola, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation. "But if you think about it from the perspective of a guy from New Jersey, or who is staying in a hotel in New Jersey and now is going to his first Yankee game, those signs are reassuring."
Reassuring though they may be to the Jersey Guy, the signs pointing to destinations miles away in other boroughs are not of much help. And besides, that explanation does not clear up the reason for all the signs that lead to dead ends or point in the opposite direction of the destinations they promise.
It certainly does not settle the question of why, again near the Brooklyn Bridge, some of the most thorough signage on this planet points the way to the Ari Halberstam Memorial Ramp, the piece of roadway named in memory of the young Hasidic student who was slain on the bridge in 1994. Some people believe that scientists will one day invent a supercomputer to estimate the number of signs marking the way to the Ari Halberstam Memorial Ramp. There may be people in far-flung countries who can recite flawless directions to the Ari Halberstam Memorial Ramp, so well marked is its approach.
These curiosities come to inhabit their lamppost perches by dint of good intentions tempered by negotiation and time. Of the hundreds of thousands of street signs in New York, there are close to 1,000 that are meant to point the way to stadiums and museums and the like, and scores more for hospitals, Mr. Cocola said.
These signs are known as trailblazers, a somewhat excessively macho term for the job performed even by the helpfully accurate ones.
People who study this issue (Yes, there are people who study this issue. Ah, New York.) say that the odd placement of these signs is in many cases a result of long chains of compromises between the places that wish to be found by drivers and the various city agencies charged with obliging them.
"You start thinking about the groups that have a claim to signage -- cultural institutions, hospitals -- and you're dealing with an agency that doesn't have the money or frankly the real estate to put up all the signs everyone wants," said John Kaehny, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for pedestrians and bicyclists. "The signs end up in some nonsensical places."
The city does have an official Policy and Guidelines statement for the posting of trailblazer signs. This states that such signs are installed "only if it is determined that the sign supplements the existing street information and diminishes uncertainty or confusion on the part of the driver." To explore the disconnect between that policy statement and the reality encountered every day by lost New York drivers, this newspaper attempted to travel to a variety of destinations in several boroughs, using only the trailblazer signs for guidance.
Supplied with a half tank of gas, sunglasses, a bag of beef jerky and enough Blow Pops to sustain a photographer and reporter who are no longer chain smokers through some frustrating driving, The New York Times set out for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, Fordham University in the Bronx and the Brooklyn Children's Museum and SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.
Readers get to come along -- spared, of course, the actual driving. It's for the best.
The journey to the Javits Center begins on Second Avenue at 57th Street, where a cheerful sign with a picture of an apple says Javits Center and points north. As Second Avenue is a one-way thoroughfare where traffic flows south, and as midday traffic would seem to promise a quick and painful death to anyone trying to follow that sign, you assume the sign has been turned by a vandal or the wind, and instead you head west on 57th Street.
There should be a left turn here somewhere. This is cheating, but you already know where the Javits Center is, at 34th Street and 11th Avenue, so you are looking for that next sign, one to point you a little ways downtown, but it never comes. By the time the West Side of Manhattan slopes down into the land of car dealerships, the Hudson River comes into view. Here your journey ends, because cars are expensive and you can't just go driving them into a river every time some sign tells you that the Javits Center is coming up.
To Fordham you go. Tooling up the Major Deegan Expressway, you are guided to Exit 11. This deposits you on Van Cortlandt Park South, where you are directed in a loop around the university.
This route seems strange, but a little patience bears out the sign hanger's intent. Had you left two exits earlier, you could have driven straight east on Fordham Road. Driving back to the expressway that way, though, the wisdom of this route becomes apparent. Fordham Road has lots of traffic lights, it is a busy pedestrian shopping district, and you can see things that might discomfit a nervous suburban parent, starting with funky stores like Liquer's and Millenium 2000 Jewelry and Bang Bang Leather.
These confusing sign-following experiences, though, pale next to the travails of navigating Brooklyn, where there is, in just one excruciating example, a tangled web of signs that could be called the Gowanus Expressway Overpass Trap.
Start at the intersection of McDonald Avenue and 20th Street, at the corner of Green-Wood Cemetery. Signs pointing down 20th Street promise to take you to the Brooklyn Children's Museum. But you pass Sixth and Seventh Avenues and never see a sign. You pass businesses that can build a skateboard ramp for you and places that can repair your forklift, but you do not see another sign for the museum, and your journey ends under the Gowanus Expressway.
A similar thing happens when you follow the sign on Coney Island Avenue near Caton Avenue for SUNY Downstate Medical Center. This one guides you into an endless loop. Deciding to maintain the direction that the sign indicates, you find yourself under the Gowanus Expressway, again. "God forbid you have an emergency and you're out in the middle of nowhere and you want to follow those little blue and white signs," said Mr. Cocola of the Transportation Department. SUNY Downstate Medical Center does exist, but if you can make it there, boys, you'll make it . . . oh, forget it.
Paul S. Pearson, a vice president of the Brooklyn Children's Museum, said that the museum's sign on 20th Street was intended to guide motorists leaving the Prospect Expressway to another set of signs for cultural institutions.
"That particular one is always a puzzling one," Mr. Pearson said.
Placing the signs, he said, was a $300,000 project that took four years, involved the Economic Development Commission and a design firm, and required approvals from the city's Parks Department, Department of Transportation and Art Commission, as well as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York City Transit and the office of the Brooklyn borough president.
"It seems fairly straightforward," Mr. Pearson said. "You pull out a map and say where you want to go. From there on out, it's a lot of negotiations and approvals."
There is another way, but this would probably lead to chaos if everyone tried it. A block from the sign for SUNY Downstate, at the corner of Coney Island Avenue and Caton Place, there is a piece of white cardboard, no bigger than a dish towel and fashioned into the shape of an arrow. It says "Calvary Cathedral of Praise."
Right down the block, just where the arrow says it will be, is a building marked "Calvary Cathedral of Praise." It's an unusual moment of absolute clarity.
"The people that really come out ahead," said Mr. Kaehny of Transportation Alternatives, "are the ones that make their own signs and put them up."

HEADLINE: Disclosing Pay Of Executives Often Leads To Raises 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
If, as expected, the latest disclosure of pay packages at the New York Stock Exchange leads to a reduction in compensation there, it may start a trend.
 Until now, disclosures about executive pay have largely had the opposite effect. Though shareholder advocates have often campaigned for disclosure, thinking that executives would be shamed by the airing of their excesses, pay has continued to rise. Disclosing pay has had the unintended consequence of creating a spiral driven upward by competition. 
 "The normal trend is the more that's out there about how much people get, the more they get," said Charles Elson, a professor at the University of Delaware's school of business and economics. "In a perverse way, disclosure has fueled this."
None of the changes that were expected to hold down executive pay have worked, Mr. Elson said. In the decade since public companies were required to tell shareholders more about how they paid their top officers, executive pay has risen rapidly, even in bear markets and often despite poor company performance.
Consider John Hancock Financial Services, the insurance company in Boston that was owned by its policyholders until early 2000. Shareholders have complained about how the company has paid its chief executive, David F. D'Alessandro, in the years since it converted to a publicly traded company.
Mr. D'Alessandro received a $21.7 million pay package last year, seven times what he earned two years earlier. The company's five highest-paid officers combined received $42 million in 2002. The amount shocked employees, shareholders and even Wall Street analysts, who criticized the company's pay practices in discussions with its executives.
Richard Syron, the chairman of Hancock's compensation committee, defended the pay publicly and in interviews as being well deserved after the successful conversion to a stock company and as necessary to retain Mr. D'Alessandro.
"People were annoyed and upset and they thought it was excessive," said Jason Adkins, a lawyer in Boston who is representing a Hancock shareholder in a suit against the company. Investors and employees expect the senior executives of such a big company to be highly paid, he said, but not quite so highly and not when returns to investors are poor.
In 2002, Hancock's earnings declined 15 percent and its stock price fell 32 percent.
"The problem Hancock had was it was grotesque, like Grasso's," said Mr. Adkins, referring to the pay package of Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the Big Board. .
Executive pay has risen at other big companies that have converted from partnerships or mutual ownership to stock companies in recent years.
Henry M. Paulson, the chairman and chief executive of the Goldman Sachs Group, received a large raise in 1999, the year Goldman went public. Mr. Paulson received more than $25 million that year -- one of the best ever for investment banks like Goldman -- up from $12.7 million in 1998, according to Goldman's 2000 proxy statement.
But that package and Mr. Paulson's compensation since then have drawn less criticism, in part because Goldman's employees and many of its other shareholders expect executives to earn large sums. At companies with large numbers of salaried workers and unionized employees, disclosures of high pay and special benefits for executives have caused more trouble.
Brandon J. Rees, a research analyst with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s office of investment in Washington, points to airlines. Donald J. Carty, the former chief executive of AMR, the parent of American Airlines, drew so much criticism over disclosures about the financing of his supplemental pension that he stepped down in April.
The large pension benefits built up by Mr. Grasso and his management team at the Big Board smack of preferential treatment for executives over other employees, Mr. Rees said.
"Excessive executive compsensation undermines employee morale," Mr. Rees said. "Nowhere is this more clear than when it comes to executive retirement benefits. Employees can see that there is this double standard."
Mr. Elson said he would be surprised if the exchange's disclosures did not lead to significantly lower pay for executives there, but primarily, he said, because it is a not-for-profit company with regulatory responsibilities. If it were a public company, the outcome would be harder to predict because change would require pressure from shareholders.
As Mr. Rees put it, "When you have a diffused shareholder base, you have a separation between ownership and control and that facilitates executives' enriching themselves."

HEADLINE: FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; 
Revisiting McNamara and the War He Headed

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
If there's one movie that ought to be studied by military and civilian leaders around the world at this treacherous historical moment, it is "The Fog of War," Errol Morris's sober, beautifully edited documentary portrait of the former United States defense secretary, Robert S. McNamara. Mr. McNamara, who was 85 when the interviews that make up the bulk of the film were conducted two years ago, served under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson from 1961 to early 1968. He has been widely vilified as a major architect of the Vietnam War, which cost more than 58,000 American lives and, according to Mr. McNamara, the lives of 3.4 million Vietnamese.
 Subtitled "Eleven Lessons of Robert S. McNamara," "The Fog of War," which has the first of two New York Film Festival screenings this evening, organizes his reflections into a list of maxims about war and human error, with the cumulative message suggesting that in wartime nobody in power really knows anything. 
 The documentary, which has a solemn, anxious score by Philip Glass, incorporates White House tapes of conversations about Vietnam that Mr. McNamara had with both presidents, along with vintage clips from World War II and Vietnam.
Stocky and slick haired, with rimless glasses and a grand corporate manner, Mr. McNamara appears to be an exceptionally articulate, self-confident man who came to this project prepared to deflect embarrassing questions about his personal responsibility for the debacle. While he readily confesses to having made serious mistakes of judgment, he will not admit to any grave moral failures. 
Near the end of the film, when pressed about whether he feels guilty about Vietnam, he dances nimbly away from the question. 
He also has a streak of grandstanding sentimentality. The only moment in which he betrays emotion is during a moist-eyed reminiscence of Kennedy's assassination and burial. And he goes out of his way to mention his good deeds. Before going into government, he worked for the Ford Motor Company (he was briefly the company's president), where he was instrumental in the establishment of new safety features, including car seat belts. Years later, at an antiwar protest in Washington, he made sure that the rifles of the soldiers guarding the Pentagon weren't loaded. 
Mr. McNamara, who left the Defense Department in 1968, remained silent about his feelings about the Vietnam War until his 1995 memoir "In Retrospect" whose reflections, including the 11 lessons, are tersely recycled in the movie.
The gist of his rationalization for escalating the war is twofold. He was serving a president (Johnson) who was strongly opposed to withdrawing American troops from Southeast Asia. Shortly before leaving office in February 1968, he sent a private memo to Johnson urging a scaling down of the war but received no response. 
Beyond that, he suggests in a tone sadder and wiser but not apologetic, that the complexity of war, its "fog" if you will, makes it all but impossible for military planners to see the whole picture, except in hindsight. 
"Any military commander who is honest will admit that he makes mistakes in the application of military power," he declares. And he worries that because there's "no learning period" for nuclear weapons, which can be deployed in 15 minutes at the whim of a single individual, one mistake could end up destroying nations. 
"The Fog of War," goes far beyond Vietnam. During World War II Mr. McNamara served as a commander under the arch-hawk Gen. Curtis Le May, who appears in old photos and film clips as a caricature of a pragmatic, cigar-chomping war-monger. Under Le May, Mr. McNamara was part of the team that made the decision to firebomb 67 Japanese cities, killing large numbers of civilians. In Tokyo alone, more than 100,000 civilians died one night in March 1945. 
That was before the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The lesson that came out of that, Mr. McNamara says, is that "proportionality should be a guideline in war." After the war, he recalls, Le May surmised that had the United States lost World War II, he and Mr. McNamara would have been prosecuted as war criminals.
Mr. McNamara was also at Kennedy's side during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when the president had to choose between answering two conflicting messages from the Soviets, one belligerent, the other more conciliatory. At the urging of the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tommy Thompson, who knew Nikita S. Khrushchev well and understood that the Soviet leader was looking for a way to avert war while saving face, Kennedy ignored the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to destroy Cuba and responded to the softer message. It was dumb luck, he says, that averted a nuclear war. The lesson that came out of that experience is arguably the most useful of the 11: "Empathize with your enemy."
It was our lack of empathy, Mr. McNamara asserts, that also caused the United States to get so deeply embroiled in Vietnam. What the United States viewed as an extension of the cold war the Vietnamese regarded as a civil war. Parallels can be found between Vietnam and the current war in Iraq. Then, as now, the United States acted without the support of most of its allies. "What makes us omniscient?" Mr. McNamara wonders. "We are the strongest nation in the world today, and I do not believe we should ever apply that economic, political or military power unilaterally. If we'd followed that rule in Vietnam, we wouldn't have been there. None of our allies supported us. If we can't persuade nations with comparable values of the merit of our cause, we'd better re-examine our reasoning." 
None of the documentary's lessons can be described as reassuring. "Believing and seeing are both often wrong," one says. "Rationality will not save us," goes another. The final and saddest lesson is delivered by Mr. McNamara with a rueful, you-know-what-I-mean smile:" "You can't change human nature."

HEADLINE: Conan the Green 

 BODY:
The actor who owns Hummers that average 10 miles to the gallon has now been elected governor of a state that has long provided national leadership on environmental issues, especially those like clean air and more fuel-efficient automobiles. Can Arnold Schwarzenegger and California's environmental impulses coexist?
 The prospects are better than one may have thought. Much will depend on the people he chooses for key posts, not least the chairmanship of the powerful California Air Resources Board, whose mandates over the years have driven Detroit to make cleaner cars and the refiners to make cleaner fuels. As with all politicians, much will also depend on whether he means what he says and acts on it. Still, his comments and campaign literature not only hearten conservationists but put him sharply at odds with the Bush administration. 
 The biggest difference is on global warming, an issue the administration has been slighting for three years. A new California law will require automakers to meet lower targets for emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global-warming gas. The automobile industry, joined by the White House, complains that the law is a backdoor way of increasing fuel economy, historically a federal prerogative. Mr. Schwarzenegger has embraced the new law and says he will defend it against all legal challenges.
Meanwhile, he promises that by 2020 one-third of California's power will be generated by renewable sources like wind and solar power. The Bush administration, in contrast, has been lobbying fiercely against a much weaker provision contained in the energy bill now before Congress. Mr. Schwarzenegger also says he is not at all pleased with the administration's recent efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act.
The differences on issues other than clean air are equally pronounced. Mr. Bush supports measures that could lead to oil exploration and drilling in sensitive coastal areas. Mr. Schwarzenegger is firmly opposed. The administration would greatly increase logging in California's Sierra Nevada, thereby upending a carefully drafted agreement to balance the needs of nature and commerce. The governor-elect would leave the deal undisturbed.
There have been missteps. A sloppy answer left the impression that Mr. Schwarzenegger would abolish California's Environmental Protection Agency to eliminate bureaucratic duplication. This was quickly corrected. Parts of his agenda are naive. Like Mr. Bush, he seems fixated on hydrogen as the fuel of the future. He may well be right over the long term, but his vision of a network of hydrogen fueling stations along California's highways by 2010 is unrealistic, if not utopian. He is not above gimmickry, promising to retrofit his Hummers with hydrogen, something only a Hollywood star could afford. The leader of his transition team, Representative David Dreier, has a dismal voting record on environmental issues.
So far, however, there is much to like, and, unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Schwarzenegger comes to office unbeholden to corporate interests. It will be intriguing to see how this plays out, especially with the governor's fellow Republicans in Washington.

HEADLINE: Deficit Falls Below Prediction, But the Year Still Sets a Record 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
As the government closed the books on the 2003 fiscal year this week, the Bush administration received a modest piece of good news: the 2003 budget deficit, while still the largest in history, was smaller than predicted.
 In August, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the deficit would be $401 billion when the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30. Now the office says the deficit will be $374 billion -- still more than double the 2002 gap of $158 billion. 
 At first glance, the smaller deficit might seem to be a portent of an improving economy. About half the reason for the $27 billion difference is higher tax receipts, particularly from corporations, which the budget office said had a particularly strong final quarter. 
But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the budget office director, said on Friday that tax revenues might have risen because corporations paid taxes slightly earlier than expected.
"There's really no single particular reason why it came in below the earlier estimate," Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. "I wouldn't say it's a dramatic recovery or anything like that -- it's really just a confluence of events. It's a heartening difference, but not really that big."
Because little has changed in the big-picture reasons for the record deficit -- tax cuts, a sluggish economy, huge outlays for military and security -- the budget office is not changing its deficit prediction of $480 billion for 2004, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. That figure is likely to rise substantially once Congress passes the $87 billion emergency spending bill President Bush has requested for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The budget office's calculations of a smaller deficit parallel those of the administration, which said this week that the year would end with a deficit of about $380 billion, rather than the $455 billion it foresaw in July. Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, said that the higher tax collections were a good economic sign and predicted that the administration would cut the deficit in half before its five-year goal.
Mr. Bolten said on Wednesday that he was optimistic the goal could be reached quickly "if we continue pro-growth economic policies and exercise fiscal restraint of the nature reflected in the president's '04 budget proposals."
Congressional Democrats, who have made the deficits a cornerstone of their critique of the Bush administration, said the improvement in the outlook was small and changed little in the long-term forecast.
"The administration's tax cuts and budget policies have not created jobs as promised, but they have created huge deficits that will stifle growth in the future and burden our children and grandchildren with debt," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
The other half of the $27 billion difference resulted from less government spending than predicted, the Congressional Budget Office said.
Mr. Holtz-Eakin said the office overestimated how much the Pentagon would spend this year. Nonetheless, the office's year-end report said that military spending had grown by 16 percent in 2003 -- the fastest rate of increase in 20 years, and more than double the 7 percent average growth of nonmilitary programs.
Spending on student loans, Medicaid, unemployment benefits and welfare was also less than anticipated, the budget office said.
As bad as the deficit numbers have been, they have been a useful cudgel for the administration in warding off increased government spending. On Friday, Trent Duffy, the spokesman for the White House Budget Office, said Congress should not see the change as an excuse to spend more.
"This is not the time to loosen the belt," Mr. Duffy said. "It's important to remember that the deficit will grow next year because of the need to finish the war on terror."

HEADLINE: Republicans Debate Merits of Following Schwarzenegger to the Center 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 10 

 BODY:
In Arnold Schwarzenegger, the national Republican Party now has a magnetic movie star in charge of the most populous state in the union, a governor-elect who has already emerged as an articulate, media-savvy and earnest figure who does not play by the conventional rules of politics.
 But far from simply rejoicing over his election, the party finds itself entangled in a debate over whether it should follow Mr. Schwarzenegger's path by moving to the center on social issues in order to become even more competitive in state and national races. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger's sweeping victory stirred anxiety among some conservatives, as much as it has cheered moderate Republicans, who have seized on it as evidence of how the party should position itself to fortify its standing, even at a time when it has proved increasingly dominant in American politics. 
Several moderate Republicans said Mr. Schwarzenegger was now in a position to be a hugely influential and moderating force on his party, should he choose to be. 
"How he won tells me that his message -- he's both fiscally conservative and socially inclusive and moderate -- was one that appeals to the middle," said Christie Whitman, a moderate Republican and former New Jersey governor who recently stepped down as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
"To me, it's a very strong signal to win statewide in a state like California," Mrs. Whitman said on Friday. "It's a socially inclusive message, but not hard-edged and leaving-people-out. And I think that's a national thing."
William F. Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, said: "There's a lesson here for the national party. This absolutely takes the curse of the stereotype off of Republicans that the opposition seeks to hang around their necks."
That argument has run up against stiff opposition from other prominent Republicans. Some suggested that moderates were seizing on an anomalous election -- a movie star defeating a highly unpopular incumbent in a largely Democratic state -- to try to relight the coals of an old fire.
"I don't think that's a fair lesson, because I think this election was more about Gray Davis and less about the particular ideological stands of the candidates," said Matt Dowd, a senior adviser to President Bush's re-election campaign. "If Arnold Schwarzenegger had been a celebrity politician that was pro-life, I don't think he would have gotten any less votes."
Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative group, said Mr. Schwarzenegger's victory was more of a lesson about how to win a state like California than about what the party should do nationally. "I don't think this means that the party nationally should move to the center in any way," he said. "The party that has to do some soul-searching right now is the Democratic Party."
To a large extent, what is taking place now is a replay of an old fight that President Bush adroitly managed, Republicans said, by positioning himself as a "compassionate conservative," while embracing traditional conservative positions on issues like abortion rights and gay marriage.
But the difference is Mr. Schwarzenegger, who like another actor who became governor of California, is proving that acting skills can be transferred to the business of politics. In the flush of his victory, several Republicans went so far as to talk him up a future presidential candidate -- a move is already afoot in Washington to start the cumbersome process of amending the Constitution to remove the prohibition on foreign-born citizens serving as president.
As unlikely as that would seem, Mr. Schwarzenegger's success and his new prominence in national politics seems likely to complicate Mr. Bush's efforts to balance the conservative and moderate wings of his party. He is a more compelling public figure than some of the other moderate voices in the party -- in particular, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Rudolph W. Giuliani -- and he is certain to be awarded a prime speaking slot at next year's Republican convention in New York.
Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida who is now a television commentator, said the White House would be wise to take a lesson from Mr. Schwarzenegger's victory, noting the close 2000 presidential race and the number of states that were decided by a relatively handful of votes.
Asked whether he thought it was a good idea for the party to move to the center, Mr. Scarborough, who described himself as conservative, responded, "If I'm a strategist, then yeah.
"I think the country right now continues to get more conservative on economic issues and more progressive on social issues. I think Schwarzenegger is ahead of the curve."
According to a New York Times/CBS News poll taken July 13 through July 27, Republicans are generally supportive of abortion rights; 22 percent said that abortion should be generally available, and another 41 percent said it should be available under stricter limits. Republicans are divided on homosexual relations. 
Rick Davis, a Republican consultant who advised another prominent moderate Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, when he ran for president in 2000, said he viewed the California election as evidence that "there is a pendulum swinging."
"Our party for the last 10 years has tried to run off the moderates," Mr. Davis said. "But it's happening without them."
Steven A. Merksamer, a lawyer in Sacramento who is active in Republican politics, said a big factor in Mr. Schwarzenegger's success was his celebrity, but he added: "His campaign can be a model for Republicans. I'll tell you this: Arnold Schwarzenegger succeeded in uniting the California Republican Party in a way it hasn't been united for years."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Schwarzenegger's victory has created mixed feelings among many conservatives. On one hand, many are delighted that the Republican Party has captured such a huge prize the year before a presidential race.
Yet many have expressed hesitation about this new symbol of the party, questioning his ideological bona fides and wondering how the party could embrace someone who was confronted with accusations that he groped and made lewd comments to more than a dozen women. 
"These Schwarzenegger conservatives -- now, there is an oxymoron for these times -- have embraced a man who is, politically, Hollywood's culture leavened by a few paragraphs of Milton Friedman," George Will, the conservative columnist, wrote this week.
"Schwarzenegger's conservative supporters have furled the flag of 'family values' while mocking their participation in the anti-Clinton sex posse," Mr. Will wrote. "They were unoffended by Schwarzenegger's flippant assertions that only the 'religiously fanatic' oppose human cloning -- not just stem cell research, but cloning."
For all that, there is no reason to believe, at this point, that Mr. Schwarzenegger is looking to do anything outside California. As several Republicans noted, he has more than enough work to do taking over this state, and he spent much more time in his campaign talking about cutting taxes than about his support for, say, abortion rights.
"He's got some real challenges right now," Mrs. Whitman said.

Mutombo Works Out; Knicks Hope It Works

BYLINE:  By LIZ ROBBINS

DATELINE: GREENBURGH, N.Y., Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Dikembe Mutombo sweated through his first Knicks practice Friday afternoon, energized by the opportunities -- financial and competitive -- the team had offered him.
 Afterward, James L. Dolan, the chairman of Madison Square Garden, made a cameo appearance at the team's practice facility to hand Mutombo his No. 55 jersey. Mutombo will be paid close to $8.5 million over two seasons to become what the Knicks see as the missing piece in the middle. 
 "I felt that the team that wanted me most was the Knicks," Mutombo said, citing Coach Don Chaney's interest. "I felt that it was a better situation for me, to go somewhere else where I can play and make money and continue to play my game the way I love it. 
"I felt at peace, knowing they want you here. In this time of my life, why get in a situation where I have been rejected?"
The Nets, Mutombo's former team, had a surplus of centers but not a surplus of cash. With the team for sale, the Nets' owners bought out Mutombo's contract to save $20 million. He was again scheduled to receive limited playing time in Coach Byron Scott's system.
In a harsh economic climate in which teams wary of the double luxury tax are looking to cut salaries, the Knicks added 7 feet 2 inches, 37 years and another $4 million this season to their league-high payroll of close to $88 million.
Their roster remodeling, which began this summer with the trade of Latrell Sprewell for Keith Van Horn, may not be done. They have one more player than the regular-season roster can carry, and are still looking to upgrade at point guard. 
The Knicks are trying to acclimate Mutombo quickly into their system. He said he wanted to play 25 to 30 minutes a game this season, his 14th. He will not play in Saturday's game against Minnesota, but could see time Sunday, Chaney said.
"I just want him to contribute," Chaney said. "We'll talk about minutes later on." 
Mutombo averaged 21.4 minutes in only 24 games with the Nets last season, when he was out for a long stretch after wrist surgery. He said he found the Knicks' offense easier because it was similar to the ones he had experienced before he struggled with the Nets' system.
Kurt Thomas, the Knicks' undersized center the past two seasons, has said he will not willingly give up his playing time to Mutombo, even if he could play power forward until the injured Antonio McDyess returns.
"Is Kurt Thomas a center?" Mutombo said. "He's my teammate and I like the way he competes. I think the organization is looking for more presence in the middle. It's not an insult to his game. I'm going to give him a little fight like I used to."
Mutombo spent the summer working out feverishly, and his former teammates and coaches with the Nets marveled at his condition.
"I think I've got three to four years left," Mutombo said. 
Mutombo said the Nets had approached him this summer, seeking to trade him or to buy him out, but he rejected them. He reconsidered when the Nets agreed to buy him out for $27.5 million of his $37.5 million contract, when the Knicks were seeking to cover almost all of the rest of that amount, and when he realized he could stay near his family in Philadelphia. "I don't want to look back to New Jersey," he said. "Whatever our marriage was, we just have gone our separate ways." 
Mutombo said he spoke with his friend Patrick Ewing, the longtime Knicks center, on Tuesday. Mutombo said he was excited to be reunited with McDyess, whom he played with in Denver during the 1995-96 season. 
"I think we're going to have one of the best frontcourts, the big guys from 3 to 5, we'll have one of the strongest, if we can get McDyess back soon," Mutombo said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Promote Themselves to N.A.A.C.P. 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 10 

 BODY:
With the South Carolina primary widely viewed as an early barometer of Southern and black support, Democratic presidential hopefuls used a forum here on Friday to promote their views on civil rights, as well as the economy and Iraq war, to the South Carolina N.A.A.C.P. convention.
 The group held its annual convention in North Carolina, in keeping with a boycott to protest the flying of a Confederate battle flag on the statehouse grounds in Columbia, S.C. 
 But the promised joint appearance of seven of the nine candidates fell apart because of travel complications that ended up giving Gen. Wesley K. Clark of the Army an extended solo appearance in which he took questions on a broad range of topics. 
The appearance helped flesh out the domestic policy positions of the retired general, who has not been in public life long. He said that he would fight racial profiling, that he wanted fairer treatment for Haitian immigrants intercepted at sea and that he would pursue prison education programs to reduce recidivism.
"Why do we put people in jail and teach them weightlifting and bodybuilding, but they can't get a high school education?" General Clark asked.
He also sought to make clear his concern for civil rights and racial equality, saying he has spent most of his adult life in "the institution that has done more than any other in America to support affirmative action."
The Rev. Al Sharpton received the most applause, two standing ovations, and roused the group with one-liners that chastised President Bush and his policies at home and in Iraq.
"We need to go get bin Laden, who is shooting more videos in Pakistan than any rock star in Hollywood," Mr. Sharpton said.
Organizers, scrambling to keep the program alive, delayed the event for nearly two hours before going ahead with just General Clark, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and Mr. Sharpton before a few hundred people in a hotel ballroom. Barely an hour into the session, first Mr. Kucinich and then shortly afterward Mr. Sharpton left to catch planes, leaving General Clark alone on stage.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut left before the discussion began, to observe the Jewish Sabbath.
Most of the questions focused on improving the economy and what to do about the Iraq war. All three hopefuls promised to promote employment programs, but just General Clark said American troops needed to stay in Iraq until it was stabilized and allies could be persuaded to help with the rebuilding costs. Mr. Kucinich and Mr. Sharpton called for the immediate withdrawal of the troops.
Former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri managed to show up by nightfall, after having been delayed by flight problems.
Mr. Gephardt took the South Carolina boycott head on, calling the struggle over the Confederate battle flag a continuation of the battle for civil rights. This year, he had had some difficulty with the issue, initially declining to take a position and the next day issuing a statement that he had been too cautious and calling the flag "a hurtful, divisive symbol" that "has no place flying anywhere in any state in this country." 
Only Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, campaigning in New Hampshire, and former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, visiting his daughter at college for a parents' weekend, made no effort to attend.
South Carolina is one of seven Democratic primaries on Feb. 3, occurring just after the first round of voting in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. But the primary is gaining special attention from the candidates because African-Americans are generally expected to make up more than half the voters, providing an indication of support from one of the party's major constituencies.

HEADLINE: Clark Puts Clinton Veterans in High Posts 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark announced a raft of top appointments to his presidential campaign on Friday, just days after simmering tensions inside the fledgling organization led to the resignation of his campaign manager. 
 Several of the new appointees are veterans of the Clinton administration. And the campaign has entered discussions with former Vice President Al Gore's campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, who recently left the presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. 
 Clark campaign officials said that with the appointments, the campaign was setting firm lines of authority and would become a more stable operation, though it still lacks a campaign manager and a political director.
"We have a fully functioning national campaign that is full-on," said Matt Bennett, a veteran of the Clinton White House and the last five Democratic presidential campaigns, who was named General Clark's director of communications on Friday.
"To get where we've gotten by Week 3 is unbelievable," he said.
Other appointments include: Eli Segal, a former Clinton official, as chairman and chief executive officer; Mickey Kantor, the former national chair for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, secretary of commerce and United States trade representative, as chairman of the steering committee; Richard Sklar, ambassador to the United Nations in 1997 and President Clinton's special representative to promote economic reconstruction in Southeast Europe, as chief operating officer; and Diana Rogalle, the former finance director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, as finance director.
The appointments were announced a day after a debate here during which the retired general's rivals sharply challenged his party loyalty and brought up his praise of the Bush administration in 2001. They also accused him of shifting positions on the war in Iraq in an attempt to undermine the stature that he brought to the race as NATO's past supreme allied commander in Europe.
Besides having to fend off aggressive attacks from other Democrats, the Clark campaign has had to deal with internal disputes like how best to sell the candidate, where to open offices, the degree to which the grass-roots draft-Clark movement will be integrated into high-level decision-making and how to teach basic political skills to a novice of campaigning.
For example, General Clark made himself vulnerable to questions about his party loyalty by failing to register as a Democrat until last week. He also continued to give paid speeches after he announced his candidacy on Sept. 17, in possible violation of Federal Election Commission rules. And he only just resigned from the boards of two companies, including the Acxiom Corporation, a data analysis firm based in Little Rock, Ark., which signed a $300,000 contract for his help in lobbying the government for homeland security business.
On Tuesday, General Clark's campaign manager, Donnie Fowler, resigned abruptly.
Allies of Mr. Fowler, 35, who was a field organizer for Mr. Gore's campaign and whose father, Donald L. Fowler, is a former national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he saw his influence being eroded.
They also said Mr. Fowler favored putting more resources into state organizations than the campaign had done so far and that he feared that by taking on so many establishment political professionals, the campaign would lose the "outsider" label that had attracted so many volunteers in the first place.
But others inside the campaign said Mr. Fowler had exercised bad judgment and was responsible for one of the campaign's early blunders -- sending the inexperienced general out with reporters on his first day as a candidate. That was when General Clark said he "probably" would have supported the Congressional resolution authorizing President Bush to use military force in Iraq. He has been trying to explain that statement ever since, insisting in Thursday's debate that he never supported the war.
Mr. Sklar said he regretted Mr. Fowler's departure and that he hoped the campaign "could find some way to work with him." But Mr. Fowler turned down the job of political director, and it is not clear whether he will return.
Mr. Sklar said that while the campaign had "hit the beach in a scattered fashion," it was now focused and organized.
The Clark campaign, which began on the fly with no computers or telephones, recently moved into the renovated Union Station building in Little Rock.
Still, several matters remain unsettled. Aides say there is an internal debate about whether to compete seriously in Iowa, which holds the first caucuses in January. Mr. Bennett said on Friday, "We have to target our resources where they make the most sense." He said that Iowa was difficult for candidates entering late because competing in the caucuses takes months of organization.
In New Hampshire, Steve Bouchard, who was Senator Bob Graham's New Hampshire director before the senator dropped out, was setting up an office this weekend for Mr. Clark. In another sign of growing discipline, the campaign expects to make major policy statements, including on health care and the economy, over the next few weeks.
There is also some discussion of setting up a small office in Washington, modeled on Bill Clinton's campaign office in 1992, as a way to work with members of Congress. But the headquarters would remain in Little Rock, officials said.
And many campaign officials are expecting the arrival of Mr. Lehane, who, after he left Mr. Kerry as an unpaid adviser, worked against the gubernatorial recall in California. Mr. Lehane was in Little Rock this week, helping his wife, Audrey Evans, settle in to the Clark campaign as a liaison between policy advisers and press advisers.
Mr. Lehane said on Friday, "General Clark is a very, very impressive person, a man of impeccable credentials, and I admire the cut of his jib." But Mr. Lehane said he would not decide for a week or so whether to join the campaign.
Because Mr. Fowler was widely regarded, his resignation was viewed as a blow by some inside the campaign.
"We were afraid we lost our champion for the grass-roots movement," said Maya Israel, who joined after working for the Clark-draft effort and was named associate director of communications on Friday.
She said that Mr. Segal addressed the staff, including those from the draft-Clark movement, late on Tuesday night.
"We were assured that our ideas will be respected and that our energy and enthusiasm will be used," she said. "It was really healing for all of us."
John Hlinko, co-director of "DraftWesleyClark.com," an Internet-based movement, who was named director of the campaign's Internet strategy, was also optimistic, saying that lines of authority and a greater sense of order were emerging. "There was a lot of angst," he said. "I feel that's petering out."

HEADLINE: GHETTO MIASMA; 
Enough To Make You Sick?

BYLINE:  By Helen Epstein; Helen Epstein writes frequently about public health for The New York Review of Books. This is her first article for the magazine.

 BODY:
Beverly Blagmon lives in the School Street housing projects in southwest Yonkers, a once-vibrant manufacturing area just north of New York City long mired in unemployment and poverty. Beverly has asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, gout and an enlarged heart, and her blood has a dangerous tendency to clot spontaneously. She is 48, and she had her first heart attack in her late 20's. One of her brothers died of heart failure at 50, and another died of kidney failure at 45, as did a sister who was 35. A young cousin recently died of cancer. In the past three years, at least 11 young people she knows have died, most of them not from gunshot wounds or drug overdoses, but from disease. 
 Monica, who asked that her last name not be used, moved to the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn from School Street a year ago. She has diabetes, arthritis and asthma. She is overweight, and the pain from a back injury that occurred four years ago makes it hard for her to walk or even bend over a stove. Her elaborately braided hair is tinged with gray. In the past year, six of her friends have died, all of them younger than she is. When asked simple questions about her life -- when she was born, where she grew up, when her three children were born -- Monica answers in short phrases, wiping tears from her eyes. She is 36. 
 Ebony Fasion, 22, and her friend Dominique Faulk, 17, both former residents of School Street, have asthma. Dominique's cousin Jo-Scama Wontong, 19, still lives in the School Street projects. Jo-Scama has lost so many people she loved to disease and accident recently that whenever she thinks about it, she is stricken with panic. "My heart beats so fast, and I can't breathe, and there's just death going through my mind the whole time." 
Something is killing America's urban poor, but this is no ordinary epidemic. When diseases like AIDS, measles and polio strike, everyone's symptoms look more or less the same, but not in this case. It is as if the aging process in people like Beverly and Monica were accelerated. Even teenagers are afflicted with numerous health problems, including asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor urban blacks have the worst health of any ethnic group in America, with the possible exception of Native Americans. Some poor urban Hispanics suffer disproportionately from many health problems, too, although the groups that arrived most recently, like Dominicans, seem to be healthier, on average, than Puerto Ricans who have lived in the United States for many years. It makes you wonder whether there is something deadly in the American experience of urban poverty itself. 
The neighborhoods where Beverly, Monica, Ebony, Dominique and Jo-Scama live look like poor urban areas all across the country, with bricked-up abandoned buildings, vacant storefronts, broken sidewalks and empty lots with mangy grass overgrowing the ruins of old cars, machine parts and heaps of garbage. Young men in black nylon skullcaps lurk around the pay-phones on street corners. These neighborhoods are as segregated from the more affluent, white sections of metropolitan New York as any township in South Africa under apartheid. Living in such neighborhoods as southwest Yonkers, central and East Harlem, central Brooklyn and the South Bronx is assumed to predispose the poor to a number of social ills, including drug abuse, truancy and the persistent joblessness that draws young people into a long cycle of crime and incarceration. Now it turns out these neighborhoods could be destroying people's health as well.
There are many different types of disadvantaged neighborhoods in America, but poor urban minority neighborhoods seem to be especially unhealthy. Some of these neighborhoods have the highest mortality rates in the country, but this is not, as many believe, mainly because of drug overdoses and gunshot wounds. It is because of chronic diseases -- mainly diseases of adulthood that are probably not caused by viruses, bacteria or other infections and that include stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure and certain types of cancer. 
The problems start at birth. The black infant death rate in Westchester County is almost three times as high as the rate for the county as a whole. Black youths in Harlem, central Detroit, the South Side of Chicago and Watts have about the same probability of dying by age 45 as whites nationwide do by age 65, and most of this premature death is due not to violence, but to illness. A third of poor black 16-year-old girls in urban areas will not reach their 65th birthdays. Four times as many people die of diabetes in the largely black area of central Brooklyn as on the predominantly white Upper East Side of Manhattan, and one in three adults in Harlem report having high blood pressure. In 1990, two New York doctors found that so many poor African-Americans in Harlem were dying young from heart disease, cancer and cirrhosis of the liver that men there were less likely to reach age 65 than men in Bangladesh.
Since the time of slavery, physicians have noted that the health of impoverished blacks is, in general, worse than that of whites. Racist doctors proposed that the reasons were genetic, and that blacks were intrinsically inferior and physically weaker than whites. But there is very little evidence that poor blacks or Hispanics are genetically predisposed to the vast majority of the afflictions from which they disproportionately suffer. As the living conditions of blacks have improved over the past century, their health improved in step; when conditions deteriorated, health deteriorated, too. This has helped support the contention among researchers that much chronic disease among minority groups is caused not by genes, but by something else.
That something else may come down to geography. Ana Diez-Roux, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, has shown that people who live in disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to have heart attacks than people who live in middle-class neighborhoods, even taking income differences into account. Researchers from the Rand Corporation found that neighborhoods where many buildings are boarded up and abandoned have higher rates of early death from cancer and diabetes than neighborhoods with similar poverty rates and similar proportions of uninsured people, but intact housing. Abandoned buildings do not in themselves cause disease, of course, but they are an indicator of neighborhood deprivation and neglect -- and this does seem to be associated with poor health, though we don't know why.
In some ways, our public health institutions are in the same position they were in 150 years ago. In the mid-19th century, public health boards were established to fight the great killers of the day -- cholera and tuberculosis. The poor were more susceptible to these diseases then, just as they are more susceptible to chronic diseases now. And then, as now, the reasons were unknown. Some believed diseases were acts of God and the poor got what they deserved. If they would only drink less, go to church and stay out of brothels, they wouldn't get sick. Others maintained that the afflictions of poverty were environmental. A stinking mass of invisible vapor, referred to as "miasma," hung in the air over the slums, they claimed, and sickened those who inhaled it. 
It was not until the early 1880's, when the German scientist Robert Koch looked down his microscope at swirling cholera and tuberculosis bacteria, that everyone finally agreed about what was going on. The water the poor drank was full of sewage and contained deadly cholera germs; in overcrowded tenements, the poor breathed clouds of tuberculosis bacteria. Malnourished alcoholics tended to be more susceptible to these diseases, but immoral behavior was not their primary cause. Nor was miasma. The primary cause was germs. 
We don't have a germ theory for chronic diseases like stroke, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. We know something about what can aggravate these diseases -- diet, smoking and so on -- but not enough about why they are so much more common among people who live in certain neighborhoods, or what makes, for example, a poor person who smokes the same number of cigarettes a day as a rich person more likely to get lung cancer. Or why several research studies show that smoking, eating, drinking and exercise habits do not fully account for why rich people are healthier than poor people. Even lack of health care cannot entirely explain the afflictions of the poor. Many poor people lack health insurance, and those who have it are often at the mercy of overworked doctors and nurses who provide indifferent care, but inadequate health care cannot explain why so many of them get so sick in the first place.
Most poor minority neighborhoods "are less healthy," says Adam M. Karpati, who works in the Brooklyn office of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. "You walk down the street and you know it. But what is that thing that you know is going on? What's at play there? That thing you can't name? We don't know that."
Clearly we need to examine this miasma with a different kind of microscope. The best we have at the moment are theories that fall into two main schools of thought. One school holds that the problem has mainly to do with stress; the other holds actual deprivation responsible. These two factors are often intertwined, but the emphasis is important. "There are so many fists in the face of poor African-Americans," says Arline Geronimus, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan who leans toward the stress school, and she proceeded to list them for me. They have enormous family obligations, she explained, and while the middle class are able to purchase child care and care for elderly relatives, the poor cannot. The experience of racism and discrimination in everyday life is also still very real, and very stressful. She says that blacks are faced with a society that institutionalizes the idea "that you are a menace -- and that demeans you," she says. Nancy Krieger, a Harvard researcher, found that working-class African-Americans who said they accepted unfair treatment as a fact of life had higher blood pressure than those who challenged it. 
Geronimus calls the grinding everyday stress of being poor and marginalized in America "weathering," a condition not unlike the effect of exposure to wind and rain on houses. Listening to Geronimus describe "weathering," I found it hard not to wonder whether anyone really knows what it is. Stress is subjective, a feeling, and it means different things to different people. Philip Alcabes, associate professor of urban public health at Hunter College, says that stress is like the miasma that was once thought to cause cholera in 19th-century slums. "You can't see it, you can't really measure it, but it floats over certain people, especially the poor, and makes them sick."
If "weathering" and stress have their modern day Robert Koch, he is probably Bruce McEwen, a neuroendocrinologist at Rockefeller University in New York. McEwen argues that stress hormones threaten the health of poor people, especially blacks and the Hispanic poor. Stress hormones are produced by the adrenal glands in response to signals from the brain. When people feel frustrated, frightened or angry, stress hormones travel through the bloodstream and instruct different parts of the body to prepare for an emergency. They speed up the heart rate and narrow the arteries so that blood gets to the tissues faster; blood sugar rises, so that energy rushes to the muscles and other organs; and some bodily functions, like digestion and the mechanisms that maintain the strength of the bones and other tissues, are inhibited. But not all stress is the same. Occasional periods of intense stress, like what you feel during a near miss in a car, do no harm. However, McEwen's research suggests that constant exposure to stress hormones impairs the immune system and damages the brain and other organs. 
Chronic stress also signals the body to accumulate abdominal fat around the waistline, which is more dangerous than fat that lies under the skin, or subcutaneous fat. Abdominal fat worsens many chronic health problems, including diabetes and heart disease, whereas subcutaneous fat does not. It's as if stress hormones were like lye, powerful stuff that in small amounts is useful for cleaning the stove, but that in large amounts will eat right through the floor. 
Not everyone believes that stress is a major contributor to the health crisis among the poor. George Davey Smith, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Bristol in England, agrees that the poor live very stressful lives, and that racism is an everyday reality for many people. However, in his view -- the second school of thought on the matter -- the health crisis among the poor has more to do with living in a deprived environment. 
The experience of poverty in America has changed a great deal since the 19th century; the poor now have safe drinking water and live in less crowded dwellings, and many have cars and TV's. However, it's also true that many poor people eat unhealthful food, smoke and abuse drugs. Americans hear a great deal about the importance of making healthy choices in their lives; warnings about cigarettes and high-fat foods issue frequently from the surgeon general's office and fill the pages of magazines and best-selling advice books. There are plenty of people who feel little sympathy for overweight diabetic people, poor or not, who eat regularly at McDonald's. But while there is considerable controversy about the ideal lifestyle regimen, you don't need to know much about impoverished neighborhoods to see the absurdity of choosing to go Atkins or macrobiotic for a person like Beverly Blagmon, who subsists on disability payments. Poor people are more likely to have unhealthy habits because fast food and cigarettes are abundant and cheap in their neighborhoods, and healthy alternatives tend to be limited. 
A recent survey conducted in four regions of the United States found that there were three times as many bars in poor neighborhoods as in rich ones, and four times as many supermarkets in white neighborhoods as in black ones. There are fewer parks in poor neighborhoods as well, so it is more difficult to find open spaces in which to exercise, and many of them are dangerous. Forty-one percent of New York's public elementary schools have no consistent physical education program. As Mary T. Bassett, a New York City deputy health commissioner, said to me, public health campaigns that tell people to "just say no" to smoking, or to change their diets and start exercising, can be cruel if they are indifferent to neighborhood circumstances. 
Davey Smith also points out that many of the poor black people who are sick today grew up in the 40's, 50's and 60's, when many black people lived in overcrowded dwellings, and were more prone than affluent whites to childhood infections. Some of these infections may have long-term effects on health. Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that has been associated with both ulcers and stomach cancer in adulthood, is most often acquired in childhood, and this may explain why poor blacks in particular have relatively high rates of both diseases. Adults who were poor as children, even if they are not poor now, are also more prone to stroke, kidney disease and hypertensive heart disease.
I wondered about these alternatives. Presumably both stress and material disadvantage are important causes of ill health among the poor. But which is more important? And what would be the best way to address these problems? If stress is a major cause of ill health, interventions to alleviate it -- counseling, antidepressants, even yoga -- might be beneficial. A recent article in The British Medical Journal suggested that building self-esteem actually helped a group of Native Americans manage their obesity and diabetes better than did conventional counseling about diet and exercise. On the other hand, if material disadvantage is a major cause of ill health among the poor, then extensive changes in the environment in which the poor live -- for example, cleaner buildings and more parks -- are needed. 
Perhaps Beverly Blagmon, who lives in the midst of such problems, could help resolve this matter. I asked her what she thought the health crisis in southwest Yonkers was caused by, and she answered without missing a beat. "Racism." We went on to talk about the lack of jobs in the area and the dilapidated state of the housing. I also learned that if stress is a killer, there is plenty of it on School Street, but yoga classes and motivational seminars are not likely to be of much help.
Beverly raised 10 children, eight orphaned nieces and nephews in addition to her own son and daughter. The kids were desperate for attention from the overextended Beverly. "It was hard," she said. "You had to deal with 10 different personalities." All the kids are grown now, and all but two have left home. Now she worries because some of them can't find jobs. When she was young, Yonkers was full of factories that hired many young people. But not anymore.
Then last year, disaster struck. Beverly's 21-year-old daughter was killed in a car accident; shortly thereafter, her nephew was shot and killed right outside her building. "I was totally out of it," she said. "People don't know how much a death can take from you. I went into the hospital right after my daughter's funeral. They didn't know if I'd had a mild stroke or not."
"Life is taken stupidly" all the time around School Street, Beverly said, but this doesn't make it easier to handle. Beverly struggles with these losses, and said her family, friends and even officials from the local Housing Authority have been supportive. But when Beverly talked about life on School Street, what she said is underscored with tension -- the constant strain of "us versus them." She sees the police in particular as a constant source of grief. "Some of them are very prejudiced, even now," she told me. She claimed that a few officers harassed children and teenagers, and have even been known to swear at kids and shove them. She recalled, as if it were yesterday, a 1997 fight at School Street. Someone called Beverly to come outside, which she did, along with a visiting friend. Police officers were on the street, some of them shouting, and in the chaos that ensued, she said, a policeman knocked down Beverly's friend, a older woman who is legally blind. "I was freaked out," Beverly said. "The main witnesses were drug dealers, and they couldn't say anything." (The Yonkers police confirmed that the woman later filed a complaint, but said an internal investigation found no wrongdoing.) Beverly said she was infuriated when, shortly after the incident, she saw the mayor of Yonkers praise the police in a televised speech. 
People who are not poor often casually ascribe their aches, pains and even more serious afflictions to "stress," but stress, if it is a killer, is a far more serious problem for people like Beverly. When middle-class people feel the police or other authorities treat them unfairly, they often have the resources to hire a lawyer and even effect change. But all too often poor blacks feel ignored when they complain about discrimination and abuse.
How might painful experiences like Beverly's be imprinted on the body? Laboratory animals suffer when stressed with electric shocks or when kept in isolated cages away from their peers, and they sometimes do develop symptoms that resemble human chronic diseases. But how does mousestress compare to Beverly's stress? Or mine? Or yours? George Davey Smith would argue that it is entirely possible that the afflictions of poor people like Beverly are not due to stress, at all, but to old-fashioned deprivation: crowding, poor nutrition, lack of exercise and exposure to dirty air, germs and vermin. For a while, Beverly's family of 11 crowded into a two-bedroom apartment, until they were eventually moved into a six-room place. Once, money was so short that she begged the welfare office for food stamps. There is nowhere around School Street for kids to run around, Beverly says, except a concrete playground with a set of monkey bars. "Why can't they put up some swings or build a basketball court? You see kids using garbage cans as basketball nets around here." Until two years ago, an incinerator in the building spewed forth horrible fumes that may have contributed to the high rates of asthma on School Street. "When you got ready to polish the furniture, it was black with dust," Beverly recalled. "Every day. Now, how much of that was getting in our lungs? I've been in the hospital every year with acute asthma." The incinerator has been replaced by a compactor, but as a result, life is a constant battle against roaches and mice, whose droppings also worsen asthma. Beverly told me that she recently caught three mice in one day. "I put them on the maintenance people's desk," she said. The elevators are always breaking down, which is hard on the elderly. Once she saw human feces in the hallway. 
After talking to Beverly, I could only conclude that her life was full of many sorts of trouble, any or all of which might be harmful to health. If only it were possible to devise an experiment that would examine the effects of stress and deprived living conditions on the health of the poor. For nearly 10 years, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has been conducting an experiment called Moving to Opportunity that seems to be doing just that. HUD researchers wanted to see what happens to poor urban families who move out of neighborhoods like Harlem in New York, Roxbury in Boston or the South Side of Chicago and settle in better neighborhoods. They wanted to know whether moving would help children do better in school, and escape being drawn into crime when they reached adolescence. They also wanted to know whether their parents would climb out of poverty.
HUD did find that people's lives improved in some ways. For example, the children who moved to better neighborhoods in Baltimore did better on standardized tests, and adults there were more likely to get off welfare. But HUD's most remarkable early findings had to do with health. In Boston, poor children who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods were less likely to experience severe asthma attacks. Adults in New York who moved were less likely to suffer from symptoms of depression and anxiety than those who stayed behind, and adults in Boston were more likely to report that they felt "calm and peaceful." The HUD researchers who devised the experiment had not set out to study health, but their findings were so striking that they decided to expand their study to determine whether moving out of poor neighborhoods affected other aspects of health that they did not measure in the first round, including blood pressure, obesity and other factors associated with such chronic afflictions as heart disease, cancer and stroke, like smoking. Those results aren't available yet, but when I heard about the earlier study, I decided to conduct a small experiment of my own. 
I wanted to talk to families, like those who had participated in the HUD program, who had recently moved out of the slums. Did the move affect their health? And if so, why? Did people experience less stress? Did they eat better food? Breathe better air? What might their experiences tell me about the mysterious miasma of contemporary poverty?
My investigation led me to Jerrold M. Levy, the general counsel of the Enhanced Section 8 Outreach Program, or ESOP, which helps low-income families move out of depressed, dangerous inner-city neighborhoods in Yonkers into middle-class areas. ESOP wasn't conducting any studies of these people, of course, but Levy was willing to put me in touch with 10 of the families he'd helped move. He had noticed that the people who moved out of dangerous neighborhoods seemed happier. "A few weeks after they've moved," he says of his clients, who are mostly single mothers, "they come into my office, and it's like one of those programs on late-night TV where they do the makeovers, you know? They have their hair done nicely, they're wearing high heels and makeup, it's like they're transformed. They have a new sense of self-worth and dignity. But will you see changes in their health? I don't think so." Depression and anxiety are major health problems that affect large numbers of poor people, so I thought I would be satisfied just to find people whose mental health improved. And I did find such people. But I also found that most people who moved gained far more than high spirits.
Of the 10 families I met, 9 had at least one member who suffered from a serious health problem before the move that required either medication or hospitalization. Of the 16 people in these families who had health problems, 12 told me that they felt better in significant ways -- either their symptoms were less severe so that they no longer required hospitalization, or they were taking less medication. Their health problems included severe asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis and eczema. Emergency-room visits for the asthmatic kids virtually stopped, and some adults with high blood pressure or diabetes reduced the doses of their medications. This was hardly a rigorous scientific experiment. There was no control group, and I was not able to check medical records. Nevertheless, I was stunned by what people told me. These people felt better, and moving appeared to have made all the difference. If moving out of southwest Yonkers were a drug, I would bottle it, patent it and go on cable TV and sell it.
Juanita Moody is now 52. In the summer of 2001, she and her husband, William, moved to a middle-class section of Yonkers from a low-income housing complex on Nepperhan Avenue, where they lived for nearly 30 years. Juanita was crippled by polio when she was a teenager, and during an operation to adjust her spine, she was given a blood transfusion that contained hepatitis C. The virus lay dormant for many years. But two and a half years ago, Juanita's doctor told her that her liver was showing signs of damage and advised her to take interferon, a prescription drug for viral infections. When Juanita found out about the possible side effects, however, she refused. Today Juanita's liver tests are almost normal, suggesting that her hepatitis is not progressing rapidly. "The doctor said I was fantastic, in terms of enzymes," Juanita told me. I did not speak to Juanita's doctor myself, so I could not confirm her diagnosis, but Juanita seemed energetic, and other doctors confirmed that it is possible for hepatitis to slow its progression. In addition, Juanita says that since she moved, her blood pressure has fallen from 140/90, which is considered high, to 130/78, which is almost normal, and the dose of blood-pressure pills she takes has been reduced by half. 
Juanita, a born-again Christian, attributes her improved health to prayer and to the new regimen she has maintained since she moved. She has become a health-food nut. Before she moved, her daughter told me, "everything was fried, fried, fried. Before she'd eat at McDonald's and stuff, but not now." Now she drinks fruit and vegetable juices, and her kitchen cabinets are full of natural remedies: vitamins C and E, zinc, magnesium, calcium, alpha lipoic acid and milk thistle, which she says is excellent for the liver.
Juanita says she began focusing more on her health after she moved. When she lived on Nepperhan, there were too many other things to worry about, including frequent robberies and killings in and around the complex itself. The building managers put up a fence to keep drug dealers out, "but the crackheads living inside the building gave the dealers the keys." The elevators were often broken, which meant that someone would have to carry Juanita and her wheelchair up and down three flights of stairs.
Juanita's new apartment is not in a luxury building. It's on a busy road, near two gas stations and a shopping mall, and has few amenities. But it is safe and has nice, leafy views. On Nepperhan, "it was stressful just to walk out of that place. You were always scared for the kids. . . . You wake up stressed, go to sleep stressed, you see all the garbage and the dealers. That is depressing. In a bad environment like that you say, 'What's the use of doing anything?' " Living in her new apartment building gives her a very different feeling. "It inspires you to do all you can -- spiritually, health-wise, any kind of way."
It is well known that junk food can make anxious people feel better. Researchers from the University of California recently discovered one possible reason. In response to constant stress, the brain makes a hormone called corticotropin-releasing factor, which instructs the adrenal glands to manufacture stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones cause a range of physiological changes that over long periods can be harmful. When people with high levels of cortisol eat sugary, fatty foods, fat is deposited in the abdomen. The researchers theorize that these abdominal fat cells can temporarily inhibit the brain from making corticotropin-releasing factor, reducing feelings of stress and anxiety. If this theory is correct, it could explain how the stress of poverty creates a biological urge to overeat, thus putting poor people at greater risk of obesity and its consequences -- diabetes, heart disease, stroke and certain types of cancer. Perhaps this explained why Juanita found it easier to change her diet once she moved out of the stressful atmosphere of Nepperhan Avenue. She admitted that doctors had been telling her over the years that she should consume less fattening food. "But they can tell you, and you don't do it," Juanita said. 
Noemi, 31, moved with her two teenage children and her 76-year-old aunt, Raimunda, from Burnham Street in Yonkers to a better neighborhood in northwest Yonkers only three months before I met her in August. Noemi, who asked that her last name not be used, has had diabetes since childhood. Shortly after she moved, her doctor reduced her dose of insulin by three units. Noemi thinks it's because she feels less stressed in the new neighborhood. "Stress affects your blood sugar," she explained. "It makes your sugar go up so you need more insulin." She drove me from her new neighborhood of neatly mowed lawns, bushy trees and two-car garages to the place she used to live. "Look at the neighborhood here," she said, as we drove by industrial garages, boarded-up buildings and vacant lots. An enormous, dented, wheezing Lincoln car screeched by. "I had to be worried all the time, you know. Are the children gonna get hit by a car? Is something gonna happen? We've lived in neighborhoods with a lot of drugs, a lot of people getting killed. You'd read about it in the paper the next day and think: Oh, God! That's only two blocks from here."
Noemi's aunt Raimunda speaks no English, although she has lived in the United States for more than 15 years. She has high blood pressure and heart disease. I asked Noemi to ask Raimunda how she was feeling these days. "She says her thing with the head is gone," Noemi translated. "Before she used to get dizzy, but not anymore. Not for the past couple of months." When I asked Raimunda why she thought the dizzy spells went away, she, unlike Noemi and Juanita, did not mention stress. Instead, she said she thought the improvement had something to do with diet. "She thinks the chicken is better here -- easier to digest," Noemi said. "But what she doesn't know is that since we moved, I still buy the chicken in the same place."
After meeting Noemi, Raimunda and Juanita, I began to see more clearly what Arline Geronimus, the University of Michigan researcher, was talking about. Perhaps the miasma that is killing the poor really is stress after all. Then I spoke to the mothers of six children who had severe asthma. Every one of them had significantly fewer and less severe attacks after the families moved out of southwest Yonkers. Reduced stress could be partly responsible -- stress can worsen asthma -- but it seemed clear to me a cleaner environment was also responsible. The children ranged in age from 3 to 16; they all moved out of southwest Yonkers and settled in different parts of Westchester. The mothers, who asked that their last names not be used, saw astonishing changes, and hearing their stories convinced me that the only way to deal with the staggering epidemic of asthma that afflicts 30 percent of children in some New York City neighborhoods is to clean up the rundown, roach-infested buildings where so many of these children live. 
Carmen and her 4-year-old son moved to a middle-class section of Westchester in the spring of 2002. In Yonkers, her son would have severe asthma attacks every month and would have to sit for hours every day breathing through a nebulizer. Since they moved, she says he has needed the nebulizer only twice. Two years ago, Monique, her 3-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter moved from Cedar Street in Yonkers to Peekskill. When they lived on Cedar Street, her son's severe asthma came complete with projectile vomiting. The attacks started just a few months after he was born, and they terrified Monique. She blames her former landlord. "There was no hot water for two weeks once, there were leaks in the roof, so it was damp all the time. Sometimes there was water coming through the roof, and mice playing in the living room," she says. "There were cockroaches everywhere, even in the refrigerator. The landlord did nothing until I called the health department. It was stressful having all those roaches around. You didn't know if they were crawling all over you at night." As soon as the family moved up to Peekskill, the boy's attacks became less severe. Although he is still on medication, the violent attacks and the vomiting have stopped.
Cockroaches and vermin do worsen asthma, and this might explain why Monique's son was so sick. But there could be another reason that so many children in poor neighborhoods have asthma, and why they get better when they move. In the past decade, rates of childhood asthma, as well as obesity and diabetes, have soared in the very neighborhoods that were worst affected by the crime waves of the 70's, 80's and 90's. One possible explanation, says Daniel Kass, a research scientist for the New York City health department, "is that asthma follows the crime epidemic, because it goes wherever people spend a lot of time indoors." 
Poor parents, terrified that their kids will be killed on the street, tend to keep them inside, with the windows shut and the TV on, where they are constantly exposed to contaminants in indoor air, which some researchers believe can be as damaging as industrial pollution. Not only are sedentary, overweight kids more at risk for asthma, but kids with severe asthma tend to exercise less and are thus prone to obesity. Mothers trying to protect their kids from crime may not realize they are putting their future health at risk. As Mindy Fullilove, professor of clinical psychiatry and public health at Columbia University explained, "The best parents -- the people who are the most upright, the churchgoers, the most protective mothers -- keep their kids inside, and they are at the intersection of the asthma and obesity epidemics."
I thought of Trevor Jackson Jr., a 14-year-old boy with serious eczema who moved from southwest Yonkers up to Cortland Manor in northern Westchester two years ago. "This is a much better atmosphere," his mother, Dawn, told me. Their new apartment is in a large house with a wide sloping lawn surrounded by trees. "The kids can just go outside anytime. The little one wouldn't go to sleep when we first got here." He wanted to be outside all the time. In Cortland Manor, "kids have a better chance to grow," Trevor's father, Trevor Sr., says. "We see deer in the yard, woodchucks, otters, frogs. There's just life up here."
I was beginning to see that the problems of stress and material deprivation were inseparable parts of the contemporary miasma of poverty. But how did these neighborhoods become so unhealthy? New York City is one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the country. Blacks, whites and other ethnic groups interact every day, but to a large extent they live separately. At the same time, the city has also become more segregated by wealth, so that many black and Hispanic neighborhoods are also the poorest. 
The Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson has described how, thanks to the civil rights movement of the 60's, many middle-class blacks have been able to find jobs and housing outside traditional black areas, leaving behind the most impoverished, poorly educated people. This concentration of disadvantage -- racial, social and economic -- combined with the loss of many unskilled manufacturing jobs, is what Wilson says contributed to the many social problems associated with poverty today, including drug abuse, crime and single motherhood. Mindy Fullilove says that these trends contributed to widening health inequalities as well. As racial and economic segregation increased, health problems became concentrated in the most deprived areas, as if the miasma were condensing over them. Indeed, I wondered if the miasma might not turn out to be segregation itself. 
In order to understand the health crisis among America's urban poor, Fullilove explains, you can't just consider what's going on now. "You have to look at the history of these neighborhoods" and think about the people who live there and what has happened to them in the past. "The history of each neighborhood will determine its pattern of disease. A city like New York suffers from an overlay of epidemics." 
In the 70's, 80's and 90's, poor minority neighborhoods throughout the country experienced a protean health crisis. Rates of some chronic and infectious diseases began increasing for the first time since World War II. Even older blacks who made it into their 60's, and who once had as good a chance of reaching their 75th birthdays as 60-year-old whites, began dying at higher rates. 
Fullilove says that urban-renewal projects that helped create concentrated poverty, along with redlining -- discrimination by banks and insurance companies -- and public- service cuts in poor neighborhoods led to catastrophic changes in the way the poor lived, and destroyed the foundation that made poverty endurable. The migrancy of poor people, displaced by fires, evictions and other calamities, destroyed informal community mechanisms for caring for children and controlling the behavior of adolescents and young adults, and this made it harder than ever for the poor to cope. "It was like a massive refugee situation," Fullilove says.
At the same time, as the middle class increasingly campaigned for restrictions on cigarette and alcohol advertising, those companies spent more of their marketing dollars in poor neighborhoods. As Rodrick and Deborah Wallace wrote in their book "A Plague on Your Houses," politicians looked the other way when companies posted huge, colorful billboards -- depicting exuberant black people smoking cigarettes and drinking beer -- outside schools and churches in Harlem, Brooklyn and the South Bronx. Construction on central Harlem's first full-size supermarket did not begin until 2002, but in the 90's there were more than a hundred places where a child under 18 could buy cigarettes, including individual "loosies," which are cheap but illegal. 
The wave of crime and drugs of the 80's and 90's has subsided considerably, and some once-grim urban neighborhoods are even prospering. But poverty has risen in many suburban minority enclaves, and the health problems of the poor have not gone away. 
Much has been written about how such social problems as joblessness and drug abuse worsen health problems, but it is also possible that the converse is true. Both Beverly and Monica have lost jobs as a result of illness, and many sick people fall into poverty. Anne Case, a Princeton University economist, has shown that unhealthy young people are far less likely to succeed in school and find good jobs later on. Thus, illness can trap poor families in cycles of disease, death and poverty for generations. 
Adam Karpati of the New York City health department says that even though we don't know what the miasma is, there is still a great deal we can do to improve the well-being of the poor. In the 19th century, it was not the discovery of germs that led to the greatest advances in public health, but a series of profound changes in the way the poor lived -- a virtual social revolution. Then, as now, health and poverty were inseparable from each other, and better housing, sewers, decent wages, better working conditions and improved nutrition saved millions of lives. Today much could be done to improve the environment and make life less stressful for the poor. The health department is working to reduce mold and roach infestation in public housing, as well as encouraging doctors and community organizations to address such problems as obesity, asthma and diabetes. These admirable programs, however, are modest in scale, and in the current fiscal climate, their financing is far from secure. 
More ambitious changes are needed, but at present, our government is permitting matters to get even worse. Since 2000, millions of jobs have been lost, and nearly three million people have joined the ranks of the poor, who now account for more than 12 percent of the U.S. population and 24 percent of African-Americans. This means fewer families will be able to move out of poor neighborhoods on their own. For now, the federal Section 8 program -- which provides subsidies for people to pay for private housing -- is the only hope most people have of getting out of these neighborhoods, but even its future is in doubt. Possible budget cuts could mean thousands of Section 8 recipients will lose their vouchers next year, and in the longer term, Republicans in Congress hope to devolve the program to the states. This will almost certainly mean the program will shrink. Last month, moreover, HUD also suspended rental supplements that Jerrold Levy says have made programs like ESOP possible. "This will reinforce the ghettoization of poor people," Levy says.
Rising unemployment and budget cuts will not only harm people's health. They will also cost Americans money. Take diabetes and asthma as examples. Around one million people succumb to Type 2 diabetes each year, with African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans most at risk. The bill for treating the nation's 11 million known diabetics comes to $92 billion for medications and doctors' visits plus $40 billion in lost productivity due to absences from work and premature death. The yearly bill for the nation's asthma epidemic is $14 billion. As Beverly pointed out to me, shortsighted cuts, amounting to a few hundred million dollars, from the HUD budget mean programs to refurbish public housing, organize recreation for children and build playgrounds have been halted. The exterminator teams that used to come every month now come once every two months, and the roaches are flourishing as never before. 
Whatever the miasma is that afflicts America's minority poor, it is at least partly a legacy of the segregation of America's cities. These neighborhoods, by concentrating the poor, also concentrate the mysterious, as yet poorly understood, factors that make them sick. You'd almost think this new miasma was caused by some sort of infection, because of the way it seems to strike certain neighborhoods and certain types of people. I recently came across a research article by Angus Deaton of Princeton University, reporting that white people who live in cities with large black populations have higher death rates than whites with the same income who live in cities with smaller black populations. It made me wonder whether the deprived, polluted, roach-infested, stressful conditions in which poor blacks live aren't affecting all of us, to some degree. And even if we never find out what the miasma is, this possibility should scare us into treating this as the health emergency it is -- if nothing else will.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
For New School Buildings, Customized Designs

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
THE public schools being built on Long Island today are a far cry from most of those of the past, which were often constructed from uniform blueprints, producing three-story boxlike brick structures in the 1940's and one-story rambling brick buildings in the 1960's.
 Today, much more effort is taken to design or remodel schools in ways that reflect the community and its needs, according to those in the business of designing schools. 
 "While some concepts transcend all districts -- such as the need for natural light, good acoustics, open space and color finishes -- today's designs are dictated by how the district educates its students, and some have additional concepts, such as features that reflect its history or location," said Edward Casper, a principal architect with Wiedersum Associates of Hauppauge, which designed the new 187,000-square-foot William Floyd Middle School in Moriches. 
Roger P. Smith, a principal at Burton Behrendt Smith, an architectural firm in Patchogue, said: "We don't want the cookie-cutter schools of the past. Today, it is necessary to take the absolute needs of the children and combine them with a statement significant to each community." 
In designing the sprawling junior-senior high school for the newly merged Eastport-South Manor Central High School District in Manorville, which opened last month, Mr. Smith said he had turned to a concept called an "academical village" used by Thomas Jefferson in designing the University of Virginia in the early 1800's. That plan included rows of individual houses for the professors -- each house containing lecture rooms and living quarters -- which were connected with the student dormitories by two colonnaded passageways. Other passageways connected dining halls and more student rooms.
The design for the 372,000-square-foot Eastport-South Manor Junior Senior High School materialized after years of planning by the two districts to create a school that would be economical and safe for day and night use and allow children in Grades 7 to 12 to interact safely, Mr. Smith said.
"In my mind, Jefferson's academical village made sense," he said. "There was the hierarchy of spaces, easy movement and the separation of functions, like a village. The main corridor would be like his idea of a strolling Main Street, which interconnects all the functions."
The $88 million school in eastern Suffolk basically consists of five attached buildings, called wings, that house commonly used facilities and 113 classrooms that range from 800 to 2,500 square foot. The biggest spaces are for large-group instruction. 
The wings -- connected by corridors that Mr. Smith compares to side streets -- are clustered in a U-shape around a central building that is attached only by its "Main Street" -- a 20-foot-wide corridor -- to the others. 
The main corridor runs through the 29,643-square-foot central building, which includes the school's entrance, and connects the building to the physical education and fine arts wings on one end and academic wings on the other. The administrative and guidance offices are in the front of the central building, and a 9,000-square-foot media center is in the rear. 
The cafeteria wing is set behind the central building and is connected by a smaller corridor to the gymnasium and the academic wings.
Lawrence Salvesen, the project's architect, said the green color of "the framed and tinted windows and shingled roofs ties into the rural community and the white Tuscan columns bring a classical look." 
Mr. Smith said, "By creating this village-style school, it gives the community a signature historic building instead of just a big box." 
Fanning/Howey Associates of Celina, Ohio, and SBLM Architects of New York City also worked on the project.
The school has a capacity of 2,200 students, who come from Eastport and Manorville. It has a current enrollment of 590 students in the junior high school and 854 in the senior high. "Most of the growth has been in Eastport, where the population has been increasing up to 10 percent a year for more than two years," said the superintendent, B. Allen Manella.
ABOUT 10 miles south on 34 acres in Moriches is the new $38 million William Floyd Middle School, which also opened last month. 
A key to its design was the district's "goal to keep the students focused within their own grade-level area so they wouldn't spend time walking all over the school to classes," said Mr. Casper. 
The school has three wings that fan out from a central 1,500-square-foot lobby. The seventh and eighth grades are in a two-story wing, and the sixth grade is in a one-story wing. A third wing contains the 4,000-square-foot cafeteria, gymnasium and 10,000-square-foot music area, with a 500-seat auditorium. It can be locked off for security and public use.
With the exception of special programs, like physical education, each grade level is contained within its own area, with classrooms built around the perimeter and science and technology rooms in the center. 
Sets of two 770-square-foot classrooms were built with a shared partitioned wall so the space could be doubled for larger group instruction. Each grade level has a special suite with offices for guidance counselors and administration. 
The 5,000-square-foot library at the front of the building near the main lobby was designed as a centerpiece.
The school is part of the William Floyd School District's $200 million construction and reorganization plan, which included dividing the middle school population and creating a second middle school. Each school now has 1,400 students, according to Richard Hawkins, the superintendent. 
The district, which was named for a signer of the Declaration of Independence from New York, covers the communities of Mastic Beach, Shirley and Moriches. It has a total enrollment of 10,500 students. 
"There have been a lot of new homes going up out here, but we don't have a lot of open land left, so I think we will top out in about two years," he said. The new school is about 10 percent below capacity. 
ON a busy main street in Mineola, Nassau County, about 50 miles to the west, a new public school for prekindergarten and kindergarten recently opened. The 62,429-square-foot two-story building resembles a traditional school, but there is no hint that small children are within.
This was a conscious feature of the design, according to Michael Spector, a principal with the Spector Group, an architectural firm in North Hills that designed the building.
"Our mission was to design a school that would protect as well as nurture," he said. "We had to make it very secure as well as creative and a beautiful piece of architecture for the community. The need for security today is of the utmost importance. The exterior shows it is a good school but doesn't reflect that there are little children inside." 
The $10.5 million building, with 19 classrooms on the ground floor and district offices on the second, was designed by the Spector architect Michael Manetta. The hallways and ductwork are bright with color, and the gymnasium is filled with light through its translucent walls and roof. 
There is a canopied front door to mark the main entry on busy Willis Avenue; however, the drop-off area is on a side street. The colorful outdoor playground is enclosed by the building on three sides, visible from large corridor windows. A bright red high metal fence faces the side street.
According to Mr. Smith there are many innovative concepts being used in today's public schools, including "emotive architecture" that creates "a sense of excitement that makes the child want to be there." 
In explanation, Mr. Smith described some of the firm's newest projects. The South Country Elementary School in Bay Shore, across the Great South Bay from the Fire Island Lighthouse, was designed with a lighthouse-style tower set over a portion of the reading area to give children the sensation of being inside the lighthouse. 
The Washington Drive Primary School in Centerport, which opened in January, was designed with a nautical motif to make students feel a connection with the nearby waterfront.
In the building's 34-foot-high atrium, students walk across a linoleum map of Long Island with the North and South Forks at the entry door and Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty at the library. Within the 2,270-square-foot library, a seating area is shaped like the bow of a ship.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
In Bali, All the Post-9/11 World's a Stage

BYLINE:  By RON JENKINS; Ron Jenkins, a professor of theater at Wesleyan University, is writing a book on tensions between Muslims and Hindus as reflected in Balinese temple performances.

DATELINE: DENPASAR, Bali 

 BODY:
"WHERE is my leg?" moaned a disembodied head in a temple courtyard a few miles from the site of last year's terrorist bombings in Bali. "Where is my arm?" 
 This past August, the memory of the carnage was still vivid to the audience, but the actor playing a victim of the bombings turned the mood of hushed dread into one of comedy, evoking sudden peals of laughter by quoting the tagline of a popular Indonesian television show about the undead: "Don't watch me! I'm not here!" 
 "The audience laughed out of relief," said Gusti Ngurah Windia, a well-known Balinese actor, as he recalled his performance a few days later. He was sitting on the porch of his home in the village of Carang Sari, several miles from the southern town of Kuta, where the bombings took place. "For a moment, the horror of their memories was transformed into fiction, a dream from a television melodrama, as if it never really happened." 
A year ago today, more than 200 people were killed in the terrorist attack by Islamic radicals. In other parts of the globe a similar assault might have led to ethnic retaliation, but the Balinese, living on the only Hindu island in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, answered with art.
During the last 12 months, performers in temple courtyards, village halls and on television frequently have used traditional Balinese theater forms -- masked comedies, shadow plays and folk operas -- to refer to the attack and its aftermath, which has shattered the island's tourist-driven economy.
Another response took place on Nov. 15, 2002, when purification ceremonies, accompanied by theater, music and dance performances, were staged in every village across the island. 
This grassroots event stretched as far as New York, where, on the same day, Balinese musicians in sarongs and flowered head-dresses led a ceremonial procession from the World Trade Center site to the Battery Park Esplanade. Among the hundreds of Americans and Indonesians who participated were family members of the American victims of the Bali bombing. They joined a masked Balinese performer in throwing flowers into the Hudson River, a Hindu ritual symbolizing the release of the soul to heaven.
Wearing the sacred mask of Sidha Karya, a mythological Balinese figure representing death and renewal, Nyoman Catra, the performer, surveyed the scarred skyline of Manhattan and said, "People are trying to destroy our world, our country, our village." In keeping with Balinese tradition, he was playing a character in a 15th-century story, but he was also speaking of contemporary events as he connected the terror victims of the two islands -- Bali and Manhattan -- by turning them into inhabitants of one town. 
"Maybe the bombers wanted to create chaos and fighting between Hindus and Muslims," said Made Sumadi, an official in Bali's ministry of religion, during an interview in August near the island's capital, Denpasar. "But we did not respond the way the bombers expected. In Bali we responded to violence with peace. The bomb had a great impact on everyone, but it could not stop our performances."
The anthropologist Clifford Geertz called 19th-century Bali a theater-state, where performances were inextricably linked to politics, religion and the problems of everyday life. Similar theatrical impulses exist in 21st-century Balinese society, where almost every village temple ceremony includes some form of theatrical event, with clown narrators serving as mediators between the invisible world of gods and ancestors and the tangible one of current events. In improvised dialogues, the clowns grapple with issues like globalization and overdevelopment that endanger the island's Hindu-animist traditions.
In traditional Balinese mythology, an era marked by death and violence is referred to as "Kali Yuga" or "the time of Kali," a reference to the Hindu deity of destruction. Many Balinese performers have invoked Kali Yuga as a metaphor for the chaos brought on by the bombings. This context has encouraged the Balinese to forgo violent acts of revenge and respond instead with religious offerings designed to restore spiritual harmony to the universe.
In August, shortly after the trial that condemned a mechanic, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim, known as Amrozi, to death for his role in the Bali bombings, a troupe of actors assembled in the village of Kerobokan, a few miles north of Kuta, to put on a play in a temple courtyard. The plot was based on an ancient legend, but the clown narrators made numerous references to Amrozi, including a slapstick gag in which one character jumped in fright at the sound of a slamming door because he thought it was a terrorist attack. Anxiety of this type is a recurring source of comedy in Bali. "Every time somebody burps, I think it's a bomb," joked another clown.
Later, an actor in a buck-toothed mask ran aggressively into the audience. "Don't worry!" he shouted. "I'm not Amrozi." He then told a story about a black magic curse that had left shops without customers. As the characters in the play overcame the curse by performing ritual offerings, spectators staged similar ceremonies of renewal to exorcise evil and invoke prosperity. A procession of elderly women in sarongs snaked through the courtyard between the actors and the audience, while a white-bearded priest chanted mantras on a flower-covered shrine. The boundaries between the play and the audience dissolved further when a woman in the crowd began sobbing and flailing her arms. 
"She's in a trance," someone shouted, as a priest sprinkled holy water on her head to revive her. Within a few minutes other spectators began weeping, as if the temple were plagued by a contagion of communal sadness. All this occurred during the appearance of an actor portraying Sidha Karya, who wore the same mask of death and renewal that had evoked tears from onlookers at the Balinese ceremony in Lower Manhattan.
"The trances were proof of the ceremony's success," said Ketut Jagra, the actor who played Sidha Karya in the village. "The bomb brought us sadness, but it can also lead to good things. Maybe it is fortunate that the bomb exploded in Bali, because now, finally, the terrorists responsible for a bombing have been caught and put on trial."
Many performances in Bali feature a masked figure whose long, pointed nose is the caricature of a Westerner. Played by Wayan Juana last August in Denpasar, the character claimed to be part American and part Balinese, manifesting his anxiety about terrorism by chain smoking and bouncing his head up and down like a bobble-head doll gone berserk.
In their masked performances, Balinese clowns create a carnival of contradictions: identity is fluid, the living speak to the dead, East and West converge. And sometimes Balinese actors play the roles of Javanese Muslims.
"We want to welcome tourists, not terrorists," said an actress, Wayan Murniasih, to a masked actor playing a Javanese migrant worker in a performance in Kerambitan in southern Bali. After making a few puns on Amrozi's name, she offered to rent the worker a room in her house, "but only if you register with the local authorities first." The message seemed ambiguous: be kind to Muslims, but be sure they are registered with the police.
"It is easy to make an audience laugh, but it is hard to teach them something useful," said Mr. Windia, the actor who played the disembodied head. His most popular character is a clown figure in female drag named Ratu Jegeg, who is famous for comedy routines based on sexual innuendo. But Mr. Windia also peppers his racy monologues with information about free treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder. As he swiveled his hips in mock seduction during a performance, he listed the most common symptoms of severe stress. The information came from psychiatrists working with the International Medical Corps, a nonprofit organization that hires traditional performers to publicize counseling services.
"Balinese artists have always played an important role in maintaining the psychological balance of the community," said Dr. Denny Thong, a consultant to the medical corps and director of the Bangli State Psychiatric Hospital in northern Bali. "Without artists, the culture would collapse. The masked clowns are particularly good at capturing events of the moment and using jokes to soften the pain. The best way to relieve stress is to laugh at yourself."
Mr. Windia agreed: "We have always had stress in Bali, but now the source of our stress is more fierce. Our traditional repertory is full of stories about times in Balinese history when people were killed by black magic and natural disasters. These were metaphorical bombs, but now the bomb is here and it is real."

HEADLINE: Try It, It's Good For You 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER; MARK LANDLER, the European economic correspondent for The Times, is based in Frankfurt.

 BODY:
FOR parents like mine, who were born in Europe and live in the United States, it's a dream to be able to take one's children to see the Continent. Inspire their young minds with the elegance of Paris and the faded glory of Vienna, the lyricism of the opera and, when they are old enough, the earthier pleasures of French wine.
 Here is the reality: three kids in the back of a Peugeot station wagon, whining about another rainy weekend spent trudging through another dusty church with moth-eaten tapestries on the wall. 
 So it was for my parents, who spent years, and a chunk of their savings, carting my brother, sister and me around Europe. Museums, cathedrals, Roman ruins, opera houses, vineyards -- all were part of a tutorial that would turn us from crunchy Vermonters, with the snowmobile boots to prove it, into cultivated citizens of the world. 
Now I live in Germany, with a 5-year-old daughter in whom I hope to instill a love for the glories of European culture. Our first tentative forays around Europe have brought home to me how hard, even thankless, it must have been for my father and mother, who were born in Austria and Ireland respectively, to show us this world.
When my father moved our family from northern Vermont to Paris on a two-year assignment in the early 1980's, my mother tried instituting a weekly field trip to the Louvre. The idea was for us to see paintings by the Italian masters one week, 18th-century furniture the next, ranging beyond the greatest hits to savor the museum's hidden treasures.
Instead, my brother, Philip, and I used to clock our visits to see how quickly one could get in, look at Leonardo's "Mona Lisa," and race back out, with an obligatory backward glance at "Winged Victory." Crowds permitting, it could be done in about 15 minutes.
Then there was the disparity in interests.
A trip to Vienna was designed to nurture an appreciation for the music of Mozart and the imperial architecture of the Hapsburgs. We viewed it as a chance to document every Mercedes-Benz and BMW on the streets, calling out the model number and engine size in chirpy tones that must have driven my parents to consider pushing us under a streetcar.
They might have expected better luck during a driving tour of the vineyards in Provence. We were in high school by then, and thanks to France's laissez-faire policies on teenage drinking, were able to sample Chateauneuf-du-Pape at the wineries. Alas, our tastes ran more to Kronenbourg, which we sucked down by the liter in a cheap bar off the Champs-Elysees.
Sometimes one of our family trips scored, but it was usually not for the reasons my parents expected.
Amsterdam, for example, was of passing interest for its canals and tulips. But it was riveting to my brother and me for its red light district, where women in garish outfits perched in lighted windows.
We did summon up some enthusiasm for Rembrandt's "Nightwatch." But that was because my parents explained that a deranged intruder had slashed the painting in 1975. Having your teenage kids inspect an artwork for evidence of knife damage is not the most obvious way to encourage an appreciation of Rembrandt's rich hues, but hey, whatever works.
There are other tricks -- large and small -- that made potentially boring excursions more interesting to children.
For teenage boys, an afternoon at the bullfights in Madrid was well worth a morning enduring the El Grecos in the Prado (my sister, Juliet, found the spectacle stomach-turning).
An evening at the Paris opera could be sold with the promise of ice cream sundaes afterward at the Cafe de la Paix across the street. It also helps to choose an opera that goes down easy. My father recommends Puccini's " Boheme" as a good starter. 
For my wife, Angela, and me, the challenge has been to expose our daughter, Caroline, to a few of Europe's treasures while we are here, with the hope that she'll retain enough to make her want to go back when she is older.
Paris seemed the right place to start, not least because our daughter had gotten a taste of the city through Ludwig Bemelmans and his books about Madeline, the plucky schoolgirl. 
Angela hit upon the idea of using Madeline as a sort of tour guide. Caroline, clutching her book like a map of the stars' homes in Beverly Hills, visits the Paris landmarks that figure in her heroine's daily life.
She loves the Tuileries gardens facing the Louvre, with its duck pond, because Madeline frolics there. She can't cross a bridge without asking whether it is the one from which Madeline tumbled into the Seine, terrifying her guardian, Miss Clavel. The Eiffel Tower, when she first saw it last year, was the familiar thing that sticks up behind Madeline's house.
The house -- or, as it is invariably described in the stories, an "old house in Paris that was covered with vines" -- has become a wrinkle in our plan. We haven't been able to find the place, and our attempts to show Caroline reasonable likenesses of it don't fool her.
I know we'll have to level with her someday about Madeline, Miss Clavel and the vine-covered house. By then, though, I trust Paris will have won her over with its other charms and rituals. Here's hoping that doesn't include guzzling Kronenbourg or sprinting past "Winged Victory."

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-12-03; 
The (Agri)Cultural Contradictions Of Obesity

BYLINE:  By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan, a contributing writer for the magazine, teaches at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley.

 BODY:
Sometimes even complicated social problems turn out to be simpler than they look. Take America's "obesity epidemic," arguably the most serious public-health problem facing the country. Three of every five Americans are now overweight, and some researchers predict that today's children will be the first generation of Americans whose life expectancy will actually be shorter than that of their parents. The culprit, they say, is the health problems associated with obesity.
 You hear several explanations. Big food companies are pushing supersize portions of unhealthful foods on us and our children. We have devolved into a torpid nation of couch potatoes. The family dinner has succumbed to the fast-food outlet. All these explanations are true, as far as they go. But it pays to go a little further, to look for the cause behind the causes. Which, very simply, is this: when food is abundant and cheap, people will eat more of it and get fat. Since 1977, an American's average daily intake of calories has jumped by more than 10 percent. Those 200 or so extra calories have to go somewhere. But the interesting question is, Where, exactly, did all those extra calories come from in the first place? And the answer takes us back to the source of all calories: the farm. 
 It turns out that we have been here before, sort of, though the last great American binge involved not food, but alcohol. It came during the first decades of the 19th century, when Americans suddenly began drinking more than they ever had before or have since, going on a collective bender that confronted the young republic with its first major public-health crisis -- the obesity epidemic of its day. Corn whiskey, suddenly superabundant and cheap, was the drink of choice, and in the 1820's the typical American man was putting away half a pint of the stuff every day. That works out to more than five gallons of spirits a year for every American. The figure today is less than a gallon. 
As W.J. Rorabaugh tells the story in "The Alcoholic Republic," we drank the hard stuff at breakfast, lunch and dinner, before work and after and very often during. Employers were expected to supply spirits over the course of the workday; in fact, the modern coffee break began as a late-morning whiskey break called "the elevenses." (Just to pronounce it makes you sound tipsy.) Except for a brief respite Sunday mornings in church, Americans simply did not gather -- whether for a barn raising or quilting bee, corn husking or political campaign -- without passing the jug. Visitors from Europe -- hardly models of sobriety themselves -- marveled at the free flow of American spirits. "Come on then, if you love toping," the journalist William Cobbett wrote his fellow Englishmen in a dispatch from America. "For here you may drink yourself blind at the price of sixpence."
The results of all this toping were entirely predictable: a rising tide of public drunkenness, violence and family abandonment and a spike in alcohol-related diseases. Several of the founding fathers -- including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams -- denounced the excesses of the "alcoholic republic," inaugurating the American quarrel over drinking that would culminate a century later in Prohibition.
But the outcome of our national drinking binge is not nearly as relevant to our present predicament as its underlying cause. Which, put simply, was this: American farmers were producing way too much corn, especially in the newly settled areas west of the Appalachians, where fertile soil yielded one bumper crop after another. Much as it has today, the astounding productivity of American farmers proved to be their own worst enemy, as well as a threat to the public health. For when yields rise, the market is flooded with grain, and its price collapses. As a result, there is a surfeit of cheap calories that clever marketers sooner or later will figure out a way to induce us to consume.
In those days, the easiest thing to do with all that grain was to distill it. The Appalachian range made it difficult and expensive to transport surplus corn from the lightly settled Ohio River Valley to the more populous markets of the East, so farmers turned their corn into whiskey -- a more compact and portable "value-added commodity." In time, the price of whiskey plummeted, to the point that people could afford to drink it by the pint, which is precisely what they did.
Nowadays, for somewhat different reasons, corn (along with most other agricultural commodities) is again abundant and cheap, and once again the easiest thing to do with the surplus is to turn it into more compact and portable value-added commodities: corn sweeteners, cornfed meat and chicken and highly processed foods of every description. The Alcoholic Republic has given way to the Republic of Fat, but in both cases, before the clever marketing, before the change in lifestyle, stands a veritable mountain of cheap grain. Until we somehow deal with this surfeit of calories coming off the farm, it is unlikely that even the most well-intentioned food companies or public-health campaigns will have much success changing the way we eat. 
The underlying problem is agricultural overproduction, and that problem (while it understandably never receives quite as much attention as underproduction) is almost as old as agriculture itself. Even in the Old Testament, there's talk about how to deal not only with the lean times but also with the fat: the Bible advises creation of a grain reserve to smooth out the swings of the market in food. The nature of farming has always made it difficult to synchronize supply and demand. For one thing, there are the vagaries of nature: farmers may decide how many acres they will plant, but precisely how much food they produce in any year is beyond their control. 
The rules of classical economics just don't seem to operate very well on the farm. When prices fall, for example, it would make sense for farmers to cut back on production, shrinking the supply of food to drive up its price. But in reality, farmers do precisely the opposite, planting and harvesting more food to keep their total income from falling, a practice that of course depresses prices even further. What's rational for the individual farmer is disastrous for farmers as a group. Add to this logic the constant stream of improvements in agricultural technology (mechanization, hybrid seed, agrochemicals and now genetically modified crops -- innovations all eagerly seized on by farmers hoping to stay one step ahead of falling prices by boosting yield), and you have a sure-fire recipe for overproduction -- another word for way too much food. 
All this would be bad enough if the government weren't doing its best to make matters even worse, by recklessly encouraging farmers to produce even more unneeded food. Absurdly, while one hand of the federal government is campaigning against the epidemic of obesity, the other hand is actually subsidizing it, by writing farmers a check for every bushel of corn they can grow. We have been hearing a lot lately about how our agricultural policy is undermining our foreign-policy goals, forcing third-world farmers to compete against a flood tide of cheap American grain. Well, those same policies are also undermining our public-health goals by loosing a tide of cheap calories at home. 
While it is true that our farm policies are making a bad situation worse, adding mightily to the great mountain of grain, this hasn't always been the case with government support of farmers, and needn't be the case even now. For not all support programs are created equal, a fact that has been conveniently overlooked in the new free-market campaign to eliminate them. 
In fact, farm programs in America were originally created as a way to shrink the great mountain of grain, and for many years they helped to do just that. The Roosevelt administration established the nation's first program of farm support during the Depression, though not, as many people seem to think, to feed a hungry nation. Then, as now, the problem was too much food, not too little; New Deal farm policy was designed to help farmers reeling from a farm depression caused by what usually causes a farm depression: collapsing prices due to overproduction. In Churdan, Iowa, recently, a corn farmer named George Naylor told me about the winter day in 1933 his father brought a load of corn to the grain elevator, where "the price had been 10 cents a bushel the day before," and was told that suddenly, "the elevator wasn't buying at any price." The price of corn had fallen to zero.
New Deal farm policy, quite unlike our own, set out to solve the problem of overproduction. It established a system of price supports, backed by a grain reserve, that worked to keep surplus grain off the market, thereby breaking the vicious cycle in which farmers have to produce more every year to stay even.
It is worth recalling how this system worked, since it suggests one possible path out of the current subsidy morass. Basically, the federal government set and supported a target price (based on the actual cost of production) for storable commodities like corn. When the market price dropped below the target, a farmer was given an option: rather than sell his harvest at the low price, he could take out what was called a "nonrecourse loan," using his corn as collateral, for the full value of his crop. The farmer then stored his corn until the market improved, at which point he sold it and used the proceeds to repay the loan. If the market failed to improve that year, the farmer could discharge his debt simply by handing his corn over to the government, which would add it to something called, rather quaintly, the "ever-normal granary." This was a grain reserve managed by the U.S.D.A., which would sell from it whenever prices spiked (during a bad harvest, say), thereby smoothing out the vicissitudes of the market and keeping the cost of food more or less steady -- or "ever normal." 
This wasn't a perfect system by any means, but it did keep cheap grain from flooding the market and by doing so supported the prices farmers received. And it did this at a remarkably small cost to the government, since most of the loans were repaid. Even when they weren't, and the government was left holding the bag (i.e., all those bushels of collateral grain), the U.S.D.A. was eventually able to unload it, and often did so at a profit. The program actually made money in good years. Compare that with the current subsidy regime, which costs American taxpayers about $19 billion a year and does virtually nothing to control production.
So why did we ever abandon this comparatively sane sort of farm policy? Politics, in a word. The shift from an agricultural-support system designed to discourage overproduction to one that encourages it dates to the early 1970's -- to the last time food prices in America climbed high enough to generate significant political heat. That happened after news of Nixon's 1972 grain deal with the Soviet Union broke, a disclosure that coincided with a spell of bad weather in the farm belt. Commodity prices soared, and before long so did supermarket prices for meat, milk, bread and other staple foods tied to the cost of grain. Angry consumers took to the streets to protest food prices and staged a nationwide meat boycott to protest the high cost of hamburger, that American birthright. Recognizing the political peril, Nixon ordered his secretary of agriculture, Earl (Rusty) Butz, to do whatever was necessary to drive down the price of food.
Butz implored America's farmers to plant their fields "fence row to fence row" and set about dismantling 40 years of farm policy designed to prevent overproduction. He shuttered the ever-normal granary, dropped the target price for grain and inaugurated a new subsidy system, which eventually replaced nonrecourse loans with direct payments to farmers. The distinction may sound technical, but in effect it was revolutionary. For instead of lending farmers money so they could keep their grain off the market, the government offered to simply cut them a check, freeing them to dump their harvests on the market no matter what the price. 
The new system achieved exactly what it was intended to: the price of food hasn't been a political problem for the government since the Nixon era. Commodity prices have steadily declined, and in the perverse logic of agricultural economics, production has increased, as farmers struggle to stay solvent. As you can imagine, the shift from supporting agricultural prices to subsidizing much lower prices has been a boon to agribusiness companies because it slashes the cost of their raw materials. That's why Big Food, working with the farm-state Congressional delegations it lavishly supports, consistently lobbies to maintain a farm policy geared to high production and cheap grain. (It doesn't hurt that those lightly populated farm states exert a disproportionate influence in Washington, since it takes far fewer votes to elect a senator in Kansas than in California. That means agribusiness can presumably "buy" a senator from one of these underpopulated states for a fraction of what a big-state senator costs.) 
But as we're beginning to recognize, our cheap-food farm policy comes at a high price: first there's the $19 billion a year the government pays to keep the whole system afloat; then there's the economic misery that the dumping of cheap American grain inflicts on farmers in the developing world; and finally there's the obesity epidemic at home -- which most researchers date to the mid-70's, just when we switched to a farm policy consecrated to the overproduction of grain. Since that time, farmers in the United States have managed to produce 500 additional calories per person every day; each of us is, heroically, managing to pack away about 200 of those extra calories per day. Presumably the other 300 -- most of them in the form of surplus corn -- get dumped on overseas markets or turned into ethanol. 
Cheap corn, the dubious legacy of Earl Butz, is truly the building block of the "fast-food nation." Cheap corn, transformed into high-fructose corn syrup, is what allowed Coca-Cola to move from the svelte 8-ounce bottle of soda ubiquitous in the 70's to the chubby 20-ounce bottle of today. Cheap corn, transformed into cheap beef, is what allowed McDonald's to supersize its burgers and still sell many of them for no more than a dollar. Cheap corn gave us a whole raft of new highly processed foods, including the world-beating chicken nugget, which, if you study its ingredients, you discover is really a most ingenious transubstantiation of corn, from the cornfed chicken it contains to the bulking and binding agents that hold it together. 
You would have thought that lower commodity prices would represent a boon to consumers, but it doesn't work out that way, not unless you believe a 32-ounce Big Gulp is a great deal. When the raw materials for food become so abundant and cheap, the clever strategy for a food company is not necessarily to lower prices -- to do that would only lower its revenues. It makes much more sense to compete for the consumer's dollar by increasing portion sizes -- and as Greg Critser points out in his recent book "Fat Land," the bigger the portion, the more food people will eat. So McDonald's tempts us by taking a 600-calorie meal and jacking it up to 1,550 calories. Compared with that of the marketing, packaging and labor, the cost of the added ingredients is trivial.
Such cheap raw materials also argue for devising more and more highly processed food, because the real money will never be in selling cheap corn (or soybeans or rice) but in "adding value" to that commodity. Which is one reason that in the years since the nation moved to a cheap-food farm policy, the number and variety of new snack foods in the supermarket have ballooned. The game is in figuring out how to transform a penny's worth of corn and additives into a $3 bag of ginkgo biloba-fortified brain-function-enhancing puffs, or a dime's worth of milk and sweeteners into Swerve, a sugary new "milk based" soft drink to be sold in schools. It's nocoincidence that Big Food has suddenly "discovered" how to turn milk into junk food: the government recently made deep cuts in the dairy-farm program, and as a result milk is nearly as cheap a raw material as water.
As public concern over obesity mounts, the focus of political pressure has settled on the food industry and its marketing strategies -- supersizing portions, selling junk food to children, lacing products with transfats and sugars. Certainly Big Food bears some measure of responsibility for our national eating disorder -- a reality that a growing number of food companies have publicly accepted. In recent months, Kraft, McDonald's and Coca-Cola have vowed to change marketing strategies and even recipes in an effort to help combat obesity and, no doubt, ward off the coming tide of litigation.
There is an understandable reluctance to let Big Food off the hook. Yet by devising ever more ingenious ways to induce us to consume the surplus calories our farmers are producing, the food industry is only playing by a set of rules written by our government. (And maintained, it is true, with the industry's political muscle.) The political challenge now is to rewrite those rules, to develop a new set of agricultural policies that don't subsidize overproduction -- and overeating. For unless we somehow deal with the mountain of cheap grain that makes the Happy Meal and the Double Stuf Oreo such "bargains," the calories are guaranteed to keep coming.

No Room to Vroom: New Memories of Gridlock Past

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
IT'S little more than a mile from 34th Street to 57th Street, but the other day it took Muhammad Zamir, a taxi driver of five years, nearly an hour to cover that distance up the Avenue of the Americas. At first he blamed last month's presidential visit to the United Nations, which brought parts of Midtown traffic to a standstill. But in Mr. Zamir's opinion, traffic has yet to improve. 
 "It's not moving out there," Mr. Zamir said on Tuesday during a cigarette break near a gas station on Eighth Avenue. "Traffic has gotten worse." 
 Some transportation experts agree. They say traffic in Midtown and other areas is nearing levels not seen since the gridlock alert days before Sept. 11, 2001. 
 "Things are getting back to those pre-9/11 levels, as New York gets restored and business gets better," said Samuel Schwartz, a private traffic consultant. 
True, October tends to be a busy month, with schools and offices back in full fall swing after the summer lull. And evidence of greater congestions is at this point largely anecdotal, and may to some extent reflect the perennial frustrations of cabdrivers who sit in traffic for a living, and frantic New Yorkers who want to get to their destinations yesterday. 
 But some data suggests that, in fact, more vehicles are entering Manhattan. According to the most recent figures from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the number of cars using the Queens-Midtown Tunnel increased to 15.7 million in the first seven months of this year, compared with 15.3 million in the same period last year. 
 The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel is also busier, carrying 10.4 million vehicles compared with 7.6 million during those same periods. And the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported that last year New York-bound traffic over its bridges and tunnels jumped to 125.2 million vehicles from 121.9 million in 2001. 
 "It does seem to us that the traffic is coming back, but not as much as before 9/11," said Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation. The agency will know more within a few weeks, when its traffic figures for the early fall come out. 
 For a period after the terrorist attack, driving in Manhattan felt like a walk in the park. The economy slowed, and single-occupant cars were barred from entering Manhattan. In the year following the attack, traffic in the city fell 4 to 9 percent. 
 But now some people point to blaring horns and rising tempers, and predict more congestion to come. "If people think that October is bad," Mr. Schwartz said, "just wait until November and December."

For Media Training, A Focus on Defense

BYLINE:  By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
JENNY CRAIG INC. has had its share of ups and downs in the last few years. After three years of shrinking sales and profits, and a backlash from franchisees when it signed Monica Lewinsky to be a spokeswoman for its weight-loss plans, the company was acquired by an investor group and is now profitable, according to a spokeswoman. 
 Press coverage of Jenny Craig has varied with its fortunes. But now company executives have prepared for whatever hard questions the future holds. Three months ago, the company hired a media expert who set up training sessions for senior executives. 
 "When you run a company like this, which offers a very personal service and is very public, you want to be prepared for tough challenges," said James P. Evans, the new chief executive of Jenny Craig. Although Mr. Evans has been receiving occasional media training for years, many of the less seasoned executives on his team found the recent sessions to be eye-openers. "Some of my senior people thought, 'Wow, I have to really think my way through this from now on; I need to be prepared,"' he said.
 As public scrutiny of corporate executives has intensified over the last two years, growing numbers of executives have been seeking out such training, either for the first time or to bolster what they already know. As a result, some experts say, the public may be less informed than it once was. 
 Training "teaches executives not used to dealing with the media how to get their point of view across in a straightforward way," said Michael Delli Carpini, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. "But there is a dark side to the training, too. If there are things you really don't want known, media training will teach you how best to avoid releasing that kind of information. I think a lot of media training now leads to overcontrol of information."
 At the height of the economic boom in the 1990's, executives generally received adulatory press coverage, and media trainers say the emphasis then was simply on getting out the corporate message. Now, with the public apprehensive and suspicious, the strategies are largely defensive. 
 Davia Temin, a former head of corporate marketing for GE Capital and now president of Temin & Company, a marketing, public affairs and crisis management firm in New York, regularly helps corporate executives navigate ethical and legal crises in what she said was today's "hypercritical" climate. "The level of savvyness that senior executives have to exhibit in talking to the press at this point in time is unprecedented," she said. "There are things I would have told a client they could say to the press four years ago that I would not advise them to say now." 
 Sally Stewart, a former journalist and author of "Media Training 101," says many of her new clients want to say only what can be supported with fact, rather than "spinning" information. "I am getting people coming to me now for remedial media training, because they want to get rid of the bad habits," she said.
 Neal Schmale, chief financial officer of Sempra Energy, an energy services holding company based in San Diego, receives media training regularly because his industry is often in the spotlight. He said Sempra, like other companies, has had to deal with more scrutiny recently.
 Mr. Schmale's latest media training taught him how to understand his audience so he could better tailor his answers. In a discussion with an industry analyst, he will often give a lengthy response to a question, he said. "If it's a reporter, I have to be a lot more focused," he said. "I can't get into the kind of detail I give when I speak with someone familiar with the industry. I don't give out more detail or information than a reporter can understand or use." 
 Robert Walters, the chief economist for Quicken Loans, a mortgage lender in Livonia, Mich., gives 20 to 25 interviews a week for radio, television and newspapers. He said he began media training a few years ago, but his most recent session, in June, made him more focused and careful. "I make sure that even the tone of what I'm saying is conveying what I want," said Mr. Walters, who speaks mostly about mortgage finance.
 He also tries harder than ever to steer clear of controversial subjects. In the last several months, he has declined requests for interviews regarding the problems at Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage corporation, which buys mortgages from lenders like Quicken Loans. In June, after having to restate three years of results, Freddie Mac fired its president; two other top executives left soon after. 
 "Here's a company that has enormous influence on our industry and is going through a difficult time," Mr. Walters said. "When I was asked to comment on how they got into trouble or about the politics of it, I kept my opinions to myself. There's no sense in sticking your neck out if you don't have to."
 EXECUTIVES' newly cautious posture means the public is likely to lose out, according to Ronald R. Sims, a business professor at the College of William & Mary and author of "Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility: Why Giants Fall." "That's the downside to paranoia: the public wants more information but it's more tightly controlled than ever before," he said. "And the less information the public has the less they are able to understand companies and make informed decisions about them." 
 The good news about executives' newfound caution, Ms. Temin said, is that the public receives more trustworthy information. "You no longer get the kind of overblown statements of success that used to come out of Enron or WorldCom," she said. "You can't hyperbolize the way you could a few years ago."
 Lamar Reinsch, director of the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University, agreed. Even if the public is getting less information, what it does receive is far more accurate, he said.
 "I think it's much healthier for business if executives are thoughtful about what they say and when they say it," he said. "I'm sure there are some who use media training to obscure things they might have previously said, but my feeling is a far larger number of executives are using these new skills to represent their organizations more effectively and honestly."

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
IT'S not news that small-capitalization stocks have been burning up the track this year. But it may come as a surprise that these smaller stocks have outperformed their bigger brothers for more than three years.
 The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small stocks, stumbled a bit at the end of September but is up 35.5 percent so far this year. It has trounced the gains posted by the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 Satya Pradhuman, small-cap strategist at Merrill Lynch, talked about the sector last week. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. What has prompted the stunning performance in small caps so far this year?

A. Three separate events have been going on: the gains in small caps are broadening, taking in more and more companies. And in March, risk came back into vogue. These two events coming together not only helped the Nasdaq market and technology stocks, but all small-cap stocks.
 The third element is the liquidity premium. Since March, market volatility has been cut in half, which means that people can more easily trade less liquid assets. Low volatility creates a sweet spot for small-cap investing.

Q. Can the small-cap run continue?

A. We can make a very good relative performance case, but I don't think the next 6 to 12 months will be as attractive as the past 6 to 8 months.

Q. Why have small caps done so well, and what is going to slow the momentum?

A. Even with the run-up we have seen this year, today small caps as a group relative to large caps are still selling below the levels reached in 1990, which was the end of a seven-year bear market in small caps.
 Second, the low cost of capital is working in favor of small caps. The spread, or difference, between what high-cap borrowers pay and what small-cap borrowers are charged is improving sharply in favor of small-cap firms. If they can get capital cheaply, they can post dramatic growth.
 The thing that is turning against them is volatility in the market. We think it is likely to pick up. It already has in the fixed-income and currency markets, and we think it will move into stocks. A tactical risk model we have started to turn negative two months ago. That means the liquidity premium may widen.

Q. Does the weakening of the dollar hurt small caps?

A. The foreign revenue exposure for large caps is about twice as big as for small caps. As the dollar weakens, that bolsters the blue-chip earnings story.
 But the trade side is just one side of the game. The other part is the portfolio part. 
 If you are a Japanese investor with assets in the U.S., how much pain can you stomach as the dollar weakens against the yen? At some point investors will pull assets from the U.S. And based on a study we did a few months ago, 90 percent of the assets invested by foreign investors are in large-cap products. Only 10 percent are in small caps. So, a weakening currency may do more damage to the S.&P. 500 than the Russell 2000. 

Q. Is there any reason to think that as the economy gains momentum, large caps will outperform small caps?

A. There is an old saw that goes: "small" when the economy is strong, but "big" when the economy is weak. I don't think that is necessarily the case. We have seen periods when the economy contracted and small caps did well. Just witness the last few years.
 Small firms are more cyclically inclined than large caps. But underneath the economic cyclicality argument is the credit story, and I think that is a more relevant driver. 

Q. Technology and biotechnology stocks have been the biggest winners in small-cap land so far this year. Which sectors and stocks do you like now?

A. Everybody is caught up in tech and biotech, but small caps have been outperforming large caps in every sector.
 If we are right about some of the changes we see coming, pockets of the small-cap market that have been at least partly ignored include energy, where we thinkmargins will be very good, simply because of the move in oil prices. 
 Another area is health care, especially hospitals. This is one of the few areas of the economy with pricing power. Health care service sector inflation is still around 7 percent, which we think is a good thing. 
 Right now we have about 16 names on our small-cap buy list. Of those, in the auto-related space we like a company called American Axle. The stock's valuations are very compelling, and earnings expectations are very good. 
 In energy, we like a number of exploration and production companies, like Newfield Exploration, Pogo Producing and Energy Partners. And in health care, we like two rural hospital operators, Community Health and Province.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH -- Lisa O. Rapuano; 
Legg Mason Special Investment Trust

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
THERE are fewer bargains in the stock market now than there were a year ago, says Lisa O. Rapuano, manager of the $2.9 billion Legg Mason Special Investment Trust.
 At current prices, Ms. Rapuano said, it is particularly important to pay attention to company fundamentals, because a strong economy is only half the equation. "A rising tide doesn't lift all boats, just strong businesses," she said. 
 The fund returned 58.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, versus a gain of 1.6 percent for its category of midcap blend funds, which own a mix of growth and value stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 8.2 percent in that time, according to Morningstar Inc.
 The fund returned 77.4 percent in the last 12 months, versus gains of 46.3 percent for its category and 35.8 percent for the S.&P. 500. 
 Ms. Rapuano, 38, is director of research for Legg Mason Funds Management, the fund's adviser, and is based in Baltimore.
 She picks the fund's 30 to 40 stocks mostly from American companies with market capitalization of $1 billion to $10 billion. She aims to buy at what she sees as significant discounts -- when a company's stock is temporarily mispriced because of a missed quarterly earnings target, for example, or a poor acquisition.
 To find low-priced companies, she checks for a variety of factors including low ratios of price to earnings and price to free cash flow. She also seeks potential purchases among companies with large amounts of insider buying or unusually high trading volume or that make the news because of regulatory scrutiny or other controversies.
 "We look for companies that are in extreme circumstances," Ms. Rapuano said, "and then we look for reasons why people may be selling more shares than they should."
 She calculates what a business is worth per share, what she calls a "central tendency of value," by forecasting a company's earnings for the next 3, 5 and 10 years. 
 After she buys, she likes to hold stocks for the long term. Last year, the fund's turnover was just 19 percent, compared with an average of 147 percent for midcap value funds, according to Morningstar.
 She started buying shares of the Pepsi Bottling Group, based in Somers, N.Y., in April, and has paid $20.52, on average, for the entire position. The stock now trades at $21.56 compared with her calculated value of $30.
 In March, after Pepsi Bottling announced that it would miss its first-quarter earnings projection, the stock fell to $18 from $23, prompting Ms. Rapuano to buy. She called bottling a "stable, low-growth business -- what everybody wanted three years ago in the bear market." In 2003, she added, "people started selling stable businesses and buying technology."
 The fund bought shares of Nextel Communications in March 2002 and has paid $5.10 a share, on average, for the entire position. The stock now trades at $21.48; her calculated value is $28. The shares were mispriced, she said, because people mistakenly believed Nextel was an "also-ran" in the cellphone services industry. But its walkie-talkie telephone technology has helped it stay profitable, she added, and management has been strengthening the company balance sheet by retiring debt.
 Investor concerns about an anemic advertising market and a weak balance sheet hurt the share price of another fund holding, the Interpublic Group of Companies, the ad agency giant, which dropped to less than $10 in early 2003 from almost $34 in May 2002. "It didn't look cheap based on reported earnings because earnings had declined so much," she said. "But it's a cyclical company, and shares were selling at a significant discount based on future earnings." 
 Ms. Rapuano started buying shares in October 2002. She paid $10.50, on average. The shares closed Friday at $13.97, compared with her calculated value of $18.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 12 about investing in the Legg Mason Special Investment Trust misstated its average annual return for the three years ended on Oct. 9. It was 8.1 percent, not 58.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Balancing theSeesaw With Commodities

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
WHILE commodities can be extremely volatile in price, investing in them can help smooth out the performance of an investment portfolio, some financial advisers say, because commodities tend to do well when stocks and bonds decline. 
 Two mutual funds are geared toward investors who want to bet on commodity prices without forging into the daunting futures markets on their own. The Oppenheimer Real Asset fund tries to mirror the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, while the Pimco Commodity Real Return Strategy fund tries to track the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index. 
 The Oppenheimer fund has gained 16.3 percent this year, compared with 14.7 percent for the Goldman index. The Pimco fund opened to individual investors last November and has gained 16.6 percent this year, compared with 13.6 percent in the Dow Jones-AIG index. 
 Like the commodity markets they follow, both funds tend to be quite volatile. But they can diversify a portfolio because commodities do not often move in lock step with stocks or bonds, said Kevin Baum, manager of the Oppenheimer fund. In the last 30 years, for example, there were only two years in which the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Goldman commodity index both had net annual losses. 
 "That just speaks to the beauty of using multiple asset classes," Mr. Baum said.
 A crucial distinction between the Oppenheimer and Pimco funds is their weighting of oil and natural gas. 
 The Dow Jones index used by Pimco limits all sectors, including energy, to a maximum of one-third of the index. The Goldman index used by the Oppenheimer fund has no such limit. Oil and gas account for about two-thirds of its value. 
 Speaking of the Oppenheimer fund, Dan McNeela, a fund analyst at Morningstar Inc., said, "If you believe prices are cyclical in nature, you will end up having a high stake in oil when oil prices may be peaking." 
 Mr. McNeela worries that some investors may be lured by the recent returns of these funds, which are intended to mimic commodity prices. "I would not want to see investors rushing into these funds if oil went to $40 a barrel," he said. Oil was trading around $31.95 a barrel on Friday, after rising 9 percent over the last year. In any case, he would not recommend putting more than 5 percent of a portfolio into a natural resources fund.
 Lewis J. Altfest, a financial planner in New York, has similar concerns. He says commodity prices have risen too far too fast this year, and he advises waiting until the funds have given back roughly half of their gains over the last 12 months before putting new money into either of them. "We're not yet in an inflationary environment," he said, "and we have already had a movement in commodities in anticipation of inflation."
 That said, Mr. Altfest does like the idea of using commodities as a hedge against inflation, which he believes will inevitably rise over the next few years. 
 He said that the Oppenheimer fund would probably do better when energy prices were soaring, but that the more-diversified Pimco fund might be a better long-term hedge against inflation.
 The two funds operate quite differently.
 The Oppenheimer fund primarily holds the bonds of natural resources companies, and futures contracts in commodities as diverse as oil, wheat and pork bellies. The fund is actively managed to try to beat its benchmark, the Goldman index, although it has often fallen short of it. Its performance has been roughly in line with the natural resources category this year.
 Pimco runs an index fund that enters into swap contracts, which are based on the price of a commodity at some future date. The fund receives money if the commodity rises, and pays money if it falls. To back the swap contracts with collateral, the fund holds Treasury inflation-protected securities, called TIPS. These pay bondholders a fixed rate plus the change in the Consumer Price Index.
 "TIPS protect you from total inflation, whether it's expected or not," said Robert J. Greer, the product manager who developed the Pimco index fund. "Commodities protect you from unexpected inflation because it isn't already priced into the futures."
 BUT Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in New York, said that both funds gave him sticker shock. The Pimco fund has a 5.5 percent load, or sales charge, and annual operating expenses of 1.24 percent, and the Oppenheimer fund has a 5.75 percent load and expenses of 1.68 percent.
 Mr. Schatsky won't put any of his clients' assets into a commodity fund until the cost of ownership drops, he said, and he thinks that may not happen until more funds are started.
 "When you have a lack of competition in some esoteric asset class like commodities, they tend to be more expensive," he said, "and that's a real drag on performance."

Who'll Sit atthe Boomers' Desks?

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the second Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DURING the Clinton boom years of the late 1990's, in one of the tightest labor markets in memory, corporate America was warned that if it did not cultivate older workers, they would take their skills and move on.
 One recession and one so-called jobless recovery later, some questions naturally arise: Was that warning ill founded? Was the tight job market at the end of the 90's an anomaly? Will chronically high unemployment be the norm for the near future? 
 The answers appear to be no, no and no.
 In fact, the current level of unemployment, which has economists and politicians in a lather, is likely to be the real anomaly. Conditions in the late 90's may have been a reflection of job markets to come. And they are coming very quickly. 
 The reason, of course, is that the big baby-boom generation is starting to retire. Its oldest members are about 57 and will be 65 in 2011. There simply aren't enough workers behind the boomers in the labor supply pipeline to fill their jobs. Employers will have to try to retain older workers in some capacity or lure retired workers back into the work force. Companies that have treated their workers badly or engaged in even the subtlest forms of age discrimination will regret it.
 So will companies that just ignore the problem. "It's stunning how many corporations and chief executives have no idea what's coming; they're so focused on their next quarter's numbers," said Paul Kaihla, a senior writer for the magazine Business 2.0. Mr. Kaihla wrote the cover article, "The Coming Job Boom," in the September issue.
 "Some smart companies that know this is coming are treating their workers well during this downturn and trying to retain older workers," he said. 
 Mr. Kaihla calls the situation a "retirement time bomb" that will gut the ranks of managers and skilled workers, particularly in technology. He cited two companies -- Intel and SAS Institute -- that are likely to be hit hard but are preparing to cope with the problem. "SAS, where 25 percent of its workers will hit retirement age this decade, is a poster child of how to treat workers well," he said. "It is designing policies to come up with contracts or flexible hours for older workers. Intel, where 15 percent will reach retirement age this decade, is retaining links with its retired workers, knowing that it may have to turn to them when the crisis strikes."
 The wedge of this labor crisis is opening now, as some boomers take early retirement. In fact, Mr. Kaihla says these early retirees are one reason the unemployment rate is in the 6 percent range, instead of 8 percent as in some previous downturns. 
 "The labor shortage has been masked by recession," he said. "By 2005 it'll be in full swing. By 2010 there will be a gap of five to seven million workers, depending on whose projections you accept." He said some projections show that gap swelling to a canyon of 14 million by 2020.
 "You can't have the vast majority of your prime-age work force retire and not have it have an effect," Mr. Kaihla said. "Always before, the generation coming in was larger than the previous one. That's not the case now. The feeder pool isn't providing the kind of natural growth we've always had in the work force."
 He also noted that the growth rate for education among workers has leveled off at about 60 percent -- meaning that this share of workers has some college education. "This is likely to get only marginally higher," he added.
 Nowhere is the potential worker shortage more pronounced, Mr. Kaihla said, than at federal agencies like the Defense Department, where half the civilian workers are scheduled to retire this decade.
 He says that the coming labor shortage will put an end to outsourcing as a contentious labor issue, and that Congress will increase the number of skilled foreign workers allowed into the country. But neither outsourcing nor immigration will make a big dent in the problem, he added.
 What does all this mean for the economy? "It means we're probably going to have to settle for slower economic growth," Mr. Kaihla said. 
 Some economists, however, aren't so sure. Henry J. Aaron and Gary Burtless, senior fellows at the Brookings Institution in Washington, cite the flexibility of the American work force as a factor that may soften the effects of boomer retirements. "Workers may take higher-level jobs at a younger age than we have traditionally seen," Mr. Burtless said.
 Both economists, though, agreed that the leveling off of the education rate among workers could be a problem as employers try to fill positions for skilled workers and managers.
 Much of this, of course, is good news for workers -- especially older, skilled ones -- and bad news for employers. "This will surely put an end to any forms of age discrimination," Mr. Kaihla said. "Companies that engage in it are so blind; they are shooting themselves in the foot. Within a couple of years or so they will be fighting for many of these workers and have to pay a premium for them."
 For example, he said, the current jobless recovery has really been a productivity recovery. "There are a lot of angry workers, because instead of hiring new workers, many companies have worked existing workers -- many of them older -- harder and longer," he said. "The minute the labor market rebounds, they're gone -- just at the time we're entering this period of labor shortage."
 "There has never been," he added, "a clear example in modern economic times of what we are facing." 
 BEVERLY GOLDBERG, a vice president of the Century Foundation, a research institute in New York, says the projections for labor shortages are likely to be pretty much on target. "Demographics don't change," she said.
 Ms. Goldberg, the author of "Age Works: What Corporate America Must Do to Survive the Graying of the Work Force" (Free Press, 2002), said Europe would have more difficulty than the United States because its immigration policies are more restrictive and its birth rates lower. She added, however, that one problem in trying to import workers was that they often lacked the necessary skills to replace older workers.
 She said the shortage was already painfully evident in occupations like teaching, where people often retire after 30 years. "Teachers are retiring in astounding numbers," she said. "New York City is combing the world looking for teachers."
 She added: "At the moment, more companies than not are lulled into a false sense of security. They have to face the fact that they're next."

Who Wins and Who Loses if the Dollar Keeps Falling?

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A FALLING dollar has always been seen as a benefit for Americans with money abroad. A weaker dollar means that foreign profits will be higher and losses smaller.
 But as long as the dollar decline is orderly and restrained, it is also likely to be good for Americans who stay invested in stocks at home, although it won't help those in bonds. 
 Some stocks that could do well in a declining-dollar environment include Microsoft, Intel, Ford, ExxonMobil and Citigroup. Gold and gold stocks should rally if the dollar keeps falling. And, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index could climb 3 percent while the Nadaq 100 index could rise almost 5 percent if the dollar falls an additional 5 percent against the euro. 
 This analysis is based on the correlation between recent dollar moves and the stock and bond markets. It was done by RiskMetrics, which uses the same kind of analysis that many companies, investment firms and central banks employ to see what might happen if one market sector made a big move.
 RiskMetrics is assuming that the dollar will fall 5.5 percent from where it was on Friday against the euro and 7.8 percent against the Japanese yen, according to Mike Thompson, a risk strategist at the company. Those declines, over an unspecified period, would leave the euro valued at $1.25 and the yen at 100 to the dollar and are in line with near-term dollar forecasts. The dollar has already slumped 7 percent against the euro and 7.2 percent against the yen since August.
 An economist might say the outlook for stocks is positive because a fall in the dollar would help the struggling economy rebound in two ways. First, a weaker dollar makes American exports more competitive abroad, bolstering sales and corporate profits. And a weaker dollar makes imports less competitive against America's domestic businesses, also helping sales and corporate profits. In the bond market, however, a dollar decline would make it harder to attract the foreign investment needed to cover the country's $500 billion current account deficit. So interest rates would have to move higher to attract more money from abroad. 
 But this is not the analysis that is behind the predictions of RiskMetrics. Those predictions rely entirely on the statistical relationship between the movement in one market and other markets.
 Mr. Thompson says the correlations cover the last 250 trading days ended on Wednesday but emphasize market performance in the last 11 of those days. How stocks and bonds moved as the dollar rose or fell during that period is translated into a prediction of how they would perform given a set decline in the dollar's value. 
 Under this analysis, the S.&P.'s metals and mining index, including gold and nonprecious-metals companies, could rise almost 14 percent during the dollar's decline. Indexes covering electronics, semiconductors, software, communications equipment and information technology could gain 6 to 9 percent. Footwear stocks could rally 9 percent, and hotel and lodging stocks could be up nearly 8 percent.
 The few losing sectors would include airlines, off 0.5 percent; telecom services and telephones, off 0.9 percent to 1.4 percent; and photography, down 6 percent. 
 The stocks expected to be the best performers are Concord EFS, Monsanto, Cendant, the American International Group and the Anthem Group, all predicted to be up more than 60 percent. Only 63 stocks in the S.&P. 500 index are forecast to decline by at least 1 percent. Navistar International, FleetBoston Financial, Pitney Bowes, BMC Software and the Pall Corporation are expected to drop by more than 28 percent.
 As for bonds, RiskMetrics says the total return for the Lehman Aggregate bond index could slip about 0.6 percent. 
 These predictions, Mr. Thompson said, "are, at best, approximations." But they do give a sense of direction, as long as there is no unexpected shock that overwhelms the recent pattern of market performance. And that means a dollar decline is right on right now.

The French, Wallowing in Self-Doubt

 BODY:
WHILE the French may appear to Americans as haughtily self-confident, the French themselves are in the depths of self-doubt, even self-loathing. At least that is the impression given by a pile of gloom-filled books published in the last year. Most of the attention has centered on a current best seller, "La France Qui Tombe" (Perrin), variously translated as "Falling France" and "France in Free Fall," by Nicolas Baverez, a lawyer and economist. Mr. Baverez, whose work carries weight in France because he is also no fan of the United States, has harsh words for nearly every French institution. 
 Excerpts follow, translated by Alain Delaqueriere of The New York Times. 
 The United States presents a textbook case: it reacted to the new global political and economic chaos by radically revising its principles of international action and by forcing its public policies to be flexible, so that it can intervene in real time. France's position has been exactly the reverse: it doesn't start with the idea that everything must change so that nothing changes, but rather that the more things change, the less France ought to change. . . . This immobility is political, economic and social, as well as intellectual and moral; it has plunged France into decline.
There is an emptiness in the Fifth Republic's institutions, creating a vacuum for demagogy and extremists on the right and left. The results are there. Beneath the flamboyant opposition to the Bush administration and warlike speeches about the re-establishment of government authority, one sees the reality -- increasing diplomatic isolation within Europe and throughout the world, a blocked economy and society, an atomization of French society and a general disordering of France's way of life. . . . Even more than Germany, France today is Europe's weak link. 
The crisis in Iraq crystallized the contradictions of France's diplomacy, whose actions can be summed up by the slogan, "a lot of noise, for nothing." The original goals were legitimate -- opposing the Bush administration's brutality, establishing the need for proof of violations of U.N. resolutions, insisting that armed force be multilateral and preventing the fiendish mechanism by which the clash of civilizations benefits Islamic terrorism. . . . The French positions were well founded, but unfortunately were ruined by the clumsy and exalted manner in which they were discussed and defended. 
Since the 1980's, the cupidity of our political leaders has given a picture of a generation of Frenchmen that, having lived off of the inheritance of the postwar reconstruction, has deliberately pre-empted the work and the wealth of future generations, who will be fewer than us, so that it may distribute this wealth to itself in the form of public spending and social rights . . . As with any historical cycle, this dynamic is hard to reverse. Nonetheless, only the French can decide to interrupt this decline, by clearly choosing the path of reform.

An Extended Rally Depends on Earnings

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks rallied last week and could continue to climb if corporate earnings reports for the third quarter meet expectations.
 A few companies, including PeopleSoft, announced last week that they beat third-quarter forecasts. 
The reporting gets into full swing this week, with announce-ments expected from Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Bank of America, and Merrill Lynch. Coke and Johnson & Johnson were down last week. Intel, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch were up. 
 Economic reports on inflation, consumer confidence and retail sales this week will be reviewed for further confirmation that the economic recovery is here to stay. While third-quarter growth is now forecast to be 5 percent to 6 percent, it is not clear if this pace can carry into next year.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.37 points, or 1.1 percent, to 9,674.68; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 8.21 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,038.06. Both indexes touched their highest levels since June 2002 before slipping on Friday. The Nasdaq ended the week at its highest close since March 2002, rising 34.74 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,915.31.

HEADLINE: Nepal Maoist Rebels Move Their Attacks Into Cities 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN

DATELINE: KATMANDU, Nepal 

 BODY:
In less than a month in this once tranquil capital, a police official cleaning his motorbike was shot at close range. Five bombs exploded with one, planted near a school, killing a 12-year-old boy. An army colonel was assassinated outside his home. 
 In each case, the police have blamed Maoist rebels, who have been waging an insurgency since 1996. In late August, they pulled out of peace talks and called off a seven-month cease-fire. In the weeks since, they have opened a new urban front in their campaign to replace the country's constitutional monarchy with a Communist republic. 
 Since the cease-fire ended, more than 400 Nepalis have died in the renewed fighting -- more than triple the number who died in the month before the cease-fire was imposed. Most of the deaths, as with those before the cease-fire, have been in the countryside, where 85 percent of Nepalis live. But now the urban elite are also watching their backs. 
 On Saturday, police officials in western Nepal said that at least 38 people, most of them Maoists, had been killed after the rebels attacked a police post on Friday. 
With the cease-fire broken, the brief run of optimism is over for this desperately poor Himalayan kingdom of 25 million people. Once again, newspapers are filled with daily reports of clashes and executions, displacement and terror, and attacks on rural infrastructure. 
The economy, already fragile, is sinking, as tourists and trekkers stay away. In fiscal year 2002, the economy shrank for the first time in two decades. 
This country was once known as a paradise, with gentle people and gorgeous terrain, including Mount Everest. But Nepal's patina of serenity always masked deep rural poverty, caste and ethnic discrimination and a concentration of wealth and power that many say has helped nourish the Maoist cause. The most recent World Bank statistics show 42 percent of the population below the poverty line.
That helps explain why the Maoists' ideology -- seen as bizarre and discredited just about everywhere else on the globe -- has gained a foothold here. The rebels, who first organized a political party, began their movement five years after the country instituted multiparty democracy, vowing to use Mao's strategies of guerrilla warfare to create a "classless and exploitationless society." 
The conflict, which has killed more than 7,500 people since 1996, promises to be even more brutal this time, in part as a result of American military aid to the government. Both the government and the rebels used the cease-fire to regroup and rearm, say diplomats, army officials and analysts here. 
The Maoists undertook a systematic campaign of extortion from businessmen, aid groups and villagers to fill their coffers. They corralled new recruits and infiltrated urban areas.
The number of soldiers in the Royal Nepal Army, formerly more of a show horse than an actual fighting force, has grown to 72,000 from 50,000 since November 2001, when an attack by the rebels drew the army into a battle that had at first been left to the police. Since then, the army has been heavily armed with the help of the United States, which is providing $17 million in military equipment and training, as well as India, which is deeply concerned about the conflict next door, and others.
The army's decades-old weapons have been replaced with mortars, machine guns and M-16 rifles, provided by the Americans, Indians and Belgians, as well as Indian and British helicopters. Counterinsurgency training has come from India and the United States.
Government statistics indicate that more than 60 percent of those killed in the seven-year conflict died in the year after the army entered the conflict and that most of them were labeled Maoists.
A report by Amnesty International last December estimated that half of those killings by the government might have been carried out without due process. As the last round of talks was getting under way in August, the army executed 18 rebels and 2 civilians near a remote village.
But in this mountainous country, military victory is impossible for either side, analysts say. 
The rebels, with an estimated 4,000 hard-core fighters, a militia of about 15,000 -- though the Maoists claim 100,000 -- and unsophisticated weaponry, can inflict terror in Katmandu, but would have a hard time taking it. They roam freely in the countryside and effectively control about 6 of 75 districts, but have never taken a district headquarters. 
An army spokesman, Col. Dipak Gurung, said the army could now penetrate almost anywhere the rebels operated, but he conceded that it could not hold those areas. "Our troops are stretched thinly all over the country," he said. By some estimates, nearly half the army is in Katmandu and the valley around it. 
Kamal Thapa, a government minister and a member of the negotiating team, said he thought the government could win -- but only by paying a "huge cost" in lives.
So each side tries to deliver enough blows to force the other back to negotiations. "I think they literally have to be bent back to the table," the American ambassador, Michael E. Malinowski, said of the rebels.
A year-old standoff also continues between King Gyanendra, who dismissed the Parliament last October, and the country's five major political parties, which have refused to join the government since then. Neither side shows any sign of compromise, although everyone agrees their disunity has worked to the Maoists' advantage. 
The talks with the rebels fell apart when the government refused to accede to the unconditional demand for an assembly to draft a new constitution. Diplomats, analysts and participants in the talks said there seemed to be differences among the Maoist leadership about the desirability of pursuing a military solution, and pressure to fight from cadres who had been fed an uncompromising ideological diet.
The Web site of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) attributed the impasse to "the seemingly irreconcilable class and political contradiction between a feudal-bureaucratic monarchy backed by foreign imperialist powers and democratic forces fighting for sovereignty of the people."
Mr. Malinowski said human rights violations by the army could jeopardize aid to Nepal, but he has been more forceful in elucidating how abhorrent the United States government finds the Maoists' ideology and tactics. Last spring, the Maoists were added to the State Department's terrorist watch list, after they killed two Nepali guards at American facilities here.
Mr. Malinowski recently compared Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoists' chief ideologue, to Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda master. In a letter posted on the Internet recently, Mr. Bhattarai attacked Mr. Malinowski for what he called his McCarthyite "ideological disposition" and called America "one of the chief wreckers" of the peace talks.
Fearful of anti-American sentiment among the Maoists, aid groups are trying to play down their American connections. The United States Agency for International Development is trying to figure out how to deliver an additional $14 million of "insurgency relevant" American aid without revealing the American financing.

HEADLINE: In the Spotlight, Choreographer Energetically Takes On Dance 

BYLINE:  BY ROBERTA HERSHENSON

 BODY:
SHADOWS crossed a scrim in the middle of a 42nd Street dance studio as Peter Pucci considered the effect of six pairs of arms waving in the light. He crouched, jumped up, bit into an apple and sat on the floor, pondering - in his active fashion - the synchronized motions and their place in his choreography of "Harmony," a new musical that will begin previews on Nov. 25 in Philadelphia, and, if fortune smiles, could make it to Broadway. 
 The musical tells the true story of the Comedian Harmonists, a group of unemployed street musicians -three Jewish, three Gentile - who rose to fame in Germany in the 1920's and later clashed with the newly established Nazi party. Mr. Pucci called the group "one of the first boy bands," though it was hardly for teeny-boppers. The men sang in German, French and English, and mixed classical music into their popular entertainment brew. The most unexpected name connected with the show is Barry Manilow, who wrote the music; Barry Sussman wrote the book and lyrics. 
 "It's not typical Barry Manilow," said Mr. Pucci, 45, a nationally known dancer and choreographer. "People will be surprised by this music. Some is quite beautiful. Some is very funny. It's a big book musical with a lot of scene work."
He lives in Mount Kisco, where his group, Peter Pucci Plus Dancers, is also based. He is a versatile artist known for his work designing stage movements for directors like Sam Shepard, David Rabe and Joe Orton; for his choreography of new works for dance companies like the Joffrey Ballet, Colorado Ballet and Ballet Hispanico; and for his stage, film and television appearances as a longtime former member, principal dancer and co-choreographer of the group Pilobolus.
He was tapped for "Harmony" by David Warren, the show's director (also the director of the recent "Barbra's Wedding"), who first saw his work two years ago and hired him despite his lack of experience with big musicals. Mr. Warren said Mr. Pucci clinched the assignment by submitting ideas for "Harmony" that were "both highbrow and silly," perfect for a show about a singing group that was "musically sophisticated but profoundly witty."
The afternoon session with the scrim - which would be used in one number - was marked by playfulness, trial and error and inspiration, with Mr. Pucci ever mindful of the clock ticking down to the play's first rehearsals several weeks ahead. "There's a lot at stake, a lot of money involved," he said during a break. He noted that the Manilow-Sussman team had worked for 10 years to stage the show, which was presented in an earlier form in 1997 in California. Hence the careful hours spent matching movements to blocks of dialogue and song, and the actors serving as stand-ins for the show's principals. 
Dressed in blue running pants and a long-sleeved black shirt to ward off the chill of the studio's air-conditioning, Mr. Pucci -- known variously as Peter, Pete and Pooch -- looked like the athlete he was until the age of 19, when dance took over his life. Twenty-six years later, he is riding a crest of fulfilling personal work; besides the musical, he is working with the Katonah-based singer and songwriter Sloan Wainwright on a solo evening-length piece, "To Begin Again," that is based on his experiences in dance. Set to Ms. Wainwright's jazzy, bluesy takeoff on Chopin's "Nocturnes," the work will have its premiere at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan on Jan. 9. 
In addition, Mr. Pucci, along with artists like the poet Billy Collins, the painter James Rosenquist and the composer Alan Menken, will receive an arts award from the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts at its 25th anniversary gala on Oct. 18 at the Performing Arts Center of Purchase College. The choreographer and singer-composer will perform a sneak preview of "To Begin Again" during the evening. 
Raised with five siblings by a single mother in a Baltimore public housing project, Mr. Pucci was a physical education major in college when he took his first dance course. Before that, the only live dancing he saw was his mother jitterbugging around the house. He was a Hall of Fame high school football player and an all-American relay racer. 
He described his awakening to dance in an autobiographical essay he uses in place of a conventional resume. "I was required to take a course in movement improvisation, a disguised dance class for jocks," he wrote. "That first improvisation class literally changed my life. I found a way to direct my energy in an intellectually rewarding manner." 
Soon he was enrolling in more dance classes, "often enduring the stares of my fellow phys ed majors as I showed up in the locker room dressed in tights." His final conversion to dance, at the end of his senior year, was like a mystical experience. "During an umpire class," he writes, "I looked up from the field and saw the dance department building where I was spending more and more of my time. Three weeks away from getting my degree, I quit phys ed and became a dance major." 
But he did not give up athletics entirely; he incorporated athletics into his art. Directors call upon him to design stage movements where an actor must throw a ball, swing a tennis racket or roll off a bed. In 1999 he choreographed the signature theater piece "Pucci: Sport," which explores how dance relates to sports in nine "innings": badminton, baseball, basketball, boxing, football, Frisbee, hockey, surfing and tennis. The work is a natural for introducing young people to dance, and Mr. Pucci presents it in schools and community centers. "We try to get kids interested in being physical," he said. "We're such an electronic society. The sports show is a way to get people into the theater and share a communal experience."
Sunlight stole into the studio through gaps in the lowered blinds as Mr. Pucci moved behind the scrim to demonstrate a hand motion, then darted back to view the shadow effect. 
Like a painter he was sketching the basic idea of the work, but was prepared to change the canvas as the need arose. Mr. Manilow's music for the show played in the background, and Mr. Pucci praised its "beautiful harmonies."
He moved behind the scrim again, laughing with the actor-dancers. Shadow play was the subject, but Mr. Pucci was enjoying the spotlight.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Pay $20 Million In Glen Cove Cleanup 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
FOR months, the mounds of excavated dirt laced with radioactive industrial waste and heavy metals have been ready to be shipped out of Glen Cove, piled along a bank of Glen Cove Creek. 
 The mounds, near a public esplanade the city formally opened last month, have been a stumbling block in the redevelopment of the city's waterfront. 
 Now, in a partial settlement that was heralded as a major breakthrough in a Superfund case, an infusion of $20 million in federal money will soon send the 60,000 cubic yards of contaminated material to a disposal site, probably in Utah.
The area in Glen Cove is known as the Li Tungsten Superfund site. The federal liability stems from its ownership of land and buildings there during and after World War II. Tungsten produced there was used in light-bulb filaments, drill bits, artillery shells, tanks and planes. 
As part of the settlement, the city, which has owned part of the site for about 25 years, agreed to pay $1.6 million for the cleanup, in addition to the $3.4 million it had paid previously. The Wah Chang Smelting and Refining Company, the plant operator during some of the period contaminated waste was disposed of along the creek, agreed to pay $700,000. 
The federal Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency announced the settlement on Sept. 30, after a year of negotiations. It has been 11 years since the area was listed as a Superfund site and 9 years since the cleanup began. 
Three federal agencies -- the Defense Department, the Commerce Department and the General Services Administration -- will share the $20 million payment and agreed to pay an estimated $7.5 million toward future cleanup costs. With the total of new money approaching $30 million, officials said that one of the most seriously polluted sites on Long Island was nearer to becoming a brownfields success story. 
"It's the best thing to happen in Glen Cove in 20 years," said Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau county executive. Mr. Suozzi proposed the waterfront revitalization plan in the mid-1990's, when he was Glen Cove's mayor. 
E.P.A. officials estimated last week that final cleanup costs would be about $50 million but emphasized that the cost could go even higher. Jane M. Kenny, the E.P.A regional administrator, said the settlement would reimburse the agency for the $20 million it had already spent on the cleanup.
Ms. Kenny said the agency would continue to try to recover money from some 20 small and large companies liable for cleanup costs and wanted them to share in shipping out the contaminated mounds.
"We are still expecting the responsible parties to remove that soil, and we have ordered them to do so," she said. 
Deborah Zwany of the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn, said, "We will continue to pursue the other potentially responsible parties." . But, she added, "we wanted to move forward with the cleanup -- that was the most significant thing for us."
Companies named in the E.P.A. order range from General Electric and Teledyne to small metallurgy concerns. Nassau County is also named, but Mr. Suozzi said the county's liability was minor.
The E.P.A. is still studying contamination in Glen Cove Creek but hoped to announce a proposal this winter, Ms. Kenny said. The Army Corps of Engineers halted a dredging project in the creek two years ago after it found unexpectedly high levels of radium and thorium, radioactive elements associated with tungsten ore.
The Superfund site comprises 26 acres where the Li Tungsten plant once operated, and Captains Cove, a property of nearly equal size about half a mile to the west on Hempstead Harbor. Operators of the tungsten plant once dumped contaminated material there, and this is where the the mounds of contaminated soil are piled. 
Glen Cove's mayor, Mary Ann Holzkamp, said the settlement would enable the city and a private developer, the Glen Isle Development Company, to make final plans for a major project at the Superfund site. An agreement, announced in February, will allow the developer to buy the land, at a price tentatively set at $20.5 million, and to build retail space, a hotel and as many as 350 housing units. 
Jed Morey, the Republican candidate for Glen Cove mayor in next month's election, questioned the $1.6 million the city agreed to in the federal settlement. "Our city's attorneys could have fought harder on that aspect," said Mr. Morey, the publisher of The Long Island Press, a weekly newspaper. "We continue to do things to move this waterfront project forward, and we don't fight hard enough for our own piece."
Mayor Holzkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election, said the settlement was fair. "Mr. Morey has no idea of the magnitude of this settlement and of the work that went into it," she said.
Others said they would just be grateful to see the last of the contaminated soil. "We have been waiting a very long time to get this material out of here," said Peter Rapelje, a co-chairmanof the Li Tungsten Community Task Force, which advised on the cleanup. "This is a very good thing."

DATELINE: MILLBURN 

 BODY:
ON an early autumn morning, commuters at the train station in this town's picturesque Short Hills section stand as crisply as they always have, immersed in their newspapers, but it is no longer business as usual.
 The violent deaths of a father and his 7-year-old son last month -- under investigation as a probable murder-suicide -- have unsettled parents and schoolchildren, disturbed the suburban calm at its roots and follow yet another unexplained tragedy. 
 Only six days earlier, while children fished in Millburn's Taylor Park, a 71-year-old sometime resident shot himself to death on a park bench, beginning a series of public and agonizing events that has led to days of questions without answer. Deepening the wound, said the local police, neither suicide appears to have left a note to unravel the mystery of the township's deadliest month in memory.
 "We continually ask the question, 'Why?"' said Mayor Thomas C. McDermott. "There is still just lots of speculation -- of what we've heard, what we've read and of what we've seen." 
 According to the police, on the afternoon of Sept. 29, an unemployed banker, Richard Alexander Josephs, 53, walked onto the tracks at the Short Hills station shortly before a New Jersey Transit train was to arrive. He was struck and killed instantly. The Millburn police, calling later at Mr. Josephs's home in Short Hills, a short distance down the tracks from the station, discovered the body of his son, Eric Cameron Josephs, who had just begun the second grade at the Hartshorn School. The child's body was "found face up in his bed in his pajamas," according to an account from the Essex County prosecutor's office, which has taken over the case.
 Many presume that Mr. Josephs's 35 months of unemployment contributed to financial pressures and fed a despondency more common in upper-crust suburbia than might be suspected.
 Mr. McDermott said that all three deaths had jolted the town, although the loss of Eric Josephs seemed to cut deepest -- Millburn has not experienced a murder in at least a decade and never had a victim that was a child. 
 "I don't know how you tell children about this, but I think you tell them the truth," said the mayor, who also has a daughter in the second grade at the school. "That's my gut feeling as a parent."
 Although Essex County investigators, awaiting results from the autopsies, declined to discuss Mr. Josephs's possible motivations, some psychologists have said the three-year economic recession and hopelessness among those out of work could be cause enough to begin a mental depression. 
 Indeed, although New Jersey's labor figures recently brightened somewhat, about 260,100 workers in the state remain without jobs while unemployment hovers at 5.9percent, in a period termed confusingly by economists as a "jobless recovery."
 In reviewing what is known about the Josephs case, Dr. Maurice Elias, a professor of psychology at Rutgers, said it was possible that despair over the family's financial distress may have begun a shift in outlook that ended in a child's death.
 Last week, the Star-Ledger reported on lawsuits by a bank and a credit card company against Mr. Josephs that sought to collect $60,000 in debts, as well as bank foreclosure proceedings on the family's house on Hobart Gap Road, which had $265,000 outstanding on its mortgage. Mr. Josephs, a graduate of Fordham and New York University, was last employed in November 2000, when he departed the Bank of Nova Scotia as a managing director.

'A Logic' to Many Suicides
 Dr. Elias emphasized there could be "a logic" to many suicides often not readily apparent. "He may have thought he was saving the child from a fate far worse than we can imagine," he speculated.
 He paused, then continued: "You could almost think of this tragedy as a double homicide. Mr. Josephs put himself in a position to be killed -- in one sense, he really didn't kill himself. He chose a method that, in essence, was not by his own hand. He may have seen his son being sucked into a black hole that he would consider a fate even worse than death."
 A second psychologist, Dr. Janet Sigal of Fairleigh Dickinson University, offered an alternative explanation. She said that Mr. Josephs's suicide could also be interpreted as "a hostile act against the spouse."
 "If nothing else," said Dr. Sigal, who studies domestic violence, "these deaths would produce guilt in his wife. They guarantee that the wife is going to be brought under public scrutiny and involved in a very public investigation. The issue for the police is to determine if this was a dysfunctional family."
 Further, Dr. Sigal recommended the completion of what she called a "psychological autopsy" --interviews with family members, friends and former employers -- before making a firmer diagnosis.
 Joseph Delmar, a spokesman for the state Division of Youth and Family Services, which monitors child abuse, said there was no record of abuse in the Josephs home, and that the agency keeps no official count of murder-suicides involving parents and children. But Mr. Delmar added he believed that the phenomenon had occurred "three or four times" in New Jersey in the past five years. 
 In fact, in July, a Camden County man, Steven Lee Wasserman, 44, killed a former girlfriend and possibly his 10-year-old daughter before poisoning himself and his 8-year-old son with carbon monoxide gas. Dr. Elias said he would not necessarily expect such cases to be preceded by instances of beatings or other obvious warning signs.
 Indeed, another psychologist, Dr. Anthony D'Urso of Hackensack University Medical Center's Audrey Hepburn Children's House, said he would anticipate quite the opposite. 
 "You're not going to see a longstanding pattern of sadistic behavior from the parent," Dr. D'Urso said. "In fact, you're more likely to see overinvolvement on the parent's part or overprotection of the child."
 Dr. D'Urso dismissed the notion that a child's murder would be a stroke of revenge, and described Mr. Josephs's state as probably being one of "desperation and helplessness." As chairman of the New Jersey Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board, whose members are appointed by the governor, Dr. D'Urso has studied more than 100 of child deaths over the past four years.
 "I don't want to oversimplify this," headded. "These parents see the suicide as a relief to their conflict. It's not clear thinking, but a fairly advanced state of depression. After a time, it becomes mental illness."
 The larger factors that affected Mr. Josephs, a former commuter, are less in question. Despite a mild improvement registered in New Jersey's unemployment rate, joblessness in New York State and its global banking center in Manhattan stood last month at 8 percent. Dr. Joseph J. Seneca, an economist and chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisers, said the state lost 42,800 jobs from 2000 to 2002, in a downward trend that reversed itself only recently.
 This year, the state's economy, leavened by a rebounding stock market, has created about 20,500 new jobs -- a figure still well below an annual average gain of 50,000 jobs expected in the longer term.

Fewer Jobs Being Created
 "There has been quite a falling off in job creation from the boom years of the late 1990's," said Dr. Seneca, who added that the situation in Manhattan had been worsened by the attacks on World Trade Center and the subsequent movement of some companies and financial institutions to locations outside of the city. "But New Jersey's economy has fared relatively well, compared to what we're seeing nationally."
 Dr. Eileen Kaplan, director of Montclair State University's M.B.A. program, noted the broader economic uncertainty that threatened mainly blue-collar jobs in recent years has finally reached the white-collar class. 
 Dr, Kaplan mentioned the practice of "offshoring" -- the export by corporations of jobs in accounting, technology and financial services to foreign countries -- and said she sensed that it began to diminish business recruiting on campuses in the past year.
 "There's a pervasive anxiety among our students," said Dr. Kaplan, who is a psychologist. "They're watching white-collar jobs move to India and China. They understand that what costs $12,000 to employ an individual abroad could cost $70,000 here, in salary and benefits."
 In grasping for other stresses on Mr. Josephs, Mayor McDermott emphasized the pressures that can go along with maintaining a Short Hills zip code. The Josephs's three-story home was assessed at $586,200, a value well above the state average, but modest in comparison to the surplus of grander residences listed for sale in Short Hills last week, which ranged in price from $2 million to more than $4 million. Moreover, the average local tax bill in Old Short Hills last year topped $21,000.
 "A lot of people here are under financial pressure," explained Mr. McDermott. "A lot of people are right now living on credit. In a town like ours, we make sacrifices to make the best for our families."
 Lynne Ranieri, a vice president of the Millburn Historical Society, said there was a "perception of a difference" in the cultures of the Short Hills section and the larger township of Millburn, where housing prices tend to be lower.
 "In the 19th century, Short Hills was developed as an 'ideal community' by Stewart Hartshorn, inventor of the roller window shade, in order to encourage commuters to come here," said Ms. Ranieri, who lives in Short Hills. "A lot of the early residents of Millburn were mill workers. The nature of the origins of the two would cast each in a different light."
 But, she cautioned, "I feel that today that we're all one community." In recent years, to a large degree the social and economic distinctions have blurred. 
 In recording Mr. Josephs's death, New Jersey Transit said that he was the 16th person to die on the rails this year. Six of those victims have been confirmed as suicides; the remaining 10, including Mr. Josephs, remain officially under investigation. It was the first such death at the Short Hills station this year. The total number of deaths this year is down somewhat from last year, when 27 people were killed along the tracks, 18 of them judged to be suicides. In both years, the proportion of males dying to females was about the same, at 2 male deaths for every one female.
 Ken Hitchner, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, said the authority issues track safety messages, but they are generally intended for school audiences and not adult commuters. Part of the reason is the unpredictability of suicides -- stations in Egg Harbor, Asbury Park and Redbank this year have each been the site of two track deaths, but the system contains 187 other train stations.

Second Suicide in Days
 "It's a charged issue," said Mr. Hitchner. "How do you reach a suicide? Suicide is never really directly addressed."
 Millburn's first suicide occurred on Sept. 23 in Taylor Park. Police Captain David Barber said that Robert McAuliffe, 71, a former Springfield resident and a temporary resident of the township, shot himself in the head with a small-caliber handgun. As with Mr. Josephs, Mr. McAuliffe apparently did not write a note, leaving the police unsure about his motive. The shooting took place at about 4:30 in the afternoon, while children and pedestrians strolled through the park. Mr. McAuliffe survived for a short time before being pronounced dead at Overlook Hospital in Summit.
 Offering another insight, Dr. D'Urso, the child psychologist, said the apparent murder of Eric Josephs had brought out a frustration he frequently felt in cases of other child fatalities.
 "We always look to the government, to the authorities to protect kids," he said. "But cases like this one signal that it is the role of citizens to protect children. The state couldn't help with this one."

HEADLINE: Networking Has Run Dry, Long-Term Unemployed Say 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER S. STEWART

 BODY:
NEARLY three years into the worst employment slump since World War II, many unemployed professionals are finding that the job networks they have been tapping are no longer producing. 
 This turn of events -- which some call network burnout or network fatigue -- appears to be a natural consequence of too many job seekers asking for too many favors. And many people in a position to hire are getting tired of it. 
 "It's a lot like spam," said Diane DiResta, president of DiResta Communications, which assists in career development. "People keep hitting up the same contacts over and over again. But people have a lot more to do these days and are less benevolent than they were in the past. There's no time for all the requests." 
Networking has been a highly effective way for many professionals to land a job, and that makes desperate job seekers that much more determined to hit up any and all contacts. According to a recent survey conducted by Bernard Haldane, the national career management firm, 61 percent of responders found their last job through networking while only 3 percent landed a job through the Internet and 16 percent by newspaper listings. Another outplacement company, Lee Hecht Harrison, put the networking number around 80 percent.
When Wayne Boatwright lost his job with Accenture, the global management consulting firm, he expected that his expansive web of friends and acquaintances would continue to help him in his search for new employment until he succeeded. 
But after two years of searching, this assistance came to an end. "I found that people aren't as likely to respond after a while of looking," said Mr. Boatwright, a 41-year-old lawyer. "You can only go back to the well so many times. You ask them once or twice for a referral or a favor. But when you go three or four times, people start to get a little tired of helping. It gets uncomfortable."
Mr. Boatwright said that even friends started to avoid his phone calls and e-mail messages. "Instead of saying something to me, a couple of them would mention to my wife that I'd contacted them again. They might tell her, 'I thought Wayne was working on the last contact I gave him four months ago."'
Many experts are baffled as to what might work for job seekers whose networks are drying up. "Sad thing to confirm, but networking has hit burnout," said Stephanie Pinson, president of the executive search firm Gilbert Tweed, in New York. "I'm not sure the best way to go about it anymore. That's why so many people are dropping out of the job market. They don't know who else to talk to, or are just getting tired of not hearing anything. It's a very different market now."
According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 265,000 adults stopped looking for work in August, the highest monthly total since March 2001. The total number of workers who have stopped searching has ballooned to more than half a million, the highest number of discouraged workers in nine years.
Sam Reese, president of Miller Heiman, a sales consulting company in Reno, Nev., said he had four or five people that call him frequently about work. "They're driving me nuts," Mr. Reese said. "One of them calls me weekly. I get the same voice mail every Thursday saying, 'Sam, I got another opportunity and I want to run it by you in case you have something better for me.'
"Then he calls my assistant panicking and saying that he's got to talk about this situation before he agrees to take the other job. So I call him back and say, 'For God's sake take it, take it will you?' Of course, he doesn't have any offer at all. He's just calling me to check in."
Susan Long, who lost her sales job a year ago at Furnitureland South, an international furniture company in Greensboro, N.C., says she thinks she is on a handful of people's to-do lists. And she is convinced that those lists have been forgotten or lost in a mess of papers. 
"I'm sure they're just busy now and can't deal with me," said Ms. Long, who is 46. "I used to call them and they'd get back to me. Not anymore. I feel like the silent majority saying that networks don't work. It's like there's an elephant in the living room and no one is talking about it." 
Craig Coleman has seen the same phenomenon up close. Since he was laid off four years ago as director of forecasting for the hosiery manufacturer Kaiser-Roth, he has watched his network shrink drastically. "After a while, people drop you off the list," said Mr. Coleman, 54. "I used to go out to lunch with people. But after you've been out of work for a while you can't really reciprocate much. You're not fun and people feel sorry for you. In the past, people would call back. But hardly anyone does anymore."
Still, some employers continue to rely on networks. John Lederer, vice president for sales at Popkin Software, which is based in New York, says that 7 out of his last 10 hiring decisions were based on information from people he knew. "I put a lot of stock in referrals," he said.
John Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm in New York, said: "It's a lot like asking everyone you know to borrow money. And no one likes doing that. But the silver lining is that the more you network, the sooner it's over and the less burnout you go through."
Some intrepid job seekers are developing entirely new networks in place of contacts that are no longer helpful. For Mr. Boatwright, that has meant attending local job support groups held at churches and community centers and participating in networking sites on the Internet like Ryze.com. 
Mr. Boatwright is also taking a new tack with his existing network. He and his wife are expecting a baby, and he has written a letter to his friends saying that if he does not land a job soon he and his family will have to move out of town.
"It lit the fire under them," he said. "I think they appreciate the change in circumstances. It's not easy to say 'Hey, I need some help.' It's just as hard for them. But this changes it up enough that it will probably make a difference."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: TRIBAL STRIFE; 
British Mediate Hatfields and McCoys, Iraqi-Style

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

DATELINE: BASRA, Iraq, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The Bukhatra tribe and the Bukheet tribe are feuding again. Capt. Tai Saukuru of the British Army is stuck in the middle, again.
 To an outsider, the tribes seem as similar as their names. Their houses are jumbles of cinder block, their streets trash-strewn alleys, their children barefoot, their men unemployed, their women an afterthought. Since June, when a Bukhatra man shot the nephew of the Bukheet tribal leader, they have been busy killing each other. 
 In August, Captain Saukuru orchestrated a cease-fire. It collapsed on Monday, and three killings quickly followed. Sidestepping the local police, Captain Saukuru on Tuesday asked the senior Shiite Muslim cleric in Basra to intervene. The following night, the captain found himself in a mosque with a roomful of belligerent tribesmen. 
By luck and design, the 12,000 British soldiers occupying southern Iraq have had an easier time than the 120,000 American troops in the rest of the country.
After decades subduing strife in Northern Ireland, the British Army here prides itself on soothing local sensibilities. This summer, British soldiers avoided the neighborhood sweeps that stirred trouble for American troops. And the rules controlling when British troops can shoot at Iraqis are stricter than those of the United States military.
At the same time, the Shiite Muslims who dominate southern Iraq suffered particularly under the rule of Saddam Hussein, and they are more tolerant of the occupation than the Sunni-dominated area around Baghdad that the United States controls. No British soldiers have been killed here since late August, while nearly 30 American troops have died from hostile fire in the same period.
So the British reacted gingerly when the feud began this summer. 
"There is no space for arrogance in this country, because arrogance can cost you your life," said Captain Saukuru, a 27-year-old native of Fiji who left the Fijian Army for the British army two years ago, after marrying a British woman. Captain Saukuru has an easy rapport with the tribes, who at first mistook him for a Kuwaiti or Saudi, but he acknowledges that the culture of blood feuds baffles him.
"You've got to have an approach, a personality, a sense of humor to deal with this lot," he said.
But the British experience shows that even the best-intentioned of outsiders cannot always solve complex clan battles. And the British effort to respect local sensibilities may carry long-run dangers of its own. In trying to work out a new truce with the help of Imam Ali Abdul Hakim, Captain Saukuru went outside the Iraqi civil justice system. That implicitly encouraged the tribes to rely on Islamic law and undercut the Iraqi police, who are struggling to gain respect.
Noah Feldman, an assistant professor at New York University who is advising Iraqi leaders, said, "It's always better to use the courts to build up your legitimacy."
Still, the current weakness of the Iraqi courts and the strength of tribal bonds here may have left the British little choice, Mr. Feldman said in a telephone interview from Washington. "Alternative dispute resolution outside the courts is sometimes the best way to achieve peace, especially in cultures where group identity matters a lot," he said. 
Captain Saukuru, who arrived in Iraq in June for a six-month stint with the First Battalion of The King's Regiment, said Wednesday that he did not regret turning to Imam Hakim for help. "Realistically, we're in an Islamic community, and Islamic rules are the paramount rules," he said. "At the end of the day, Islamic law still stands." 
The British first became involved in the feud after firefights erupted between the tribes in July. Three people were killed, one of whom was shot by British troops. To stop further violence, Captain Saukuru asked Imam Hakim to settle the dispute. The imam ordered 18 Bukheet families, with about 400 people, to leave the crowded slum that the tribes share here in Basra, the largest city in southern Iraq. That move eased tensions. But many of the evicted families have returned, and the truce collapsed Monday when a Bukhatra killed a Bukheet man who had come back. Two more killings followed, bringing the death toll from the feud to seven. Both tribes, however, put the toll at six, not counting the death of a woman.
So Captain Saukuru appealed again to Imam Hakim, a gentle-looking man with a brown robe and a bushy beard. After turning the captain down -- "He said, 'I've had enough of the two tribes,' " Captain Saukuru said -- Imam Hakim relented and said he would look for a compromise.
But compromise was hard to find at the mosque, where the two tribes faced each other across a narrow room as brass samovars of tea brewed on an electric stove and Imam Hakim sat at the front beside Ciaran Griffin, a British lieutenant colonel. After a few minutes, the meeting slipped into disorder, with tribesmen shouting at one another and the imam. As turmoil mounted, Imam Hakim lost his patience and walked out, ordering three leaders from each side into his private study.
Inside the imam's office, Sheik Nasir Ramadhan of the Bukhatra and Sheik Jassim Jaber of the Bukheet made their cases to Imam Hakim as the British officers watched. The tribes disagree about nearly every fact related to the dispute, including the tribal affiliation of the most recent victim, an issue that has further complicated the feud.
Sheik Jaber of the Bukheet told Imam Hakim that the newest victim, who lived in the town of Zubayr, was not a member of his tribe. The sheik insisted that the Bukhatra negotiate separately with a third tribe to resolve that killing.
Sheik Ramadhan insisted that the dead man, Saalem Ajr Mazbun, was a legitimate target and distantly related to the Bukheet. The killing should be considered a part of the feud, Sheik Ramadhan said.
After two hours of back-and-forth, Imam Hakim essentially issued a stay, ordering a five-day truce. Then he left town, traveling to Najaf, the religious center.
Imam Hakim's work had finished, at least for the moment, but Captain Saukuru's had only begun. On Thursday afternoon, the captain headed to visit the sheiks for hours of consultations and endless glasses of tea.
In a white room, a portrait of the Shiite martyr Ali in the corner, Sheik Jaber complained that the Bukhatra had set off the newest round of violence. Nearby, in a smaller and dirtier room with a similar picture of Ali, Sheik Ramadhan worried that the brother of the Zubayr man his tribe had killed would take revenge. "He's looking for al Bukhatra, driving around," the sheik said.
The captain promised to try to persuade the third tribe not to open a new cycle of killings. Meanwhile, he urged both sides to respect the truce. 
"We want a complete solution," he told Sheik Ramadhan. But the sheik did not seem to be convinced that that was likely. 
Asked what happened on Monday, he laughed and said, "We killed one from al Bukheet, and they killed one from us, and then of course we killed one," the sheik said, as lightly as an auctioneer calling off bids.
By day's end, Captain Saukuru was no closer to gaining a permanent truce than he had been in the morning. And with the cease-fire set to expire on Monday, both tribes appeared to be spoiling for a fight.
"I'm not ready for one battle," said Sheik Jaber. "I'm ready for 10."
On Saturday, with the tribes no closer to agreement, Captain Saukuru said he might have to give up on his effort to use Imam Hakim to settle the feud. Instead, he plans to demand that both tribes hand over suspects to him or the Iraqi police.
"The only way forward is to arrest the killers," he said.
If the tribes do not cooperate, the British Army is prepared to make the arrests, Captain Saukuru said.
"If that means having soldiers in the village to look out for them, then we'll do it," he said "We've more or less exhausted the tribal side of things."

HEADLINE: After the Storm, Shattered Crab Shacks and Lives 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: TANGIER ISLAND, Va. 

 BODY:
The Chesapeake Bay was smooth as varnished maple as Mitchell Shores steered his skiff toward Tangier Sound. Crab huts on stilts stood like egrets in the shallow inlet. Watermen braided nets and tinkered with engines. The scene seemed postcard perfect. 
 But the bay that gives the watermen so much had also taken something away. 
 Several huts were bowled over like dollhouses before a rampaging child. Electric poles tilted at odd angles. A boat was sunk in the muck. And there was a pile of splintered planks and crumpled wire-mesh traps: the remains of Mr. Shores's crab house, a victim of Hurricane Isabel.
Mr. Shores, a grizzled 66-year-old in a faded red flannel shirt who has been crabbing since he was a teenager, squinted against the sun and clucked his tongue as he surveyed the wreckage.
"Terrible, ain't it?" he said, pulling at his bushy mustache. "In one day, to wipe out all you done all your life."
For more than three centuries, Tangier Islanders have endured war, storms and creeping environmental hazards. They have seen their island overrun by raging tides. But old-timers say nothing since the nameless storm of 1933, and possibly earlier, has hit Tangier as hard as Hurricane Isabel did last month.
The storm's 80-mile-per-hour winds and 20-foot seas damaged or destroyed more than a dozen crab houses on the island's exposed eastern flank. The watermen lost their crab traps, dredging nets and coolers -- and with them their livelihoods. 
Most will recover, as they have before. But it will not be easy, because few have insurance, and those without it must wait for the federal government to help with grants or loans to cover damages that can run $20,000 and more per waterman. 
"It was just a disaster for the watermen," said the town's mayor, Edward Parks, a part-time waterman who lost much of his gear."Some of them will have to start all over."
Living off the water is about all they know on this marshy 3.5-mile-long island populated by 640 residents. This is not a summer getaway for the wealthy. Many here are descendants of families that settled here in the 17th century. Like the generations before them, they measure their fortunes by the bushel of oysters, clams and, most important, blue crabs.
Located 14 miles from Virginia's eastern shore, Tangier is reachable only by boat or airplane. Cars are for the most part not permitted on the island's narrow paths, and residents travel by bike or golf cart. There are seven restaurants, two churches, two grocery stores and one police officer. A doctor from the mainland visits on Tuesdays.
Islanders have their own dialect, which has been described as Elizabethan but can sound like a collision between South Boston brogue and North Carolina twang.
Many residents cherish their isolation and the sense of sanctuary it provides. They like the one-big-family feel of their town, the absence of crime, the knowledge that neighbors will look after their children. The only traffic jams occur when two people in their carts stop to talk. The major crime is speeding: 15 m.p.h. is the limit.
But for a few, Hurricane Isabel has shaken their assumptions. 
Marty Crockett, 36, was born and raised on the island, a scion of Tangier's original settlers. But the hurricane destroyed most of his crabbing equipment and part of his crab house. Three feet of water poured into the stately white Victorian house Mr. Crockett's family has owned for generations. 
He is considering what once seemed unthinkable: giving up the independence of crabbing to work the predictable hours and wages of a tugboat. He is even thinking of moving off the island.
"I love this place to death," Mr. Crockett said. "But in the water business, you never know whether they'll let you work, how much you'll make or if a storm will knock you out."
"With one breath of wind," he said, "you're out of business. Something you worked for all your life."
Some watermen weathered the storm just fine, finding that it stirred crabs from their hiding places, making catches more bountiful. But for others, it was the latest hardship in a difficult year. 
Deep cold last winter froze the inlet, making it impossible for some watermen to move their boats for weeks. A cool, rainy summer drove crabs into deeper waters, reducing catches.
And then Hurricane Isabel struck, abruptly ending what should have been the most profitable season of the year: the dredging of "peelers," crabs about to shed their shells. Each soft-shell crab can sell for $3 or more, 10 times as much as a hard-shell crab. 
Possibly the trend most damaging to Tangier's fragile way of life has been a steady exodus of its young people. A century ago, the island had more than 1,200 residents, sustained by seafood processing plants, a vigorous shipping industry and a bay full of crabs, clams and oysters. But with the declining fortunes of the seafood industry, few teenagers stay beyond high school. 
Four of the six seniors at the island's 97-student school said they planned to leave after graduating. Tugboat work, the military and college beckon more brightly than Tangier. 
"My dad used to push me to work on the water," said Brian Pruitt, 17. "But the years went by and he changed his mind. He said, 'If you've got any sense, go away.' "
Many watermen also say state regulations freezing the number of licenses for watermen have made it difficult for their children to get into the business. Without a license, a person can work as a mate on a boat but cannot start a business.
Daniel Mariano, 27, said he could barely support his wife and son on a mate's salary. Mr. Mariano has applied for crabbing licenses, but none have been available. The storm has made matters worse by wrecking his boss's business, leaving him temporarily unemployed.
"I work week to week," he said. "When I'm out of work a couple of weeks, it's hard to bounce back."
The freeze on licenses was instituted in the late 1990's to protect the dwindling crab population. But now many environmental groups support exempting Tangier Island from the restrictions to help preserve its way of life. 
"It's not like people here have a McDonald's where they can go to flip burgers," said Lonnie Moore, a former Tangier waterman who now works for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a nonprofit group. "It's either crabbing or leave."
But for many older residents like Mitchell Shores, there is nothing but crabbing. With no pension, 401(k) plan or significant savings, he keeps working.
Mr. Shores snickers at suggestions that hoisting crab traps, dredging for peelers and navigating the bay 16 hours a day, even in winter, are somehow enjoyable. It is not fun, he says; it is all he knows.
"In the water business," he said, "you don't retire."

HEADLINE: STATES AND CITIES RISK BIGGER LOSSES TO FUND PENSIONS 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Many state and local governments, facing ballooning pension promises to police officers, firefighters, teachers and other public employees, are rushing to sell bonds to cover the shortfall. That strategy has sometimes backfired in recent years, leaving taxpayers on the hook for even more debt.
 States and municipalities are drawn to bond sales because they bring instant cash, easing budget pressures without further tax increases or reductions in retirement benefits. 
 But critics say the bonds could prove costly for some officials using them -- and for the local taxpayers. The cities and states have to pay a fixed rate of interest on the bonds, and are essentially betting they can earn a higher rate of return by investing the proceeds in their pension funds. 
But recent investment losses have already left some cities and states on the hook for a mounting debt, covering not just the retirement money for their workers but also the interest on the bonds. New Orleans, Pittsburgh and New Jersey have all placed losing bets in recent years.
Almost all pension funds have suffered sizable losses over the last three years. Government pension plans can dig themselves into deeper holes because, unlike corporate pension plans, they are not bound by federal requirements to maintain a certain level of funding. Some have no reserves at all: they just pay as they go, out of revenues.
With money tight, municipalities are desperately looking for financial help. This year, pension bonds will account for nearly 5 percent of all new municipal bonds, up from less than 1 percent in each of the last five years.
In the first nine months of this year, Illinois, Oregon's school boards, New Jersey's economic development authority and more than a dozen towns and counties sold $13.3 billion in bonds for pension purposes, almost as much as the total sold for pensions throughout the 1990's, according to Thomson Financial, a research firm.
More sales are coming. Wisconsin and Oregon each plan one before the end of this year, and Kansas has authorized a sale. West Virginia, home of the nation's weakest public pension plan -- according to a study by Wilshire Associates, an investment advisory firm in Santa Monica, Calif., the state teacher's plan has only $1 for every $5 it owes -- is fighting a court battle to sell $3.9 billion of the bonds without first holding a referendum. In California, a planned $1.9 billion bond sale for state employees' pensions contributed to the fiscal uproar that led to the recall of Gov. Gray Davis.
Other officials have weighed the risk and declined. "It's really tough to justify," said Robert C. North, the chief actuary for New York City's five employee pension plans. For years, Mr. North said, investment bankers have been urging the city to sell bonds to pay for its pension promises, and every time, he argues against it because he believes there are sounder and cheaper ways of financing pensions. 
"On a risk-adjusted basis, the only people who can make money on this are the investment bankers," Mr. North said. 
This risk is not always made sufficiently clear, critics say, by financial consultants who stand to make money from the bond sales.
New Orleans recently found out just how deep a hole it had dug for itself by selling bonds in late 2000 to finance the pensions of 820 retired firefighters. In May, city officials asked the manager of the bond sale, UBS Financial Services, for a progress report and were shocked to learn that the deal was expected to cost the city $270 million over time.
"We were thinking that we were going to make money on it," said Suzy Mague, fiscal officer for the New Orleans city council.
City officials say their rosy expectations were created by PaineWebber, the lead underwriter, when it described the bond transaction. (PaineWebber, which collected a $3 million fee for its role in the bond sale, has since merged with UBS.) 
"It was basically presented to us as, 'Look, this is really the way to go. Even if you use the worst estimates, you still break even,' " said Scott Shea, a former city council member who served on the budget committee at the time.
According to Ms. Mague, PaineWebber said New Orleans would probably have to pay about 8.2 percent interest on the bonds. PaineWebber predicted that the city could expect to earn 10.7 percent a year, on average, by investing the proceeds, mostly in stocks, a prediction based on returns from 1983 to 1999 -- a period that encompassed the greatest bull market in history.
A spokeswoman for UBS said the company did include less favorable possibilities in its presentation, and did not suggest that 10.7 percent, or any other rate of return, was guaranteed.
Mr. Shea said he asked PaineWebber about risk. "I frankly don't recall anybody telling me, 'Look, if the market tanks, you'll be in worse shape than if you had never sold the bonds,' " he said.
New Orleans issued bonds worth $171 million in December 2000, and almost immediately, the stock market tanked. Instead of returning 10.7 percent a year, the investments have suffered losses of about 3 percent a year. 
By June, only $98 million was left -- enough to pay the firefighters' pensions for just a few more years. When the money runs out, the city will still have to pay their pensions -- about $17 million a year -- but then it will also have to pay interest on the bonds of $16 million a year.
Pittsburgh, likewise, sold $294 million of bonds in 1996 and 1998 to buttress a skimpy pension plan for its workers. Before that, the city was spending about $21 million a year from its operating budget to keep the plan afloat. 
After an initial spurt, the pension plan slumped again when stock prices fell. Today, Pittsburgh is paying $26 million a year to shore up the plan and to pay its bondholders. Two major credit-rating agencies recently said they were reviewing Pittsburgh and might lower its rating because of its heavy indebtedness.
New Jersey had similar results after issuing $2.8 billion of bonds in 1997. The sale was the largest of its kind then and made headlines by generating $53 million in fees for various securities and law firms. 
In the first two years, the transaction looked good. New Jersey earned more than double the break-even amount. Then the markets turned. As of June, the pension plan's five-year average return was 1.9 percent, nowhere near enough to cover the pension costs and bond interest, which this year totaled $890 million.
"This money didn't build a road or a bridge, but we still have to pay it," John E. McCormac, the state treasurer of New Jersey said.
Officials may look past unhappy outcomes like these in part because market conditions have improved. Stocks are rising. Interest rates are very low, and officials see an opportunity to lock in debt at historically attractive rates.
Even Orange County in California is considering an issue, despite lingering concerns over its bankruptcy proceedings in 1994.
The county got into trouble after taking on undue investment risk, something critics of the new issues fear will happen again as states reach for higher returns. New Jersey, for example, has restricted pension investments to stocks and bonds, but is reviewing its portfolio and whether to hire an independent money manager, as other states do. 
The state's auditor has recommended investing a small amount in alternative investments, perhaps real estate, venture capital or other instruments that may provide greater returns, at greater risk.. Some state employees oppose the change, saying the risks are too great.
Their view is supported by some government finance specialists and academics, who argue that speculative investments, even stocks, are unsuitable in pension funds. They say that people retire on predictable schedules, and it is safest to invest conservatively, in bonds that will mature when people need the money.
Depending on market conditions, though, the current crop of bonds could pay off handsomely for the governments issuing them.
An Illinois official says that the state's $10 billion bond issue was based on an assumption that the money would earn 8 percent to 8.5 percent annually. Illinois will pay 5.07 percent interest on the bonds. "As long as the actuaries are right," said a spokeswoman for the state budget bureau, "we should be safe."

HEADLINE: Big Corporations And Their Taxes 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on recent changes to Connecticut's business tax ("Companies Prepare for New State Taxes," Sept. 21) tells a very small part of a very large story. Since Connecticut's deficit began in the summer of 2001, the state has enacted well over $1 billion in spending cuts, many of which fall most heavily on our children and their families. We have reduced health care coverage for kids, made deep cuts to affordable child care, decreased the state's contribution to K-12 education, reduced need based scholarships for higher education and more. 
 Many of these cuts would not have been necessary had we been willing to restore some of the hundreds of millions of corporate taxes that were drastically cut during the last decade. The business tax cuts were so steep that by 1999, 38 of Connecticut's 95 largest corporations paid no corporation business tax at all, and nearly two-thirds (more than 52,000 corporations) paid only the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (A.M.T.) of $250. (Recent changes in the law require all corporations subject to the business corporation tax to pay at least the $250 A.M.T.) 
 As a share of total tax revenues, the Connecticut corporation business tax is now third lowest among states, yet Connecticut is home to General Electric Co. (recently ranked by The Wall Street Journal Market Data Group as the world's largest public company), United Technologies Corporation, and other very large corporations. The share of tax revenues coming from all of Connecticut's business taxes combined is now behind gambling as a source of General Fund revenues.
Connecticut has begun to renew some corporate tax responsibilities, but, as your article suggests, the state has not made appropriate distinctions between small and large businesses. For example, by adding a surtax to the corporation business tax, we have increased the taxes due from the many small and medium businesses that pay taxes here, but we have not touched the many, very large corporations, that because of tax breaks and loopholes, pay only the $250 A.M.T. There are many ways to make the corporate tax distribution fairer to small businesses that have not been adopted, in part because the best interests of the small business community are often overshadowed by big business interests in Hartford.
Asking corporations to share fairly in tax responsibility is sound public policy. Research on corporate location decisions shows that taxes are only one of many (and generally not one of the most important) factors in that decision making process. Last year, New Jersey adopted a multi-pronged corporation business tax reform despite claims that it would trigger a tremendous loss of employers and jobs from that state. A year later, key economic measures indicate that New Jersey fared better than Connecticut. The percentage increase in New Jersey's new business starts in the first quarter of 2003 compared with 2002 was twice that of Connecticut and New Jersey added 34,200 nonfarm jobs in March and April 2003 when Connecticut's net change was zero.
The general anti-tax message that has become so popular is short sighted. Businesses need and depend upon our roads, airports, rail lines, courts, educated workforce, health care system and more. All of these are paid for by tax dollars. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt said: Taxes are the dues we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.

Proginet Corp. Posts a Loss Of $550,000 for Fiscal Year
The Proginet Corporation (OTC: PRGF) of Garden City has posted a loss of $550,376 for its fiscal year that ended July 31, reversing a profit of $196,614 recorded in the prior year. 
 Sales dropped from $6.6 million to $5.4 million, the company said in announcing the year's results on Monday. Proginet develops software for use in data security. 
 Kevin M. Kelly, the company's president and chief executive, said that despite declining sales, Proginet was able to improve its cash and liabilities position and had avoided assuming debt.
"Financial results fell short of the company's expectations for the fiscal year, yet the company was able to remain strong in a difficult economic climate," Mr. Kelly said.

Acclaim Raises $11.8 Million

 SENATOR MANSFIELD
The Extraordinary Life of a Great American
Statesman and Diplomat.
By Don Oberdorfer.
Illustrated. 593 pp. Washington:
Smithsonian Books. $32.95.
 THERE are parts of this fine new biography of Senator Mike Mansfield, as he pleads with Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson not to plunge America into war in Southeast Asia, that could break your heart. Mansfield served with the Marines in China in 1922, then worked his way from the copper mines of Montana to become a college instructor, a congressman and the Senate's acknowledged expert on Asia. He never varied in the advice he gave about Indochina: the United States had no compelling national interest to defend there, and it would lose any war it chose to fight. Had he been able to persuade his two old friends, there might be no need for that black granite gash and its 58,000 names on the Mall in Washington. 
"We cannot hope to substitute armed power for the kind of political and economic social changes that offer the best resistance to Communism," Mansfield, then majority leader, wrote his friend President Kennedy about Vietnam in 1961. "If the necessary reforms have not been forthcoming over the past seven years to stop Communist subversion and rebellion, then I do not see how American combat troops can do it today." A year later, he warned that the United States was in danger of being drawn "inexorably" into the doomed role and bloody fate of the French colonial armies in Southeast Asia: "To ignore that reality will . . . be immensely costly in terms of American lives." Kennedy's face grew red with anger. "This is not what my advisers are telling me," he said.
Nor did Mansfield relent after Johnson, an ally of many years, replaced Kennedy in office. "The Communists are, obviously, not going to be faced down. It now appears that they are not going to be stung down. That leaves only the possibility of mowing them down and that is going to take a lot of time and a great many lives," he warned after the Pentagon reported that an American destroyer was attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964, and Johnson responded with bombing raids.
Toward the end of his 98 years, after capping a distinguished Senate career by serving two presidents as ambassador to Japan, Mansfield's voice still broke when he spoke of Vietnam. Like Oscar Schindler weeping for Jews he could not save, he found shame and tears in his failure to stop the killing. "It still haunts me," he told Don Oberdorfer, a former Washington Post reporter who teaches international relations at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University. Though fond of his taciturn subject, in "Senator Mansfield" he doesn't duck the brutal question: Shouldn't the senator have gone public with his doubts, perhaps stepped down as Democratic leader in protest? Mansfield thought it better to preserve President Johnson's confidence, to ensure that the president got at least one expert and dissenting view. "I could have been more vigorous, I could have adopted another kind of procedure," Mansfield concedes in an interview. "But just don't know what it was." This is a thorough biography of a public man who served longer as majority leader than any other. It's perhaps a disservice to dwell so on Vietnam. Yet Oberdorfer recognizes Mansfield's role in the war as a core of the story. It is a timely topic.
The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States -- Mansfield lived to see them; he died a month later -- were no Tonkin Gulf incidents. There is little doubt that our national interest is now at stake: Ho Chi Minh didn't have hopes of acquiring pirated nuclear weapons or vials of smallpox, and could have been deterred if he had. Though the North Vietnamese fought with what we saw then as irrational commitment, Al Qaeda makes them look downright reasonable.
That said, it's instructive to weigh Mansfield's cleareyed prescriptions of how, and where, and in what proportion, the United States should best apply its military and economic power as it goes up against another guerrilla foe. Mansfield warned Kennedy that the United States was overreliant on military might, while shortchanging diplomacy and efforts to bring about social and economic reform. 
"The Vietnamese problem since 1955 has been a compound in which one part has been military and several nonmilitary," he told Kennedy in 1961. "Yet the remedy which has been applied to this problem has been a compound in which several parts have been military and only one part nonmilitary." In this season when another American intervention has etched a new place name -- Iraq -- on the gravestones at Arlington, it's a warning to which, this time, we should pay better attention.

 BODY:
Exiled from power, the stalwarts of the Democratic Party's Washington establishment plot their return at dinner parties in the capital's tonier neighborhoods. On a recent evening, I attended one of these meetings in a spacious living room in suburban Maryland, where about 50 former ambassadors and administration officials, mostly from the Clinton era, have been gathering regularly to grill the party's presidential candidates. I was invited to attend on the condition that I not identify the host, the guests or the precise location.
 The featured speaker this time was not a candidate for office or even a politician. It was John Podesta, who was Bill Clinton's last White House chief of staff and who is considered one of the party's sharpest and toughest operatives. Podesta is a 54-year-old marathon runner with an intense, angular face that seems to suggest he is always calculating something you would never be able to grasp. He is also the leader and architect of a new liberal think tank in Washington known as the Center for American Progress. His goal is to build an organization to rethink the very idea of liberalism, a reproduction in mirror image of the conservative think tanks that have dominated the country's political dialogue for a generation. 
 Many such left-leaning ventures have been tried over the years and have failed to wield much influence, but Podesta's effort seems different, not only because of his considerable personal stature within the party but also because rage at the Bush administration has galvanized Democrats.
"The rise of the machinery of ideas on the right has been impressive," Podesta told the gathering, to nods of assent. "People have noticed it, and we have talked about it. But we haven't really found the vehicles to compete with what's coming at us."
Going back to Barry Goldwater, Podesta said, conservatives "built up institutions with a lot of influence, a lot of ideas. And they generated a lot of money to get out those ideas. It didn't happen by accident. And I think it's had a substantial effect on why we have a conservative party that controls the White House and the Congress and is making substantial efforts to control the judiciary."
Podesta laid out his plan for what he likes to call a "think tank on steroids." Emulating those conservative institutions, he said, a message-oriented war room will send out a daily briefing to refute the positions and arguments of the right. An aggressive media department will book liberal thinkers on cable TV. There will be an "edgy" Web site and a policy shop to formulate strong positions on foreign and domestic issues. In addition, Podesta explained how he would recruit hundreds of fellows and scholars -- some in residence and others spread around the country -- to research and promote new progressive policy ideas. American Progress is slated to operate with a $10 million budget next year, raised from big donors like the financier George Soros.
"The question I'm asked most often is, When are we getting our eight words?" Podesta said. Conservatives, he went on, "have their eight words in a bumper sticker: 'Less government. Lower taxes. Less welfare. And so on.' Where's our eight-word bumper sticker? Well, it's harder for us, because we believe in a lot more things." The Center for American Progress, Podesta said, was concerned with articulating these principles carefully, over time, rather than rushing out an agenda to help win an election in 2004. "We're trying to build an idea base for the longer term," he said, to bring about "an enduring progressive majority."
There was genuine excitement in the room. "This is the first thing I've heard that gives me hope in a very long time," one woman said. The audience, however, had varying notions of what a think tank should do. Most of the questioners seemed to assume as a matter of faith that the liberal message would naturally triumph in America if not for Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and a president who, they insist, has lied. One guest urged Podesta to concentrate on briefing liberal TV guests before they appeared on talk shows; another thought Democrats were losing because they used the wrong language. 
Podesta gently reminded his audience that a think tank was for developing new policy solutions, not simply repackaging old ones. "We've got to fill the intellectual pail a little," he cautioned, before worrying too much about how those ideas should be conveyed.
This is precisely the challenge facing Podesta. Just about every leading Democrat in Washington agrees that the party could use a new Big Idea, something to compete with the current conservative agenda of slashing programs and toppling rogue regimes. But what kind of idea? Is it as simple as an image makeover? Is it a left-leaning TV network to fight back against a right-tilted media? Or does the party need a new and bolder policy agenda, even if it means years wandering in the wilderness to find it?
If the history of conservative thinktanks is any indication, it might take a real outsider, someone contemptuous of the Democratic establishment, to settle these questions. Can John Podesta, a paragon of the party, find the answers?
Sometimes called the godfather of the conservative movement, Paul M. Weyrich holds a weekly strategy session for 50 or so activists at the offices of his Free Congress Foundation near the Capitol. When Podesta dreams at night, this is the kind of meeting he envisions holding with his left-wing allies: an army of well-financed, loyal ideologues, each occupying a place in the power structure and with enough reach to turn ideas into policy.
When I attended a recent meeting, at the invitation of Weyrich's staff, those giving briefings included Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, representing the Republican leadership of both chambers, as well as President Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, and the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, N. Gregory Mankiw. The prickly Weyrich presided with a scowl from the dais (he is now confined to a wheelchair), from which he exhorted the faithful to get their message out, using words that made him sound like some liberal's parody of Dr. Evil.
"There are 1,500 conservative radio talk show hosts," Weyrich boasted. "You have Fox News. You have the Internet, where all the successful sites are conservative. The ability to reach people with our point of view is like nothing we have ever seen before!"
Weyrich was 31 when he and Edwin Feulner, then serving as disgruntled aides in a Congress dominated by Democrats, founded the Heritage Foundation in 1973 with early donations from a handful of wealthy families with names like Coors and Scaife. Determined to foster conservative scholarship and get it into the hands of like-minded policy makers, Weyrich and his compatriots were driven by a single, overarching conviction that grew out of the Goldwater campaign in 1964: government needed to be stingier at home and tougher abroad. 
Weyrich and Feulner were not interested in securing immediate victories for a Republican Party that seemed to have, at that time, almost no hope of controlling Congress. In fact, many of the ideas they would ultimately champion -- Social Security privatization, school choice, missile defense -- began well outside their party's mainstream. They were insurgents, and they set about staging an ideological takeover of the party, a process that came to fruition sooner than they might have hoped when Ronald Reagan, a fellow outsider, was elected president in 1980.
Today the Heritage Foundation, with an annual budget of roughly $30 million, is like a university unto itself. Its eight-story building houses some 180 employees, and it just completed an addition that has, among other amenities, state-of-the-art teleconferencing, apartments for about 60 interns and a fully wired 250-seat auditorium with its own greenroom. The foundation's in-house scholars are a constant presence on radio and cable TV. (Laura Ingraham, with one of the nation's largest radio followings, broadcasts from a Heritage studio.)
In all, according to a study by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, Heritage and other conservative think tanks -- the best known being the libertarian Cato Institute and the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute -- spent an estimated $1 billion promoting conservative ideas in the 1990's. From their ranks sprang some credible academics whose think-tank writings spawned powerful careers, including Jeane Kirkpatrick, the former U.N. ambassador, and Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court associate justice. There also came a flood of conservative theorists -- like Charles Murray, whose book "The Bell Curve" attacked assumptions about racial equality, and John Lott, who proposed that we would be safer if everyone carried a gun -- whose arguments, however dubious, bled indelibly into the public debate.
The disarray Podesta faces as he tries to build a counterweight to this behemoth is not so different from the landscape Weyrich and Feulner surveyed in the 1960's. Not only have Democrats lost their hold on Congress, but they also seem to have lost their hold on a larger vision for the country. 
At least in these early stages, the 2004 presidential campaign highlights the stagnation of the Democratic idea pool. The leading candidates spend their time debating questions that were put on the agenda by Republican think tanks, like tax cuts and pre-emptive first strikes, while proposing programmatic variations on old ideas, like universal health coverage and national service -- worthy notions, certainly, but no worthier than they were when Clinton put them forward 12 years ago. 
Transformative agendas spring from the emotion of a national moment. The New Deal seized on the anxiety of the Depression; the so-called Reagan and Gingrich revolutions played off a growing distrust of government among a newly prosperous middle class. Given the extraordinary current moment in world affairs, the conversation among Democratic candidates thus far is as notable for what has not been offered as it is for what has: no new framework for the Middle East, no clear doctrine on when and where to undertake military or humanitarian missions. While the Democratic candidates uniformly attack Bush's plan for "personal savings accounts" (which is another way of saying the privatization of Social Security), no one seems to have an alternative, 21st-century retirement plan that would save the nation from what looks like an inevitable fiscal crisis.
"We get so caught up as a campaign in trying to find the right position on Israel or the right position on health care that we don't really have time to think through bigger ideas," a senior policy adviser to one campaign told me. "We're just not generating any exciting new vision."
During the 35 years of dominance from F.D.R.'s New Deal through L.B.J.'s Great Society, Democrats constructed what Gary Hart, the former senator and presidential candidate, calls "an ideological cathedral": the G.I. Bill, welfare, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, voting rights. But apart from critics like Hart and Bill Clinton, whose centrist leanings succeeded in getting the party to rethink issues like welfare reform, leading Democrats have fallen into the role of protecting their fathers' agenda from attack rather than inventing a vision of their own. Even the Democratic Leadership Council, which served as the ideological springboard for Clinton's agenda, has gravitated toward electoral politics and away from policy innovations.
"There have been bits and pieces of an agenda," Hart said recently. "Somebody had an idea about health care. Somebody had an idea about education. But nobody's pulled it all together."
Podesta, the latest to try, exudes a quiet confidence as he sits in a corner office of the think tank's 15th Street building. Cautious and shrewd, he retains the authoritative air of a chief of staff ("You mind if I read while we do this?" he asked me before one interview, looking down over his glasses), presiding over a mixed crew of casually dressed former White House aides and new college grads in jackets and ties. Podesta has hired about 30 people so far and plans to double that number, although he's not yet sure precisely what they will all be doing. "I'm looking for opportunity," he said when we first sat down in June, "as opposed to having a business plan that you execute, you know, Step 1 and then Step 2 and then Step 3." 
Podesta stressed that the think tank was not an organ of the Democratic Party. Rather, he pledged that American Progress would offer its voice and ideas to any policy maker or party that would have them. It was obvious that he wanted the center to be seen as an insurgent force in politics, beholden to no one, although it was difficult to imagine who besides the Democrats would stand to benefit from a revitalized liberal agenda. (Presumably Podesta isn't raising $50 million in order to take over the Green Party.)
In the months that followed, as I talked with Podesta regularly, I came to understand that he was, in fact, caught between powerful forces in his own party, an exceptionally deft navigator trying to steer his way through treacherous crosscurrents. On the one hand, there is the party's struggle between elements of the left and center -- the battle personified by Howard Dean and Moveon.org on one side and Joe Lieberman and the D.L.C. on the other -- from which Podesta has vowed to remain aloof. "I'm trying to be ecumenical on the center-left thing," Podesta said. "When you've got such a radical direction of the country on the right, that's where our fight should be, and not with each other."
The other conflict, and the one that involves Podesta and American Progress more directly, is between those who believe the party can "message" its way out of exile and those who believe it will have to innovate its way out. It is a difference of opinion that divides Podesta's potential financial backers, powerful allies and even some of those working for him. And it could, if left unresolved, leave American Progress as confused about its own mission as Democrats seem to be about theirs.
Most Democratic insiders, like those assembled in the living room where I watched Podesta make his pitch, will insist that the party's main problem has been its inability to be heard. And this, they say, points to a lack of institutional voices. The Brookings Institution, a moderate think tank that is every bit as sprawling as Heritage and is supposed to be its counterbalance, is neither ideological nor self-promotional enough to push back against the right. The Democratic National Committee's idea of debating the opposition is to produce and post on its Web site a painfully slow and nonsensical animated video of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as Frankenstein and Igor. With no one coordinating the message, liberals rely on an array of single-issue groups -- environmental, abortion rights, civil rights -- who pursue disparate agendas, and not always effectively. 
The need to imitate the tactics and the discipline of the right wing is now discussed obsessively at liberal and leftist strategy sessions and dinner parties, and leading Democrats see Podesta's think tank as a command center for a new left-wing conspiracy -- a progressive group that is, for once, both well financed and willing to get as mean as the opposition. Among them is Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader and the highest-ranking Democrat in the land, who has been known to complain bitterly about the influence of right-wing commentators. Daschle was among a small group who plotted with Podesta for more than a year to establish American Progress.
"They have a dozen think tanks, and we have none," Daschle said during a conversation in his Capitol office. "We don't come close to matching their firepower in the media."
When I asked if the Democrats might also be struggling for lack of compelling new ideas, Daschle shook his head.
"I don't worry," Daschle said. "The recent polling data suggests that with all of this imbalance and all of this reach and all of this power that the right has today -- in media, in think tanks and on the radio and with the White House -- with all of that, on many of the issues the American people care the most about, Democrats are now leading. It's very encouraging to us."
It is not so encouraging, however, to some other Democrats, who say that asking voters how they feel about the party on a bunch of individual positions -- deficit spending, a patients' bill of rights -- is not the same thing as having a coherent idea of where you want to take the country 10 or 20 years from now. They want Podesta's group to function not simply as a TV booking agency but also as the kind of idea factory that Heritage, Cato and A.E.I. were in the 1970's, pumping out provocative new proposals that could eventually define in the public mind what it means to be progressive. 
Senator Hillary Clinton is one of them. "We do have to do a better job to compete in the arena with the ideas we already have," she told me. "But it's also clear to me that we need some new intellectual capital. There has to be some thought given as to how we build the 21st-century policies that reflect the Democratic Party's values." 
Even inside the offices of American Progress, there are divergent views about how to divide resources between doing battle and doing research. I mentioned to Laura Nichols, Podesta's senior vice president for communications, that one staff member had suggested there was no need "to reinvent the wheel" of Democratic thought. 
"I think we do need to reinvent the wheel," said Nichols, who until recently shaped the party's message as one of Dick Gephardt's top aides on Capitol Hill. "Being able to duke this out on the cables every day is not going to solve your problem of what the long-term progressive vision is.
"This is what I did for 10 years: 'Where's our bumper sticker? What's our slogan? Where's our bullet point?' There is no magic bullet here. We're just going to have to do the hard work."
Podesta seems to agree. "In my view, the ideas are most important," he said. At a meeting of liberal interest groups, most of whom were chiefly concerned with message, Podesta put it this way: "We're constantly operating on the way Bush has set the table and on the way conservatives have set the table. We need to reset that table, and the only way to do that is to start with the substance."
And so, on a recent afternoon, Podesta sat at the center of a long conference table in the offices of American Progress, listening to a disembodied voice on the squawk box in front of him talk about taxes. In an effort to rethink not just the Democrats' tax policy but also the tax system itself, Podesta has been talking with a small group of experts like Gene Sperling, Clinton's former economic adviser, and Robert Rubin, Clinton's treasury secretary. The ideas floated at this meeting, held with five people at the table and three others on the phone, "aren't even half-baked," Podesta said. "They're still in the box." In other words, the goal at this point wasn't to arrive at an actual policy proposal as much as it was to think big and creatively in a way that lawmakers and campaign consultants almost never do.
Podesta and his working group started from the premise that Bush's tax cuts have actually increased the burden on wage earners; lower taxes on corporations, dividends and estates mean that people who rely on weekly paychecks are shouldering a greater share of the federal outlay. 
Podesta is intrigued by the notion of what he calls "a flatter tax" that would reduce income-tax rates but would cover investment income as well. In other words, everyone would pay the same lower rate on their income, no matter what bracket they fell into, but instead of taxing only wages, the new system would also count capital gains and dividends as taxable income. 
"You're talking more income at lower rates, as a way of gaining more revenue," Podesta told the group. "At least as a broad-based idea, are you getting what I'm throwing out here?"
The idea for some kind of flat tax, of course, isn't new; in fact, it's another product dreamed up in conservative think tanks. (By adding in investment income, however, Podesta's version would be more progressive.) But it would mark a major departure for Democrats, primarily because it would effectively do away with dedicated payroll taxes for entitlements like Medicare and Social Security -- a cornerstone of the liberal cathedral.
"What you're proposing," said one of the voices patched in by phone, "would be a fundamental shift in Social Security funding and the entire system of how that works." Podesta readily agreed. That is precisely the kind of conversation he wants American Progress to be having.
Finding big ideas on any range of issues, however, may prove almost as daunting as selling them. American Progress has planned for its coming-out party this month a conference to discuss "muscular alternatives" to Bush's foreign policy. (The speakers tentatively include Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who was invited before he announced his presidential campaign, and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, an independent-thinking Republican.) The conference probably won't unveil anything terribly new, but Bob Boorstin, the longtime Democratic aide who is coordinating it, says he wants to wade into policy debates where Democrats have traditionally been absent.
"I am convinced, for instance, that there is a solution to the three-fighter-jet problem in the military," Boorstin said, referring to the three separate jets currently being developed by different branches of the military, a duplication that Donald Rumsfeld hasn't yet resolved. "People on our side don't regularly go to the Naval War College or the National Defense University to find out who's teaching and what they're saying. There's talent out there -- serious talent -- and we need to tap into it."
Also under discussion is a project to address long-term challenges facing public education, relying on academics who may have innovative solutions. "I'm sure there are journals filled with that stuff, that test and analyze and explain it," Podesta said excitedly, "but no one comes forward to put that into the policy arena.
"That to me is where you start. You don't call Geoff Garin and ask him to do a poll," he said, referring to a leading Democratic pollster. "You think about what the problems are and what the solutions might be."
This kind of conversation clearly energizes Podesta. While he has spent his career splitting time between the worlds of political campaigning and committee reports, he is at heart a policy geek, and a very smart one. I wondered whether he was ready to take on the party's interest groups, which have often stood as a steadfast barrier to innovation. Got an idea to reform public education? Not if it upsets the teachers' union. Figured out how to restructure Medicare? You'd better run it past the AARP. "There's just such an incredible timidity among Democrats," says Ted Halstead, whose centrist New America Foundation does some of the more innovative policy research in Washington. "They dare not think outside the box for fear of being punished by one of their constituencies."
When I put this question to Podesta, he chose his words carefully. "There's no simple answer," he said. "You have to have enough self-confidence to say either let's throw these ideas out there and at least debate this or let's champion them."
But, he said: "I don't begin the conversation from that perspective. Of all the institutions that cause problems for society, I don't think the teachers' union is one of them. You get cheap brownie points for smacking your friends around. When they deserve it, we need to be brave enough, but we don't have to position the organization to have that be its reason for being."
In the end, this is what most sets Podesta apart from the conservatives whose model he is trying to replicate. Their "reason for being" was the triumph of their ideology, and if they had to destroy the Republican establishment in the process, they thought, so be it. They were more interested in a movement of ideas than in building governing majorities.
It may be that Podesta is willing to confront the party establishment, but there is nothing in his past -- or in the resumes of any of his main hires at the center, all of whom are veterans of the Hill or the White House -- that suggests he and his team want to divorce themselves from the party's political aims. They are the Democratic establishment, and that means there will always be the temptation to forgo the longer, harder conversation that the party probably needs to have in favor of a short-term strategy.
It is worth remembering, too, that activists like Weyrich and Feulner didn't start with either the message or the specific policies. They started, instead, with a core philosophy that deftly articulated the way a lot of frustrated Americans felt. They knew what they believed and how to put it into words, and they were passionate about living in a country that closely resembled their vision. What Podesta dismisses as a bumper sticker -- "less government, lower taxes and so on" -- is, in fact, the starting point from which a generation of powerful ideas took flight.
Podesta has undertaken this process in reverse; he is building up a machine for finding new ideas and marketing them in hopes that all this effort will somehow coalesce into a new and compelling governing philosophy for Democrats. Even before its official debut this month, American Progress began assembling focus groups in nine cities and among a number of "elite" Democrats to get a sense of what the progressive vision ought to be. This is what consultants do when they want to win elections, but it is a less promising way to locate a bold new concept of American government.
It may be, ultimately, that Podesta and American Progress will imitate conservative think tanks in the way that most Democratic leaders badly want them to -- by attacking Bush, by getting their people on CNN and by making sure they're armed with the talking points of the day. But that's not what really made those think tanks powerful in the first place. I mentioned to Podesta what one Republican told me -- that the best thing for American Progress would be for the Democratic presidential nominee to get totaled in 2004 the way Goldwater did 40 years earlier. That way, the party would be desperate for new ideas, and a determined think tank could conceivably take over its agenda.
"I'll leave that for somebody else to say," Podesta replied. "If you ask me, I'd rather have a progressive administration." That makes sense coming from a loyal Democrat. But if you really want to reset the table, you might have to be willing to kick it over.

HEADLINE: The World: Culture of Dependency; 
Another Challenge in Iraq: Giving Up Food Rations

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
THE overhaul of welfare in America may seem complicated, but it has been simple compared with the challenge in Iraq. In the United States, the people who relied on public assistance were defined as the underclass. In Iraq, they're the entire nation.
 To Saddam Hussein, a culture of dependency was not a social problem but a political plus. Father Saddam, as he liked to be called, provided citizens with subsidized homes, cheap energy and, most important, free food. After international sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990, he started a program that now uses 300 government warehouses and more than 60,000 workers to deliver a billion pounds of groceries every month -- a basket of rations guaranteed to every citizen, rich or poor. 
 American and Iraqi authorities are now struggling to get out of the grocery-delivery business without letting anyone go hungry. They're trying to find a politically practical way of replacing the rations with cash payments or some version of food stamps. Planners would ultimately like to see the aid given only to the needy, but for starters they would simply like to get all Iraqis accustomed to shopping for themselves.
"We need to replace the food program and attack the dependency culture created by Saddam Hussein," said Barham Salih, the prime minister of a Kurdish section of northern Iraq, which also receives the rations. "This culture has become one of the biggest obstacles to rebuilding Iraq. Everybody expects the U.S. to turn on its supercomputer and make all of our problems go away, but we should be learning to do things by ourselves."
You can get a sense of the challenge facing reformers by visiting Zayuna, one of Baghdad's most affluent neighborhoods. While many Iraqis -- 60 percent of the population, by some estimates -- depend heavily on the food rations, the residents of Zayuna generally do not. 
In fact, many of them disdain the items in the basket, which includes rice, flour, beans, sugar, oil, salt, powdered milk, tea, soap and laundry detergent. But most residents still make sure to collect -- or have their servants collect -- their monthly rations from the program's agent operating in their neighborhood. 
Then they take the items they don't want and drive to a roadside kiosk at the nearby Thulatha market, where vendors are legally allowed to buy the rationed groceries and resell them to less picky consumers. After the citizens sell their government-issued groceries, they either pocket the cash or apply the proceeds toward the purchase of better products available at the market, like olive oil to replace the cheaper soy oil. 
To an outsider watching people make these exchanges, it might seem odd for people in Mercedeses and BMW's to be profiting from government food aid, especially since the original justification for the aid has vanished. The program began as an emergency response to United Nations trade sanctions, and was later supplemented with provisions from the separate oil-for-food program of the United Nations. Even though the sanctions have ended, the program is still considered indispensable.
"It would be a disaster if the program ended," said Haidar Hassan, one of the vendors at the market, and he was not merely speaking of his own business as a middleman. "If the government did not give out all this rice, there would be a shortage of rice in the market." He predicted the price of a kilogram (about two pounds) would quadruple from its current price of 10 cents. 
His clientele was similarly alarmed. "My economic situation is good, but even I could not afford the new higher prices if they stopped the program," said Thaeir Ezadden, a police captain whose salary had recently more than quintupled, to $150 per month, thanks to the new pay scales instituted by American authorities.
Mr. Ezadden said he might be willing to go along with one change currently being considered -- giving everyone cash payments instead of rations -- but only if it was accompanied by more central planning.
"If they gave out money instead of food," he said, "the Americans would have to establish an office in the Ministry of Trade to control all the food prices. Otherwise businessmen would import food and make a profit with high prices. The Americans should also give jobs to everyone who needs one."
Economists, while acknowledging the need for protecting consumers during the transition, say that a market economy would provide food much more cheaply and efficiently than the current government-run system. But the American and Iraqi officials in charge of the program know that economists' arguments are not going to assuage the fears of citizens who have forgotten how the market works.
"We want to phase out the rations program, but we must take into account the concerns of our most vulnerable citizens," said Fakhrldin Rashan, the acting officer in charge of the Ministry of Trade. "The transition to a different system of payments must be done slowly."
Planners are considering gradually replacing some groceries with cash welfare payments or some version of food stamps that could be redeemed at local markets. Besides giving shoppers more choices, the change would also help Iraqi merchants and farmers, because consumers would presumably buy more local fruits and vegetables instead of relying on the many imported foods in their rations.
Mr. Rashan said no major changes in the program would take place before next year, although one small part of it will be privatized soon. The drivers who now deliver the food to government warehouses will essentially be given their trucks and then paid as independent contractors instead of as government employees.
But that still leaves close to 20,000 other government employees in the food program, plus another 45,000 distributors who dole out the food at neighborhood storefronts. Any change in the program is sure to bring protests from the affected workers as well as from citizens accustomed to having their shopping done for them.
"People expected the Americans to come in and create a better rations system," said Robin Raphel, a State Department official who has advised Iraq's Trade Ministry. "But we can never make the system work as well as it did when the whole country was a command-and-control system run from the center, and even then it was profoundly inefficient. We want to introduce market forces and get people used to making their own decisions."
After Iraqis adjust to shopping for themselves with food stamps or welfare payments, planners would like to wean the more affluent citizens from any kind of aid. But no one expects American or Iraqi officials to take that step anytime soon. 
"We have to be very careful with our food program," said Mr. Rashan, of the Trade Ministry. "We already have enough social and political problems in this country. We don't want to create any more." 
Mr. Rashan, incidentally, said that he himself has not been picking up rations for the past several months, but not out of any ideological qualms.
"I've been so busy with the new responsibilities here that I haven't had time to pick up the basket," he said. "But I hope I'll find the time next month."

HEADLINE: Investing; 
New Glamour for an Old-Fashioned Asset

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
GOLD, the ultimate old-economy asset, is close to its highest price since 1996 and is capturing broader interest than it has for most of the last 20 years. That leaves two major questions for people who are thinking of investing in gold: how to do it, and whether to do it at all after the recent run.
 Many financial planners encourage owning gold even when they expect and hope that it will lose value. It is the just-in-case component of a portfolio: a hedge against war, inflation, deflation or some other social, political or economic upheaval. To them, the question is how much to own. With the price of oil rising, the Middle East in turmoil and other global trouble spots threatening to erupt, there is no dearth of prospective events to hedge against. 
 "It depends on the specific investor, what assets they own and their financial goals," said Robert Cox, a commodity adviser at Citigroup Private Bank in New York. "What percentage of gold is appropriate is particular to an individual -- normally 2 percent to 3 percent of one's assets -- but I believe some investors like to have more in a volatile economic environment. Certain people feel safer holding more physical assets." 
 Fund managers who specialize in precious metals naturally advise holding gold and its close relatives in more wholesale quantities.
 "The last few years has demonstrated once again that having 10 percent to 15 percent of assets in gold and other commodities is definitely the right approach to take," said Graham E. French, a fund manager at M&G Investment Management in London who runs the Vanguard Precious Metals fund.
 During the gold rally, holding funds that invest in shares of mining companies has certainly been wise. The average such fund tracked by Morningstar Inc. rose 61.2 percent in the 12 months through Thursday and 14.5 percent a year, on average, over five years.
 Charles de Vaulx, a manager of several portfolios, including a gold fund, for First Eagle Funds in New York, says the firm's mainstream funds typically have 5 percent to 7 percent of their assets in gold, or in mining shares or other proxies for gold. That would have amounted to dead money for most of the 1980's and 90's, when gold lost as much as 70 percent of its value.
 But Mr. de Vaulx, whose investment style is to buy out-of-favor assets, said, "When we see the way Alan Greenspan tries to keep the bubble going, and considering that stocks around the world are not that cheap, even after a three-year bear market, it's a good, cautious policy on our part."
 Gold now trades at $373.55 an ounce, up from about $270 early in 2001. And by one important measure, it is treasured more than ever, prompting some analysts to urge caution. Global Market Perspective, an investment advisory newsletter published by a technical analyst, Robert Prechter, said in its September issue that large speculators in the gold futures that are traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange had accumulated their largest-ever net holding of long positions. The newsletter noted that previous peaks of nearly the same magnitude had heralded substantial price declines, and it predicted that another would occur.
 If investors want to get into gold, they can take many paths -- and the decision can be crucial. Few conventional investments are more cumbersome and costly. Gold pays no income and can be expensive to store, and trading commissions are typically far higher than those for stocks and bonds.
One way to cope with these obstacles may be a fund called Equity Gold Trust, which is being considered for approval by regulators and is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The fund will hold one asset -- gold bullion -- and is intended to make gold cheaper for small investors.
 Each share of the fund will be worth one-tenth of an ounce of gold, minus fund expenses, and will be redeemable for cash. The bullion will be stored in the London vault of HSBC Holdings, the big banking company. Because there is no active management, and because the sponsor of the fund, an industry association called the World Gold Council, will hold the bullion in bulk, the annual expenses are projected to be about 0.2 percent of assets, or about 8 cents a share, based on the current price of bullion.
 "This issue is a pure-play in gold," Mr. Cox at Citigroup said. "One could settle the shares any day based on the daily price in London, so there is liquidity. The idea seems to allow for very small investments."
 MINING shares are popular proxies for gold -- and lucrative ones lately -- but Mr. Cox noted that they were not precise substitutes. 
 One reason, he said, is that "a number of these companies mine other commodities in addition to gold."
 Mr. French, at M&G, said there was good reason to be cautious about gold stocks. "Gold companies often demonstrate wastage of higher prices," he said. "They love corporate jets and big offices. One would think the mentality has changed, but I fear it has not. A lot of the profit people have factored in won't come back to shareholders."
 Nevertheless, Prescott Crocker, manager of the Evergreen Precious Metals fund, said gold stocks generally track movements in the price of bullion, and with considerable leverage. "As the price goes up, a large portion of that increase is carried down to the bottom line," he said.
 If gold moves from $350 an ounce to $400, the gain is about 14 percent, but if a mining company can produce gold for $300 an ounce, the same gain will double earnings, assuming that costs remain constant. That leverage is also present when gold prices fall.
 Mr. French and Mr. Crocker prefer stocks of well-managed companies that do not hedge their exposure to price movements; have nearly all their assets in gold, not other metals; and own mines in stable countries, or in many different ones, to limit political risk. Paying the right price is important, too.
 "You need value," Mr. French advised. "You have to treat gold shares like other equities." 
 One company that both managers own is the Newmont Mining Corporation. It is the only gold-mining company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, so it attracts index trackers as well as gold aficionados.
 "It also has no hedges, is diversified according to its resources, with mines in the U.S., Peru, Indonesia and Uzbekistan, and is thought to have very good management," Mr. Crocker said.
 Mr. French called Newmont the biggest and best-managed company in its field, but for those reasons it is also richly priced, and he owns less of it than he once did. Other companies he likes include Lihir Gold, an Australian company with deposits in Indonesia, and Ashanti Goldfields, a Ghanaian company. He said Ashanti had "great long-life assets and strong production, but the market just doesn't want to buy the shares," possibly because of perceived political risk.
 Mr. French also likes the large South African producer AngloGold, while Mr. Crocker is partial to another South African company, Gold Fields, and to Goldcorp in Canada.
 MR. CROCKER'S largest holding is another Canadian company, Placer Dome Inc., which has undergone a corporate makeover.
 "It became a more aggressive explorer, canceling all its Australian hedges and going out and buying a large property in East Africa with tremendous potential for adding reserves," Mr. Crocker said.
 Mr. French warned against becoming carried away by the rally in bullion prices. Hedging against disaster is one thing; trying to make a big score from it is another.
 The run-up in gold represents "a huge option on an opinion, and in the last few years the opinion has been that the world is going to blow up," he said.
 "But you don't want to be there when that opinion changes," he added. "It's like a lobster pot: it's very easy to get in these things, but it's very difficult to get out."

Trucks Give a Daimler Star a Lift

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: STUTTGART, Germany 

 BODY:
TO visit the imposing headquarters of DaimlerChrysler here, with its rows of Mercedes-Benzes parked out front like a Praetorian Guard, is to understand where the heart of this vast automotive empire lies.
 There isn't a Chrysler in sight -- to say nothing of the trucks, buses and vans that generate nearly a fifth of its $156 billion in sales. Yet these country cousins, not the polished Mercedes-Benzes, are the key to whether DaimlerChrysler can rebound from its current misery or will become a case study of an ambitious merger gone awry. 
 So it is fitting that the two men most likely to succeed Jurgen E. Schrempp, the chief executive, have each been assigned toturn around one of the troubled divisions: Dieter Zetsche at Chrysler, and Eckhard Cordes at the prosaically named commercial vehicles division. 
 In recent months, as Chrysler's financial woes have deepened and Mr. Schrempp's own future has come into question, Mr. Cordes, 52, has emerged as a man to watch. While Mr. Zetsche is struggling in Detroit, Mr. Cordes has righted a business that had been hemorrhaging money.
 "Turning around the truck business may be tougher than fixing the car business," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst at Auto Trends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J. "He's done a very good job."
 An unapologetic cost-cutter, but also a sophisticated businessman who played a central role in the negotiations that led to the 1998 merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, Mr. Cordes would seem to have the qualities needed to guide a trans-Atlantic company through troubled times.
 Though Mr. Zetsche is well regarded and still in the running, several insiders and analysts said Mr. Cordes was being viewed on both sides of the Atlantic as the rising star.
 "Of all the guys on the management board, he was the one the Americans felt most comfortable with," a former senior executive at Chrysler said. "He understands the way Americans think."
 Of course, handicapping the race to succeed Mr. Schrempp, who is 59, hinges on when the chief executive will head for the stables. His contract is due to expire in April 2005, but with DaimlerChrysler's problems fanning rumors about Mr. Schrempp's future, the chairman of the company's supervisory board, Hilmar Kopper, felt obliged last week to offer an endorsement of him.
 "I think the feeling that the strategy should be changed or that Mr. Schrempp should leave earlier is solely something that is nourished by the American media," Mr. Kopper said in an interview.
 Mr. Kopper, a former chairman of Deutsche Bank, which owns 12 percent of DaimlerChrysler, said other board members had encouraged him to extend Mr. Schrempp's contract. "A majority have made some sort of gentle indication, a remark like, 'Why don't we talk about extending Jurgen's contract. His time shouldn't be over too soon. We like what he is doing,"' he said.
 But Mr. Kopper's comments are unlikely to disperse the clouds over Mr. Schrempp, particularly if Chrysler does not recover from a $1 billion operating loss in the second quarter.
"He's got quite a bit of tarnish on him," Mr. Phillippi said. "I think the majority view among analysts is that the merger was an enormous mistake and that Schrempp is going to get the blame for it."
 Mr. Cordes was also one of the deal's architects, acting as an interlocutor between Daimler and Chrysler. Among other things, he helped broker a compromise between the two sides over the number of board seats each would hold, and what to call the combined entity. (Chrysler initially balked at taking a backseat to Daimler.)
 Despite the growing questions, Mr. Cordes said he did not feel a special obligation to defend the deal. All of DaimlerChrysler's executives, he said, back Mr. Schrempp's vision.
 "We are not facing a strategic problem here, but a very tough operational one," Mr. Cordes said in an interview. "I continue to be convinced that those problems can be fixed."
 Mr. Cordes described his division as DaimlerChrysler "writ small." The company is the world's top producer of commercial vehicles: heavy-duty trucks, buses and vans. But it faces problems stemming from the global economic downturn, especially in the United States.
 Sales of heavy trucks have fallen by more than 50 percent in North America since the late 1990's. That devastated Daimler's American truck maker, Freightliner, which lost close to $700 million in 2001.
 Mr. Cordes, who took over the truck unit in late 2000, administered bitter medicine, dismissing Freightliner's chief executive, closing three assembly plants, cutting the labor force in half and reducing wages.
 Freightliner now makes money, and Mr. Cordes projects a 2003 profit for the broader commercial vehicle division, which had an operating loss of $360 million in 2002. 
 "I don't want to be cynical," Mr. Cordes said, "but the good thing about having undergone such an operation is -- if you survive it, and we survived -- then you are well prepared for the future."
 Mr. Cordes is pinning his hopes on a rebound in the truck market in Europe and the United States. But he is also searching for new sources of growth: DaimlerChrysler recently agreed to buy a stake in a Chinese truck maker, Beiqi Futian.
 While Mr. Cordes waits for demographic trends to lift him up, he must navigate DaimlerChrysler's internal politics. A native of Neumunster, Germany, Mr. Cordes got a Ph.D. in political science at the University of Hamburg and started as an assistant to the manager at the Mercedes plant in Sindelfingen, near Stuttgart, in 1976. He has gained a reputation as a clearheaded strategist who could clean up corporate messes, though he is not, in auto industry parlance, a "car guy."
 NOW, insiders said, he must position himself for bigger things without appearing to be a self-promoter. Publicly, he has been scrupulous about not comparing his results with Mr. Zetsche's. 
 Mr. Kopper praised Mr. Cordes, but added, "Any of my possible candidates who comes out too early and starts talking to the media will not be my candidate."
 Given that Mr. Kopper put Mr. Schrempp in his job, that message is one that Mr. Cordes would do well to heed.
 "I love my job," he said, when asked whether he aspired to being the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler. "It's a challenging job. I could see myself being retired in this job."

Rhetoric Vies With Reality On a Hot Topic: Jobs

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Depending on the politician, jobless data can differ.JOBS -- the loss of them over the past three years and plans for creating them in coming years -- have moved quickly to the center stage of the young presidential campaign.
 President Bush and his aides refer to the recent tax cut, almost without exception, as the "jobs and growth" package. Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor seeking the Democratic nomination, said on Wednesday that he expected jobs to be the race's biggest issue. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, another Democratic candidate, interrupted himself in a recent debate to announce, "This is all about jobs." 
 With the attention has come an escalating battle between the parties to define the terms of the debate and the numbers used in it. To no one's surprise, that battle includes some hyperbole. Here is a guide to the economic rhetoric of the 2004 election:

DEMOCRATIC EXAGGERATION -- In their stump speeches, many Democratic candidates -- including Senators John Edwards of North Carolina and John Kerry of Massachusetts -- have taken to referring to a loss of three million jobs since Mr. Bush took office. Other Democrats mention a loss of "more than three million." Those who have used this figure recently include Terry McAuliffe, the party chairman; Donna L. Brazile, the manager of Al Gore's 2000 campaign; and Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee.
 But it is wrong. Since early February 2001, when employment peaked and just a few weeks after Mr. Bush took office, the number of jobs in the American economy has fallen by 2.84 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Tables on the bureau's Web site display a smaller loss, but the bureau plans a revision that is not yet included in them.)
 So where does "more than three million" come from? It is the decline in private-sector jobs, said a spokeswoman for Mr. Stark, who said he should have included that qualifier. But this is not nearly as relevant to the population's economic health as the overall job loss. It's a little like counting hits, not runs, after a baseball game.
 Such fine distinctions may seem like minutiae, but the parties clearly care about them. After I wrote about job loss back in July, when the number was 2.5 million, I received an e-mail message from an aide to Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, saying, "Please note that three million jobs have been lost."
 Isn't the problem big enough without exaggerating it?

REPUBLICAN DENIAL -- A few Republicans have their own version of the job-loss total: almost zero.
 Allan H. Meltzer and Brian S. Wesbury -- conservative economists, who have each made their arguments recently in essays on The Wall Street Journal's editorial page -- suggest that the Bureau of Labor Statistics' survey of businesses is so flawed as to deserve being ignored. They say the bureau's far smaller survey of households, which shows a loss of just 75,000 jobs since February 2001, should be the standard. They correctly note that the household survey often picks up jobs at start-up companies before the business survey does.
 But nonpartisan analysts still give far more credence to the business survey, which polls 400,000 establishments, compared with the 60,000 families in the other survey. The bureau itself and the Congressional Budget Office have both said recently that they trust the business survey.
 The household survey may well be counting many people who call themselves self-employed but are in fact finding little work. It also depends heavily on the Census Bureau's population estimates.
 With the help of unemployment insurance records, the government may eventually reduce the job-loss total. But the chances that it will fall anywhere near zero are roughly the same as the Nasdaq's odds of zooming above 5,000 again soon.

PRESIDENTIAL BOGEYMEN -- In a speech this month, Mr. Bush hailed his tax cuts as the main reason the 2001 recession was shallow by most standards. Then he added: "Some have said, 'Well, maybe the recession should have run its course, you know, maybe should have been deep, and you shouldn't have had the tax relief."' He never named the "some."
 No thoughtful policy maker or economist advocated a deep recession. The debate was about whether Mr. Bush's plans --which principally cut taxes for the wealthy, the people who pay the most taxes -- were the most effective way to stimulate the economy quickly. 
 The tax cuts did help the economy and are a big reason it is growing again today. But they have not been enough to prevent the worst loss of jobs in 20 years and the longest streak of losses since the 1930's. That is no exaggeration.

Enlisting Aid to Education In the War on Terror

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
IN his visit to Indonesia during an Asian tour that begins this week, President Bush is likely to announce as much as $150 million in aid for this nation's schools over the next five years. From the administration's viewpoint, Mr. Bush's emphasis on the importance of education abroad fits neatly with his interest in improving schools at home. Applied here, this emphasis is aimed at countering one of the broadest challenges to the United States: the appeal of fundamentalist Islam to young people in the Muslim world.
 On the theory that ignorance and poor education are among the reasons that young people are drawn to radical Islam, the Agency for International Development has been revamping its programs in Muslim countries in the last two years to spend more on schools and less on other things, including family planning. 
 After the Sept. 11 attacks, the administration sought increases in foreign assistance, arguing that the aid was crucial in fragile but friendly Muslim nations. Pakistan ($600 million), Afghanistan ($297 million) and Jordan ($250 million) were the main beneficiaries, and schools in those countries were given new attention.
Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, did not receive a significant increase in assistance, but with a school system that ranks among the weakest in the world, the president's visit is seen as an opportune time for the new emphasis on classroom learning. In spending per student, Indonesia has been the lowest in Asia, after Laos. Aggravating the problem, a handful of Islamic preachers have stepped into the void left by the state and established religious boarding schools that have turned out to be havens for young terrorists.
The United States is coming late to the game. Saudi Arabia has invested directly in Islamic schools here for years. At Gontor, the most prestigious religious boarding school in Indonesia, for example, the newest building is known as the Saudi building, after a Saudi government donation. The library has crisp new books in Arabic; its English books are more than a decade old.
In a study this year, A.I.D. found that the quality of education in primary and secondary secular schools had declined in all 12 Muslim countries that the report covered. The quality of schooling in Islamic institutions was even weaker. It turned out parents did not seem to care about the poor academic standards in the religious schools and indeed sought them for their strict Islamic education. Moreover, in all the countries, these religious institutions were seen growing in number: they were often located in poor neighborhoods, and were generally more affordable than state schools that required costly uniforms, textbooks and extra payments or bribes to teachers.
So how does the United States strengthen state schools in Indonesia -- or Pakistan or Egypt -- so that fewer parents send their children to Islamic boarding schools?
The most obvious option would be to strengthen the secular schools by working through national education bureaucracies. That seems to be the strategy in Pakistan, where A.I.D. has committed $100 million to the education ministry over six years. The money would not go to religious schools, known as madrasas, where direct American influence would be unwelcome anyway.
But in some countries, particularly Indonesia, the national education departments are famously corrupt. So American officials are seeking a new route: building alliances with school officials at the local district level. This is painstaking work, but holds the prospect of producing results because education in some of these countries is being decentralized.
In Egypt, where illiteracy rates are extraordinarily high among women and girls and where ideologically driven terrorism has been a problem for decades, A.I.D. financed a pilot program in community-based schooling in Alexandria, and persuaded the city's popular governor to back it. Though it still has a long way to go, the program, now several years old, is being replicated in four major provinces of Egypt.
In Indonesia, if all goes well, A.I.D.'s efforts could resemble the best of the results that the United Nations Children's Fund has achieved in one part of eastern Java. In the last two years in Probalinggo, with a population of 200,000, Unicef has introduced the idea of giving parents a role in deciding how school budgets are spent; it has also paid for teacher training that stresses student participation, and has encouraged community involvement in fund-raising.
At the weakest school in the district, the Raudlatul Ulum madrasa, run by an Islamic charity, it has been difficult to get the message across. The teachers still stand at the front of the class with long rulers in their hands, ready for disciplinary threats. The weekly parent-teacher meetings are only for men; female teachers are excluded. Sutik, a fifth-grade teacher who says she receives a monthly salary of $8 a month, says she has raised only $4 from parents for a bookshelf. (There is no money for books yet.)
But at the Ngepung state primary school, 10 miles away, Unicef has achieved a virtual transformation. Mothers work as teacher aides in overcrowded classrooms. The school has become known as the "banana school" because the local farmers donated their banana crop for an auction where local businessmen paid crazy sums so the school could buy computers.
Before class the other day, third-grade boys were making art on computer screens, while the girls learned multiplication tables with an innovative set of playing cards designed by the principal, Hadi Trilaksono. Showing a visitor classrooms with desks arranged in a friendly circle, Mr. Hadi said: "I'm trying to make the students more active, and not just sit and listen. I can tell the students enjoy it more that way."
For a nation known for the stultifying rote learning of its state education, those were rare scenes.

HEADLINE: THE READING FILE; 
For Arnold and America, Some Advice From Afar

 BODY:
In Austria, the victory of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was born in the province of Styria, was the occasion for wall-to-wall political and cultural commentary. Excerpts follow from editorials in the Oct. 9 issues of three Austrian dailies (translated by Victor Homola):

DER STANDARD
Left of center
 OCT. 7 will become a memorable date in the history of California. . . . 
 The man who made this possible might not look or behave like a symbol of sophisticated thinking -- but one cannot deny his victory. . . . He deserves his place in the pantheons of successful exile-Austrians.
However, . . . one can imagine two very different scenarios for Arnie's political future.
Screenplay No. 1: He will manage to negotiate a budget with the overwhelmingly Democratic parliament in Sacramento. . . .
California will accomplish a spectacular turnaround and pull the entire United States to a brighter economic future. This will benefit George Bush and secure his re-election. After, . . . the pressure to change the constitution will be so strong that Arnie will move to the White House as president in 2012. The only thing missing would be his public ascension as the greatest Styrian ever.
Screenplay No. 2: He will get trapped in grueling financial warfare with his Democratic counterparts and California will go downhill even further.
Frustrated voters . . . will tell him to go to hell with a sardonic hasta la vista. With the active encouragement of the Democrats, a group of women, who were molested by the sensuous Styrian, will raise the issue of sexual harassment again. Eventually, the Californian disaster . . . will damage fellow party member George W. Bush so badly that he will lose his job in 2004. The only thing missing would be the United States declaring war on Styria.

KRONENZEITUNG
The leading tabloid
THE terminator as statesman! . . . The Man of the People will be on hand for all Californians. 
But is this myth of the people a suitable tool to get a run-down political system going again? . . . Arnold Schwarzenegger now sees the hours, days, week, months and years of truth dawning. 
With his winning appearance he has won the support of the masses, by talking big he has awakened their big expectations, and with his simple slogans he made them believe in simple solutions. . . . 
It is up to Arnie now not to gamble away the trust of the people. the hard times are still forthcoming. . .

DIE PRESSE
Right of center
 THE elections of Arnold Schwarzenegger for governor were not as unique as Austrians pretended. In Minnesota, four years ago, a "man from outside," a bodybuilder without a precise political agenda, was also lifted into the office of governor on a wave of popularity; Jesse Ventura had the slogan "the people's governor" on his lips as well. 
Maybe Schwarzenegger will call his friend Ventura and ask him for a recipe to prevent failure. Because even in Hollywood, politics are more than the announcement of tax cuts. In this respect, Schwarzenegger can also ask another friend for advice, George Bush Sr. He had also won the elections with the slogan "Read my lips, no new taxes," but then lost his voters after a tax increase.
If both of them coach Schwarzenegger the right way, the Californians might perhaps go to bed with an action-hero and wake up next to a governor. Perhaps.

HEADLINE: Economy Worries Californians, but It's Not That Bad 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK and DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, Calif. Oct. 9 

 BODY:
When Van Daele Communities, a house builder here, put eight new houses on sale recently, 52 people camped out for as long as four days to have a chance to buy. 
 "We've never seen it like this in 25 years," said Mike Van Daele, the company's chief executive. Housing prices are appreciating as much as $10,000 to $15,000 a week, Mr. Van Daele said. 
 On the north side of town, spanking new light manufacturing buildings stretch through what were once orange groves. Some are already humming to life with companies making plastic bottles, stereo speakers and other products. 
"The economy's terrible, it's rotten -- look," Robin C. Treen, a commercial real estate broker, said with sarcasm as he drove a visitor around. 
Riverside hardly looks like a center for a political rebellion rooted in economic anxiety, yet that is precisely what it is. The residents of this inland county east of Los Angeles voted overwhelmingly to oust Gov. Gray Davis and to replace him with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Voters told pollsters they were concerned about California's economy though the economy is doing relatively well.
In a way, it is the story of an entire state. Despite the political upheaval, growing budget deficit, the electrical power crisis and the bursting of Silicon Valley's bubble -- all of which have created the image of a state deep in recession -- California's economy, by many measures, has done better than the rest of the nation's in the last few years. 
Military spending in the state is up about 40 percent since 2000 after plunging in the 1990's, according to Economy.com, a research company, and the Defense Department. House prices continue to rise in most of the state. Some places, like Riverside County, are creating jobs faster than almost anywhere in the country. 
At 6.4 percent, California's jobless rate in September was a bit higher than the nation's 6.1 percent, figures released Friday by the state Employment Development Department show. California suffered a sharp drop in payroll jobs in the month, in contrast to a gain nationally. Still the gap with the nation is far smaller than it was in the early 1990's after the military industry collapsed. 
"California has obvious problems," said James Diffley, an economist at Global Insight, a consulting firm that follows regional trends, "but the economic performance has been surprisingly good." 
This could offer Mr. Schwarzenegger his best hope for erasing the state's expected $8 billion deficit. Having promised not to raise taxes and to protect education spending, his deficit reduction plans depend to an unusual degree on the health of the economy and the speed at which revenue from current taxes comes in, economists say. 
But the health of the economy here, at least relative to other places, also means that a bounce strong enough to eliminate the deficit on its own is unlikely. Many consumers have already bought cars and houses in recent years, leaving less pent-up demand than at the end of most slumps. And neither technology, a pillar of California's economy, nor finance, another important sector, seem to be on the verge of a hiring surge. That could leave Mr. Schwarzenegger with some of the budget problems Mr. Davis had, forecasters say. "It's going to be very very hard," said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. 
Concern about the economy, is considered one of the major reasons voters recalled Mr. Davis and replaced him with Mr. Schwarzenegger last week, though dissatisfaction with Mr. Davis's performance was also a big factor. Polls of voters showed that 83 percent said the state's economy was in bad shape. Nationally, 56 percent of people rated the economy negatively in a recent New York Times/CBS poll. 
One reason that people here might view similar economic conditions more negatively than people elsewhere is because the boom here in the late 1990's was so great. Also, until the 1990's, Californians were used to their state routinely outstripping the nation economically. 
"Things aren't horrible here, but it's not as good a situation as we used to have," said Michael Bazdarich, forecasting center director at the University of California at Riverside. 
But many people in business here said that what sent them to the electoral barricades was not the economic statistics overall but concern about the state's business climate. In nearly a dozen interviews, businesspeople repeatedly cited soaring costs for electricity and workers' compensation, the increase in the vehicle tax and a recently passed law requiring companies with 20 or more employees to offer health insurance to all their workers. Businesspeople attribute many of these changes to developments in the Davis administration, which, they say ignored many of their complaints. 
"That's the way we feel, we keep getting slapped around," said Debbi Huffman Guthrie, who runs a roofing company here in Riverside that her grandfather started in 1921 but which Mrs. Guthrie said she recently considered closing. 
"I was ready to shut the doors on an 82-year-old business," she said. But Mrs. Guthrie said she is hopeful that Mr. Schwarzenegger will change things. 
High costs can make for a profitless prosperity. Tamco, a company in nearby Rancho Cucamonga that recycles scrap metal into reinforcing bars for concrete, has benefited from strong construction activity. Shipments this year should be the highest for the company, said Brad Wilkins, the chief financial officer. But profits will be the lowest in many years, because electricity rates and workers' compensation costs have soared. 
Bomatic, a maker of plastic bottles, based in nearby Ontario, is moving most operations to Utah next year, laying off 80 of its roughly 100 California employees, said Kjeld Hestehave, the owner. 
The company's power costs rose to $100,000 a month from $30,000 before the power crisis and workers' compensation has risen to $340,000 a year from $80,000 two years ago, he said. In Utah, those costs will be reduced as much as 90 percent, he said.
Mr. Schwarzenegger tapped into anger among businesspeople, making the retention and attraction of industry one of the main themes of his campaign. Executives say they cannot wait for him to take office. 
"I wish he would have stormed the governor's office the day he won," said David Harrigan, owner of Plascor, a bottle maker in Riverside. 
Economic conditions vary around the state. In San Jose, in Silicon Valley, the drop in employment since the peak is now the largest on record for any city, surpassing Detroit's loss in the 1980's, Economy.com said. 
Riverside County's growth, to some extent, reflects losses in coastal areas. People and businesses are flocking here from Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego in search of more affordable houses or more land for factories and warehouses. 
And, even here, growth has been spotty and slower than it was a few years ago. House building is booming, in part because of low interest rates. New houses mean new jobs in retailing, banking and other consumer services. Distribution has become a major employer. Ross Stores, Krispy Kreme and Walgreens have built or are building huge warehouses in Riverside or adjacent San Bernardino counties, which are known together as the Inland Empire. But manufacturing, which often provides high-paying jobs, is suffering in some cases. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger's immediate challenge will be the deficit, which stems in part from rising spending in the late 1990's, when the Internet boom swelled tax receipts. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger has said little specific about his economic plans. He has vowed to eliminate waste from state spending and promised not to raise taxes. He has vowed to repeal a recent increase in the car tax, which would add $4.2 billion to the deficit in the short term. He has also said he will try to get the state a bigger share of revenues from Indian casinos. 
But changing the regulations that businesses oppose will, in many cases, require laws, and the legislature is controlled by Democrats. 
Phil Angelides, the state treasurer and a Democrat, said "Democrats were not forthright in addressing the genuine problems of the business climate," he said. 
But he added that the state could prosper only by continuing to invest in education and maintaining a strong work force and a good quality of life. "Our ticket to prosperity is not to become the cheapest place in the world to do business," he said.

HEADLINE: As Factory Jobs Vanish, Sweet Talk Could Turn Tough 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
When the Carrier Corporation, the company whose name is synonymous with Syracuse, announced last week that it planned to shut down its manufacturing operations there and lay off 1,200 workers, Gov. George E. Pataki intervened to see if the state could offer enough incentives to make it worthwhile for the company to stay.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative James T. Walsh, the local congressman, also tried to prevent the move. 
 Carrier has not been persuaded. 
Now state and federal officials, who have watched helplessly as a million manufacturing jobs have left New York State in the past three decades, are wondering what, if anything, they can do to save jobs.
Many economists argue that it is futile to even try to halt the flow of manufacturing jobs out of historically industrial states like New York because the loss of these jobs is a natural, though painful, outcome of global economic forces. But that economic reality often collides with political necessity, as it did last week in the case of Carrier, an emblematic employer that said it would not build its air-conditioners in New York State anymore simply because the company can make more money by building them elsewhere.
Some lawmakers say that since carrots no longer seem to be working, it is time to consider some big sticks that would force companies to consider more than the bottom line when they move jobs offshore.
Carrier officials said the issue was not solely money but proximity. The company ships 80 percent of the shipping container refrigeration units it makes in Syracuse to Asia.
"It is not about the cost of manufacturing in New York State as much as it is about geography," said Jonathan Shaw, a spokesman for the company. There is nothing New York can do to entice the company to stay, he said, "unless they are going to pick New York State up and move it."
Carrier's decision was a body blow to central New York State, once a leader among Northeastern manufacturing areas. The announcement was also part of a grim trend decades in the making and quickened by the nation's recent economic troubles.
When manufacturing employment peaked in 1979, 1.5 million people worked in factories that made things in New York. Manufacturing was the backbone of the economies of most upstate cities, providing middle-class wages to millions of workers, sending their children to college and paying the taxes that kept these cities alive. 
Since 2001, when the country entered a recession, the nation has lost 2.8 million jobs, and one-tenth of the losses were in New York. Almost half the jobs lost statewide were in manufacturing.
Given these statistics, it is unsurprising that lawmakers would want to stanch the flow. New York, like other states, offers incentives to attract and retain jobs. Such programs are politically popular, but experts question their effectiveness.
Intense competition from factories in Asia that make products much more cheaply drives down the prices manufacturers can command, said Richard Deitz, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Buffalo who tracks manufacturing.
That competition means manufacturers must cut costs by increasing productivity, cutting back on labor and moving closer to customers or moving jobs overseas.
"A lot of changes in manufacturing are good for consumers because it means cheaper goods, and that is a benefit, very broadly speaking," Mr. Deitz said. "But what happens is that job losses are concentrated in certain areas."
So while consumers across the nation enjoy cheap goods, areas like New York suffer from higher unemployment, erosion of the tax base and population loss.
It is natural for politicians to try to ameliorate this by essentially subsidizing industry locally, said Robert E. Scott, an international economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal policy institute in Washington. But such subsidies are usually ineffective in the long run, he said.
"Paying companies to stay is less useful," Mr. Scott said. "It gets states involved in an endless race to the bottom. They compete to spend more and more to keep the same number of manufacturing jobs, and in many cases the employer leaves anyway."
A more effective role for government, Mr. Scott said, would be in leveling the playing field internationally by enforcing trade agreements and requiring labor standards from trade partners. The money states use to persuade companies to stay would be better spent on retraining workers whose jobs have vanished, he said.
New York has programs to retrain workers that are part of an effort to transform the state's economy by attracting new industry, particularly in technology, Pataki administration officials said. But keeping manufacturing jobs is important, too, to ease the transition, officials said.
Thomas J. Duesterberg, president of the Manufacturers Alliance, a public policy and research organization, said government did have a significant role to play in helping to keep manufacturers in the United States, but he said reducing corporate taxes and regulation, and tort reform, would be more effective than local subsidies.
Mr. Walsh, a Republican, said that if incentives did not keep manufacturers in New York, he planned to use deterrents. He said he would introduce a bill to require that companies that do more than 10 percent of their business with the federal government have at least 50 percent of their employees in the United States.
"There is a real firestorm brewing within the Congress on manufacturing jobs," Mr. Walsh said. "It is not just the Northeast being gouged or the Midwest, it is the South, too: Georgia, Tennessee and Texas losing jobs."
The loss of jobs, Mr. Walsh said, is too painful for communities to simply write it off to global competition, and he said the Bush administration needs to do more than just cutting taxes to ensure that manufacturing remains a vital part of the national economy. Businesses must be forced to consider the political consequences of their actions, not just the economic realities, he said.
"I think you need a stick," Mr. Walsh said. "I think you need a threat. This needs to be more than just a straight business decision. This needs to be a political decision, too."

Iraqi Cleric Proclaims His Own Government
An anti-American cleric, whose forces clashed with American soldiers and killed two of them, has proclaimed his own government in Iraq. The move failed to produce any signs of popular support, but did appear to notch up his defiance of the American-led occupation. 1

A great majority of foreign aid workers in Iraq, fearing that they have become targets of the postwar violence, have quietly pulled out of the country in the past month, leaving essential relief work to their Iraqi colleagues and slowing much of the reconstruction effort. 18

 President Bush will appear with California's governor-elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger, on a fund-raising trip to the state, a Republican close to the White House said. Mr. 
Bush's advisers said they were elated with the outcome of the race and said it would give them a strong foundation in a Democratic state they want to win in 2004. But Democrats said Mr. Schwarzenegger would be of little help to Mr. Bush if he wrestles as poorly with the state's financial crisis as did the man he defeated, Gray Davis. Elisabeth Bumiller

In Search of Savings, Companies Turn to the Sun

BYLINE:  By JIM RENDON

 BODY:
JOHNSON & JOHNSON, an icon of American corporate culture, is showing a growing interest in a technology once associated with backwoods cabins and pocket calculators. Like a number of other large companies, Johnson & Johnson has begun to generate its own power from the sun. 
 Solar power has evolved from being an expensive, pie-in-the-sky technology to one that is finally beginning to make business sense. Recent electricity shortages in California, the continuing gyrations in energy prices over all, and new state and federal incentives are among the reasons for companies' efforts to start or expand their use of the technology. 
 On a blustery fall afternoon, the solar installation on the roof of the United States headquarters of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceutica Products unit in Titusville, N.J., is producing 245 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power 245 homes. At their peak, the 2,850 solar panels can produce about 500 kilowatts of energy, making this one of the largest solar installations on the East Coast. The system provides about 10 percent of Janssen's annual electricity needs. 
 While Johnson & Johnson has corporate policies that support the use of green power, a large part of the decision to install the system, as well as three others on its buildings in New Jersey and California, was economic.
 "We looked at solar power two or three years ago, but we never got into the ballgame because the incentives were not there," said John Subacus, Janssen's director of facility management. "But new incentive programs made the project financially neutral, and we felt it was the best time to jump in and do something good for the environment." 
 The company said 57 percent of the cost of the Titusville system was covered by state and federal programs promoting solar energy use. 
 Companies including Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, Whole Foods Market and Domaine Carneros, a winery, have installed solar panels on some of their buildings. Not only will many of these systems pay for themselves within a decade, but those that do will then produce essentially free energy for another 15 years or more, providing as much as 40 percent of the energy needs of these businesses.
 On Janssen's roof, silicon solar panels the size of ceiling tiles snake around fans and ventilation ducts, absorbing the afternoon sun. As the sun hits each panel, the silicon molecules produce electrical charges -- a positive charge on one side of the panel and a negative one on the opposite side. Pipes containing wiring from each panel lead to a small shed behind the building, where the solar-generated power is converted from direct current to alternating current. It then flows into the building's electrical system.
 "It's been performing ahead of expectations," Mr. Subacus said. "Everyone involved in the program is happy with it." 
 Businesses often look for a two- to three-year payback on capital investments. Solar power cannot yet provide that; the average commercial installation is expected to pay for itself in five to nine years. Mr. Subacus said that Janssen's would take 20 years to pay for itself, much longer than average, because he is assuming that energy prices will rise only 4 percent annually; if they climb faster, the system will pay for itself sooner.
 Solar power accounts for only three-hundredths of 1 percent of all electricity generated globally, said Lisa Frantzis, director of renewable and distributed energy at Navigant Consulting in Chicago. Yet sales of equipment are growing quickly. Since the 1990's, the market for products that capture electricity from the sun has grown about 20 percent a year, In the last three years, the growth has accelerated to about 33 percent a year. 
 That impressive growth rate has lured investments from large corporations, many of which are better known for electronics or even pumping oil. Sharp is the world's largest provider of solar products, followed by the the BP Solar unit of BP; Kyocera; the Shell Solar unit of Royal Dutch/Shell; and Sanyo. 
 But solar power remains a small part of the balance sheet for many of these companies. BP Solar had $300 million in revenue in 2002, compared with BP's total of $178.7 billion. Nonetheless, Steve Westwell, president and chief executive of BP Solar, said he wants to be ready when solar power takes off.
 "The solar market is showing dramatic growth, which any corporation should be excited about," Mr. Westwell said. "It is increasingly looking like the right thing to do." 
 Solar energy has also been lucrative for smaller companies. The PowerLight Corporation, a company in Berkeley, Calif., with 100 employees, has made Inc. magazine's list of the 500 fastest-growing companies in America for four consecutive years. The company says its annual revenue has grown to $28 million from $800,000 in the five years through 2002. 
 PowerLight, which installed Johnson & Johnson's system, specializes in grid-connected solar energy. These systems draw electricity from the traditional power grid when they need it, and push electricity back into the grid for a credit when they don't. 
 That flexibility has appealed to a growing number of businesses. In 1999, grid-connected systems in the United States produced 4 megawatts of power. By the end of 2003, Ms. Frantzis estimates, they will account for 65 megawatts of electricity.
 Tom Dinwoodie, the chief executive of PowerLight, said: "Solar has a bad rap from back in the 1970's. But it is no longer on the fringe, and it feels great." 
 Solar rebate programs offered by states have also drawn interest. The 15 states that offer rebates for renewable energy projects have pledged $4.4 billion to them from 1998 to 2012, Ms. Frantzis said.
 In New Jersey, of the 200 projects completed or under way since its renewable energy program began in 2001, some 150 have been approved in the last six months alone. California has had a similar rush: 44 percent of its 530 applications were made in 2003. For commercial systems in New Jersey, rebates are as high as 60 percent. In New York, they are as high as 70 percent, with a cap of $500,000. 
 Residential solar systems are eligible for credits similar to those given to businesses. In New York and New Jersey, as much as 70 percent of the cost of a home grid-connected system can be recouped from the state. 
 Many programs intended to encourage solar use by businesses have started in the last two years and are just now drawing attention as companies learn that the systems can be a good investment.
 Domaine Carneros, a Northern California subsidiary of the French winemaker Champagne Taittinger, installed a solar system this summer. It produces 120 kilowatts of electricity, or 40 percent of the winery's energy needs. The entire system cost $800,000; the company received a 50 percent rebate from the state of California, along with some federal and state tax credits, and it can accelerate the depreciation on the investment over five years. 
 After those benefits, the final cost of the system is only $200,000, said Eileen Crane, Domaine Carneros's president and winemaker. At that price, the company estimates that the system will pay for itself after four years. 
 "I didn't expect it to be economically viable," Ms. Crane said. "I thought I would have a hard sell to the owners back in France. But the more I looked at it, the more it became clear to me that not only was it good environmental stewardship, but that it made full economic sense."
 UNLIKE other renewable power sources, solar panels provide the most electricity in the middle of the day, when demand is greatest. At such peak times, utilities charge businesses a premium for electricity, helping to make solar that much more attractive.
 That was a significant factor in the decision by Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. to install solar panels on a 635,000-square-foot building in Torrance, Calif., said Sanford Smith, Toyota's corporate manager for real estate and facilities. 
 "Solar power allows you to stabilize your power purchasing so you won't be buying peak power produced during the middle of the day," Mr. Smith said.
 The system provides 20 percent of the building's electricity. Toyota is evaluating the project and is likely to expand its use of solar energy, he said. 
 Even though solar power is on a growth curve in the United States, the technology is spreading even faster in Japan and Germany. In Japan, higher prices for other types of energy have bolstered the popularity of solar power. There are fewer than 5,000 grid-connected solar setups in the United States, compared with 40,000 systems in Japan, most of them residential, said Glenn Hamer, executive director of the Solar Energy Industries Association in Washington. 
 Other countries are also quickly developing uses for solar technology, Ms. Frantzis said. In 1999, the United States accounted for 17 percent of the global solar market. Last year, it accounted for only 13 percent. 
 Nonetheless, Ms. Frantzis is optimistic about solar power's future, even in the United States. "People see that eventually it is going to get there," she said. "Right now it is not so far off."

HEADLINE: The Building That Isn't There, Cont'd 

BYLINE:  By Tom Wolfe; Tom Wolfe is author of "A Man in Full." The first portion of this article appeared on Sunday and can be found online at nytimes.com/opinion.

 BODY:
Oh, they had thrown a regular fit before, hadn't they, they being the critics and the architecture scholars and the rest of the International Style crowd, over his American Embassy building in New Delhi. But once they got through their yawping and muttering over the marble, the gold, the water garden, the maharajah grillwork, etc., the name Edward Durell Stone was bigger than ever. It stood for imagination, daring, aloofness from the whole cult-programmed bunch of them.
 They might -- in fact, they surely would -- throw another fit over his new museum for Huntington Hartford . . . the tons of white marble, the precious wood veneers, the gold rugs, the red carpets, etc. At the same time, they would also surely have to deprogram themselves long enough to give credit for genius where genius deserved it. They weren't crazy, after all . . . 
 Take the red carpets, for example. They played an integral role in one of the most ingenious pieces of engineering ever attempted in a building that tall, 10 stories. Stone had divided the galleries into split levels connected by short, luxuriously wide flights of red-carpeted stairs, creating a grand central staircase with the galleries themselves serving as the landings. Any ambulatory person could walk from the ground floor to the topmost gallery, looking at pictures the whole way, without even realizing he'ddone it. Not even Frank Lloyd Wright's spectacular spiral ramp in the Guggenheim Museum could compare in originality or function. 
Today there is scarcely a living soul under the age of 60 who ever set foot in the Gallery of Modern Art during the time Mr. Hartford owned it . . . or has any idea of what it was once like . . . other than from the radioactive contamination remaining from the attacks upon the museum launched even before it opened in March of 1964. If there was a single major critic that year who was not a messenger girl for International Style orthodoxy, I never read her.
The critic who inflicted the cut that keeps on bleeding was Ada Louise Huxtable, architecture critic for The New York Times, with the never-to-this-day-forgotten comment that Mr. Hartford's museum reminded her of "a die-cut Venetian palazzo on lollipops." The "lollipops" referred specifically to the columns and their inset dark-marble discs, but the quip had le tout New York sniggering over the entire building. 
The truth is, the columns constitute a highly sophisticated repetition of the arches of the loggias up above in the form of both solids (the black marble discs) and voids (the arched spaces between columns) down below. The student of architecture might wish to go over to Columbus Circle and take a look at the virtuosity of this extraordinary interplay of positive and negative space before it is destroyed. 
The museum's often-derided "Islamic grillwork" is not grillwork at all but rows of portholes letting in light at the corners. The building contained no applied decoration . . . not even Stone, the avowed apostate, could get the old-time religion completely out of his bones in launching this, the first revolt by any established Modernist, against the icy grip of the French and German International Style orthodoxy.
But none of that mattered. The damnable lollipops gibe just wouldn't get tired and go away. In fact, while researching this article, I went into a library, and the first librarian I spoke to said, "Oh yes, the lollipop building."
As a going enterprise, Mr. Hartford's Gallery of Modern Art lasted only five years. The storm of derision in the press was a killer. Worse, no big donors were going to come forth to help him keep it going. Mr. Hartford was a good-looking, well-brought-up rich boy who had a reputation for big woolly projects that never panned out. He didn't fit anywhere in the New York network of corporate moguls who underwrite and climb such approved social ladders as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art or even the Whitney Museum of American Art, which is, hmmmm, a bit sketchy. Without big donors, those institutions couldn't stay open 30 minutes -- and the Gallery of Modern Art, thanks to the press, was beyond sketchy. Carrying the museum all by himself quickly became too much for Huntington Hartford. In 1969, he gave this historic masterpiece to Fairleigh Dickinson University, just to get out from under the load.
"Historic masterpiece." Here I take as my text Dean Stern. On this point, too, both sides will agree: Robert A. M. Stern is not only a noted architect but also the definitive historian of 20th-century New York City architecture. His Gibbon-scale trilogy, "New York 1900," "New York 1930" and "New York 1960," is a sweeping but rigorously scholarly 2,684-page study of the city's architecture from 1890 to 1976.
In a letter in February to a civic organization's panel on whether 2 Columbus Circle should be declared a landmark, he wrote: "No one will disagree that Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum is a masterpiece, though a highly idiosyncratic one, to say the least . . . I bring up the Guggenheim because there was a strong, mutually acknowledged kinship between Frank Lloyd Wright and Edward Durell Stone, whom many thought was the master's leading disciple."
Mr. Stern went on to characterize the museum as one of Stone's "masterworks," along with the embassy in New Delhi and Stone's own town house on East 64th Street in New York, whose entire facade was grillwork.
Lever House and the Seagram Building "represent the epitome of the correct, the orthodox in postwar Modernism," said Mr. Stern, while Stone's Huntington Hartford museum "pushed the envelope very far toward what would become Postmodernism. This building is a landmark in the history of architectural taste." He closed with an appeal: "Preserve this landmark whole. Preserve this public provocation, this embodiment of artistic risk-taking."
The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission preserved Stone's own town house, by landmarking it years ago, but refuses, despite constant appeals, to so much as hold a hearing on the museum. From the day the museum became eligible for landmark status in 1994, the commission's behavior puzzled me and many others. Naively, as it turned out, I had been thinking of landmark status in aesthetic and historical terms. The game proved to be about something else entirely.
In the hog-eat-hog economy of the 1990's, big porkers kept getting eaten up by bigger ones, and Gulf & Western, the first commercial buyer of the museum after Mr. Hartford's financial troubles, disappeared down the gullet of Viacom, and Viacom gave the building to the city in 1994 in return for tax breaks. 
The landmarks commission seemed to be getting a clear message from City Hall: lay off 2 Columbus Circle. 
The city envisioned a bidding war. It would sell the property for hundreds of millions to a developer and on top of that wind up with a big corporate taxpayer or two on the Department of Finance hard drive. From that day on, every time the question of a hearing on 2 Columbus Circle came up, the landmarks commissioners, as I see it, dove under their desks, clapped their hands over their ears, cried out to their secretaries to shove history and the concept of landmarks preservation itself through the shredder, and hid.
The fantastic bidding war, however, never occurred. By November of 1998 there were only two interested parties, Donald Trump, who wanted to demolish the museum and build something new, and the Dahesh Museum, which wanted a home for its collection of 19th-century academic art. Then Mr. Trump pulled out. The city's dreams of a tax-paying bonanza were over. 
At this point the American Craft Museum moved in to challenge the Dahesh. Being far better connected politically, with a former chairwoman of the landmarks commission, Laurie Beckelman, on the payroll, the craft museum renamed itself the Museum of Arts and Design and flicked the Dahesh aside like a dead Taiwanese watch battery. In came Architect Brad Cloepfil and Ephemeralism -- which brings us to where we are today, awaiting, unless the plans change drastically, the first example of the old peekaboo, I-see-you-game ever built on Columbus Circle.
Soon, during the next few days, weeks, months at the most, an appalling smack will be heard throughout New York. It will not be hostile fire. It will be the sound of the landmarks commissioners hitting the deck once more . . . while one of the most important buildings in the history of 20th-century architecture is vaporized and small urban creatures sniff the stench that's left in the air.
Well . . . one can always hope the Museum of Arts and Design's retro trek back to Ephemeralism will be "fun" at least:
In yesterday's polluted air
I saw a museum that wasn't there.
It wasn't there again today.
O how I wish it would go away.
Postscript: It so happens Stone had a vision for the Circle itself that was never realized. He wanted to eliminate the traffic lanes that ran through it, make it whole again and ring the outer edge with three-story-high Doric columns salvaged from the Seventh Avenue facade of Pennsylvania Station, whose demolition had begun barely four months before the Gallery of Modern Art was completed. He had two things in mind: creating a proper stage for the towering monument to Christopher Columbus at the center -- and a proper memorial for Penn Station, a masterpiece of New York architecture by the great architects McKim, Mead & White, that had been sold to the highest bidder and destroyed, columns and all, and fed to the Jersey marshes in a senseless but innocent-by-reason-of-uncontrollable-cupidity act of vandalism. 
The what-have-we-done shock that followed led directly to the creation of the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1965. As the French say: "Apres la mort le medecin." After death, the doctor shows up.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article on Oct. 13 about the fate of a building designed by Edward Durell Stone at Columbus Circle incorrectly described the circumstances under which the Museum of Arts and Design changed its name and hired a former landmarks commissioner. The museum changed its name from the American Craft Museum after it was awarded the 2 Columbus Circle site in June 2002, not before. It also put the former commissioner, Laurie Beckelman, on its payroll after winning the site, not before. The article incorrectly described the status of Donald J. Trump's bid to develop the site. Mr. Trump never removed himself from consideration.

HEADLINE: Sayre Journal; 
A Small Town Loses Its Prisoners and Livelihood

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: SAYRE, Okla. 

 BODY:
Nearly 1,000 criminals were hauled away from here this summer, all of them incarcerated convicts, never to return. It pained nearly everyone to see them go.
 The exodus from this remote western Oklahoma town took with it about 225 jobs and a third of the government's revenues after a furor over the cost of inmates' phone calls led to the closing of a prison. 
 "It's a huge blow," said Elaine Barker, the city clerk. With the prisoners gone, the operating budget this year has been chopped by a third to $2.7 million, Ms. Barker said. Plans for a new City Hall have been halted indefinitely. The city has put off renovating an old building for the Police and Fire Departments and constructing a 60-unit apartment complex to relieve the acute housing shortage. 
Hiring has stopped. One of five water department jobs has been cut. With nothing to build, the city construction manager has been let go. The job of economic development director has been eliminated. The city had budgeted for a full-time treasurer to succeed the part-time treasurer, who retired, but now Ms. Barker has inherited those duties.
After a heady run of rebuilding and face-lifting, Sayre, about 120 miles west of Oklahoma City, is at a dead stop, all because of the collapse of its primary economic engine: a five-year-old, $35 million, red-roofed, gray-walled, privately run medium-security prison, the North Fork Correctional Facility.
Over the summer, the prison management company, the Corrections Corporation of America, sent the 989 inmates, all from Wisconsin, to another of its facilities, 100 miles northeast of Sayre. Now the state-of-the-art prison in Sayre languishes in its prairie-grass setting.
Sayre's travails arose from the loss of commissions it had received on prisoners' collect, long-distance telephone calls home to Wisconsin. Their families each paid about $22 for 20 minutes. Sayre collected up to 42 percent, and the contractor, AT&T, took the rest. For the fiscal year that ended in June, Sayre's share amounted to $656,000, close to the entire city budget in the years just before the prison opened. 
"We got ourselves into a situation where we were unable to control the outcome," Jack W. Ivester, the mayor and a lawyer, said. "Looking back, there were a couple of road signs that we missed."
Sayre, population 4,114 before the inmates left, is one of about 200 rural communities in the nation, many ravaged by population declines and the loss of farms, factories and mines, that brought in prisons to bolster their economies during the 1990's. Swallowing fears about the proximity of criminals, the towns tapped into a growing population of prisoners and a shortage of prisons in many states.
"To my mind," Jack McKennon, the city manager of Sayre, said two years ago while the town prospered, "there's no more recession-proof form of economic development." 
But in some states, growth in the number of prisoners has stalled, and some are opening new prisons so they won't have to send inmates elsewhere. Burned, Mr. McKennon says now, "It's just like a manufacturing plant that says they're going to move to China or Mexico."
For a couple of years, Wisconsin pressed the corrections company, based in Nashville, for lower telephone rates. But the company, which had no say about the contract that would not expire until next November, deferred to Sayre and AT&T. City officials say that they tried to renegotiate it but that AT&T declined. "The rates we charge are no higher in Oklahoma than anywhere else," a spokesman for AT&T, Kerry Hibbs, said. 
The corrections company, faced with losing its contract to house the Wisconsin prisoners, moved the men to its prison in Watonga, Okla., where it holds the telephone contract and can meet the Wisconsin limit of about $8 for a 20-minute call.
Sayre officials said that six and seven years ago, during the discussions about building a prison, no one -- not they, the corrections company or the state of Wisconsin -- raised doubts about charging inmates much higher rates than consumers pay. The fees were high, Ms. Barker said, "but in defense of the city, the contract was in place when Wisconsin signed the contract with C.C.A. to house their prisoners here." 
Still, Mayor Ivester said, "when Wisconsin prisoners went to Sayre, we started getting complaints."
"When we received those complaints," he continued, "we conveyed them to AT&T, and that's where I think the problem was. AT&T was inflexible. On two occasions, the city went to AT&T and said, 'You need to accommodate the rates with the complaints from Wisconsin.'
"In both cases we were rebuffed," the mayor said. "The answer was no. A third time we went to C.C.A. and said, 'We've tried. You talk to them.' C.C.A. experienced the same inflexibility we did." 
Bill Clausius, the spokesman for the Wisconsin prison department, said the state repeatedly pressed the corrections company to bring rates down to $1.25 to connect and 22 cents per minute, well below the Sayre rate of $3.95 to connect and 89 cents a minute.
Mr. Hibbs at AT&T said: "We find it hard to believe that they would shut down the prison over telephone rates. We had no interest in shutting the prison down." 
Ms. Barker said, "AT&T wanted us to buy out the contract for a price of $850,000, which was way above our means."
With the corrections company looking more and more determined to move the men, AT&T let Sayre out of the contract in late June at no cost to the city and washed its hands of further business here. In a statement then, AT&T said, "We wish Sayre well in finding a new phone service provider for its prison and hope that the facility and accompanying jobs will be saved." 
But by then Wisconsin and the corrections company had had enough, and the vans to Watonga were rolling. "Everyone tried to get those rates lowered," said Louise Green, vice president for marketing at the corrections company. "It was not done."
Sayre and the corrections company, both with big stakes in the prison here, are seeking a new customer. Once they have one, Sayre could resume collecting water and sewer fees from the prison and a sales tax from the prison commissary but much less from the telephone calls.
To avoid another closing, Ms. Barker said, "we're negotiating with different phone companies, and we've got some really nice proposals." 
Mostly, though, they would be nicer for prisoners. "It would cut our income tremendously," she said.

HEADLINE: China Plans Giant Step This Week 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Amid all the clutter that has been rocketed into space is a clunky satellite expected to circle the Earth until 2070. The satellite, the Dong Fang Hong, was the first ever launched by China, in 1970, and is also an extraterrestrial boombox: It broadcasts into the cosmos the strains of the Maoist anthem, "The East is Red."
 If China becomes the third nation to send an astronaut into space, as it plans to do on Wednesday, its top leaders will be sending a new message, to two audiences. 
 To the rest of the world, China is displaying its growing technological prowess, staking its claim to a future role in space and reasserting its case for being considered a power equal to the United States. 
To its own people, the Chinese leadership hopes to stir pride and nationalism and to prove that the Communist Party, rather than being a dinosaur, is capable of the most technical of achievements. A full-throttle propaganda campaign is under way, with huge coverage in state-run newspapers and a 20-part series about the space program about to run on state-run television.
"It's primarily about showing the world; it's about prestige," said Brian Harvey, author of a 1998 book about the Chinese space program. "It's a vindication of their political system."
The mission is meant to orbit the earth 14 times in 21 hours before returning, but it opens the way toward China's much bigger ambitions in space. The government plans to launch a Hubble-like space telescope and to begin exploring the moon within three years. Analysts say China is working to launch a space station, possibly to coincide with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
For now, though, the Shenzhou V is the center of attention. The spacecraft is scheduled to blast off between next Wednesday and Friday from a launching site in the Gobi Desert. The government has still not identified the astronauts. Nor has it said how many astronauts will be on board, through there reportedly will be between one and three.
It might seem anticlimactic to join a space club where the original members, the former Soviet Union and the United States, each sent astronauts into space more than 40 years ago. But if China's late entry speaks to its arrested development, it also underscores the country's determination to be in space and to pursue scientific excellence.
Centuries ago, China invented the rocket as well as gunpowder. But Chinese political analysts and historians note that the country's leaders, many of them engineers or technicians, are strongly influenced by Chinese history from the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the country faced foreign invaders with superior weapons and technology.
"From that time on, China has always been preoccupied with copying and catching up with foreign science and technology," said Lei Yi, a historian of modern China at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "The launching of the Shenzhou V is really a logical extension of this line of thought that goes back a century -- saving the nation through science and technology."
The former Chinese president and party chief, Jiang Zemin, who remains the head of the military, which ultimately controls the space program, restarted the astronaut flight program in 1992. (In the 1970's, China discontinued a secret, manned program.) An editor at a major state newspaper, who spoke on condition of anonymity, attributed Mr. Jiang's interest, in part, to his fear of falling too far behind the West.
Mr. Jiang and his successor as president and party chief, Hu Jintao, are expected to attend the launching. "The space program is really Jiang Zemin's legacy, and if the launch is successful, he'll want his share of the glory," the editor said.
There have been reports of debate within China's scientific community about the value of spending so much money on space -- the annual budget is $2 billion --- and whether the mission will generate real scientific breakthroughs. He Zuoxiu, a senior physicist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said he would applaud a successful launching, but cautioned against reading too much into one.
"If the launch is successful, we'll have joined the space club, but that doesn't mean we're a scientific power -- far from it," he said.
Mr. He said China spends only about 1 percent of its gross domestic product on scientific research and development. He said he understood the reasons for sending astronauts into space, but noted that, scientifically, there may be more pressing areas of concern.
"China faces a severe energy shortage, the gap in oil production is growing," he said, offering examples. "Also, transport is extremely backward -- look at the railways." But he concluded that "international prestige is the most important consideration here."
Asked about plans for a moon mission, he added:
"Some people will say that we have more pressing problems to deal with before taking on a moon landing, like feeding and clothing all our people."
It is unclear how much the preparations are resonating with the public, but one state-run newspaper reported this weekend that people were pouring into the launching area in hopes of getting a glimpse of the blastoff.
"The Chinese public is also deeply aware of China's image as a scientifically backward country, and I think the idea of reviving China as a scientific power is very popular," said Mr. Lei, the historian. He said the Chinese were stunned by American technical expertise in the Iraq war.
The emergence of China as a space power, possibly with military goals, has spurred some predictions of another space race. India, for one, is rushing to match China. But even as conservatives in the United States regard China's intentions warily, other experts minimize the chance of a coming race with America.
John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said it would likely take a decade for China to send an astronaut to the moon. He said the space program is developing antisatellite weapons and robotic space weapons, but said he did not think that the Shenzhou V had military applications.
"It's earning them a seat at the central table on space issues," he said.

HEADLINE: Faith Fades Where It Once Burned Strong 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: ROME, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Like many Italians in decades and childhoods past, Giampaolo Servadio used to go to Roman Catholic Mass every week. He even served as an altar boy.
 But last Sunday morning, as church bells tolled around this city of storied cathedrals, he followed a different ritual: he went running. It struck him as a more relevant use of time. 
 "The church seems really out of step," said Mr. Servadio, 39, mentioning issues like birth control and questioning the very utility of prayer. "I don't see how something like a confession and a few repetitions of the 'Hail Mary' are going to solve any problems." 
He wondered if he should call himself Catholic: "When you realize that for 20 years you don't do this -- you don't even go to church -- what kind of Catholic are you?"
A fairly typical one, at least in Italy and much of Europe, where the ties of Christianity no longer bind the way they once did -- and often seem not to bind at all.
This week Pope John Paul II is to celebrate his 25th anniversary as the head of the Roman Catholic Church, which is both Europe's and Christianity's largest denomination.
It has been a quarter century of enormous changes, and few have been more significant, for his church and mainstream Protestant denominations, than the withering of the Christian faith in Europe and the shift in its center of gravity to the Southern Hemisphere.
Christianity has boomed in the developing world, competing successfully with Islam, deepening its influence and possibly finding its future there. But Europe already seems more and more like a series of tourist-trod monuments to Christianity's past. Hardly a month goes by when the pope does not publicly bemoan that fact, beseeching Europeans to rediscover the faith. 
Their estrangement has deep implications, including the prospect of schisms in intercontinental churches and political frictions within and between countries.
The secularization of Europe, according to some political analysts, is one of the forces pushing it apart from the United States, where religion plays a potent role in politics and society, shaping many Americans' views of the world. 
Americans are widely regarded as more comfortable with notions of good and evil, right and wrong, than Europeans, who often see such views as reckless. 
In France, which is predominantly Catholic but emphatically secular, about one in 20 people attends a religious service every week, compared with about one in three in the United States. 
"What's interesting isn't that there are fewer people in church," said the Rev. Jean Francois Bordarier of Lille, in northern France, "but that there are any at all."

Debates Over Gays and God
While France is an extreme case, its drift from Christian institutions and disparity with the United States hold true throughout much of Europe, where faithful attendance at Christian services, be they Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox, is the province of a small minority of people. 
They show up to mark crucial milestones in their and their loved ones' lives. But they pay minimal heed, between those visits, to their churches' exhortations and admonitions.
The tension between contemporary attitudes and traditional church teachings has forced an emergency meeting this week of the leaders of the worldwide Anglican Communion.
They are expected to debate the acceptability of openly gay bishops in their church. Representatives from congregations in the developing world have threatened to break the church in two if their Western peers head in a permissive direction.
The preamble of a new, unfinished constitution for the European Union omits any mention of Christianity or even God among the cultural forces that shaped Europe, although the pope and other Christian leaders raised vehement objections.
"My own view is that there is a form of secular intolerance in Europe that is every bit as strong as religious intolerance was in the past," said John Bruton, a former Irish prime minister who was involved in the drafting of the document. He lobbied for God's inclusion.
Mr. Bruton's vantage point is Western Europe, but many Eastern European countries -- with a few exceptions, like the pope's native Poland -- are no more demonstrably devout. Having gone through religious outbursts after their emergence from Communism, they too seem poised to pivot in a secular direction.
Christianity's greatest hope in Europe may in fact be immigrants from the developing world, who in many cases learned the religion from European missionaries, adapted it to their own needs and tastes, then toted it back to the Continent.
In cities like Paris, Amsterdam and especially London, there are many thriving independent black churches, packed with newcomers from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and other African countries.
A recent report by Christian Research, a British group, determined that blacks and, to a lesser extent, Asians represent more than half the churchgoers in central London on a given Sunday, though they represent less than a quarter of the area's population.
By some estimates, more than 25 million people in England identify the Church of England as their denomination. Only 1.2 million actually go to one of the church's services every week.
Other Protestant denominations are in the same shape.
"In Western Europe, we are hanging on by our fingernails," wrote the Rev. David Cornick, the general secretary of the United Reformed Church in Britain, in the June-July edition of Inside Out, a religious journal. "The fact is that Europe is no longer Christian."

Believing vs. Attending
That is something of an overstatement. Despite a recent influx of Muslim immigrants and the rise of mosques in countries like Britain, France and Germany, an overwhelming majority of Europeans who profess religious devotion consider themselves Christian. But for most, Christianity has evolved into an amorphous spiritual inclination rather than an exacting creed. 
Stephanie Vercamer, a 31-year-old florist in Lille, wears a gold cross around her neck and said it saved her from injury in a car crash several years ago. "There is a God," Ms. Vercamer said. "I wouldn't be here today if there wasn't."
But she said that she almost never sets foot in a church and that while she wanted to arrange a Roman Catholic baptism for her daughter, who was born out wedlock, she had not been able to yet. The little girl is 3 years old.
At the Saint Sacrement church in Lille, attendance at Mass often drops below 50 but rose above 125 on a recent weekend. The Rev. Emile Reyns, a priest there, gladly reported that he had recently done prenuptial counseling for six couples: proof, he said, that young adults still wanted Catholic weddings.
But he sadly conceded that all the couples had been living together for a while.
"They say it without blushing," said Father Reyns, 66, who added that he did not expect to see the couples much once they moved on to their honeymoons. At Saint Sacrement, like many other congregations, the regulars tend to be much older.
"In terms of religion, Europe is very complicated," said the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, the author of "Religion in Europe at the End of the Second Millennium," which was published this year.
Sizable majorities of people in most European countries believe in God, and sizable majorities believe as well that some kind of religious service is important when a person dies, according to the European Values Study, a sweeping survey conducted in 1999 and 2000 and published this summer. 
But they are less familiar with, or tethered to, the specific rituals and roots of Christian worship. "If you ask the average European the basic credo or statements of the Christian church, most of them don't know," said Grace Davie, a sociologist at the University of Exeter and the author of several books about religious trends in Britain and Europe.
That assessment is supported by the caretakers of the faith themselves.
Last month Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, the archbishop of Milan, said at a news conference, "The parishes tell me that there are children who don't know how to make the sign of the cross."
"At the elementary schools, they don't know who Jesus is," added the cardinal, who is widely considered to be a strong candidate for the papacy.
According to the European Values Study, only about 21 percent of all Europeans said religion was "very important" to them. Although the methodology was not precisely comparable, a Gallup Poll this year showed that 58 percent of Americans defined religion that way.
Even in Italy, where 33 percent of respondents described religion as "very important," the percentage of Italians who go to church every week is as low as 15 and no higher than 33, according to various polls.
Most Italians seem not to listen to the Vatican, even though about 85 percent identify themselves as Roman Catholic and the pope resides smack in the middle of their country.
John Paul has exhorted them to be fruitful and multiply, forbidding artificial birth control. But Italians have had one of the world's lowest fertility rates for a quarter century now.
In a 1981 referendum, Italians defied an aggressive campaign by John Paul and other Roman Catholic leaders and voted by a margin of two to one in favor of legal abortion. Abortion is now readily available and commonplace in most European countries, as it is in the United States.
Europeans are moving well ahead of Americans -- and more aggressively challenging traditional Christian teachings -- by providing civil recognition for same-sex couples. Despite stern opposition from the Vatican, the French, Belgian, Dutch and German governments have granted same-sex couples legal entitlements and protections, and Britain is considering it, too.
But the diminished sway of Christianity is evident in more than low fertility rates and bold new legislation.
Public schools throughout Western Europe have removed crosses from walls. Many congregations have been forced to close or combine operations, to make do with part-time ministers or to import pastors from the developing world.
On this continent, ministry has lost much of its luster.
"In Western Europe," said Archbishop Giuseppe Pittau, the secretary of the Vatican congregation in charge of seminaries, "it's been almost a tragedy. A diocese that once had 10 priests ordained every year might have two, or one, or less."
The desperation is evident. In September, when a group of Catholics in a rural town near Rome heard that the local monastery would be closed and the monk would be sent away, they kept him there for several days by bricking up and barricading the entrances.

Urban Stresses, Wider Choices
There are many suggested reasons for Europe's drift, which happened gradually, over decades, as the continent grew wealthier and better educated.
One is a modern European cynicism about big institutions, grand ideologiesand unfettered allegiances, manifest not only in partly empty churches but also in weakened support for labor unions and political parties.
"It's an overarching thing, a diminishing trust," said Rudiger Noll, director of the Brussels-based Church and Society Commission of the Conference of European Churches, an interdenominational group.
The process of urbanization moved Europeans from quiet places where the church was at the center of life to chaotic bazaars where it got lost in the din.
The Rev. Enzo Bianchi, a Catholic theologian in Italy, said that in today's heterogeneous and often hedonistic European capitals, "there are more and more morals and ethics on the market."
"There's Buddhism, Hinduism, New Age spiritualism, consumerism," Father Bianchi said. "With all these competitors, it's harder for the church to sell."
But in the United States, to name one country, many of the same dynamics have not prompted a similarly pronounced estrangement. Some experts say that in Europe, suspicion of major denominations may run higher because religious leaders directly wielded political power in the past. Others say the unchallenged supremacy of state-blessed faiths in Europe -- like the Lutherans in Scandinavia and Anglicans in Britain -- perhaps turned out to be a curse.
"Monopolies damage religion," said Massimo Introvigne, the director of the Center for Studies on New Religions in Turin and a proponent of the relatively new theory of religious economy. "In a free market, people get more interested in the product. It is true for religion just as it is true for cars."
It also has reverberations well beyond the pews.
"I've been struck by the way in which religion now serves to underpin the divergence between Europe and the United States, and where I particularly saw that over the last year or two was in attitudes about the Middle East," said Philip Jenkins. Dr. Jenkins is a British scholar who teaches history and religious studies in the United States and wrote "The Next Christendom" (2002), about changing patterns of Christian worship around the world.
"Americans still take biblical and religious arguments very seriously, and therefore give a credence to the Zionist project that Europeans don't," Dr. Jenkins said.
He said that for many Americans, the frequency with which President Bush invoked morality and religion in talking about the fight against terrorism was neither striking nor discomfiting. "But in Europe," he added, "they think he must be a religious nut."
The president's brand of certainty and fervor is not easily found here. But it exists, if one knows where to look for it.

'Hallelujahs' and Pragmatism
At least 3,000 people, some clapping, singing and swaying from the moment they left their cars, turned out on a recent Sunday at the Kingsway International Christian Center in East London.
That was just for the first of three scheduled services.
Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo could not welcome each of the worshipers personally, but his face beamed from screens and monitors scattered throughout the gargantuan assembly hall. His voice thundered over loudspeakers.
His message was a blend of Corinthians and Hallmark, gospel truth and pop psychology, rendered in the style of a convention center motivational speech.
"If you don't change your thinking from stinking thinking, your life will stink," he told the parishioners, who shouted "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!"
"Turn the dream machine on," he said.
Pastor Ashimolowo, a Nigerian immigrant, started Kingsway 11 years ago, and it now claims about 10,000 members in East London, along with thousands more elsewhere. Many are from Africa, or their parents were.
They belong to a stream of European newcomers who were already Christian when they arrived in Britain -- or France or Switzerland or Holland -- but did not find in the Protestant and Catholic churches of Western Europe what they remembered and relished from home.
They wanted excitement, spontaneity and a kind of inspiration that spoke directly to them. Throughout many European cities, independent Pentecostal churches that are unaffiliated with traditional denominations sprung up to deliver that.
London today is full of them. Some are gigantic, like Kingsway. Others inhabit narrow, indistinct storefronts in working-class neighborhoods.
Worshipers often speak in tongues and take part in faith healings, practices that have begun to crop up as well in more traditional settings, like a United Reformed congregation in East London.
A decade ago, that congregation had dwindled to fewer than 10 members, some white and some black. Then the Rev. John Macauley from Sierra Leone took over. He gambled that the future of the parish was in a more ebullient style of worship.
"I was the only one clapping my hands back then, like I was from Planet Cuckoo," he said.
But that sound and sensibility, which soon led to a drum kit and baptismal pool on the altar, tugged new congregants into his orbit. His church now has more than 250 members.
Both it and Kingsway deliver more than an adrenaline rush. They strive to be practical, and they market themselves that way.
At Kingsway, glossy brochures for a new religious seminar promise advice on "how to be entrepreneurs," "mastering your finances" and "managing your relationships."
There is emerging evidence that the promise of a tightly knit community and a certain intensity of experience can lure more affluent, established Europeans into church as well, especially if those Europeans are young.
Some sociologists say new data suggest a possible reawakening of Christian interest in people under 30, and Christian movements throughout Europe are reaching out aggressively to them.
The Emmanuel Community in France has wooed hundreds to gatherings like one in Paris on a recent Saturday night, where scores of well-dressed professionals nibbled quiche and sipped wine in a courtyard under the moonlight.
Then, around 10 p.m., they hurried across the street to a centuries-old cathedral where they titled their heads backward, lifted their palms heavenward and rocked back and forth, in thrall to a religious ardor that most of Europe has lost.

HEADLINE: WELFARE SPENDING SHOWS HUGE SHIFT 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
New government figures show a profound change in welfare spending, shifting money from cash assistance into child care, education, training and other services intended to help poor people get jobs and stay off welfare.
 Cash assistance payments now account for less than half of all spending under the nation's main welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, federal officials say. 
 The proportion has been declining steadily since 1996, when Congress revamped welfare and abolished the guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children. The 1996 law required most adults to work within two years of receiving aid and gave states sweeping authority to run their welfare and work programs with lump sums of federal money. 
"Welfare" used to mean a monthly check that could be immediately converted to cash. But statistics tabulated by the Department of Health and Human Services, at the request of The New York Times, show that the proportion of federal and state welfare money spent on cash assistance declined to 44 percent in 2002, from 77 percent in 1997. The proportion allocated to various types of noncash assistance shot up to 56 percent, from 23 percent in 1997.
"The program has been fundamentally transformed," said Wade F. Horn, assistant secretary of health and human services in charge of welfare policy.
The federal and state money is used not only to provide a minimal income to single mothers, but also to help them move from welfare to work, hold onto low-wage jobs and move into better-paying jobs.
The money is being used to pay for transportation from home to work, to treat drug abuse and mental health problems and to provide temporary shelter for women who have suffered domestic violence. The money is also used for one-time payments -- for example, for car repairs -- to alleviate immediate financial needs, so people never go on the welfare rolls.
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is financed jointly by the federal government and the states. Of the total of $25.4 billion spent in 2002, about $11.2 billion was for cash assistance and $14.2 billion was for noncash benefits.
Joel Potts, the welfare director in Ohio, said that nearly 75 percent of Ohio's welfare money was spent on cash assistance before 1996. Now, Mr. Potts said, only 30 percent goes for cash assistance, while 31 percent is spent on child care, and 39 percent goes for job training, vocational education, transportation, housing and counseling.
"This is a fundamental and significant shift in social policy," he said.
Wisconsin says it spent $217 million on cash assistance in 1997 and $72 million on child care subsidies. In 2002, it spent $40 million on cash assistance and $266 million on child care.
In Ohio, Wisconsin and other states, much of the child care money goes to people who are not receiving monthly welfare checks -- families who have left welfare or never been on it.
Mark H. Greenberg, a lawyer at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a research and advocacy group, said that by directing money from the welfare block grant to child care, job training and other services, states had been able to "hold down welfare caseloads." Indeed, Mr. Greenberg said, a large share of the welfare block grant is being used to help families who do not receive welfare in the traditional sense.
The official federal tally of welfare recipients counts only people who are receiving monthly cash assistance.
Since the welfare law was signed in 1996, the number of people on welfare has plunged, to 5 million from 12.2 million, a 59 percent decline. The federal government provides a fixed amount to the states, $16.5 billion a year, regardless of how many people are on the rolls.
Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means subcommittee responsible for welfare policy, said: "The welfare caseload is changing more than it is shrinking. There are certainly fewer people receiving cash assistance, but there are also more people receiving child care, employment services, vocational training and other assistance designed to promote work."
Cynthia M. Fagnoni of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said: "Prior to welfare reform, states focused their welfare spending on providing monthly cash payments. Since welfare reform, states are spending a smaller proportion of welfare dollars on monthly cash payments and a larger share on services."
The federal government does not have comprehensive data showing the number of people who receive noncash benefits and services subsidized by the main federal-state welfare program.
But the trend is clear. "While cash assistance caseloads were falling by half," Mr. Greenberg said, "state child care caseloads were doubling, to about two million. Politically, there is much more support for child care than for cash assistance."
Mr. Potts, the Ohio official, said the new strategy was no less expensive than the old one.
"The cheapest thing to do is to pay a woman to stay home and raise kids in extreme poverty," he said. "We did that for 60 years. We found that cash assistance, by itself, leads to nothing."
Robin Arnold-Williams, director of the Utah Department of Human Services, said: "The old traditional welfare program is now an employment program. But it requires an upfront investment that may cost more in the short run. Child care alone may be more expensive than handing out a cash grant."
Sharon Parrott, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group, said that child care, transportation and other services had been "an enormous help to low-income families, enabling them to stay off welfare and to make the transition from welfare to work." But she added, "Falling caseloads amid rising poverty are cause for concern."
The number of people in poverty rose to 34.6 million in 2002, from 31.6 million in 2000, the Census Bureau reported last month. But the number of people on welfare continued to decline, to 5 million in 2002, from 5.8 million in 2000.
Many states use welfare money to aid victims of domestic violence. Welfare officials say that at least 20 percent of welfare recipients have suffered such abuse in the last year, often at the hands of men who discourage them from working.
"Safety is a paramount issue for many welfare recipients," said David A. Berns, director of the Arizona Department of Economic Security. "A woman will never be economically self-sufficient if she is afraid to go out of the house for fear of what might happen to her."

HEADLINE: Genetically Modified Food and the Poor 

 BODY:
Brazil has wisely decided to end a three-year ban and allow its soybean farmers to plant genetically modified crops that require less pesticide. But the decision has been controversial. Few global issues provoke a more emotional debate than that of genetically engineered crops, which contain transplanted genes from other species to make them easier to grow or more nutritious or flavorful. The evidence suggests that such foods are safe (Americans have been eating them for six years) and could reduce world hunger. 
 But genetically modified crops have not overcome widespread resistance mostly because the industry is tightly controlled by five conglomerates. The companies must realize that relaxing their grip on the technology is in their long-term interests. 
 One of theproblems is that the companies have done nearly all the research on the crops' safety on their own or financed it elsewhere. If they want to build consumer confidence, they should embrace independent tests of the products' safety and impact.
While safety concerns have been the focus of debate, the real problem is that genetic engineering is hurting the poor. It makes cotton cheaper to grow for highly subsidized American producers, further undercutting the price of cotton and forcing West African producers out of business.
Poor countries should fight back by adopting the technology themselves. Unfortunately, so far most of them have failed to approve it. African farmers work tiny plots without the benefit of fertilizers, irrigation or pesticides. The risks they face from genetic modification are remote -- but unlike Europeans, the average African would benefit hugely from crops engineered to resist bugs or need little water.
The other reason Africans do not grow such products is that the major companies like Monsanto, Dupont and Syngenta have no financial interest in developing them for African crops -- and tightly control the technology.
There are two methods of transferring genes, for example. Both were developed by universities, but industry giants now hold the licenses. The companies permit others to do research with the technologies but want control over any product commercialized as a result. Several poor nations are trying to develop improved versions of local crops, but these efforts have been crippled by the biotech companies' control over the technology.
The world shouldn't ban genetically modified food. It should develop a cassava root resistant to the mealy bug and drought-proof corn. Antiglobalization activists are right that corporate greed is the problem. But they are wrong that genetically modified crops should be banned. The real crime of genetic modification is not its risks but that it is squandering its promise, widening the gap between rich and poor.

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
At a Television Bazaar, a Glut of Shows

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: CANNES, France, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Sun Wej is used to selling films and television programs in Chinese enclaves in Asia and the United States, but he harbors broader ambitions. 
 "We wish to be more acceptable to mainstream communities," said Mr. Sun, deputy chief for strategic development at the Shanghai Media Group, as he received a visitor to the company's exhibit at Mipcom, the premier trade show for TV programming. 
 Shanghai Media came to Mipcom for the first time this year. Around a dozen tables, company executives lauded the merits of feature films like "Elopement to the Moon," a love story, and of television shows like "Music Up," about a teenage rock band in China. But Mr. Sun's hopes for international growth are tempered by the reality of a glutted programming marketplace, which has tilted the contest between supply and demand in favor of the buyers. 
The government-owned Shanghai Media is a behemoth whose 61 cable, satellite and pay-per-view channels make it China's second-biggest media group. But its programming is but a rivulet in the mighty stream of television products that flows over buyers at the annual trade show, which opened Friday and ends Tuesday. 
The talk at the show was about the approval last week by British regulators of the $6.3 billion merger of Granada and Carlton Communications, broadcasting companies with a huge combined program library and control of more than half of Britain's television advertising market. With the networks stretched financially, the steady stream of new programs -- from established studios and numerous upstarts -- has been chasing a diminishing flow of advertising money, depressing prices. 
Now, with the consolidation all but complete, industry executives said a new, more stable industry was beginning to emerge. Patrick Vien, president of Universal Studios Networks at the Universal Television Group, spoke of a "general correction of the market" and added, "Now we are poised for growth." Universal introduced a science fiction channel last month, Sci Fi Germany, on the German Premiere network, and is in discussions to do the same in Italy. 
Although prices are unlikely to return to the highs of the 1990's, Mr. Vien said the new market lacked the volatility of that era. 
"We're still in a phase of adjustment, of at least another 12 months over all of this rationalization," said John McMahon, managing director for the European operations of Sony Pictures Television International. 
Sony decided this month to expand the reach of its action and adventure channel, AXN, to six central European countries, including the region's largest economies: the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. The channel was already carried on satellite and cable networks in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere in Europe.
Giants like Sony -- which owns vast programming libraries, operates its own networks, and even makes the television sets that viewers watch -- have weathered the storm better than small distributors and producers. But Mr. McMahon said a stable broadcasting industry would benefit everyone. "It's in all our long-term interest to have financially viable buyers," he said. 
The trade show, a boisterous carnival of buying and selling, has 1,150 exhibitors from 50 countries, who are trying to sell feature films, documentaries, cartoons and all manner of software and technology for television. Representatives of the Egyptian Radio and Television Union, in head scarves, negotiate programming rights for feature films made in Cairo, in a booth adjacent to one where the sales force of Eurogirls, a British company, hawks soft pornography. Italy's Rai Television offers religious programs, while PlayboyTV International promotes itself on billboards proclaiming, ambiguously, "Enhance Your Performance." 
Unlike in the United States, commercial broadcasting in most regions of the world, including Europe, Asia and to some extent Latin America, is a recent development. Governments began to relax their controls in the 1980's by privatizing national networks and allowing the rise of commercial cable and satellite television, sparking an explosion of channels. The programming boom is evident everywhere. Many countries once absent from the market for television products are now joining the fray. Shanghai Media joined a growing number of Chinese companies that attended the trade show. Participants in Russia's growing film and television industry, including dozens of private commercial channels, now come regularly. 
Yet even production companies in mature markets are seeing extraordinary growth. Endemol, the Dutch company that produced the original "Big Brother," had just begun expanding internationally when it founded Endemol USA three years ago. Now it has 22 national affiliates producing 25,000 hours of programming a year. When General Electric's NBC unit started Telemundo, the affiliate that runs a distant second to Univision in the Hispanic market in the United States, it bought its programs from Latin American countries like Mexico and Venezuela. Now it produces three-quarters of its programs at studios in the United States, and has 20,000 hours of programming. 
Harry Evans Sloan, chairman of SBS Broadcasting, which operates 13 European TV stations, said networks were increasingly reliant on reality shows like those Endemol created because they cost less to produce. He estimated the drop in prices at as much as 25 percent from the boom years to now. 
Moreover, while European networks continue to buy a large number of programs in the United States, the weak dollar has pushed real prices, when the programs are paid for in euros, even lower. With supply outstripping demand, Mr. Sloan said, networks are renegotiating prices for programming purchased in the past. "It's become a buyers' market," he said. 
Some executives pointed to increased price differences according to market segment. Peter Chernin, president and chief operating officer of the News Corporation, which owns 20th Century Fox, said that for big hit films, like "Finding Nemo," there was "nothing but upside on price." For other products, costs were stable, he said. 
But Mr. Chernin added that low quality shows, like old films and reruns of the sitcoms that continue to fill hours of broadcast time on channels around the world, no longer fetched the prices they once did. In the past, newly established networks had to fill programming libraries, and the studios often charged them a set price for packages of programs in which the new and good was mixed with the old and weary. That kind of programming, is "toast, and it's toast forever," Mr. Chernin said. "It's never coming back."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Official Says Recovery Is at Hand 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Shigemitsu Sugisaki, a deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said yesterday that the world economy had "turned the corner," although growth prospects in Western Europe remained "subdued."
 Mr. 
Sugisaki, 62, the fund's No.3 official, said that United States economic growth remained the driving force for the world economy, but he said that situation must change if the current account deficit of the United States is to be narrowed. 
 Current account imbalances "can't be resolved solely by exchange rate adjustments," Mr. Sugisaki told a World Economic Forum meeting in Singapore, referring to Washington's call for Asian nations to allow exchange rates to be determined more by market forces. "Trading partners of the U.S. need to boost their growth."
The United States trade deficit reached a monthly record of $43 billion in March. The trade gap through August reached $324.4 billion, compared with $265.3 billion in the first eight months of 2002.
Because the United States economy has lost more than 2.5 million manufacturing jobs since President Bush took office, the trade deficit has led lawmakers to propose protectionist legislation. 
The Bush administration has also pledged to crack down on what it calls unfair trading practices by China.
Mr. Sugisaki, who is leaving the fund early next year, said there was no clear evidence that China's currency, the yuan, is undervalued.
Still, he said, Beijing should move in a phased manner to a more freely traded currency.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
A decision that Minnesota should leave Internet phone businesses unregulated does not put the issue to rest.

BYLINE:  By Barnaby J. Feder 

 BODY:
THE ruling by a federal judge in Minnesota last week that the state cannot regulate Internet telephone calls the way it does conventional phonecalls was at least a temporary victory for those who argue that the increasingly popular Internet phone services should be exempt from regulation.
 The judge, Michael J. Davis, is expected to issue his written opinion in the case tomorrow. That should clarify where he found that Minnesota went wrong with its attempt to apply longstanding phone company regulations to Vonage, a start-up Internet phone company. 
 Whatever the reasoning, it will not eliminate the mounting pressure on public policy makers to address the fact that the value of the new technology, for now and many years into the future, stems largely from the fact that it works with the old phone network. In other words, the 20-year-old in Manhattan who uses his Internet phone call to his grandmother in Minnesota will still be dependent on the regular telephone network if Grandma answers on a conventional phone. 
So, do regulators have the right to make sure that Internet phone services are paying a fair share of the cost of supporting the local telephone networks? And if so, should regulators exercise that right -- and how? Some advocates for the new technology would like the discussion to begin and end with the conclusion that Internet phone calls are not a telephone service at all, but simply yet another computer application, like e-mail programs. So far, the overwhelming preference in Congress, the private sector and even among many regulators seems to be keeping the Internet free of government regulation. 
As just another Internet application, the new technology remains free of a wide range of telephone industry encumbrances like access charges, taxes, service reliability requirements and rules supporting programs like emergency 911 service.
But to the average person, it can sure seem like a phone service. It is advertised as a phone service, subscribers get a phone number and they speak into equipment that looks and performs like a phone. More to the point, Vonage and other providers quickly turn their calls over to local or long-distance phone companies for transmission over the phone networks unless the provider's gateway computers - situated at telephone company switching stations - recognize the number being dialed as belonging to one of its own customers. The reliance on the existing phone infrastructure keeps the new services from having a total free ride. Companies like Vonage buy bulk capacity on the phone networks and pay privately negotiated rates to connect to them. Vonage said that it also pays $1.50 per phone number assigned to subscribers into a regulatory fund that supports universal phone service. Vonage and other Internet telephone services say they are also working voluntarily with regulators on ways to meet public policy goals like extending emergency 911 service to their customers.
"There's a lot of confusion about how we run our business, because it's so new," said Brooke Schulz, a spokeswoman for Vonage, which is based in Edison, N.J. For all the conceptual difficulties, though, many advocates for the technology concede that regulation may well be appropriate in the long run. Still, they would prefer that regulation be handed down by the Federal Communications Commission rather than be shared by the F.C.C. and the states the way conventional phone regulation has been. Also, they want to delay regulation until the industry matures and they see what pressures Internet telephone traffic puts on the conventional phone network. 
"A five-year moratorium on regulation would be enough to allow the landscape to clear," said Jeff Pulver, chief executive of Pulver.com Enterprises, a leading promoter of Internet phone technology.
The argument for delay rests partly on the fact that there are fewer than 100,000 consumers and businesses routinely dialing calls with the new technology. But rapid growth is making issues arising from the technology less theoretical every day. Low-cost broadband telephone services have quickly grabbed 10 percent of the market in Japan. At least one respected analyst, John Hodulik of UBS Securities, is advising clients that the rise of such traffic is the single biggest threat to earnings that major phone companies face over the next five years.
The established phone companies, however, are in no hurry to have regulations for Internet telephone service, which they themselves have been using for several years within their own networks. Some, like the AT&T Corporation, convert standard calls into Internet data packets and then send huge amounts of their own traffic on Internet lines in an effort to cut access payments to other carriers. In fact, lawsuits and regulatory disputes have been proliferating over just such practices.
Rather than pushing for regulation of the new technology, companies like AT&T and Verizon are arguing that the way to keep the field level is to hasten deregulation of their old-line telephone businesses. 
Jeff Carlisle, the senior deputy chief of the F.C.C.'s common carrier bureau, said that much of the talk about regulation mixed up questions that could be considered separately. One obvious concern is how to support universal service programs that provide subsidies for phone service to rural areas and poor customers and for efforts to deliver broadband Internet access to schools and libraries. At the federal level, more than $5 billion annually is collected for such service programs from a levy on long-distance phone companies -- currently 9.2 percent of revenues. 
But some experts argue that the basic goal of the universal service program may need to be redefined before forcing Internet telephone companies to contribute to subsidies for conventional phone service. "It may be," Mr. Pulver said, "that people will need the Internet more than basic phone service."

HEADLINE: OPEC Asks Others To Cut Oil Output 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The president of OPEC, Abdullah al-Attiyah, warned yesterday that crude oil prices may collapse next year because of increased flow of Iraqi oil unless Russia, the world's second-largest exporter, and other top producers reduce output.
 Mr. al-Attiyah reminded non-OPEC members of the collapse in crude oil prices to almost $10 a barrel in 1998-99 after a recession in several Asian economies coincided with increased output from the world's top oil producers. 
He spoke yesterday with reporters in Seoul, South Korea. 
 Subsequent cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC nations kept the price of oil traded in New York at an average of $28 a barrel in the last four years, compared with $19 in the previous four. On Friday, the Russian energy minister, Igor Yusufov, said that oil prices were too high and might harm global fuel demand.
"Without help, mainly from Russia, we expect oil markets to face a lot of difficulties in the future," Mr. al-Attiyah said on Friday. "Non-OPEC should understand that 1999 is only four years ago. We have to learn from the past."
Yesterday, Mr. al-Attiyah declined to comment on the Russian minister's remarks. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose 11 members include Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela, decided last month to reduce the group's total crude oil production targets 3.5 percent, to 24.5 million barrels a day, starting on Nov. 1. OPEC members pump a third of the world's oil.

HEADLINE: Metro Matters; 
How About A Big Tax On Kvetching

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
INSPIRED by Seattle's unsuccessful (but ingenious) effort to address both its caffeine addiction and budget problems by taxing espresso, Matters proposed some new taxes and laws a few weeks ago and invited readers to submit their ideas.
 Letters, e-mail messages and a few phone calls came from as close as Central Park West and as far as Connecticut Avenue in Washington. As a whole, the suggestions amounted to a compendium of pet peeves. There was the occasional loopy proposal, like the one for a "hoot tax" -- to discourage Peruvian pan pipe and guitar bands. ("Sure their music is haunting," a reader wrote. "But exactly when did someone pound a fist on a service desk and demand to be haunted?"). 
 But most of the ideas focused on daily irritants, revealing how frustrating life can be in New York. In any big city, really. It is, as anyone who has ever attended a neighborhood meeting with the mayor or listened to a political call-in show knows, the small stuff that gets to people.
They object to many a habit and practice that will never be regulated becausethey are a function of density or the downsides of human nature. But however common, they are still hard to take, with privilege topping the unofficial list.
This may not come as a revelation, but there is quite the populist streak in New York. Or is it jealousy? One reader, for instance, fumed about parking privileges near hotels and at police stations.
"Why is it the whole block in front of many hotels has a 'no parking' sign, so hotel doormen can be paid by parkers to watch their cars?" this reader asked. "And cops get free MetroCards. Their presence on subways and buses could add to passenger security, yet each one is entitled to free parking at their precinct. Why can't they park at the train stations or a subway stop or leave the car home, versus overcrowding the city streets?"
In a spirit of inclusion, she added that this is true for some firefighters and Parks and Recreation Department employees.
More than a few people complained about movie and television crews around town, and how their cars, trucks and trailers take over the streets. Yes, good for the economy, they acknowledged, but where is the regard for the ordinary citizen. Abuse of privilege was the consensus.
Abuse of one's personal space is, it seems, also quite the annoyance. One reader proposed taxing people who block subway-car doors when trains are not crowded, which would in fact be nice. As nice as it would be unlikely.
The gentleman writing from Washington said he'd tax "grating cellphone electronic rings," and also suggested a few Broadway-related taxes: Tax "songs about boozing and survival sung by anyone besides Elaine Stritch" (a "brass tax," he called it). And tax Broadway shows "whose producers employ television celebrities of dubious talent to boost audiences."
TRAFFIC and crowds and noise are big issues. One e-mailer complained about the failure of traffic officers and the police to warn people of a traffic jam soon enough for drivers to take a detour. Another proposed a tax on people who stop dead in their tracks on the sidewalk without warning, risking collisions.
A third railed about the inconvenience of street fairs and parades and wondered if the city wasn't too lenient with permits. (This person has obviously never contemplated a career in politics.)
Another couldn't understand why on some streets cars are towed away, while on others, usually streets that house powerful institutions like news organizations and hospitals, double- and triple-parking is tolerated, and suggested that offenders pay even higher penalties than they do now. A matter of privilege again.
The same reader also said he refused to pay for second cup of coffee and favored a tax on all stingy eateries. To which we cannot resist the thought that taxing every pizza place that calls itself Ray's or Ray's Original, or any variation on same, might weed out the impostors.
In all the correspondence, it is worth noting, there was not one mention of the larger issues that make for most political discourse and commentary in this space and elsewhere -- nothing about tax policy or educational standards, about housing, the courts and judgeships, the mayor or the governor.
Back next time, on the theory that somebody's got to do it.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Planning the Budget For 2 Countries at Once

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, never imagined that one day he would also be the budget director of Iraq. 
 But that is what his job amounts to in this strange Washington autumn, when a man who oversees the federal government's $2.3 trillion annual budget is spending huge portions of his time arm-twisting Congress into coming up with the $87 billion that President Bush wants over the next year for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most of the money is to go to securing and rebuilding Iraq, with the unstated goal of pulling out at least some American troops before the 2004 election. 
 Or, as Mr. Bolten put it last week, the $87 billion "is to return the country rapidly to Iraqi control." 
Mr. Bolten was speaking at a Washington institution, the weekly Sperling breakfast with reporters at the St. Regis Hotel, where the stately surroundings gave off a whiff of imperialism. Under the chandelier, over scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, on a gorgeous fall morning in the capital, Mr. Bolten found himself discussing decisions about people in remote precincts who, at least for now, are the subjects of American power.
Nonetheless, Iraq seemed far less a jewel in the crown than a money pit, with Mr. Bolten in the role of the man who started out renovating his kitchen but ended up rebuilding the whole house. 
Did he regret, one reporter asked, that the $87 billion supplemental spending request, which created an epidemic of sticker shock on Capitol Hill, was not slimmer?
"No," replied a brisk and businesslike Mr. Bolten, who relaxes by riding a Harley. On the other hand, he acknowledged, "we know we have a politically challenging situation."
That situation began last summer, when the Pentagon, the American authorities in Baghdad and Mr. Bolten's Office of Management and Budget began pulling together what would amount to Iraq's first budget post-Saddam Hussein. 
The primary responsibility fell to Adm. David Oliver, a Pentagon official who had put together the Navy's budget for the past three years. But staff members from Mr. Bolten's office were also on the ground in Iraq, asking officials of the destroyed Iraqi ministries what they needed. Of the $87 billion, $20 billion was to be for reconstruction, principally in Iraq.
"Oliver led the effort to engage the ministries in ways that were quite similar to what O.M.B. does, and what countries around the world do," said Peter McPherson, the president of Michigan State University, who was until recently the director of economic policy for L. Paul Bremer III, the top American administrator in Baghdad. "You say to the minister, O.K., what's your plan, how much money do you need, and then you go back and forth."
Administration officials said that the number they came up with was even larger than the $87 billion, and that Mr. Bremer pared it down. Back in Washington, Mr. Bolten, whose job is to say no, cut the request some more, although no one in his office will say by how much. Democrats say it clearly was not much at all, and that the high prices seem like a giveaway to American contractors doing business in Iraq, like Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, which was Vice President Dick Cheney's company from 1995 to 2000.
"Hold on, you've got to understand something," said Dan Senor, a spokesman and senior adviser to Mr. Bremer who is in Washington to explain to Congress why Iraq needs $10 million for garbage trucks, at $50,000 each. "O.M.B. played its traditional role, but like in any emergency situation there was some deference given to Bremer because he was on the front lines and had the best perspective on the emergency needs."
Whatever the case, Mr. Bolten now finds himself defending not only $50,000 garbage trucks (which Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee removed from the Iraq request last week), but $9 million to create a nationwide ZIP code system for Iraq. He is also on the defensive about a $400 million request for two maximum-security Iraqi prisons, which comes out to $50,000 a prison bed. The Appropriations Committee slashed those, too, but administration officials say they will fight to get the prisons back.
As Mr. Senor, who was at Mr. Bolten's side at the breakfast, put it in a telephone interview yesterday: "These are maximum security prisons. If we skimp on training and infrastructure for Iraqi security, American forces are going to have to fill in the gap." Besides, Mr. Senor said, California is building a maximum security prison adjacent to San Quentin that costs $220,000 a bed. Democrats counter that the rough cost of building a new prison should be $14,000 a bed.
Mr. Senor added that $50,000 for a garbage truck was not a bad deal when new diesel ones cost $150,000 each. 
"Let me make a point on the garbage trucks," he said. "In order to prevent the terrorists from capitalizing on the sense of despair, restoring basic services is critical." Mr. Hussein, he added, "used the manipulation of basic services to repress certain parts of the population."
In other words, he said, only the rich and the Baathist-connected got garbage pickup in prewar Iraq, but now everyone will -- or at least they would have until the Appropriations Committee said no.
When the Sperling breakfast was over, Mr. Senor headed out with Mr. Bolten into the bright Washington autumn, in search of money for Iraq.

HEADLINE: The Snowmobile Quagmire 

 BODY:
In mid-December the snowmobiling season is scheduled to open in Yellowstone National Park -- another winter of health risks for park workers and visitors, pollution haze over the west entrance and Old Faithful, the din of a fleet of noisy machines in an otherwise silent park and daily harassment of winter-stressed animals. By siding with the snowmobile industry and overturning a Clinton-era plan to phase out snowmobiles, the Bush administration would continue a practice that violates the conclusions of its own Environmental Protection Agency, the better judgment of many National Park Service employees, the public will and common sense. In its own small way, the snowmobile issue demonstrates once again that when it comes to public lands the administration is always willing to sacrifice public good for private interest.
 The basic question at issue should be winter access. How do you get the most people into the park at a beautiful time of year with the least harm to the park? Some people will come on cross-country skis. Most will ride on snow coaches, the specially equipped, environmentally benign buses that travel over snow-packed roads. But to the White House the issue isn't access for humans but access for snowmobiles. And in the way they've handled this matter, the Interior Department and the snowmobile manufacturers have been guilty of disingenuousness at best, lying at worst. 
 The Park Service is legally committed to allowing only snowmobiles that meet a standard of "best available technology." Until a few years ago, most snowmobiles had two-stroke engines that were loud, dirty and fast. In 2002, manufacturers began introducing four-stroke machines that were, in fact, quieter and cleaner, though slower and less powerful. But there's backsliding already: this year's new four-stroke snowmobiles, while cleaner than the older machines, are more powerful, noisier and dirtier than last year's. Put simply, the quest for power seems quickly to have replaced the quest for the best available technology. Even the Park Service has admitted that some of this year's fleet will not pass muster -- but will be allowed into the park anyway.
President Bush's E.P.A. has reached essentially the same conclusion reached by the Park Service during the Clinton administration. Compared with snow coaches, snowmobiles of any kind are more polluting and more disturbing to wildlife and to visitors who aren't on snowmobiles. 
Americans have been quick to see the common sense behind this issue. In previous comment periods, the public overwhelmingly opposed snowmobiles in Yellowstone. Even legislators have caught the drift of public opinion. In July, a number of Republican congressmen crossed party lines to ban snowmobiles in the park by a House vote of 211 to 209. That vote stood until Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio and the liaison between the Republican House leadership and the White House, changed his vote, resulting in deadlock and defeat.
There is still hope for a satisfactory conclusion to this debate. Even as the public comment period for the Interior Department's snowmobiling plan comes to a close tomorrow, environmental groups are preparing to argue in court for the enforcement of already enacted laws that would prohibit snowmobiling in Yellowstone, with a decision expected by mid-November. We hope that that decision will close the park to snowmobiles for good. We also hope that the decision will afford the park a year or two to phase out the machines, giving the snowmobiling economy of West Yellowstone a chance to adjust to the new reality.
But think of it this way. If the Clinton plan had been followed from the outset -- without the Bush administration's cynical delay -- West Yellowstone would already have adjusted, and the park this winter would be silent.

HEADLINE: Lieberman, the Centrist in the Middle of the Pack 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
When Al Gore announced last December that he would not run for president in 2004, few people were as well positioned as Senator Joseph I. Lieberman to become the standard-bearer for the Democratic Party.
 As the only prospective candidate for the Democratic nomination who had already run on a national ticket, he had broad name recognition and, as he is fond of saying, had already proved that he could get more votes than George W. Bush. 
 But in the nine months since Senator Lieberman of Connecticut declared his candidacy, he has struggled to break out of a packed second tier of candidates, overshadowed by the antiwar oratory of Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, and the public's infatuation with Gen. Wesley K. Clark.
So while some recent polls have shown Mr. Lieberman leading President Bush in a theoretical head-to-head battle, those figures are virtually meaningless for a candidate who has yet to win over Democratic loyalists in Iowa and New Hampshire. In those states, Mr. Lieberman has been unable to capitalize fully on his name recognition. He ranks a distant fifth in fund-raising. His monotone delivery and sometimes too-subtle jokes rarely send listeners into a frenzy of cheers. 
And in a nation that has undergone profound shifts since 2000 -- entering a state of perpetual war, with a struggling economy and anxiety about the safety of the country -- some voters seem to view Mr. Lieberman with far less excitement than when Mr. Gore selected him as his running mate.
In a sign of concern among campaign officials that Mr. Lieberman is not catching on, the candidate plans to reintroduce himself on Monday by embarking from Hartford on a weeklong tour of early primary states, including New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Florida and Michigan. Calling his tour "Leading With Integrity," Mr. Lieberman is seeking to contrast his reputation for forthrightness with what he says is the Bush administration's failure to keep its promises. The campaign will also introduce new policy prescriptions, like an economic plan that calls for overhauling the entire tax code and a proposal to create 10 million jobs over four years.
Mr. Lieberman insists that he is not worried.
"Most of the American people are just tuning into this race, incidentally, as they are catching on to George W. Bush," he said on Friday at a campaign stop in North Carolina. "My campaign team tells me that I'll be considered the front-runner after people start voting. The point here is that this is an undecided race."
Lieberman advisers also say he was hampered by a late fund-raising start because he did not assemble his organization until Mr. Gore bowed out. He has lost some of the natural advantage of name recognition that he enjoyed from the 2000 campaign because his relative lack of money has led him to delay introducing television commercials, while many of his rivals have been on the air.
Many Democrats say Mr. Lieberman's prospects are diminished by the same factors that help him stand out from others in the field: he is a centrist, but his middle-ground stands, while advantageous in a general election, are not helpful in winning over the hard-core Democrats who are critical to winning primaries.
At some appearances, he has been shouted down when he has mentioned his support for limited school voucher programs and for lifting trade restrictions. He has been booed for his support for the Iraq war; beyond backing the Bush administration's decision to go to war to oust Saddam Hussein, Mr. Lieberman co-sponsored one of the resolutions authorizing the war. He has not retreated from that position, which has lost him some support among Democrats. But he has been critical of the Bush administration's failure to plan for the war's aftermath, something that he spoke out about even before the war began, when he laid out a recovery plan for Iraq in an October 2002 speech to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Some of Mr. Lieberman's supporters have made clear that they want to see a better showing -- and soon. Henry Branch, a retired Air Force master sergeant who is commander of District 12 of the American Legion in Phoenix, told the senator during a campaign stop last week that he voted for him and Al Gore in 2000. But Mr. Branch also wondered why he keeps hearing more about Howard Dean in the news.
"I don't know why Senator Lieberman has not raised as much money as the others," Mr. Branch said in an interview. "I'm still pro-Lieberman, but he hasn't been the one to separate himself from the field."
In fact, many Gore-Lieberman strategists from 2000 have moved on to other candidates, like General Clark. But the campaign does have some staff from the Clinton and Gore camps, including Craig T. Smith, who briefly ran the Gore campaign.
Notably missing from this week's itinerary is a visit to Iowa, whose Jan. 19 caucuses are the first important balloting for the Democratic nomination but where the senator has yet to make much headway in the polls. 
Some of Mr. Lieberman's aides have urged him to bypass Iowa altogether, focusing instead on New Hampshire and the mostly Southern states with primaries on Feb. 3, including Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Carolina.
Those primaries follow only a week after New Hampshire's primary and two weeks after Iowa's caucuses, a short enough time, campaign officials believe, to allow Mr. Lieberman to thwart any momentum gained by the winner of those contests.
But many Democrats say they think that will be a tough route to the nomination, in part because several other candidates, including General Clark and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, are following similar strategies.
"If he hasn't done something in the first two or three states, I think he'll have a hard time meeting the expectations people have set for someone who was the vice-presidential nominee," said Steve Hildebrand, who ran Mr. Gore's winning primary operation in Iowa in 2000 and is not now affiliated with any presidential candidate.
Members of the Lieberman campaign staff acknowledge that they must finish third in New Hampshire and win at least three of seven states on Feb. 3 to have a chance at the nomination.
Gordon Fischer, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, expressed skepticism about the skip-Iowa tactic.
"You can certainly ask President McCain or President Al Gore in '88 how successful that strategy is," Mr. Fischer said. "I think the fact that other primaries have moved up makes Iowa and New Hampshire more important, not less."
Mr. Lieberman and his staff decided to build his campaign around the integrity theme after he tried out that message in a speech two weeks ago before the Democratic National Committee -- and drew generally good reviews.
"The people who run this White House simply haven't trusted the American people enough to level with us, and so the American people are now naturally losing their trust in this White House," Mr. Lieberman told the audience of Democratic party leaders. "There's been a pattern of broken promises and basic deceptions that has diminished the presidency, degraded our strength and disrespected the American people." 
"I know those are serious charges," he added. "I understand. I don't make them lightly. But the evidence is clear and supports those charges."
There is, of course, a certain amount of risk in branding the president a liar. But one senior Lieberman strategist said, "It's particularly credible coming from him in a way that it is not from the other candidates."
Mr. Lieberman's strategy is to turn his centrist credentials into an asset in states where Democrats are generally more conservative than they are in Iowa and New Hampshire. He has made an overhaul of immigration policy a centerpiece of his campaign, winning support from Hispanics and others in Arizona. Aides also think he will thrive in Oklahoma, which is unlike many states in the South in that urban populations tend to be more Republican and rural areas more Democratic, with both of them on the conservative end of the spectrum.
"Senator Lieberman plays well here," Jay Parmley, chairman of the Oklahoma Democratic Party, said in an interview. "Name recognition is what helps him the most, and the fact that he's conservative. That doesn't mean he's going to win it."

Digital Projection of Films Is Coming. Now, Who Pays?

BYLINE:  By ERIC TAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Moviegoers who recently saw the Johnny Depp film "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" at the Pacific Sherman Oaks Galleria 16 cinema here may have noticed that something was different. Instead of the traces of dust and scratches, and the slight shaking of the image that is perceptible at many screenings, they were looking at a picture that is pristine, sharp and steady. 
 That is because the film was projected digitally, the images fed not from a five-foot-diameter reel of 35-millimeter film, but from a computer hard drive, and beamed onto the screen using a projector without any moving parts. 
 Filmgoers evidently like what they see. "Given a choice between watching a 35-millimeter print or a digital file of the film, customers prefer the digital version," said Jerry Pokorski, executive vice president and head film buyer for Pacific Theaters, which operates the 16-screen movie complex in Sherman Oaks, in the San Fernando Valley. The theater's newspaper ads note when a film is showing in the digital format, and "our grosses are as much as 40 percent higher when we screen a film digitally," Mr. Pokorski said. 
One might think that a crowded theater and higher ticket sales are all the evidence a multiplex owner would need to be persuaded that digital projectors are worth adopting. But economics and industry politics, as well as continued disagreements over technical formats, have delayed the long-predicted digital revolution in movie theaters. A big sticking point is the standoff between theater owners and Hollywood studios over who will pay to update the nation's 35,000 projection booths. 
So far, the Galleria's digital system is one of only 39 that the supplier, Technicolor Digital Cinema, has installed around the country as an experiment, at no charge to the theater owners. In all, fewer than 80 cinemas in the United States have movie-quality digital projectors -- some of the others having been installed experimentally by another emerging competitor, Boeing Digital Systems, and the rest by theater owners. Throughout the world, fewer than 200 cinemas in some two dozen countries are using digital projectors to show movies -- with most of the machines paid for by the manufacturers for test-marketing purposes. 
Aesthetics aside, the exhibitors say that the cost-benefit analysis comes down too much in favor of the studios, which could save a couple of million dollars on each movie they release if they could send it to theaters as digital files -- whether by satellite, or high-speed network lines, or on hard drives -- rather than shipping film copies that can cost $1,200 each. At that rate, a 2,000-print domestic release, common for a typical feature film, costs about $2.4 million in duplication costs, according to Screen Digest, a British research firm, which estimated that the movie studios spend a total of $1.36 billion a year to produce and distribute prints worldwide.
The way the theater owners see it, the costs would not offset any benefits. A typical 35-millimeter projector, they say, costs $30,000 and lasts up to 30 years. But a feature-film-grade digital projector is expected to cost as much as $150,000, at least initially. And because it is a new technology, its effective life is unknown. Beyond the price of the projector would be the cost of the satellite dishes or high-speed transmission lines needed to receive the digital file, as well as an investment in the automated theater management systems to connect and control the entire operation. 
"With the cost savings the studios would enjoy, they could fund the U.S. transition to digital projection in seven years," said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, the exhibitors' trade group. "But theater owners could not sell enough extra tickets or raise prices high enough to cover those costs." 
Theater owners do acknowledge that there might be economic and operating benefits for themselves, as the Galleria 16 experiment seems to indicate. To prepare a standard 35-millimeter film for projection, several employees must now physically splice the film to the preview trailers the night before the first show. By contrast, to prepare a movie for digital projection at the Digital Cinema test site in the Galleria, an operator selects the film title and the accompanying trailers from a list on a computer screen, and adds them to the night's play list.
Mark Kahn, a Pacific Theaters engineer responsible for the company's digital installations, said: "My policy is to keep it simple, so I created a program that allows the projectionist to just push a button and leave. The system lowers the lights, plays the trailers, turns off the lights, and starts the digital projector."
To ensure that a technical problem does not interfere with the show, a copy of the digital file runs simultaneously on a second hard drive. If the first hard drive fails, an operator can switch to the backup drive. And for good measure, a 35-millimeter film copy of the movie is also running, and that projector can start showing the film if both hard drives crash. 
But Mr. Pokorski of Pacific Theaters says he does not believe that eliminating the film-preparation tasks will necessarily translate into lower labor costs. "It still takes from 4 to 10 hours to prepare and test the digital print prior to its first screening," he said. "There is really no overall financial benefit for us to go digital, so we should not have to pay for the transition." 
Before the digital transition can occur in earnest, various technical and business issues also need to be resolved, which is why many industry experts predict that the shift may still take seven years to complete. 
Hollywood studios, though, are eager to make the switch, and not only because they will no longer have to make and transport costly film prints. Using digital play lists, like those that catalog music on personal computers, movies and trailers will begin at the right time and in the right order, simply by highlighting a title on a computer screen and adding it to the list. And the film studios plan to use various forms of scrambling software -- encryption -- to keep the movies unviewable by anyone not possessing keys to the digital code.
"By switching to an encrypted digital projection technology, the motion picture industry will be able to reduce the losses it now incurs due to piracy," said Charles Swartz, executive director of the Entertainment Technology Center, which, through its Digital Cinema Laboratory, is testing various digital projection technologies for the industry. 
Thwarting piracy is only part of the laboratory's function. "We need to create standards that are better than the consumer can now get at home with an HDTV and a surround-sound system," Mr. Swartz said.
The lab expects to complete its work by the end of the year. In 2004, Digital Cinema Initiatives, an industry group set up by the movie studios, plans to establish specifications. Then, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers would be asked to adopt technical standards for the industry.
The recent digital installation at the Sherman Oaks Galleria used a digital projector made by Christie Digital of Cypress, Calif. Technicolor also uses projectors made by Barco, a Belgian company. A third manufacturer, Digital Projection International of Manchester, England, has supplied digital equipment to a number of Japanese movie theaters. All three makers use the digital light processing, or D.L.P., chip invented by Texas Instruments, to project the image. Eastman Kodak has licensed a separate projection technology, known as D-ILA, from the Japanese electronics company JVC and expects to market digital-feature-film grade projectors beginning in 2005, according to Bill Doeren, general manager of the Digital Cinema Group at Kodak.
Doug Darrow, the Texas Instruments business manager overseeing the development of the D.L.P. chip, predicts that the costs of digital projection systems will come down. 
"Once the standards are defined, companies that can develop cheaper solutions will enter the marketplace," he said. "We'll see a tiered approach, with smaller screens able to use less expensive projectors."
But the exhibitors say they are skeptical. "With only 35,000 screens in the U.S., and an additional 115,000 in the rest of the world," Mr. Fithian of the theater owners' trade group said, "the economies of scale are not there to create lower prices."
Talks between the theater owners and the studios to resolve the transition issues began last March. Neither side will comment on their status of the discussions. Several third parties have stepped into the financial breach, proposing to finance the hardware and software transition, and then charge the studios a per-screen fee. The studios say they have looked at the third-party approaches, but "we've not yet begun examining them," said Chuck Goldwater, the president of Digital Cinema Initiatives.
Rather than wait for all the issues to be resolved, one big theater owner, the Regal Entertainment Group -- which owns the Edwards, Regal and United Artists theaters -- has installed a less-expensive type of digital projector in 306 of its 561 cinemas. The systems, which project an image quality comparable to high-definition television, but not fully equivalent to 35-millimeter film, are being used for packages of advertisements before feature films or when renting out the theaters for corporate videoconferences or special remote transmissions of concerts and other live entertainment. 
"We're making money on our ad sales," said Kurt Hall, president of the Regal CineMedia unit. "And we've built our digital infrastructure. Once digital feature film standards are set, we only have to upgrade our projectors to be ready."

A Pregame Ritual: Doctors Averting Disasters

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
How to hit a boy when he is down: Buddy Lorentsen, a 12-year-old from Patchogue, N.Y., loves soccer and wants to play on his school team. But he had cancer as a toddler and, as a result, he has only one kidney. His doctors and parents agreed he could play. But the school district said no: a child with only one of a pair of vulnerable organs could not play a contact sport.
 His family took the matter to court, and on Thursday a State Supreme Court justice ruled that Buddy could play. But his school, Seneca Junior High in Holbrook, said Buddy could not play until he had participated in 10 practices, leaving little of the season for him to play. 
 Was all this tumult necessary? Not according to a leading expert, Dr. Michael C. Koester, a pediatrician at Good Shepherd Medical Center in Hermiston, Ore., who said he would have "no concern" about the boy's playing soccer, a sport he called low risk.
"I caution athletes with one kidney about the risks of sports participation and do not give clearance unless the patient and parent understand those risks," Dr. Koester wrote in the September issue of Contemporary Pediatrics. "A protective 'flak' jacket should be worn when feasible," he suggested.
Dr. Koester pointed out that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends individual assessment for youngsters with unpaired organs who want to play contact, collision and limited-contact sports.
Each year, millions of youngsters participate in organized sports -- more than seven million in high schools alone. Nearly all have to undergo evaluations before they participate. The goal is to prevent injuries, some of them possibly permanent or even catastrophic. Often these exams are done en masse in school gyms or at a local medical clinics, where it may be hard to obtain the kind of information needed.
Many other youngsters seek clearance from personal physicians, who may or may not know what questions to ask, what to check, and which children need more tests or referrals to specialists.
Preventable sports-related disasters, like sudden cardiac death and heatstroke in young athletes, happen rarely, but in nearly all cases, properly performed exams can identify vulnerable children.
Ideally, the exams should be done six or eight weeks before an athletic season begins, allowing time for further consultations or rehabilitation of an old injury if necessary. But even if the child is already playing, it is not too late to be sure the right steps are taken.

A Crucial First Step
In a telephone interview, Dr. Koester said: "History is the key, including family history. More than 90 percent of problems that limit participation can be determined through a good history. In general, this exam is too superficially done. The right questions are not being asked. If you don't ask, you won't get the answers you need."
In a study of medical history forms used by Oregon high schools, fewer than half were considered adequate by standards of the American Heart Association.
Knowing that people often forget their past injuries and that youngsters may not know the relevant family medical history, Dr. Koester questions both the parents and the child. Parents are asked to complete a history form with the child before the youngster is examined. 
"It's not normal for a child to have aches and pains for more than a few days after an activity," Dr. Koester said. "Prolonged discomfort and any injury that causes the child to limp or miss practice longer than a day or two should be examined by a physician."
For example, a high school girl who wanted to play volleyball came in hunched forward. Dr. Koester asked her how long she had experienced back pain.
"Oh, since last year's volleyball season," she said.
But she had mentioned it to no one. She turned out to have a stress fracture in her lower back.
The leading predictor of an athletic injury is a past injury, especially one that was undiagnosed, untreated or improperly rehabilitated, Dr. Koester noted. "The filled-out form may say 'no previous injuries,' but when asked about specific problems, the child may say 'oh, yes.' These things are often hard for a young person to recall."
Certain disorders are responsible for most cardiac deaths in young athletes, most often enlarged hearts and abnormal coronary arteries, less often aortic aneurysms or damaged aortic valves. Though such problems are hard to detect by physical exam alone, there may be a history of clues: fainting or chest pain in exercise or a family history of unexpected death before 50. 
Dr. Koester pointed out that doing an electrocardiograms or echocardiograms on all athletes would identify only 1 child at risk among 200,000 and result in 1,999 false positives to find one true positive, statistics that make such testing economically and emotionally unfeasible.

Exploring a Child's Past
Any child who has experienced exercise-induced asthma, or bronchospasm, when exercising should undergo exercise testing followed minutes later by a breathing test called spirometry.
The child's history of concussions is critically important: anyone who has had one is at risk for another. Repeated concussions -- even a very brief loss of consciousness after a violent collision -- can cause permanent brain injury. No child who still has symptoms of a concussion should be cleared to take part in athletics, Dr. Koester wrote. In addition, a child who has had a shoulder injury with radiating symptoms requires a neurosurgical exam before being cleared to play a contact sport.
A history of a seizure disorder does not automatically preclude participation if the seizures are well controlled. But the pediatrics society suggests careful consideration before allowing a child with epilepsy to take part in high diving, skiing and high-apparatus gymnastics.
Heatstroke is a leading cause of death in young athletes and those with a history of heat illness are especially at risk. Factors that may increase the risk are obesity, an illness with fever, dehydration, certain medicines (antihistamines, antidepressants and stimulants), the use of ephedra or creatine and failure to be acclimatized to the heat.
Special consideration should be given to children with only one of a pair of organs. A boy with one testicle, for example, should wear a protective cup. Children with less than 20/40 corrected vision in one eye, who in effect have only one functional eye, must always wear protective eye gear in sports with high risks of eye injury.
Finally, the history should look into a child's eating habits and use of supplements, with special attention devoted to possible eating disorders.
One clue to overzealous dieting and excessive exercise in girls is their menstrual histories. A history of no menstrual periods or loss of periods or stress fractures should raise suspicions, Dr. Koester said.

This is the first of two columns on physical exams for youth sports.

HEADLINE: China's Long March Into Orbit 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
When Moscow put the first humans into space 42 years ago, Soviet officials raised a veil of secrecy. They made sure the genius behind the feat was a nonperson, awarding his medals in private. They lied about the spaceport's location. And they said the heroic astronaut had landed his spacecraft, when in fact he had ejected from his capsule high in the atmosphere and parachuted back to earth.
 Now, as China prepares to become the third nation to fire a person into space, perhaps as soon as Wednesday morning Beijing time, the differences are telling. 
 Secrecy remains. But the Chinese have also opened sophisticated Web sites that promote their space hardware. Government agencies hand out glossy images of rockets and capsules. And Western experts have learned enough information about the Chinese technology to spend endless hours analyzing the nuances of the impending flight. 
Space analysts say the openness shows that Chinese astronaut gear is basically an adaptation of Russian rocket and capsule designs, though much improved. "It's extremely surprising how much China has revealed," said Phillip S. Clark, a top expert on the Chinese space program. "This is full throttle compared to what they used to do."
When John E. Pike, a space analyst in Washington, wanted to pinpoint the Chinese launching site, he said, he turned to an official Chinese rocket manual, which put the Jiuquan Space Center in the Gansu Province of northwestern China, on the edge of the Gobi Desert. 
"It's far less secretive than the Soviet space program," Mr. Pike said. Why? Mainly, he said, because of Beijing's drive to sell space technologies. "They have to talk to people in order to sell their products."
Analysts say the new openness, in addition to revealing the Russian aid, shows that the Chinese have worked hard to make their rockets more reliable -- a major requirement for human flight -- after suffering a series of disasters in unpiloted flights roughly a decade ago.
The improvements came fromtoil as well as American companies eager to use Chinese rockets for launching satellites, the analysts said. Ultimately, the United States, worried that such aid could improve nuclear-armed missiles, fined the companies heavily for helping Beijing.
Chinese officials deny that their space program greatly depends on foreigners and tend to laugh off the American accusations. 
Whatever the truth, experts agree, the bottom line is that China is now entering the astronaut game with some notable high cards as well as the world's fastest-growing economy. The flight's timing is linked to celebrations of the Communist revolution.
In Washington, the politics of an unblemished voyage are expected to be fairly significant because the space shuttles are now grounded, creating an impression that some aspects of space leadership are passing to another power.
"It's not going to restart the space race," said James E. Oberg, a NASA veteran who wrote about the Chinese astronaut program in this month's Scientific American. "But it adds some instability and excitement to an arena that's been fairly boring."
If the launching is successful, people in parts of the United States should be able to see the Chinese craft moving across a dark night sky like a star adrift. Four unpiloted test flights flew with an inclination to the Equator of 42 to 43 degrees, meaning that they traveled as far north as that latitude.
New York City is at a north latitude of 41 degrees, so the craft in theory could fly within its view if it follows the path of its predecessors.
Whether it does depends on sky conditions, the orbit's inclination and its duration. The longer the voyage, the greater the chance it will pass within visual range of particular ground sites.
"Even a short flight should cross the United States six or seven times," said Charles P. Vick, an expert on the Chinese space program at GlobalSecurity.org, a research group based in Alexandria, Va.
Space analysts said Beijing's effort to send humans into orbit began in earnest about a decade ago and was at first quite secretive, code-named Project 921. The cold war was just over and the impoverished Russians were cutting deals. So the Chinese, experts said, bought part of a Soyuz, a standard Russian spacecraft for transporting people.
It was no man-in-a-can, a description apt for early American models. Back to front, the Soyuz has a propulsion unit, a pressurized capsule for up to three people during assent and descent, and a forward module where astronauts can work. Even today, Russia uses the Soyuz routinely for ferrying astronauts to space outposts, and the Chinese obviously had the same objective in mind.
"They didn't buy a whole Soyuz," said Mr. Clark, who writes space books and articles from Britain. "It was a descent module stripped of innards, so mostly a shell." The Chinese also bought a life-support system, he added, and a pressurized suit for wearing inside the spacecraft.
Experts said the Chinese carefully studied and adapted Russian gear to their own needs. "They had to build and test and prove everything themselves," said Mr. Oberg, who lives near Houston. "So most of the similarities are superficial. The one exception is the suit. It copies the Russian design down to the stitching pattern."
The Chinese named their spacecraft Shenzhou or Divine Vessel. Weighing more than 8 tons and almost 30 feet long, it was slightly larger and heavier than the Soyuz. The main difference is the forward unit, which on the Shenzhou has solar panels and can remain in orbit after the piloted module descends back to Earth.
Even as China readied a home for astronauts, it worked hard to design a new type of Long March rocket to hurl Shenzhou into orbit. Beijing also found itself forced to confront the ticklish, potentially deadly issue of rocket dependability.
Chinese rockets failed in 1991, 1992, 1995, and twice in 1996, according to Chinese figures. It was a real crisis, given Beijing's interest in winning orders for satellite launchings and its ambitions for Chinese citizens in space.
American companies, including giants like Hughes, the world's largest maker of communications satellites, helped iron out the problems. This March, Boeing, which acquired Hughes Space and Communications, agreed to pay a record $32 million in fines to settle federal charges that the two companies had unlawfully transferred rocket and satellite data to China. The penalty was said to be the largest ever for an arms export case.
Bruce Berkowitz, a space analyst in Washington, minimized the episode in a paper for the Hoover Institution, saying the American companies made no effort to hide their assistance because they believed they were doing no wrong. He added that the technology at issue was trivial.
"The Chinese," he said, "probably gave away more technological secrets than they acquired from the U.S. companies." Other Western experts disagreed, saying the disclosures were quite significant.
No matter what, Beijing's work improved. Experts said the Chinese had suffered no major launching failures since the two of 1996.
A few months after the rocket dust settled, in October 1996, the Chinese formally announced plans to launch people into orbit. Late that year, two Chinese astronauts began training in Russia, and in turn trained a dozen others back in China. 
In June 1999, photographs began to circulate publicly of a new Long March rocket for astronauts, Mr. Clark said. Known as the 2F, it stood 19 stories high. Its top bore a small escape tower whose rockets could fire and pull the astronauts to safety if the main vehicle failed in the countdown or early stages of the flight.
Mr. Vick of GlobalSecurity.org examined images of the Jiuquan Space Center and found that the rocket's assembly building was some 32 stories high. From there, the rocket rolls to a nearby launching pad. 
Shenzhou first flew in 1999, with follow-up flights in 2001, 2002 and early 2003. The first mission lasted 21 hours, experts said, and the latter ones about 7 days. The flights became increasingly complex, with changes in orbit and practice moves for docking with other spacecraft.
A mystery surrounding the first piloted flight, known as Shenzhou 5, is how many astronauts will fly: one, two or three. The mission's length is to be about a day. Experts said the descent module, in theory, can be refurbished and fired back into space.
Analysts expect the Chinese to chart an increasingly bold course, first practicing linking up Shenzhou modules and ships together in orbit, then building a space outpost and using the craft to ferry astronauts.
Within a decade, Mr. Oberg said, China's space efforts may eclipse those of the Russia and the European Space Agency. If so, he added, the United States could find itself facing a new kind of space competition. "They're going to be in the top echelon of an exclusive club," Mr. Oberg said. "And they're not going to retrace everybody's steps. For much of that time, the other countries were going in circles."
Beijing officials talk of sending astronauts to the Moon and of planting a colony on Mars. "Down the road, it will become quite important to the White House," Mr. Vick predicted. "People are going to have to make a decision of how to take on this challenge."

HEADLINE: Don't Look Down 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
During the 1990's I spent much of my time focusing on economic crises around the world -- in particular, on currency crises like those that struck Southeast Asia in 1997 and Argentina in 2001. The timing of such crises is hard to predict. But there are warning signs, like big trade and budget deficits and rising debt burdens.
 And there's one thing I can't help noticing: a third world country with America's recent numbers -- its huge budget and trade deficits, its growing reliance on short-term borrowing from the rest of the world -- would definitely be on the watch list. 
 I'm not the only one thinking that. Lehman Brothers has a mathematical model known as Damocles that it calls "an early warning system to identify the likelihood of countries entering into financial crises." Developing nations are looking pretty safe these days. But applying the same model to some advanced countries "would set Damocles' alarm bells ringing." Lehman's press release adds, "Most conspicuous of these threats is the United States."
O.K., let's run through some reassuring counterarguments.
First, economists are very good at devising models that would have predicted past crises, but each new crisis tends to happen where and when they didn't expect it. So even though our budget deficit is bigger relative to the economy than Argentina's in 2000, and our trade deficit is bigger relative to the economy than Indonesia's in 1996, our experience needn't be the same.
Second, nasty crises in third world countries have a lot to do with the fact that their debt is in foreign currency, usually dollars. As a result, when the peso or the rupiah plunges, debts explode while assets don't, and balance sheets collapse. By contrast, thanks to the special international role of the dollar, America's burgeoning foreign debt is in our own currency.
Finally, financial markets are generally willing to give advanced countries the benefit of the doubt. Even when an advanced country seems to be deep in a financial hole, lenders usually assume that it will somehow find the resources and political will to climb back out.
So is America safe, despite its scary numbers?
Third world countries typically suffer from institutional weaknesses. They have poor corporate governance: you can't trust business accounting, and insiders often enrich themselves at stockholders' expense. Meanwhile, cronyism is rampant, with close personal and financial links between powerful politicians and the very companies that benefit from public largesse. Luckily, in America we don't have any of these weaknesses. Oh, wait. . . . (Isn't that all history? No. According to The Wall Street Journal, we are again hearing warnings that "optimism is based on massaged earnings.")
Still, there's no question that the U.S. has the resources to climb out of its financial hole. The question is whether it has the political will. 
There is now a huge structural gap -- that is, a gap that won't go away even if the economy recovers -- between U.S. spending and revenue. For the time being, borrowing can fill that gap. But eventually there must be either a large tax increase or major cuts in popular programs. If our political system can't bring itself to choose one alternative or the other -- and so far the commander in chief refuses even to admit that we have a problem -- we will eventually face a nasty financial crisis.
The crisis won't come immediately. For a few years, America will still be able to borrow freely, simply because lenders assume that things will somehow work out.
But at a certain point we'll have a Wile E. Coyote moment. For those not familiar with the Road Runner cartoons, Mr. Coyote had a habit of running off cliffs and taking several steps on thin air before noticing that there was nothing underneath his feet. Only then would he plunge.
What will that plunge look like? It will certainly involve a sharp fall in the dollar and a sharp rise in interest rates. In the worst-case scenario, the government's access to borrowing will be cut off, creating a cash crisis that throws the nation into chaos.
I know: it all sounds unbelievable. But would you have believed, three years ago, that the U.S. budget would plunge so quickly from a record surplus to a record deficit? And would you have believed that, confronted with that plunge, our leaders would offer excuses rather than solutions?

HEADLINE: Bolivian President Remains Defiant as Protests Intensify 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
Thousands of demonstrators marched in Bolivia's capital and other nearby cities on Monday, calling for the president's resignation. But they were dispersed by military units firing tear gas canisters, and at a midafternoon news conference President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada was defiant and pugnacious.
 "I'm not going anywhere," he said, citing his determination to remain in office and vowing that "order will be restored." He added, "It is not possible that democracy be replaced by a dictatorship of the unions" that will "pit region against region, class against class and ethnic group against ethnic group." 
 Clashes between demonstrators and the military have killed at least 42 people. At least 14 of them were killed Monday, according to Bolivia's Permanent Human Rights Assembly.
With popular revulsion growing, leaders of two parties that have been part of the precarious governing coalition said Monday that they were thinking of pulling out. But the clearest indication of weakening support came when Vice President Carlos Mesa announced that he was breaking with the government, which had the support of only 8 percent of those asked in recent polls.
"Neither as a citizen nor a man of principles can I accept that, faced with popular pressure, the response should be death," Mr. Mesa said, although he said protest groups bore part of the blame.
Bolivia, the poorest country in South America, has been racked since mid-September by antigovernment protests initially organized by groups representing the Indian peasants who are the country's impoverished and marginalized majority. But labor unions, student and neighborhood groups and opposition political parties have since joined and helped strengthen the movement.
In recent days, with many people angry over a government-backed proposal to export natural gas that opponents say would not benefit most Bolivians, the protests have grown increasingly confrontational, with demonstrators armed with sticks of dynamite blocking highways. Over the weekend, Mr. Sanchez de Lozadacalled out the troops, an action that has raised the level of violence even further.
The immediate cause of the unrest is the proposal to build a $5 billion pipeline to begin exporting Bolivia's vast reserves of natural gas to the United States and Mexico through a port in Chile. Opponents worry about corruption and complain that the royalty rate on gas shipments is so low that the project will end up offering more financial benefits to foreigners than to this Andean nation of eight million people.
"We've always exported our natural resources, like silver and tin, to others, so that they get rich and we remain poor," said Luis Alberto Javier, 30, a plumber's helper who supports the protests. "That gas should remain here to create jobs in Bolivia for Bolivians rather than be sold abroad, especially through Chile."
Chile is viewed as an enemy here because Bolivia has been landlocked ever since it lost its outlet to the Pacific Ocean in a war with Chile in 1879. Rapid economic growth in Chile during the past two decades has increased Bolivians' resentment. Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, a 73-year-old millionaire businessman, is seen as being overly cozy with Chilean business interests.
In a television address to the nation early on Monday, he promised that no new gas exports would be permitted until the citizenry was consulted, and he called for negotiations "to try to reach a consensus." Opposition leaders, sensing that his position was rapidly deteriorating, quickly rejected his call.
"We are not going to have dialogue with the murderers of the people," said Evo Morales, who leads the powerful coca growers union and who finished a close second in the presidential election last year. After the "massacre" over the weekend, he added, the opposition's attitude toward the president is one of "resignation or nothing."
Police officers in some outlying areas of the capital have joined demonstrators, according to local news reports. The loyalty of the police has been in doubt since a nationwide mutiny in February.
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada apparently decided to take the police off the streets in working class suburbs like El Alto and replace them with army troops backed by tanks and helicopters for precisely that reason. But even the prospect of continued military support for his government was being questioned.
"The Armed Forces are reaching the limit of their tolerance for a situation in which they are being blamed for these deaths," said Juan Ramon Quintana, a former military officer who now leads a private institute called the Bolivian Program for Strategic Research.
With roads in and out of the capital blocked, gasoline scarce and renewed violence a threat, many residents of La Paz stayed home from work on Monday. Most flights from the main airport, in the area that has experienced the most violence, have been canceled or postponed, airport officials said, and many stores are running out of supplies.
At a small butcher shop here, the proprietor, Estela Maman, said on Sunday that she was about to run out of meat, and would soon be forced to close down. Nevertheless, she said she supported the protests.
"The government is going to have to give in if there is to be a solution," she said. "None of this would be happening if they just listened to us, the people, but they never do, and now they are paying the price."

HEADLINE: Shanghai Journal; 
Splendid Skyline. Do You Feel Something Sinking?

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Like so many people here, Wang Yongxin happily moved into a high-rise apartment in the 1990's, when the construction frenzy seemed to capture this financial center's ambitions to become the next New York or Hong Kong. New skyscrapers always seemed to be rising, and Shanghai's self-esteem rose with them.
 Now, though, sitting on a sidewalk bench in the Pudong district, the epicenter of the city's recent building boom, Mr. Wang, a local business owner, is more frustrated than impressed. He frets about traffic, pollution and what many local residents say is the diminishing quality of life. There is even the inconvenient fact that some scientists believe the skyscrapers are causing the city to sink. 
 One solution, Mr. Wang said, is to stop building skyscrapers. "It would certainly alleviate some of the problems," he said. "There are enough high-rise buildings."
Surprisingly, many officials in Shanghai seem, at least partly, to agree. Sometime in October, the city's urban planning bureau is expected to revise local building laws to limit, if not ban, high-rise development.
If a new law is approved, and the opacity of Chinese politics means nothing is ever certain, it could spell the end to a period in which Shanghai came to symbolize China's roaring economy. Few, if any, cities in the world built as many tall buildings during that period. A planning bureau report says Shanghai now has at least 2,880 buildings of 18 stories or higher, an overwhelming majority of them constructed since the early 1990's. 
It was Deng Xiaoping, then China's aging supreme leader, who came to Pudong in 1992 out of frustration with Shanghai's laggard economic growth. He called on local officials to hasten development and "not waver until the job is complete." His words are now on a monument across the street from the Jin Mao Tower, which at 1,381 feet is by some calculations the world's fourth-tallest building. The planned World Financial Center, expected to surpass the twin, 1,483-foot Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as the world's tallest building, will rise above the monument.
"The whole nation got excited about the development," said Wu Jiang, a former university professor who is now deputy director of Shanghai's planning bureau.
But if Shanghai officials and planners regarded every new building as another step in its march to becoming a leading world city, mundane problems, the sort experienced by so many other places, have arisen. The population density in certain downtown areas exceeds that in Tokyo and New York, according to the planning bureau report. Some downtown areas became so dense with buildings that they became "heat islands," where temperatures rose above surrounding areas, a local institute found.
In a city known for its graceful colonial architecture along the Bund, the skyline -- the pride of local officials -- became more formless as residential towers cropped up in every corner of the city. With increasing frequency, residents are filing complaints based on an obscure law mandating that every home or apartment must receive at least two hours of sunlight a day.
"The interesting thing about Shanghai is that for a variety of reasons it was almost designed from the outside in, as if planners were more concerned with how it looked to the outside world than how it worked from within," said Christopher Choa, who runs the Shanghai office of a New York-based architectural firm, HLW.
Mr. Wu, when he was still a professor, had been critical of city planners, calling for more parks and public spaces and for halting the city's demolition of historic buildings. But when the city government appointed him deputy director of the planning bureau, he said he was convinced that attitudes were changing. 
"We still want to encourage all the economic development," he said. "We want people to come here. But on the other side, we want to make our city better."
The other question, of course, is whether the buildings are causing the city to sink. Built on a swamp, Shanghai sank by roughly eight feet from 1921 to 1965, largely because of the draining of groundwater beneath the city. But officials managed to correct the problem and virtually stop the sinking -- for a while. Statistics vary, but the city is again sinking, at roughly a centimeter a year. A study by a local institute said the sinking is worst in the downtown areas with the highest concentration of new buildings.
Still, many local officials and academics say they are not overly alarmed. Tang Yi Qun, a professor of geo-technical engineering at Tongji University, said both Tokyo and Mexico City have worse problems with subsidence.
The debate about curbing development in Shanghai comes as many economists and government officials are expressing concerns that the national real estate market could overheat and threaten China's economy.
For now, though, regardless of what happens with the economy or the building law, cranes will still rise in Shanghai: officials say as many as 2,000 buildings of all sizes have been approved or are already under construction.

Scares are back in style this Halloween as marketers pump up the ghoulishness quotient.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
MARKETERS are again grappling with the best tone to strike in Halloween advertising, but seem to have agreed that this year there is nothing for them to fear but missed sales.
 As has been true since real-life terror arrived on Sept. 11, 2001, advertisers' and consumers' attitudes toward fantasy frights this Halloween are serving as a Rorschach test for the country, marketing consultants say. 
 "It's back to scary and ghoulish," said Candace Corlett, a partner with WSL Strategic Retail, a New York consulting firm. "It just goes to show you how fleeting the emotional impact of such trauma can be." 
Dr. Robert K. Passikoff, president at Brand Keys in New York, a brand and customer-loyalty consulting company, agreed. "It's not going to be as kind and gentle a Halloween as it was the past couple of years," he said. "You'll see a lot more of the reverting back to horror and monsters and less of doctors, nurses, firemen and policemen."
"It's the first time you'll have seen it since 2001," Dr. Passikoff added.
That year, marketers reined in the ghouls and gore in their advertising and products. Even last year, as memories of the attacks were becoming less raw for many Americans, the sniper killings in the Washington area were a reminder that horror could return at any time. Marketers continued to strike a softer Halloween tone, eager to preserve spending on a holiday that totals about $7 billion annually, according to the National Retail Federation, a trade group.
But this fall the biggest domestic news stories have dealt with matters political, as in the California recall election, or pop, as in the relationship between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, collectively referred to as Bennifer.
As a result, consultants said, marketers feel more comfortable selling products like the Tormented Zombie sold at Spencer Gifts, the retail chain. The Zombie is a three-dimensional figure that screams and lifts its head off its shoulders when it detects motion nearby.
"In 2001, certainly there was reservation about the items that were shown," said Cheryl Wilson, customer development director at Spencer Gifts in Egg Harbor Township, N.J. "Displays were adjusted. But this year we're full-blown Halloween."
Perhaps the most vivid reflection of the fluctuating national mood has come in ad campaigns for Halloween events at the Universal Orlando Resort, part of Vivendi Universal. In 2001, its promotions were tweaked to make them more cartoonish.
By last year, Universal Orlando's Halloween commercials showed grisly images from the laboratory of a mad scientist.
But the 2003 campaign shook off any lingering hesitation about confronting consumers with terror. Universal Orlando and its agency, David and Goliath in Los Angeles, turned out commercials that resembled snuff films, which purport to show tapes of actual deaths.
One spot shows a man strapped down in a bathtub filled with water. A sadistic director films the man's desperate gyrations; a hand flips the switch on an electric breaker; a scream is heard. In another, the director fixes hooks to the corners of a clown's mouth to stretch his smile at least as wide as is humanly possible.
The campaigns appeal to a specific target audience of young people thirsty for a good scare, said David Angelo, chairman and chief creative officer at David and Goliath.
Moreover, Mr. Angelo said, the trauma of Sept. 11 created a need not just to feel secure but to feel normal. "Halloween has always been part of our lives," he said. "Take away that and then you're really going to be living under a shell."
Chris Riddle, the resident "Halloween Guy" at American Greetings, the greeting card company, said traditional Halloween spookiness had a place now, even if a different one from that of recent years.
"We have homeland security and economic issues right now," said Mr. Riddle, a senior creative consultant at American Greetings in Cleveland. "But they're in the back of your mind and you want Halloween to take a break from them."
Ms. Corlett, the retail consultant, said that any urge among consumers to let loose might be matched by a hunger for the start of the holiday season, with its connotations of family and home.
"There's just this anxiousness to get the holiday season started," she said. "It's just a nice three-month respite where the focus is on celebrating and family and less on world events."
Marketers are not likely to forget the friendly, family side of Halloween. Much as adult costume parties are a blessing to liquor and beer retailers, the growing family and home decoration elements are increasing sales; the National Retail Federation ranks Halloween as the second-biggest decorating "season" after the winter holidays.
Tom Williams, a spokesman at Wal-Mart Stores in Bentonville, Ark., said that its Halloween circulars and in-store promotions increasingly promoted home decor and crafts items with a harvest theme.
"It gives us a much longer selling range, into November," said Mr. Williams. As for toning down the gore, Wal-Mart has had fewer decisions to make because it always shied away from the bloodiest masks and costumes, he said.
Campaigns aimed at families or younger children continue to use Halloween to market gentle fare. The Hallmark Channel, for instance, is planning a 16-episode marathon of "The Addams Family" episodes. The Bronx Zoo in New York is advertising a "Boo at the Zoo" day with the theme "Have a hoot with family fun." The Sears, Roebuck & Company Web site advertises costumes that are strictly the stuff of fantasy, like Harry Potter and the Care Bears.
Burger King's Halloween promotions center around cute hamster action figures from "Hamtaro," a Japanese cartoon shown on the Cartoon Network.
And some marketers are playing both sides: The Happy Meal promotions at McDonald's allow children to choose from Madame Alexander dolls, some in pumpkin or leopard Halloween costumes, or Stretch Screamers, toys that include a disfigured mummy.
One suggestion for Halloween marketers looking to bridge the gap between pop culture costumery and freak-show frights: how about a Bennifer mask?

Motorola Releases Earnings in Rebuff to Debt-Rating Cut

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Motorola announced before the markets opened yesterday that it had achieved better-than-expected earnings in the quarter that ended Sept. 27. The report was made a day earlier than scheduled in an effort to offset the troubling news of a downgrading of its debt rating late Friday.
 "Over all the third quarter was a strong quarter for Motorola and one that signals some positive momentum in key aspects of our business," Mike Zafirovski, Motorola's president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. 
 Motorola's bright spots in the third quarter included stronger cellphone sales in North America and a sharp jump in two-way radio system sales to government agencies as spending on homeland security increased. Companywide, new orders were up 25 percent from the quarter in 2002. 
Investors were initially impressed, sending Motorola's stock up more than 4.4 percent to a 52-week high of $14.40 in early trading, but the stock soon retreated to finish at $13.87, up just 8 cents from Friday's close.
"People got concerned about handset margins," said Chris Versace, who follows Motorola for Friedman, Billings Ramsey. While operating margins for the cellphone unit rose to 5.7 percent in the third quarter from 3.4 percent in the second quarter, they are still well below the 12.7 percent margin Motorola enjoyed a year ago. In addition, with Motorola and other manufacturers all reporting a sharp increase in shipments from the second quarter, some investors are worried that sales to consumers' demand may not keep up, leading to an inventory glut by the end of the year, Mr. Versace said.
On Friday, Moody's Investor Services announced downgradings that left Motorola's subordinated debt classified as below investment grade -- junk bonds in industry jargon -- and its senior unsecured debt rating just one step higher.
Moody's said that the moves, which affected ratings on $8 billion in Motorola securities, primarily reflected concerns about Motorola's financial prospects in the cellphone business, where it ranks a distant second to Nokia of Finland. Motorola is facing increasing competition from a number of smaller players, including Samsung of South Korea and manufacturers in China.
Motorola introduced 17 new handsets in the third quarter, including 5 with integrated cameras, the market's hottest new segment. It has marketed the camera phones overseas, but has not yet introduced them in the United States, leaving the field wide open to many competitors who are already in the American market. 
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., also faces tough conditions in many of its telecommunications equipment businesses. Bondholders are anxious about how much cash it can obtain from its recently announced plans to spin off its money-losing semiconductor business and how that cash will be deployed.
There is also uncertainty about who will replace Christopher B. Galvin, who announced last month that he will retire as chairman and chief executive because of strategic disagreements with the company's board. While stock investors have reacted positively to Mr. Galvin's departure plans, bondholders are more leery about the risks that may involve, according to Paul Hsi, an analyst at Moody's.
"Our ratings are based on a long-term view, not the recent quarter," Mr. Hsi said.
Motorola said yesterday that it had net income of $116 million, or 5 cents a diluted share -- essentially the same as a year ago -- on sales of $6.8 billion, up 4.5 percent from the third quarter of 2002. Excluding costs associated with layoffs and other one-time expenditures, Motorola earned $132 million, or 6 cents a share, 3 cents higher than the consensus projection of analysts polled by Thomson First Call.
Looking ahead, Motorola advised Wall Street that it expects sales of $7.5 billion to $7.7 billion and earnings of 11 cents to 15 cents a share in the current quarter, which is at the rosy end of current analysts' estimates. Analysts said that the current quarter would be a far more important barometer of Motorola's efforts to regain momentum in the cellphone market because the last three months of the year are traditionally the biggest selling period for such products. 
Mr. Galvin said that business conditions in most industries and regions had stabilized, creating better prospects for "slow but emerging growth." In response to Moody's downgrade, he said that Motorola generated $1.1 billion in cash in the recent quarter and now had its strongest balance sheet in 20 years.
Motorola said it shipped 20.2 million handsets in the third quarter, an increase of about 19 percent from a year ago, as sales for the business climbed 8 percent to $2.9 billion.
But that sales surge in Motorola's biggest business would have been much stronger if the company had not lost ground in Asia. The average price of the phones sold was lower than anticipated, in part because Motorola has discounted many older phones it is phasing out. As a result, operating profits for the handset business were $147 million, down 39 percent from the $241 million reported a year ago.
Motorola's large semiconductor business, which eked out a $13 million profit a year ago, lost $76 million in the recent quarter, including $33 million paid out to lay off employees, as sales fell 4 percent, to $1.2 billion. On an encouraging note, new semiconductor orders rose 8 percent, to $1.4 billion, the strongest figure in 11 quarters.
Reduced capital spending by cable television companies drove broadband equipment sales down to $421 million, a drop of 19 percent from a year ago, and sliced profits for the group by 64 percent to $24 million. 
The star of the Motorola portfolio was Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions, the unit that sells radio and other private communications systems for public safety and security tasks. Sales reached $1 billion, up 17 percent from a year ago, and operating earnings nearly tripled to $146 million.

HEADLINE: A Disability Law Catch-22 

 BODY:
The Social Security Administration has been not only mean-spirited but also illogical in handling Pauline Thomas's disability claim. It denied payment to Ms. Thomas, a 61-year-old elevator operator in New Jersey who has a serious heart problem, on the ground that there is a job she can do -- a job that no longer exists. It is an absurd decision, but one fully in keeping with the Bush administration's drive to cut back on spending for the needy. The Supreme Court, which hears her case today, should strike a blow for common sense by upholding her claim. 
 Ms. Thomas was a housekeeper until she had a heart attack. With her cardiac problems, including an irregular heartbeat and dizziness, she could no longer do that job. Instead, she became an elevator operator at the Hudson County Administration Building in Jersey City. When her employer installed automatic elevators and she was laid off, she filed for disability benefits. She did not claim that she could no longer perform her old job; she argued that with the widespread automation of elevators, the job no longer exists in thenational economy. 
 The Social Security agency, in a mechanical application of its disability test, ruled against Ms. Thomas. It conceded that her medical problems were real and constituted a "severe impairment." But it insisted that its test required a worker to show that a disability prevented the performance of the person's prior job. That rule is reasonable in most cases. Workers should not be allowed to get disability benefits if they can return to their old lines of work. But it makes no sense when, as in Ms. Thomas's case, their jobs no longer exist.
Ms. Thomas sued the Social Security Administration for her benefits, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, correctly ruled that Congress had not intended this nonsensical -- and cruel -- result. Ms. Thomas's case has not drawn much attention, but it should, particularly since technology is transforming the workplace so rapidly. Any American who pays Social Security taxes is buying a government disability insurance policy. It is not much of a policy if the government can deny claims by pointing to imaginary ways in which severely disabled workers can support themselves.

HEADLINE: Where Faith Grows, Fired by Pentecostalism 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA and LARRY ROHTER; Somini Sengupta reported for this article from Nigeria and Larry Rohter from Brazil. 

DATELINE: ON THE LAGOS-IBADAN EXPRESSWAY, Nigeria 

 BODY:
For many, this highway leads to the future of the Christian faith, and at 9 o'clock on a Friday night, traffic is heavier than a Los Angeles rush hour.
 Hundreds of thousands of Nigerians, from street vendors to computer consultants, sit through the exhaust and the squealing horns to reach evangelical campgrounds with churches as large as airplane hangars. The names are as spectacular as the hopes they sell: Mountain of Fire and Miracles, Deeper Life, and the largest and oldest, the 12,000-acre Redemption Camp. 
 The worshipers are drawn by a program of rousing song and dance and by an eminently practical gospel promising health and prosperity. They come seeking quick fortunes or protection against mundane maladies, from hunger to arthritis to armed robbers. They shout hallelujahs until close to daybreak, when the highway, famous for accidents and bandits, is safe to make the crawl back to Lagos. 
Here nobody, it seems, can afford not to pray. 
"In countries where everything is very O.K., where they take care of their citizenry, people are very lethargic when it comes to religion and God," said Oluwayemisi Ojuolape, 27, a lawyer in Lagos, who attended this all-night vigil, called Holy Ghost Service. "They are not encouraged to ask for any help. They seem to have all of it." 
Not so in the developing world, where Christianity is drawing followers as never before. 
That growth is changing the complexion and practice of the Christian faith and other religions in a fervid competition for souls, generating new tremors in places like Nigeria, which are already marbled with ethnic and political fault lines, and causing schisms between the old Christians of the north and the newer ones of the south. It is also beginning to be felt in the political life of these countries. 
The new Christian expansion is particularly striking in Pentecostalism, a denomination born only about 100 years ago among blacks, whites and Hispanics in an abandoned church in Los Angeles. Emphasizing a direct line to God, its boisterous, unmediated style of worship employs healings, speaking in tongues and casting out demons. 
Spreading Pentecostal congregations -- a quarter of all Christians worldwide -- are bumping up against established Christian churches and Islam in Africa, and chipping away at what has long been a virtual Roman Catholic monopoly in Latin America.
In Brazil, where the national identity has been intertwined with Catholicism since the Portuguese landed 500 years ago, the emotional services at thousands of Pentecostal churches amount to a religious revolution in the world's largest Catholic country.
In the 25 years of John Paul II's papacy, Brazil's Protestant population has quadrupled, with the biggest surge coming in the 1990's among evangelical and Pentecostal groups. More than 25 million Brazilians belong to such churches, leaving pastors like Ezequiel Teixeira of the New Life Project Church in Rio de Janeiro so giddy that he predicts, "In another 25 years, Brazil will have a Protestant majority." 
By some estimates, more than a third of Guatemala's population is now Protestant, and Pentecostal churches are making significant inroads in Argentina, Colombia and Chile, where Catholics account for 70 percent of the population. 
Across the tropics and the south, Christian worship, especially Pentecostalism, has captured hearts and minds in countries where the precariousness of ordinary living -- blackouts, robbery, disease, corruption -- makes rich and poor alike turn to divine intervention.
"It allows for spiritual or divine agency, so that God has the power to fix and heal and also to protect you," said Lamin Sanneh, a professor at Yale Divinity School who specializes in West Africa. "You might fall into a ditch, or you might be in a car accident, roads such as they are. You are always in present danger. Pentecostalism speaks that language very well."
In Africa, a big part of the success of Pentecostal movements, scholars say, rests on the ability to tap into traditional cosmology, in which gods have long been solicited in pursuit of specific, worldly favors. 
"God has become a modern-day juju God," said Chichi Aniagolu, a Nigerian sociologist and a Catholic who, by her own admission, dips into Pentecostal services. "You appease him. You bring him yams, goats, make sacrifices, and you get what you want. Today, you're not making sacrifices. You're giving tithes."
Churches have become formidable economic empires. Most troubling to critics is the enrichment of enterprising preachers, who say their fine cars and expensive suits can convince others of what God's grace can provide. Critics accuse them of duping the poor and doing little to ease poverty or repair endemic corruption. 
Yet their appeal has been seemingly irresistible. Worship today is a far cry from the rituals once imposed by European missionaries. Services are conducted in Swahili and Igbo. Most of all, services can be much livelier than their European antecedents. 
"I was in Rome the other day and I found the way they celebrate the Eucharist a bit boring," said Bishop Anthony Ireri Mukobo, of the Archdiocese of Nairobi.

A Gospel of Success
From the stage at the Redemption Camp outside Lagos on a recent evening came a gospel of success.
"There will be no more sickness," sang Pastor Enoch A. Adeboye, the general overseer of the vast empire known as the Redeemed Church of Christ.
"Yes, Lord, I believe," the worshipers, more than 100,000 of them, sang back.
"There will be no more failure," the pastor sang.
"Yes, Lord, I believe," answered the crowd. "Yes, Lord."
Like other proponents of prosperity theology, the pastor likes to remind his congregation that God multiplies what the faithful give to the church. "If you don't sow, you don't reap," he says. 
"I have heard God speak," the pastor went on, "and I can tell you, I have heard the sound of abundance."
Abundance certainly has come to the Redeemed Church. There are no fewer than 5,000 parishes worldwide, about 4,000 of them in Nigeria, Mr. Adeboye said. 
A former mathematics professor close to the Nigerian president, Mr. Adeboye could only estimate the total membership at around two million. Asked about church revenues, he demurred, saying only, "By the grace of God, we are able to take care of our ministers." 
There are some 40,000 of them. The church has built a school and a health clinic at Redemption Camp. A university is under construction. 
The congregants are by no means all in need. Emmanuel Dania, a tall, fit, British-educated computer consultant, rolled into the V.I.P. parking area of Redemption Camp in an air-conditioned white Toyota pickup truck, then high-fived a friend who had arrived in his own chauffeur-driven BMW. A beggar was quickly turned away. 
Mr. Dania regularly worships at an affiliated church in a stylish section of Lagos, where he has found a network of like-minded, upwardly mobile young Nigerians. Some months ago, Mr. Dania said, he had bid on a project with the Central Bank of Nigeria. The official in charge of the contract was a member of the same church.
"He said he was so happy he was dealing with a man of God," Mr. Dania recalled. "You can actually do business in the church. You don't have to go anywhere else. There's a lot of prosperity in the church."
Many traditional Christian theologians, particularly Catholics, dismiss the message that faith will bring wealth and success. 
"They're preaching Cross-less Christianity," said the Rev. Iheanyi Enwerem, of the Catholic Secretariat in Lagos. "The idea of everything joy-joy, prosperity-prosperity, well-well. In life, there are certain things we can't have because God doesn't want it. For them, everything is Easter joy, no Good Friday. We say it's totally un-Christian."
But for the poor, the very presence of the rich in the same sanctuary serves as a powerful lesson, much like the testimonials that those who say they were miraculously healed deliver: If God answered their prayers, maybe he will answer mine. 
Iwalola Adebusoye, 40, sells rice at a Lagos market. At Redemption Camp, she stood from her seat, closed her eyes, put her hands on her hips and spat her prayers in rapid-fire Yoruba, as though shouting at a no-good deceiving husband.
Uneducated herself, she said she had put three children through school on her earnings selling rice. She was now praying for an opportunity to expand her trade, maybe sell eggs. "To move forward," she said in halting English. "No helper," she said of her predicament. "Only God. And Jesus."

A Fervent Response to Rigidity
Such predicaments are also widespread in Brazil. Like many Brazilian Pentecostals, Manoel Ferreira was born in the poverty-stricken interior into what he calls "a fervently Catholic family," but converted after migrating to a large city, Sao Paulo.
While being trained to join the state police in the early 1950's, Mr. Ferreira was accidentally shot by a fellow cadet. The wound became infected, he remembers, and he feared he was going to die.
"In those days, only Roman Catholic chaplains were allowed into hospitals," he recalled during an interview in a working-class neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. "But a male nurse who was an evangelical preached clandestinely to me, and as soon as I was released I made my way to the Assembly of God, and never left."
Today, the denomination that Pastor Ferreira heads as bishop of the Assembly of God is the largest of its kind in Brazil, with 8.8 million members, according to the Brazilian census of 2000, and more than 100,000 churches.
Founded in 1910 by missionaries from Chicago, the Assembly of God in Brazil now sends missionaries abroad and has spawned dozens of other denominations with colorful names like Church of Christ's Spit. 
These Pentecostal churches have made a special effort to appeal to women, who often complain of being limited to a supporting role in the Catholic church. The Pentecostal movement, in contrast, encourages them to be more than wives and mothers: deaconesses, missionaries, even pastors. 
"I thought that it was my destiny to suffer, because I had been taught as a Catholic to accept the fate God had for me," said Josefa Barros de Sousa, who migrated from Paraiba, a poor northern state, to Rio de Janeiro to work as a nanny. "No one recognized me or my suffering, until I got here and learned that I could talk to God myself and didn't need a priest or saints to do that for me." 
Pentecostal churches have been quick to exploit the potential of television with innovative programing, like that of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Brazil's fastest-growing denomination. 
Begun in a funeral parlor in Rio de Janeiro in 1977, the church has grown from 200,000 members at the start of the 1990's to more than two million today. It owns a leading television network and substantial real estate holdings, and has worked to elect 22 of its members to Congress.
Belatedly, the Catholic Church is responding with a movement that has come to be known as Charismatic Renewal, borrowing Pentecostal thunder, including speaking in tongues. 
Services that incorporate rock-style hymns and intense devotion to the Virgin Mary have made the Rev. Marcelo Rossi, 36, of Sao Paulo, a pop star who sells millions of CD's. In October he is starring in a movie in which he plays Archangel Gabriel. 
But the Pentecostal movement continues to grow. Besides Catholicism, it aggressively challenges Brazil's traditional animist cults like candomble, macumba and umbanda, which have many of the same African roots as Caribbean voodoo and santeria and are practiced by millions of Brazilians who consider themselves Catholics.
Yet part of what draws followers may be a certain stylistic resemblance: the trance-like state of Pentecostalists speaking in tongues resembles that of macumba adherents when they are "receiving a saint."
The chief appeal, however, appears to lie in preachers who offer rural newcomers advice on adjusting to blighted, violent urban neighborhoods, and a gospel of self-esteem, a message of empowerment. 
"Don't let anybody tell you that you are nothing," Silvio Pereira, a 30-year-old Assembly of God preacher, told worshipers at a small church on the outskirts of Salvador da Bahia, in northern Brazil. "Raise your head high because God wants to use you. You are dynamite in the hands of God."

Bringing Change to All Creeds
The expanded Christian following in the developing world has translated into increasing power, both within developing countries and within mainstream denominations. 
As church attendance has withered in Europe, senior Vatican officials and Roman Catholic leaders recognize and look to the developing world as fertile ground for conversions and growth, a place where the faith takes firmer root than it does in Europe or North America these days. Indeed, the successor to Pope John Paul could be a Latin American or African cardinal. 
The growing assertion of the Christian south is provoking fierce doctrinal arguments, too, often over their preference for literal readings of the Bible and a conservative view on social issues. The Anglican Communion meets in October in London in an attempt to heal an unprecedented rift over homosexuality, a charge led by the head of the Church of Nigeria, which, with 18 million congregants, is the largest member of the Anglican Communion.
Tensions extend to the political sphere. The proliferation of Islamic law in northern Nigeria, which has set off rioting that has killed hundreds, is widely seen as the Muslim elite's response to Nigeria's new, hard-line Christianity.
Throughout Africa, the rivalry between Christianity and Islam, from Sudan to Ivory Coast, is growing.
In Nigeria, a nation of 130 million that accounts for one-fifth of Africa's population, the rivalry is so intense that it has been impossible for the government even to conduct a census to know the numbers of each group.
Christian missionaries have been dispatched to open schools and parishes in northern Muslim strongholds. Church leaders have spoken out loudly against the re-introduction of Islamic law into several state penal codes. Rioting has divided cities where Muslim and Christian neighbors once lived side by side.
In the view of critics, the flourishing of Christianity has only added to Nigeria's poverty and corruption.
"The movement is clearly reflective of everything that's wrong with Nigeria," said Nosa Igiebor, the outspoken editor of Tell, a weekly newsmagazine. "Poor people are forced to pay these tithes, and by doing so, every problem they take to the pastor will be solved. The pastors know it won't be. Just the same way our political leaders deceive people, by making promises they have no intention to keep."
Under the rule of President Olesegun Obasanjo, himself a born-again Christian, church sermons are broadcast all weekend long on state-run television. So too is the presidential chaplain's Sunday service from the presidential villa in the capital, Abuja. 
In response to Muslim complaints, the television also broadcasts clips from Friday Prayers at the National Mosque in Abuja. 
The Christian resurgence has led a group of young urban Muslim professionals to create a Pentecostal-style movement of their own. On Sunday mornings in a downtown Lagos parking lot, men and women sit in separate tents. Volunteers collect prayer requests, just as at Redeemed Church.
On a recent Sunday, the requests themselves were remarkably similar, too. One man wanted the congregation to pray for his visa interview at the United States Embassy that coming Thursday. A young woman wanted blessings for her university entrance exam.
"If you have belief, if you have courage that it is Allah that grants everyone's desire, then within a short time of coming here, your prayer will be answered," said Oriyomi Musbau Hussein, 31, the civil servant who asked the congregation to pray for his visa application.
The group calls itself the Nasrul-Lahi-Il-Fathi Society of Nigeria, or Nasfat. What began eight years ago at a banker's house today boasts 80 branches in Nigeria and 3 in the United States and Britain. 
Koranic prayer books are translated into English, as well as the main Nigerian tongues. These Muslims do not sit and listen to an imam preach in a language they do not understand.
Nasfat's efforts are in direct response to what its leaders see as the encroachment of the new churches. "Now you see young folks deflecting to Christendom," said Saminu Oki, an American-educated official of Lagos State, who serves on the group's executive committee. 
"They've been able to attract the young ones," he said of the Christian churches, who have received Muslim converts. "They made it so simple. You don't even have to read the Koran. They poisoned them. If you read verses of the Bible, all your problems will be solved."
Nasfat has purchased 100 acres of land on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway as well, where the group intends to build a retreat and a university, not unlike Redemption Camp. 
"We are pace-setting," Mr. Oki said. "We don't want to do it the old way."

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
A Rebound for U.S. Luxury Goods

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
As the models floated down the runway here Sunday at the Louis Vuitton show, spectators could not miss the one accessory accompanying every costume. A tiny satchel. A big valise with gold trim and metal studs. A pouch with leather ruffles. Even the models in bathing suits carried pocketbooks. 
 Vuitton's presentation of handbags was unrelenting, but most of the biggest names in luxury fashion, including Christian Dior, Chanel and Saint Laurent, were hoping for their own big hit -- the one purse or watch or pair of shoes that would excite the buying public as it awakens from its lethargy of the last two years. 
 At last, analysts say, a turnaround has begun for the $63 billion global market in luxury goods. Tourism is beginning to recover; pent-up demand is beginning to be unleashed. And during the month of runway shows for spring 2004 fashions that began in New York, continued in Milan and will end in Paris on Tuesday, the big luxury brands were all trying to get out in front, to grab the spotlight with the most irresistible new accessory. 
"The stakes for this season's big bag are very high," Domenico De Sole, chief executive of the Gucci Group, said Saturday. "Whoever gets the bag gets the fashion momentum." 
At Gucci, clothing contributes only 30 percent of income -- the rest is accessories. Vuitton, thanks to leather goods, contributes 60 percent of the operating profit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's No. 1 luxury company -- so it is perhaps not surprising that the house prepared 300 sample bags for its Sunday show. At the Chanel show, meanwhile, guests laughed as models turned their wrists to show off their watches.
The big luxury companies -- hunter-gatherers of brands like Gucci, Dior, Boucheron and Bottega Veneta -- as well as luxury emporiums like Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman have shown significant sales increases in the last two months, according to executives. They predict that when results from the last quarter are released this week, the increases over a year ago will be 10 to 20 percent for many companies. 
Gucci was one of the brands hit the hardest in the global economy of the last two year. But in boutiques in the United States, Europe and Japan, sales in September increased by more than 10 percent over September 2002, according to Mr. De Sole. 
"The luxury market is clearly on a rebound," said Christian Oddone, an analyst who specializes in luxury products for the Actinvest Group in London. "The market is already assuming a full recovery five or six months from now, and stock prices have risen accordingly: the price of Bulgari, for instance, has doubled. Tiffany, too, has risen. And LVMH. After two years in which everything that could happen did happen, we're looking toward a more stable environment."
There are still holes in the luxury goods recovery: Europe, and especially France, is still iffy because of a lack of tourists, particularly Americans. Mr. De Sole spoke of Americans' "lingering resentment" against the French over the Iraq war. The Japanese, too, have less ardor for luxury goods than in the boom years of the late 90's. 
But in the United States, luxury is coming back, according to analysts. Last week Neiman Marcus, which operates 36 stores nationwide, reported a 14.7 percent increase in sales for September compared with sales at the same stores a year ago. At Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores, one analyst estimated that designer clothing sales had risen more than 15 percent in the last six months. H. Frank Doroff, the chain's general merchandise manager, refused to confirm the figure but said that significant designer sales had revived not only in New York, but in Boston, Los Angeles and Florida, as well.
The hottest luxury brands? "Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Ralph Lauren and Burberry," he said.
At all 54 of Ralph Lauren's own stores, which handle only his most expensive lines of clothing, jewelry, shoes and bags -- versus department stores, which also handle less expensive lines like Lauren -- sales are up an average "in the high teens" for September, said Nancy Murray, a spokeswoman. Several analysts predict that Burberry, a brand that the company's chief executive, Rose Marie Bravo, calls "accessible luxury," will report similar increases this week when it announces its third-quarter results. 
For LVMH -- whose 60 brands include Dom Perignon and Fendi -- sales were down 10 percent over all at the end of the first half of the year, reported in mid-September. But in an interview last week, Yves Carcelle, the president of Louis Vuitton, said that many LVMH brands have been rising steadily in the last two months. The company reports its third-quarter results Tuesday.
An especially weak division of LVMH has been its duty-free shops, where sales plummeted in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Iraq war and the threat of SARS. But LVMH has told analysts to expect that the shops will break even by the end of this year. 
Even in Paris there are some signs of returning tourists, who are major consumers of luxury goods. May Wong, the wife of a toy manufacturer from Hong Kong, said she had come on a two-day visit "because it's more relaxing now; you don't have to worry about getting SARS on an airplane." Shopping here is also a relative bargain: her Dior bag -- fresh off the runways, she said -- was 10 to 15 percent cheaper than in Hong Kong.
"And you wouldn't see it in the shops back home until two or three months later," Ms. Wong added.
Blake W. Nordstrom, president of the Seattle-based Nordstrom chain, said that during the downturn, core customers continued to shop, but they bought less -- a handbag instead of an evening dress, for example. "Our luxury customer never left us," said Mr. Nordstrom, whose company's sales were up 7.7 percent in September over the previous year. "We suffered a setback, and now, the designer clothing is the most robust of all." 
Bert Tansky, the chief executive of Neiman Marcus, put it similarly: "She may have bought less, she may have accessorized what was already in her closet, but she never traded down." At Neiman Marcus, sales from the just-released Christmas catalog -- which, besides a $50,000 set of Vuitton luggage and a $12 million jet, includes household robots for $400,000 -- are running above last year's levels, he added.
As the luxury shopper spends more, not only in local stores but in travels around the world, analysts say the competition among brands is apt to heat up. And nowhere is this more visible than in Paris, where accessories are the engine that extends luxury brands to people whose parents would never have dreamed of owning a Dior or Vuitton anything. 
For Sunday's Vuitton show, the invitations were engraved metal and arrived in a card case covered with the house's imitated-to-death canvas, including the signature LV's and a tiny, real leather tab. The souvenir may have delighted its recipients, but more than anything, the fashion editors and retailers awaited the bag parade at the show. Would there be another knockout hit like the one commissioned a year ago from the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, who made Vuitton's signature fabric more colorful, more playful? 
All eyes were on the models' hands. Each carried a different bag. But in the end, the crowds seemed disappointed. Mr. Carcelle, the company president, predicted that the bags would all "sell like hot cakes," nevertheless, fashion followers agreed there was to be no single "it bag."
"No," said Lee Radziwill, the longstanding fashion figure, as she stood outside after the show contemplating the question of handbags. "No, certainly nothing like last year."

Iraq's interim trade minister warned on Monday against forcing his nation's economy to mold itself rapidly into a free-market system, saying that a swift change would fuel unemployment and heighten political instability.
 "We suffered through the economic theories of socialism, Marxism and then cronyism," the official, Ali Abdul-Amir Allawi, said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's East Asia Economic Summit meeting here. "Now we face the prospect of free-market fundamentalism." 
 A lively debate is taking place within the Bush administration and the Iraqi government on how quickly Iraq should move toward a free-market economy. In some quarters, sweeping economic change along the lines of Eastern Europe's rapid reorganization is advocated.
According to Mr. Allawi, imposing a similar reorganization on Iraq would represent a "flawed logic that ignores history."
"The economies of Eastern Europe collapsed due to internal problems," Mr. Allawi said. "Our situation is very different since the changes came in the form of very welcome help from outside."
"These things are not yet being thrust down our throat," he added, "but I strongly disagree with the call for fast and radical change."
Mr. Allawi cautioned that using "shock therapy" could lead to a reaction against foreign companies and persistent political instability.
With more than 500,000 workers on their payrolls, Iraq's 200 state-owned enterprises are the largest employers outside the central government.
Many in the governments of Iraq and the United States have advocated a wholesale sell-off of state owned enterprises. Mr. Allawi said the international pressure to privatize immediately, and to eliminate subsidies, was too great.
"By no means should we preserve all state-owned enterprises," Mr. Allawi said. "But there are some sectors that are more natural for government involvement or rehabilitation." He urged the quick closing of companies holding monopolies on car sales and construction contracts.
The Iraqi economy, once shielded from foreign investment, has already begun to move toward a free-market model since the American-led invasion. Restrictions have been lifted on investment in all economic sectors apart from oil; import duties have been cut to 5 percent; and the maximum corporate tax rate has been set at 15 percent.
A slow recovery is under way. But Mr. Allawi said the economy was normal only in the sense that public markets are functioning. 
A big problem, he said, is suspicion about the intentions of foreign companies. "There was already a great uproar when we opened up the economy to 100 percent foreign ownership," he said. "I happen to agree it is the right policy, but the Iraqi private sector is extremely weak."
Domestic companies in every sector face shortfalls of capital, technology and management expertise, Mr. Allawi said. Most, he added, will be condemned to failure if they are not given more time.

HEADLINE: China Expects Tourism to Grow Rapidly 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS BUCKLEY 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
The tourism industry in China is set for rapid growth in the coming years, despite lingering fallout from the SARS epidemic earlier this year, according to a report released here Monday.
 The report, issued by the World Travel and Tourism Council, a private organization that represents hotel and travel companies, predicts the number of tourists and business travelers visiting China will grow 22 percent a year beginning next year through 2013, and the flow of Chinese tourists and travelers going abroad will probably grow even faster. 
 Council representatives and travel industry executives warned, however, that China must overhaul its tourism administration and accept more foreign involvement if it is to manage the expansion.
"China has the potential to become one of the world's greatest tourism economies, but the scope of effort needed is staggering," said Jean-Claude Baumgarten, president of the council. 
The report was issued a few days after the end of China's weeklong National Day holiday, which saw a resurgence in domestic Chinese tourism after the SARS epidemic forced the cancellation of travel during the May Day holiday and halted most long-distance travel.
"It was the most dramatic shutdown of tourism we've ever seen anywhere in the world in recent history," Richard Miller, the vice president for research and economics at the council, said of SARS.
The council report, which Mr. Miller wrote, estimated SARS reduced growth by the tourism and travel sector by 25 percent, costing it $7.6 billion and 28 million jobs.
Using techniques to quantify the overall economic contribution of tourism and travel, Mr. Miller estimated SARS-inflicted damage cost the entire economy $20 billion.
Industry analysts said, however, China's domestic tourism and business travel sectors revived faster than many had predicted.
"Now we're at above where it was before," David Yates, president of 4oceans, a British company that provides booking for Chinese hotels and travel agents, said in a telephone interview. "There's incredible pent-up demand."
He also noted that non-Chinese business travelers began returning to the country soon after the government ended travel restrictions in June. Tourists are returning now, too, though more warily and in fewer numbers than before. 
In July, the last month with official figures available, visits by non-Chinese nationals were down by a quarter compared with July 2002; visits from the United States were down 37 percent.
Many industry analysts expect fallout from SARS will be more than canceled out by the sharp growth in the number of Chinese traveling abroad for pleasure or business.
"Over the last few years, outbound spending by Chinese tourists has exploded," Mr. Miller said.
"There are very few countries growing faster than China."
In recent years the Chinese government has eased restrictions on Chinese tourists traveling to selected countries, including Thailand, Australia and Germany. Last year, Chinese made nearly 16 million trips abroad, including visits to Hong Kong and Macao, according to the council -- an increase of 4 million from the previous year. 
Mr. Miller said that he expected similar growth over the next decade, pushing China into the top ranks of international travelers.
The report by the council argues that to manage and sustain its emergence as a tourism superpower, China must radically overhaul its tourism administration and open the sector to more private involvement in decision making.
"China'stourism structure needs to adapt to the needs of the market," Mr. Baumgarten said. 
The recommendations he cited included opening China's national tourist administration to private-sector participants, raising its political status, and investing more money in infrastructure and training for tourism.
He also said China should modify its current system of squeezing nearly everyone's vacations into three weeklong public holidays, which, he said, "puts an unmanageable strain on existing tourism resources." 
Most Chinese have no vacation besides those holidays.
Mr. Yates of 4oceans said that the tourism industry in China should become more flexible and attuned to the needs of individual travelers. 
"China has traditionally been dominated by package tours, but the fastest-growing market is for frequent individual travelers," he said, using the industry term for people traveling on their own.
For the time being, however, China's travel officials will be more concerned about preventing a renewed spread of SARS with disastrous consequences for the tourist industry. Recently, China has reintroduced reporting requirements and disinfected buses and taxis amid fears that the disease may reappear during the winter.

HEADLINE: Global Energy Official Is Worried on Prices 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The head of the International Energy Agency, an adviser to 26 industrialized nations on oil policy, said yesterday that low fuel inventories might lead to price swings in the fourth quarter as demand peaked.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last month voted to lower production to bolster oil prices. 
Demand is set to reach its highest point as consumers in the United States and Europe use more heating fuel. 
"Prices are too high," said Claude Mandil, the executive director for the agency, at a conference in Paris. "This winter the main problem will be volatility because of low stocks. That's my main concern."
Brent crude in London has risen 20 percent, to almost $31 a barrel since OPEC decided on Sept. 24 to trim its output by 900,000 barrels a day, or 3.5 percent. OPEC has cited rising production in Iraq and other countries that threatens to hurt prices. The decision may undermine economic recovery by increasing energy costs, the energy agency has said.
"I regret the decision," Mr. Mandil told reporters during a conference on natural gas markets. "Stocks are lower than the levels they've been at in previous years."
The agency tracks inventories in the 30 nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. August figures, the latest available, show that stockpiles equaled 53 days of demand, 2 days less than at the time a year ago, according to a monthly report released by the agency on Friday.

Motorola Earnings Lift Market on a Light Trading Day

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A strong profit report from Motorola lifted Wall Street yesterday as investors grew more optimistic that third-quarter earnings in general would be strong. The Dow Jones industrials rose nearly 90 points to a 16-month high.
 Trading was light as the bond market was closed for Columbus Day and Japan's financial markets were closed for a national holiday. 
 "It's a bit of a surprise to see this much strength on a low-volume day; you have to give credit to the Motorola numbers," said Peter Dunay, chief market strategist at Wall Street Access, a brokerage firm based in New York.
But he added: "It's really anticipation that's driving the market. Most analysts are now expecting even more from earnings, which could put the market under pressure."
The Dow closed up 89.70 points, or 0.9 percent, at 9,764.38, having gained 1.1 percent last week for its third winning week in four. Earlier in the day, the Dow rose as much as 108.81. The close was the highest since June 5, 2002, when the blue chips closed at 9,796.80.
The broader market also finished higher. The Nasdaq composite index gained 18.22 points, or 1 percent, to 1,933.53, after a weekly advance of 1.9 percent. It was the Nasdaq's highest close since January 31, 2002, when it stood at 1,934.03.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,045.35, having risen 0.8 percent last week. It was the highest level since June 5, 2002, when the index finished at 1,049.90.
Motorola rose 8 cents, to $13.87, after the company reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share.
"People are feeling pretty good about the Motorola earnings," said Mark Donahoe, managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "There also was an upgrade of the software sector by Lehman Brothers which helped things."
"But it's hard to draw real trends today because of the low volume," he added.
Stocks have rallied sharply since mid-March, but investors are now looking for strong evidence of economic improvement. Analysts say third-quarter earnings reports, which are released in earnest this week, will be crucial in determining whether the market can go higher, although some caution that investor expectations may be becoming too high.
"What's really under the microscope is what investors see for '04," Mr. Dunay said. "They want to see revenue growth and earnings going forward. It won't be enough to see companies meeting or beating estimates. They expect all the fiscal stimulus to get the engine moving again."
A Dow component, Honeywell International, jumped $1.27, to $28.77, after saying it would acquire Silent Witness Enterprises Ltd., a maker of video surveillance equipment.
FedEx advanced $2.79, to $71.35, after Merrill Lynch raised the company's stock rating to buy from neutral.
Computer Associates International gained $1.17, to $24.67, after Lehman Brothers raised the company's stock rating to overweight from equal weight.
Losers included eBay, which dropped $1.47, to $58.99, after the Smith Barney division of Citigroup cut its rating to sell from hold.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 5 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.34 billion shares, compared with 1.42 billion traded on Friday.

Marlins Tickets Are a Hot Item Again

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
The Florida Marlins, one of Major League Baseball's most troubled franchises in recent years, appear to have a new lease on life, regardless of the outcome of their first playoff appearance since 1997.
 Support for the Marlins in South Florida, an area often described as less than enthusiastic about the 10-year-old team, has soared since they reached the National League Championship Series. The Chicago Cubs lead that series, 3-2, entering Game 6 tonight in Chicago. 
 The three games of the series at Pro Player Stadium in Miami attracted near-capacity crowds of more than 65,000, a sharp increase compared with the regular season, when the Marlins ranked ahead of only the Montreal Expos and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in attendance. 
The outpouring of support in the postseason has begun to dispel concern that the Marlins are among the franchises with a skittish fan base that could be eliminated from the major leagues.
Although the Marlins' playoff berth represents one of the season's most impressive turnarounds, the team's success in building support in South Florida depends on extending its achievements into next season.
"The Marlins are in a salutary situation by having had a good season and being based in a market that is growing in terms of both population and income levels," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who specializes in sports. "Their biggest challenge will be reminding people that this season is different than what happened after 1997."
That year, the team's original owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, invested heavily to recruit talented players, and the Marlins went on to win the World Series in only the franchise's fifth season.
But Huizenga, citing difficulties in gaining public financing for a new baseball stadium, dismantled the team and sold it in 1999 to John Henry, a successful commodities trader. 
After five consecutive losing seasons, fans grew disillusioned, translating into dismal ticket sales and few lucrative endorsement deals. 
Henry, disappointed with tepid support for the Marlins and for a new stadium, sold the team last year to Jeffrey Loria, a New York art dealer and a former Expos owner, for $158.5 million. 
In a carefully orchestrated series of deals, Loria was allowed to transfer control of the Expos to the commissioner's office for $120 million. Henry went on to lead a group that acquired the Boston Red Sox for $660 million.
This season, Loria, aided by an estimated $20.7 million in revenue-sharing transfers from the league, pursued a strategy similar to Huizenga's in 1997 of luring top-notch players like catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who signed as a free agent last off-season.
But Pro Player Stadium, the home of the Miami Dolphins of the N.F.L. and an awkward fit for baseball fans accustomed to more intimate surroundings, remains a source of contention. 
In addition to trying to retain talented players, Loria is expected to renew efforts to win support for a new stadium, always a delicate subject in Miami, or at least renegotiate the lease for Pro Player, which is still owned by Huizenga. 
So far, efforts by the Marlins' president, David Samson, to reach a new agreement with Huizenga on the lease have been unsuccessful. In an unusual twist, Huizenga, who also owns the Dolphins, is still profiting handsomely from the lease, long after selling the Marlins. 
Huizenga receives an estimated 62.5 percent of parking revenue, 30 percent of profits from concessions and $2 million a year from the state of Florida as part of the $60 million in tax incentives he received to base the Marlins in Miami. 
Ron Castell, a spokesman for Huizenga's holding company, said the Marlins are "a fine tenant." 
Faced with an expensive lease, Loria appears prepared to cut costs in other areas. Earlier this year, the Marlins dismissed John Routh, who was paid $82,000 a year in his job as the team's mascot, Billy the Marlin. The Marlins replaced Routh with one of his former assistants, for less than half of Routh's salary. 
"The overall atmosphere around the club was to save as many pennies as possible," Routh said.
With a payroll this season of roughly $50 million, one of the lowest in baseball, Loria will be faced with paying higher salaries next year and, after a successful season, receiving less in revenue-sharing from the league. 
He seems to relish the opportunity to take on such issues.
"It's incumbent on us to continue to do all the right things," Loria said. "We also need to continue to show South Florida our commitment here is unwavering and solid."

HEADLINE: Citing Fairness, Lieberman Proposes Tax-Rate Changes 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Oct. 13 

 BODY:
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat seeking the presidential nomination, proposed an overhaul of the federal tax code on Monday that would lower rates for middle-class families while raising rates, sometimes substantially, for wealthier Americans.
 Speaking to about 250 supporters and onlookers at a rally by the Merrimack River here, Mr. Lieberman said his plan would "restore integrity and fairness" to the tax code by shifting more of the burden to wealthy individuals and companies. 
 The plan calls for lower income tax rates for individuals earning less than about $70,000 a year and families earning less than about $115,000 a year. In addition, Mr. Lieberman's plan would restore the tax on dividends and re-establish certain estate taxes, negating two changes central to the Bush administration's economic plan. 
"When George Bush tries to say, 'You Democrats are all just raising taxes,' we're going to be able to say, 'No way,' " Mr. Lieberman said. "We're going to make taxes fairer for all. We are going to fix the mess George Bush has made of our tax system and federal budget."
In addition to raising rates for higher-income Americans, the Lieberman plan would impose a 5 percent tax surcharge on individuals and families with incomes of more than $250,000 a year. The plan would also close some loopholes in the corporate tax code, including the use of offshore tax havens by American companies. 
Kim Pizolato, a teacher from Nashua, N.H., who attended the Lieberman rally in Manchester, said she thought the senator wanted to lower taxes but doubted whether he could. "I don't know how he can cut taxes but provide all the services he wants to provide," Ms. Pizolato said.
But Mr. Lieberman said that the new measures would together bring in an additional $900 million in revenues over 10 years, and that the tax code restructuring would simply shift the burden to higher-income families. 
In addition to his tax proposal, Mr. Lieberman released a book of campaign proposals on Monday, offering what he calls "a fresh start" on issues including foreign policy, domestic security and energy consumption. Later this week, he plans to propose a commission to study "corporate welfare," much like one suggested by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and modeled on the commission that studied alternatives to closing military bases.
The proposals came as part of a five-day tour by the Lieberman campaign of early primary states, including Oklahoma, South Carolina, Florida and Michigan. The tour, focusing on the theme "Leading With Integrity," is an effort to put distance between Mr. Lieberman and his Democratic rivals and to lift him from a pack of second-tier candidates. 
The campaign has begun to make Mr. Lieberman, or at least his reputation for being "the conscience of the Senate," as some supporters call him, as much the issue as his ideas for the economy and rebuilding Iraq.
In the last two weeks, Mr. Lieberman has attacked President Bush for what he says are the president's failures to keep promises made during the 2000 campaign and, after taking office, for giving favors to special interests like energy companies. 
As president, Mr. Lieberman said, "I will do everything I can to make sure that there will never be distrust in my motives."
He added, "My only interest will be the nation's interest."
Other Democratic candidates have proposed tax changes. Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri have called for repealing all of the Bush administration's cuts.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, as well as Mr. Lieberman, have said they would repeal the cuts for the wealthiest Americans but retain the benefits for the middle class.
The plan announced on Monday by Mr. Lieberman went further. He would raise the top tax bracket to 39.6 percent from 33 percent for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $143,500. A family with adjusted gross income of more than $150,000 could see its rate rise to 39.6 percent from 28 percent.
But many others would see their taxes fall, Mr. Lieberman said. The tax rate for a married couple earning $50,000 would fall to 12.5 percent from 15 percent currently, saving the family up to $1,000. Couples earning $75,000 could see their taxes decline by $1,500, he said, and couples earning $100,000 could expect to save up to $2,000.

HEADLINE: China's More Nuanced Diplomacy 

 BODY:
In a few days, President Bush will fly to Asia for a week of diplomacy. Fighting terrorism, thwarting North Korea's nuclear ambitions and promoting trade will head his agenda. Yet all his meetings will be shaped, to some degree, by the rise of China as a dominant Asian power. In that regard, one of this year's more encouraging developments has been the more nuanced and constructive diplomatic style of China's new leadership under President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. 
 The effects have been seen from North Korea, which China has tried to nudge toward nuclear sanity, to Southeast Asia, where China has gone from bullying its neighbors over control of a group of small islands in the South China Sea to wooing them with expanded business relations and people-to-people exchanges. There has also been a welcome flexibility in Hong Kong, where a repressive new security law was withdrawn after popular protests. Mr. Bush's trip will take him to a region trying to make sense of this new tone. 
 Some of the positive shifts may not be permanent. China, which has cruelly disappointed Western optimists before, has not renounced its claim to the disputed islands. It has declared only a pause in its efforts to impose sovereignty. And resource-rich neighbors, like Indonesia, are well aware that Beijing believes that securing guaranteed access to their raw materials is essential to its continued economic growth. Further, a redrafted Hong Kong security law is likely to be reintroduced later. 
President Hu and Prime Minister Wen took office earlier this year and are still maneuvering to consolidate their authority. They will undoubtedly face challenges from more nationalist and ideological Communist Party politicians, some of them associated with the still-powerful former leader, Jiang Zemin. Thus far, however, the new leaders have regularly associated themselves with more pragmatic domestic policies and more responsible international behavior. 
This new emphasis comes at a critical time, when Beijing is finally coming close to fulfilling its ambition of being one of the modern world's great powers. It is already a political leader in East Asia and an engine of global economic growth. 
For years, Chinese leaders have debated whether Beijing should exercise its new power in the classic 19th-century imperial way, with privileged Asian spheres of influence, or in the more modern manner, with successful economic competition in an open and globalized world. Based on the limited evidence of the past few months, Mr. Hu's instincts appear to lie in the second direction.
Mr. Bush will get a chance to reach his own evaluation of Mr. Hu and his policies when the two meet at an economic conference in Thailand early next week. Americans have a considerable interest in the diplomatic sophistication of China's new leaders. Washington has long been the leading international power in the Asia-Pacific region. An economically resurgent China is certain to increase its influence over the coming decade. Yet China's gains need not come at America's expense. Mr. Hu's more responsible approach to foreign relations deserves American recognition and encouragement.

HEADLINE: Intelligence Puzzle: North Korean Bombs 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
New intelligence estimates that North Korea may have produced one or two nuclear weapons in recent months -- or perhaps more -- have immersed the administration in another internal debate about the quality of intelligence about illegal weapons.
 With President Bush just days from embarking on his longest foray in Asia, some of his advisers say it is possible that North Korea is telling the truth about having turned 8,000 nuclear fuel rods into enough weapons-grade plutonium for several warheads. 
 Others, including more cautious intelligence analysts at the State Department, say there is still no proof, and plenty of incentive for the North Koreans to bluff.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, in a series of confidential briefings, has taken a middle view: It has told Asian governments that North Korea has probably produced enough plutonium to make two new nuclear weapons, according to officials who took notes on the briefings. 
"When you add up the evidence, we have every reason to believe they've made two new weapons," a senior Asian official said. That would be in addition to the one or two that the C.I.A. has said the North probably made in the early 1990's. 
American officials caution that the international agency reached its estimates by reinterpreting data from the United States, South Korea and other nations.
The international estimate concerned fuel and did not assess whether the North could convert it into a working bomb. North Korea has never tested a nuclear weapon. The C.I.A. assessment that North Korea built two bombs a decade ago appears to assume that the country had mastered the technology, but the basis for the conclusion is unclear.
Without fully embracing the international estimate, administration officials say American analysts have concluded that the North has turned at least an eighth of its nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium, and maybe as much as a third. 
What it all adds up to is that no one knows for certain how big the North's arsenal is.
President Bush vowed earlier this year that he would never tolerate a nuclear North Korea. But he has left deliberately ambiguous how he defines "tolerate."
Charles Pritchard, who resigned this summer as the State Department special envoy for North Korean nuclear issues, cast Mr. Bush's political and strategic problem this way:
"We've gone, under his watch, from the possibility that North Korea has one or two weapons to a possibility -- a distinct possibility -- that it now has eight or more," said Mr. Pritchard, who also worked on North Korean issues during the Clinton administration. "And it's happened while we were deposing Saddam Hussein for fear he might get that same capability by the end of the decade."
In June, evidence collected by American satellites and sensors that capture a gas, krypton 85, released during reprocessing offered up tantalizing hints that additional nuclear facilities exist. But intelligence officials were unable to reproduce those findings, leaving what one senior official called "a lot of suspicions, but zippo evidence."
The facilities are thought to be in the mountains toward the Chinese border, and perhaps in underground tunnels, making them less vulnerable. "It's the hardest intelligence target we have," one senior American official said, "much harder than Iraq."
For Mr. Bush, that uncertainty greatly complicates his trip to Asia.
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Scott McClellan, said on Friday that Mr. Bush's strategy had already "achieved important success," because the North has "agreed to multilateral talks, six-country talks" on resolving the nuclear issues. 
The administration's strategy relies heavily on pressure from China, which supplies the desperately poor North with most of its oil and much of its food.
Yet as Mr. Bush heads to Asia, administration officials are trying to put down a minor rebellion with a key ally over the strategy.
South Korea's foreign minister, Yoon Young Kwan, held a heated meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell last month in New York, demanding that Mr. Bush respond to North Korea's call for security treaties and a plan for gradual improvement in economic relations in return for dismantling any nuclear facilities. In a twist that angered Mr. Powell, the South Korean said his new president, Roh Moo Hyun, would not consider sending any troops to aid in Iraq unless the United States gave ground on North Korea.
Mr. Powell, according to several officials familiar with the exchange, curtly told told him, "That is not how allies deal with each other."
In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Powell declined to discuss the meeting. But, he said, "we have some ideas, some interesting ideas, about how we can move forward on providing some security assurances to the North Koreans that might open up some new possibilities" during Mr. Bush's trip.
Mr. Bush meets President Roh next week at an Asian summit meeting in Bangkok, along with China's president, Hu Jintao, with whom the United States has shared a tremendous amount of highly classified intelligence in recent months about the progress of the North's program.
Unlike Iraq, North Korea is not denying its efforts, but rather boasting with an enthusiasm that makes many analysts suspicious. Earlier this month the North Korean government said it had solved "all of the technological matters" for making weapons.
The debate over what is actually going on in some ways mirrors the arguments that unfolded a year ago over how to interpret contradictory intelligence about Iraq. 
Hawks in the administration, from the White House to the vice president's office to the Pentagon, argue that it is entirely possible that all 8,017 spent-fuel rods stored in North Korea since 1994 have been converted into bomb fuel. They note that when the North last turned fuel rods into bombs, in 1991, they went undetected by intelligence agencies for years.
Yet the Iraq experience has bred significant caution among intelligence agencies, now more careful than ever about overinterpreting the evidence. And, as in the case of the krypton gas, that evidence sometimes seems to appear, then disappear. 
"There are lots of ways for the North Koreans to scrub their facilities and reduce the amount of krypton that gets out," said a former intelligence official with long experience with the technology. "So measuring the gas output is a crummy way of figuring out how much plutonium they have produced."
Satellites have detected other suspected facilities, but that technology is also not reliable. 
"Our knowledge of North Korea is so limited that you have to sympathize with the poor intelligence analysts who have to make sense of all this," said Joel S. Wit, a former State Department official who visited a site five years ago that the C.I.A. believed was a new reprocessor, only to find a huge hole in the ground. "The ramifications of a screw-up are pretty big: that you've missed a second facility, or that they have reprocessed and we haven't picked it up. Either one of those is a pretty terrifying thought."

HEADLINE: Farmers Help Deliver Modified Crops to Brazil 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SANTO ANGELO, Brazil 

 BODY:
Brazil's decision in late September to legalize the planting of genetically modified soybeans may have infuriated environmentalists and some in the government, but it has caused much rejoicing and relief in the farming community here in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, where farmers have been planting transgenic soybeans illegally for years.
 Among those celebrating is Rafael Moreno, who for the last four years has been planting and harvesting genetically engineered soybeans on his 1,000-acre farm. "Everybody around here was doing it and it made economic sense, so I did it, too," said Mr. Moreno, 30, a resident of this sleepy town close to the Argentine border. 
 Such realities and the fact that Brazil -- already the world's No. 2 soybean producer, after the United States -- is working hard to become an agricultural superpower are crucial factors behind President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's changed stance on the planting of genetically modified crops.
Before taking office in January, Mr. da Silva opposed such crops. But now that he heads the government, he has to weigh the growing importance of agribusiness, which accounted for a third of the country's gross domestic product and 40 percent of its exports last year.
Farmers here expect the president's decision, which legalized transgenic crops for this planting season, to pave the way for more permanent legislation that would put them on an equal footing with farmers in the United States, Argentina and Canada, where gene-altered crops have been planted for years.
Mr. da Silva's about-face will affect not only Brazilian farmers, but American exporters and consumers from Stockholm to Shanghai.
"Now we'll be more competitive in everything -- not just soy but melons, corn, oranges, cotton," Mr. Moreno said. "So far, we've only been catching up, thanks to our favorable climate and soil."
When Mr. Moreno started planting the seeds, originally smuggled from Argentina, most of his farm equipment was at least 15 years old -- "more or less scrap metal," he said. But now, after just a few years, increasing returns from the farm have enabled him to replace all but one tractor.
The government's decision has also brought a palpable change in mood to a bustling tractor and farm machinery dealership in Santo Angelo.
Just five years ago, local farmers' margins were shrinking, and Wilson Pippi, the owner of Pippi Maquinas, said he was finding it tough to drum up new business. But then more and more farmers began planting genetically modified soybeans smuggled from Argentina, and Mr. Pippi's sales took off.
"I've been selling Massey Ferguson for 40 years, and I can't recall a more favorable outlook for agriculture round here," said Mr. Pippi, who also grows soybeans.
Unwilling to put his other business at risk by breaking the law, Mr. Pippi had refrained from planting genetically modified soybeans, but now he says he will and predicts most Brazilian farmers will do the same.
On a national scale, although only about 17 percent of the soy plants in Brazil's fields are transgenic, the country's soybean production has risen nearly 60 percent in the last six years, closing the gap on the United States, which is expecting a drought-diminished harvest in 2003. On Oct. 10, the United States said that Brazil was about to surpass it in soybean exports.
Santo Angelo farmers say that by planting the genetically modified seeds their average yield has already risen from around 30 to nearly 50 bushels an acre. 
"Unlike farmers in America or Europe, Brazilian farmers get no subsidies, so this is important in helping us compete," Mr. Pippi said. 
Too much genetically modified soy, however, could pose a problem. Brazil's top export market for soybeans is the European Union, which has introduced stringent regulations on the origins of all genetically modified food because of concerns by consumers. Domestic consumers could also prove resistant.
The stance in Europe appears to be softening considerably from three years ago, when genetically modified foods were described as Frankenfoods. But if Europeans continue to resist, "we will just have to look for other markets," said Amauri Miotto of Rio Grande's Fetag, a federation offarmers working small, family-owned properties. "There are plenty of poor, hungry people in the world who need cheaper food."
There is no reason Brazilian farmers cannot produce both conventional and genetically modified soybeans, said Carlo Lovatelli, president of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries, or Abiove, though he said they should be paid a premium for conventional crops because they cost $20 to $30 a metric ton more to produce.
Detailed labeling and testing required for export shipments will eat into the improved margins of those planting genetically modified soybeans. Farmers here, however, say those costs are marginal compared with the savings on herbicides and in time, because the fields of genetically modified soybeans are free of weeds and easier to harvest.
Environmentalist groups and many members of Mr. da Silva's Workers' Party continue to echo European concerns about genetically modified food. They are also angry at what they call a "sell out" by Brazilian agriculture to the Monsanto Company, whose Roundup Ready technology is used in the genetically modified seeds that have entered this region from Argentina.
But at the end of the day, Mr. da Silva had little choice but to overrule such opposition, said Odacir Klein, Rio Grande's agriculture secretary.
Nearly three-quarters of the state's soybean farmers have been planting the transgenic seeds for years. 
While it has been technically illegal to possess genetically modified seeds, only a handful of farmers have ever been prosecuted and only minimal amounts of the seed are thought to have been seized.
"Patrolling the borders is a federal task, and the previous federal government was always quietly in favor of genetically modified crops, so they never did anything, and the result was this consummated fact," Mr. Klein said.
Mr. Moreno agreed.
"Even if they hadn't changed the law, we all would have planted again anyway," he said. "What could they do, arrest 150,000 of us?"
If Monsanto were to offer him genetically modified seeds engineered specifically for the region's climate and soil, he said he would not think twice about buying them and paying royalties to the company. 
Monsanto, which has complained bitterly for years about farmers in southern Brazil using its technology but not paying royalties, welcomed the government's decree and said it hoped to find "an applicable solution" for past and future unpaid fees.
That is likely to be tough going. Here, at least, farmers have stockpiled seeds from previous harvests and now do not have to smuggle seeds. 
Mr. Moreno revealed a large supply of seeds stacked in his barn.
"There are 2,000 bags in there," he said with a grin. "But I only need 600 bags to replant my crop."

PERSON: Joel E. Segall 

HEADLINE: Joel Edwin Segall, 80, Economist And President of Baruch College 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Joel E. Segall, an economist and former president of Baruch College whose master plan helped make the business-oriented school a major presence in Manhattan, died on Thursday at a hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 80 and lived in Branford. 
 Dr. Segall, who earlier had a career at the University of Chicago and at the Treasury and Labor Departments in Washington, led the Baruch branch of the City University of New York from 1977 until 1990. With about 15,000 students, the college describes itself as home to the largest combined undergraduate and graduate business school in the country. 
 The most visible results of the master plan adopted under Dr. Segall's guidance are two centers near the building at 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue where Baruch was born in 1847 as a free public school of higher education called a Free Academy. The two centers are the Information and Technology Building, housing the Newman Library, and the 17-story Vertical Campus, which opened two years ago. 
Joel Edwin Segall was born in Bridgeport, Conn. He served in the Army Air Force in World War II before receiving his M.B.A. (1948), M.A. (1952) and Ph.D. (1956) degrees at the University of Chicago. He joined the faculty as an assistant professor of finance in 1952. 
He taught for 20 years at the University of Chicago Graduate School and eventually became director of its doctoral programs. He was also a visiting professor at institutions including the Royal College of Science and Technology in Scotland and Stanford University. 
In the early 1970's he was deputy assistant secretary for tax policy in the Treasury Department and deputy undersecretary for international affairs in the Department of Labor. An authority on corporate mergers, he was a consultant to the Securities and Exchange Commission when New York City's Board of Higher Education chose him to lead Baruch in 1977. 
He became a strong voice for keeping the college relatively close to the financial industry, in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. There it serves as City University's preparatory school for business managers. 
Dr. Segall is survived by his wife of 45 years, Joan Downey Segall; a daughter, Patricia D. Coughlin of Shrewsbury, N.J.; two sisters, Sandra Levin of Bridgeport, and Arlyne Segall of Trumbull, Conn.; and one grandson. A daughter, Jamie, died in 1989.

HEADLINE: Coca Culture 

BYLINE:  By Leonida Zurita-Vargas; Leonida Zurita-Vargas is secretary general of Bartolina Sisa, an association of peasant women. This article was written with Maria Cristina Caballero, a Colombian journalist and fellow at Harvard's Center for Public Leadership.

DATELINE: COCHABAMBA, Bolivia 

 BODY:
There has been rioting in Bolivia for nearly four weeks now. News reports say that the riots have been over the construction of a pipeline to ship natural gas to the United States. That's true, but there's a deeper anger at work: anger toward the United States and its war against a traditional Bolivian crop, coca. 
 You see, because of the American drug problem, we can no longer grow coca, which was part of our life and our culture long before the United States was a country. This is why many of the people protesting in La Paz and other cities are peasants whose families have cultivated coca for generations. 
 My tribe, the Quechua, comes from the lowland jungles of the Chapare in central Bolivia. We are used to chewing coca leaves every day, much as Americans drink coffee. We sustained ourselves by growing coca for chewing and for products like shampoo, medicinal teas and toothpaste. We did not turn coca into cocaine; the chemicals needed for that are made in countries like the United States. Bolivia now allows us to grow a very small amount of coca, but it is not enough.
I am a cocalera. I owe my life to coca. My father died when I was 2 and my mother raised six children by growing coca. I was a farmer myself, growing coca for traditional purposes. But the United States says it is better for us to just forget about coca. In the early 1990's, Bolivian officials distributed American money -- $300 to $2,500 per farm -- and told us to try yucca and pineapples. But 60 pineapples earn us only about eight bolivianos (about $1). And unlike coca, yucca and pineapples are difficult to carry to the cities to sell, and they spoil. So many farmers returned to growing coca. 
Then in 1998, the Bolivian government announced it would eradicate coca farms through a military program financed by the Americans. Soldiers came to the Chapare and destroyed our coca crops with machetes. School teachers were beaten, and some houses were burned down. 
When I saw that, I couldn't be quiet. I helped to organize people village by village, and I became leader of a national association of peasant women. Eventually we were joined in our protests by other social movements and unions. We have continued to grow. Evo Morales, the head of the national coca growers' union, even came in second in the 2002 presidential election. He got 21 percent of the vote, while the current president, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, got 22 percent. 
I think Mr. Morales would win today. Bolivians have grown tired of Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's free-market, pro-UnitedStates policies, which have not lowered our high rate of unemployment. The president's willingness to build a pipeline through Chile to export our natural gas to the United States has made many more people join the anti-government protests the cocaleros started.
To me, real success in the war on drugs would be to capture and prosecute the big drug traffickers, and for the United States to stop its own citizens from using drugs. The war on the cocaleros has brought Bolivia nothing but poverty and death.
Now tanks surround the presidential palace in La Paz. Fourteen people died in riots there on Monday alone. Unless the United States and its allies like Mr. Sanchez de Lozada stop their war against us, Bolivia will have neither peace nor a future.

HEADLINE: What Can a Million Buy in Manhattan? Something Average 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
The Census Bureau says that the typical American household made $42,409 last year. At that rate, this family could buy an average-priced Manhattan apartment after just a little more than 21 years, if luxuries like food and clothing were skipped and entire incomes were forked over. And then there's the maintenance.
 The average price for an apartment in Manhattan was $919,959 in the third quarter of this year -- another record high -- according to the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, one of the most comprehensive real estate surveys. 
 In part because so many of the sales in Manhattan are in the seven-figure range, the average is skewed upward.
The median price of an apartment in Manhattan for the third quarter of 2003, the exact middle of all the sales, was $575,000, the Elliman survey found -- still no bargain for the typical American family.
This was the first time the average price cracked the $900,000 threshold. Buyers in Manhattan apparently shrugged at concerns about the economy; that $916,959 average surpassed the previous high of $894,617 set in the second quarter of 2001. 
This record represents a rebound for Manhattan apartments. During the weakest period in the last five years -- the first quarter of 2002 -- the average price was $788,256.
"There are few places in the country where it might make sense to pay such prices," said Dr. James. W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "If you're in the middle of a cornfield in the Midwest, you're going to have a hard time finding someone to resell to. The rich are only willing to buy and live in a few select locations and -- obviously -- Manhattan is one of them."
Those who have never experienced the cold shower of looking for a home in Manhattan might think that $900,000 would buy a fancy five-bedroom apartment with gold-plated faucets, free maid service and one of those concierges who gets you tickets to "The Producers."
Well, here's the cold shower. Do a quick search of The New York Times on the Web's current sales listings and look for places in the same areas the survey covered: below West 116th Street and below East 96th Street. Yesterday you would have found a dozen apartments for sale for $900,000. There is one three-bedroom apartment, eight two-bedrooms, two one-bedrooms and one place where the new owners will have to build their own bedroom walls.
To be sure, these are very fancy one-bedroom apartments. One of the units listed for sale, a condominium on West 37th Street, was designed by its Italian architect/owner. Another, on East 73rd Street, has two fireplaces and really high ceilings.
So how come there are so many people willing to pay that much for a box in the sky? Real estate professionals say there has been a continuing crunch in the number of available apartments and a significant bounce in the luxury market ("luxury" here, of course, is defined as amounts resembling the G.D.P.'s of small Caribbean nations). 
"All this occurred despite lingering trepidation over local, national and international economic conditions," said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, which prepared the Elliman report.
Even billionaires feel bear markets.
"Clearly, Manhattan is linked to the health of the stock market," Dr. Hughes said. "And so, the stock market rally of the last six months has certainly improved the financial wherewithal of many affluent households."
The record price of $919,959 was an 8 percent jump from the $849,013 the average apartment sold for in the third quarter of 2002.
That median price of $575,000 for a Manhattan apartment was unchanged from the previous quarter, but up by 10.8 percent over the median price of $519,000 during the third quarter of last year.
The report is based on 2,324 co-op and condominium sales collected from many listing agencies. Those totals represented an increase of 13.1 percent over the 2,055 sales recorded in the second quarter of this year, and 3.7 percent above the 2,241 sales in the third quarter of 2002.
The stock market provided more buyers, but sellers were scarce. By the end of the third quarter, the number of available apartments had dropped to 5,224, 17.7 percent lower than the 6,346 units on the market in March.
Those sellers who did cash out almost all did well. The average price for studio apartments was $303,895, up by 17.4 percent from the $258,826 price in the same period last year. One-bedrooms sold for an average of $471,531, an increase of 12.6 percent above $418,607 in the third quarter last year.
In two-bedrooms, the average price was $1,073,966 (this doesn't make that $919,959 look so bad, right?). This was an increase of 6.2 percent over the average two-bedroom's price of $1,011,790 last year. 
The only sellers who did not hit the jackpot were those peddling three-bedrooms. There, the average price was $2,468,286, down by 3.3 percent from $2,553,537 last year.
For the lucky people in a cramped borough with an apartment that has at least four bedrooms, they got an average price of $5,698,266, up by 4.6 percent over 2002's $5,445,396.
The study also calculated changes in the luxury market -- defined as the top 10 percent of all co-op and condominium prices. In the third quarter of this year, that meant an average price of $3,461,532; a 10.6 percent gain over last year's $3,128,424.
Kirk Henckels, director of Stribling Private Brokerage, the luxury division of the brokerage firm Stribling & Associates, said that the most expensive co-op sale in the first half of this year was about $20 million. "That's versus the highest sale of about $13 million in 2002," he said.
And the party appears to be continuing. Mr. Henckels said that 2003 stood to rival 2000 for big-ticket sales -- at least 18 sales of $10 million or more. "It would appear," he said, "that we are about to equal the peak of the luxury market."

HEADLINE: Misguided Faith on AIDS 

 BODY:
In August, the United States Agency for International Development abruptly canceled bids for a program to market condoms to gay men and others in Brazil. When the decision was criticized publicly, the agency reinstated most of the program. This was the right choice. Preventing the spread of AIDS means working with the groups most at risk. 
 But the cancellation was just a recent example of the Bush administration's efforts to transform American initiatives abroad related to sex: AIDS prevention, family planning and sex education. Decisions about these programs -- which can mean life or death to the people who use them -- are increasingly not based on what saves lives, but on what appeals to conservatives at home. 
 Conservatives in Congress monitor the Web sites of the agency and its contractors for references to sex workers, gay men or drug users, and have forced the agency to discourage these projects. The right sees working with such groups as an endorsement of abhorrent behavior. But these high-risk groups are the most likely to contract and spread AIDS. To ignore them is to fuel the epidemic.
Condoms are also under attack. Bush administration officials have tried to remove international endorsements of condom use. President Bush's decision to stop the funds for any overseas family-planning group that mentions abortion has also effectively stopped condom provision to 16 countries and reduced it to 13 others, including some with the world's highest rates of AIDS infection.
Congress's appropriation for the president's AIDS initiative stipulates that a third of the money for AIDS prevention go to promote abstinence until marriage, a requirement that will strip needed funds from more effective programs. The Agency for International Development is increasingly financing groups promoting abstinence. Earlier this year, for example, the agency denied funds to a highly regarded AIDS prevention program in Africa to give the money to a consortium of evangelical groups whose proposal was considered deficient on the merits, but whose leader has links to an influential conservative in Congress.
While every good AIDS prevention program includes messages about postponing sex or reducing the number of sexual partners, the blanket advocacy of abstinence until marriage is a proven failure at protecting people from disease. The message has no meaning for gay men or for women who are forced by poverty into prostitution. In much of Africa, teenage girls -- many of them AIDS orphans themselves -- are coerced into sex by older, wealthier men. Knowing how to negotiate condom use could save their lives. The right's answer to AIDS is the sexual equivalent of "just say no," and is no more effective. It should not become the foundation of Washington's efforts to fight AIDS abroad.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Always New Joy to Be Found in Ancient Ruins

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
PETRA, that Jordanian "rose-red city half as old as time," is a spectacular place where a narrow, dark ravine suddenly opens into a vista of massive temples with Hellenic columns and pediments carved into red sandstone cliffs. It was the capital of the Nabateans, whose sophisticated trading culture flourished from the first century B.C. to the third century A.D., then vanished.
 "It's truly awe-inspiring," said Craig Morris, co-curator of a major exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History, "Petra: Lost City of Stone," which is to open on Saturday. "There are only five or six places this impressive in the world, and Petra is one of the top two." 
 A bit of a problem, really.
"That's one of the challenges of this exhibit," Dr. Morris said. "It's a real battle to get the impressiveness of it. The scale is such that there is no gallery large enough."
The exhibit addresses this in two ways. One of the first objects to strike a visitor's eye is Frederic Edwin Church's huge 1874 painting "El Khasne, Petra," of the building known as the Treasury framed in the walls of the entrance ravine. The second is a kind of triptych of movie screens, in which the camera slowly pans across the reddish cliffs and buildings in an effort to show their size and scale.
(In fact, lots of people have seen Petra but probably don't realize it. Harrison Ford is chased through Petra in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.")
Tall and slim, with round horn-rimmed glasses, Dr. Morris may not be quite as combative as Indiana Jones, but he attacks ancient ruins with comparable zest.
"Archaeology is completely and totally in my blood," said Dr. Morris, 64, whose formal title at the museum is senior vice president and dean of science, curator, department of anthropology. His co-curator is Glenn Markoe of the Cincinnati Art Museum, which has one of the most extensive collections of Nabatean sculpture outside Jordan.
On his first field trip as a young anthropology graduate student at the University of Chicago, Dr. Morris discovered that "archaeological fieldwork was absolute paradise."
"You get to work in the sun and dig things up," he said.
He grew up in Kentucky and attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where he said he was "interested in absolutely everything," graduating in 1961. He also took part in the early days of the civil rights movement with black students from nearby Fisk University. White students sat in the segregated back seats of city buses, blacks up front.
"The whole idea was to give the impression of an integrated bus," he recalled.
AT Chicago, he came across the doctoral dissertation of John Victor Murra, "The Economic Organization of the Inca State." He stayed up all night reading.
Later, he went to Peru for a dig, where Dr. Murra himself picked him up in his old Buick and they went for a lunch of, he still remembers, ceviche, corn, sweet potatoes and piquante de pollo.
"You go to a country and you can either be taken by it or repelled," he said. "Peru was truly love at first sight and I have a passion for excavating it."
Dr. Morris even keeps an apartment and car in Lima, ready for his excavations. He taught for seven years at Brandeis University and had just been granted tenure -- and spent six months renovating a cottage in Wellesley, Mass. -- when his dream job at the museum came open in 1975.
"My housewarming and my going-away party, that was the same event," he said.
He has lived for years on Gay Street in Greenwich Village, where his next-door neighbor was the radical lawyer William Kunstler, who sometimes attracted unwanted attention.
"He was a great neighbor," Dr. Morris said. "But once I got a rock through my window by mistake."
The Incas are Dr. Morris's specialty, and so it should be noted that he rates an ancient Incan city, Machu Picchu, above Petra. He has also made extensive excavations at another city, Huanuco Pampa, unearthing, as it were, evidence that beer occupied a fraternity-size role in Incan civilization.
Like the Petra exhibit, his studies focus on the interrelationship among economics, religion and culture in shaping a civilization. The Nabateans, at their height, controlled the trade routes for incense, spice, cotton, silk and ivory between China and India to the east, and Egypt and Greece to the west. The emperor Trajan took Petra into the Roman Empire for three centuries beginning in A.D. 106. An earthquake wrecked the city in A.D. 363 and it never recovered.
The Byzantine Empire ruled in the fifth and sixth centuries with enough vitality left to build several fine churches. But the city was eventually abandoned, only to be "discovered" in the mid-19th century by Westerners like Mr. Church and the British traveler David Roberts, whose lithographs hang on the walls of many Middle East hands.
"We're looking at the rise and fall of the Nabateans, how they went from a relatively nomadic people to a great trading people," Dr. Morris said, recalling a seminal course at Chicago that explored "why civilizations arise, why in some places civilization flourishes and in others it doesn't, and how they all inevitably come to an end."

HEADLINE: Clark Wants Civilian Reserve To Provide National Service 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark called yesterday for a national service program, envisioning a voluntary civilian reserve that would allow people to be activated in times of national need.
 General Clark, who is retired from the Army, was the latest Democrat to embrace the concept of national service. Under his proposal, people would register their skills and talents and be on call for five years. A tour of service would be six months. 
 "I believe the call to service is the highest calling any American can answer," he said to an enthusiastic and overflowing audience at Hunter College in Manhattan, "that your time and talent and energy are the greatest gifts you can give your country."
Tasks would include helping after an earthquake or forest fire in the United States. Overseas, volunteers might help a nascent democracy trying to establish a constitution.
The speech was the first of four major addresses by General Clark -- the others are on health care, the economy and national security -- that he plans to give over the next month to define his candidacy and try to distinguish it from that of his eight rivals for the Democratic nomination. General Clark criticized President Bush yesterday for allowing Congress to cut the budget for AmeriCorps, a volunteer service program started under President Bill Clinton as a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.
He said his service plan would allow Americans to donate their skills for six months into established and coordinated programs run by nonprofit organizations, nongovernmental organizations or the government. They would receive the same health care coverage as the National Guard and would be able to return to their jobs.
General Clark was on active duty for 34 years and has made the call to service a cornerstone of his presidential candidacy, which began 28 days ago.
But his character has been questioned by some top military officials, notably Gen. Hugh Shelton, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said at a forum in California last month that he had reservations about General Clark's character and integrity. General Shelton has declined to elaborate.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat who has helped spearhead support for General Clark, accused General Shelton yesterday of "character assassination." Speaking to reporters as the audience in a Hunter College auditorium waited for General Clark to appear, Mr. Rangel said, "For someone to say this and not to specifically identify what those problems were, I have no respect for that type of character assassination."
He added that the real "character defect" was in a person who would allude to such faults but not explain them.
General Shelton did not return a phone call yesterday and has declined repeated requests to explain his comments.
National service programs have been especially popular with Democratic presidential candidates. Senator John Edwards of North Carolina has proposed a community corps for high school students that would give grants to states that require students to participate in some form of community service to graduate.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has called for a similar high school program as well as a chance for college students to earn the equivalent of their state's four-year public college tuition in exchange for two years of service.
General Clark's plan would allow the president to call up 5,000 people for national emergencies.
In the Senate, John McCain, the maverick Republican of Arizona, who spoke repeatedly of such service during his unsuccessful 2000 presidential campaign, has joined with two Democrats, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Evan Bayh of Indiana, to introduce a national service program. But that effort has stalled as Republicans in Congress have been highly critical of AmeriCorps, saying the agency was poorly managed and lacked financial controls. AmeriCorps members serve up to a year and receive a $4,725 educational stipend for performing tasks like cleaning parks or teaching at-risk children.

HEADLINE: Calling for Reconciliation, New Liberian Leader Takes Office 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Urging forgiveness and rebuking lawlessness, Charles Gyude Bryant, a businessman, took power on Tuesday afternoon, charged with leading a government of national reconciliation for this war-weary nation.
 "The war is over, my people -- never again," Mr. Bryant announced in the rotunda of the National Assembly, packed with United Nations officials, rebel leaders in suits and the presidents of Nigeria and Ghana. "Those grievances that motivated you to take up arms against your own people and government are now on the political table. You have been brought into the government." 
 Mr. Bryant, who once sold tugboats to the Liberian Port Authority, was chosen in August by representatives of Liberia's warring factions to serve as chairman of an interim government until elections are held in 2005. His formidable first task is to cobble together a coalition cabinet composed of people loyal to the former Liberian warlord-turned-president, Charles G. Taylor, and the two armed guerrilla groups that sought to oust him. Rebuilding a battered, war-weary nation comes next.
"What we are asking is for each of us to look into the mirror," Mr. Bryant said, "see the enemy in us and show some willingness to forgive brother and sister."
Mr. Bryant laid out an ambitious agenda for reconstruction, intended both to drum up popular support at home and draw much needed development aid from abroad. He promised to end "a denigrating politics of patronage and tribalism," to comb the country for weapons and to set up an independent judiciary. Then, to resounding applause, he vowed to take action to lower the prices of rice and fuel.
Greed and conflict have reduced Liberia's three million citizens to among the most destitute in the world, despite the country's rich trove of rubber, timber, gold and iron ore. Founded by former American slaves more than 150 years ago, Liberia has known little but on-and-off war for the past 14 years. Unemployment is estimated to hover at around 85 percent, and a third of its people are believed to have been displaced from their homes.
Mr. Taylor ceded power on Aug. 11 to his vice president, Moses Z. Blah, who stepped down on Tuesday afternoon to make way for the new government.
Mr. Taylor's departure had been hastened by mounting international pressure, a pinching economic embargo and two separate rebel movements, supported by neighboring Guinea and Ivory Coast.
Mr. Taylor, currently in exile in southeastern Nigeria, has been charged with war crimes by a United Nations-backed tribunal. 
In his first statement since leaving his country, Mr. Taylor pledged his support for Mr. Bryant. He denied charges by United Nations officials that he continues to meddle in Liberian affairs. "I pledge my all to peace and the peace-building process now unfolding in Liberia," he said. "This is my native land where I have to return one day, live, die and be buried."
Among the guests at the inauguration ceremony was the former first lady, Jewel Taylor, who sat on the dais with the other dignitaries, fanning herself. 
Asked whether her husband still intended to return, Mrs. Taylor said they were not discussing it. "Let's see how the indictment goes," she said, referring to the war crimes charges. "If the indictment is dropped, he is a freeman. I pray for that."

HEADLINE: Study Says Lighter Cars Would Cost More Lives 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Federal regulators, poised to overhaul fuel economy rules, released a study on Tuesday that asserts that reducing vehicle weights would have a deadly effect over all. But the study said that putting the heaviest Hummer-size vehicles on diets could save lives.
 The study also found that minivans and large four-door sedans were the safest vehicles on the road. Small cars had the highest fatality rates, though midsize cars were said to be safer than small and midsize S.U.V.'s, the report said. 
 The study's principal focus was weight. Though the weights of cars and trucks have actually been ballooning for a decade and a half, the largely theoretical study was aimed at exploring possible effects of changes to the fuel economy system. 
Later this year, the Bush administration is expected to announce proposals to rewrite fuel economy regulations for light trucks -- sport utilities, minivans and pickups. A reconfigured system, three decades after the oil shocks of the 1970's led to fuel regulations, would have a huge impact on future vehicles. 
The administration has an intra-agency group reviewing fuel economy regulations for light trucks, starting with the 2008 models, that includes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Office of Management and Budget. The administration is considering an approach that would push slimming the heaviest light trucks but diminish such pressure on other vehicles. 
"We're probably not too far away from releasing a notice on our thoughts on post-2007 fuel economy," said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the traffic safety agency. "I would say weeks rather than months."
The report is the third on weight and safety by one of the traffic safety agency's top researchers, Charles Kahane. It will help form the underpinning of the administration's regulatory proposals, according to several people close to the proceedings, along with a 2001 report by the National Academy of Sciences. 
The industry has long cited the report as proof that regulating fuel economy has had deadly effects. 
"The study confirms what we've known for a long time, that the downweighting of vehicles has an adverse impact on safety," said Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which has the major automakers, except Honda, as members.
"Downweighting" is the industry term for reducing weight to improve fuel economy. Since the mid-1980's the process has reversed -- on average, cars and trucks have become heavier, speedier and, as more people buy big vehicles, less fuel efficient. 
The average car weighed 4,071 pounds in 1975, 3,013 by 1985 and now 3,408, according to E.P.A. data. The lightest cars have largely disappeared; cars of 2,500 pounds or less accounted for 18 percent of sales in 1985 but less than half a percent last year. Heavy cars and station wagons have largely been replaced by light trucks, whose weight has shot up from 3,840 pounds in 1987 to 4,569 today, according to the E.P.A., though that does not count vehicles above 6,000 pounds, like the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Excursion. 
Mr. Shosteck expressed reservations that less weight on the heaviest vehicles would be a good idea. 
By contrast, consumer groups and some researchers say the dangers posed by sport utilities to other vehicles are understated by the Kahane reports. They have criticized the reports as too focused on weight and not enough on size and design characteristics, nor on the fact that technology exists to increase fuel economy regardless of weight. 
Similar studies, underwritten by Honda, found that reducing weights by 100 pounds across the board, as the Kahane report suggests as a test, would save lives on balance. 
John W. Zellner, an engineer who is the president of Dynamic Research Inc., a research group that did the Honda studies, said reducing weight could be beneficial. 
"It's an energy management issue," he said. "If you are moving along at 60 miles per hour and you weigh two tons, in a crash you have to bring that two tons to a stop quickly. If you only weigh one ton, you only have to dissipate half that amount of energy."
"All things equal, if you have a large vehicle that weighs half as much, in a crash against a brick wall it will crush-in half as much." 
But other researchers agreed with the report's methodology. 
Dr. Adrian Lund, the chief operating officer of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group backed by auto insurers, called the study a "thorough analysis." "Cars apparently never get heavy enough," he said, but for the heaviest light trucks, "eventually there's a diminishing return on getting heavier and heavier and there's a significant cost in terms of damage to other people."

HEADLINE: Death Shares Commuter Tracks; 
New Jersey Suicides Illustrate Morbid Lure of the Rails

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
In Manville, N.J., last Friday a killer apparently tried to disguise his crime by placing the victim's body on the freight rail tracks, where it might be viewed simply as another suicide under the wheels of the 6:20 train.
 On Sunday in Morristown, Bruce DeHart, a construction worker putting in some overtime hours refurbishing the train station, noticed the hubbub around the station where a 37-year-old man had committed suicide by stepping into the path of an oncoming train. He thought for a moment that it was just another death of one of the homeless alcoholics who live in makeshift camps around the railroad tracks and occasionally meet their end there. 
 Two weeks ago, when the blare of an express train horn sounded, only to have the train stopped screechingly at the Short Hills station, Jim Cook, the attendant at the Citgo Gas Station about 50 yards away, knew immediately what had happened. 
And on Tuesday, a motorcyclist who sped around a railroad crossing bar in Hazlet, in an apparent effort to beat the oncoming train, lost the race and was killed when the train struck him.
There have been three suicides and one accidental death on the 975 miles of New Jersey Transit railroad tracks in the last two weeks. It began with an unemployed Short Hills banker who killed himself Sept. 29, and continued on Sunday with the suicide of James Thomas Kelly, 37, who was instrumental in organizing New Jersey residents who had been abused by priests. On the same day in Millington, a woman crouched down on the tracks in front of an oncoming train, a railroad spokeswoman said. The deaths continued further with the motorcyclist on Tuesday.
But rather than an unexpected spike in such incidents, they are a reflection of a morbid fact of life in New Jersey. Death on the tracks -- at the rate of about 25 a year -- is common enough that residents near the tracks can sense the cues and New Jersey Transit officials have a regular counseling program in place for engineers and other crew members whose trains are involved in what they euphemistically call "critical incidents," whether they be accidents or suicides.
"I've had three myself in 35 years of service, and I can still picture each one of them," said Bob Vallochi, general chairman of the union representing the commuter line's engineers. "I remember how I was treated then, when there was a more callous attitude of getting right back in the saddle. Now you don't have to just shut it out."
Engineers like Mr. Vallochi and Wayne Pierson, who has been at the controls of locomotives for 38 years, insist that the incidents are not increasing. It is just the reporting of them that is increasing, they say, now that the rail lines are larger and publicly owned and touch on more and more commuter lives in the state's sprawling suburbs.
And because the rail lines are so extensive, such "suicides by locomotive" or accidents are almost impossible to prevent, said Penny Bassett Hackett, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit.
"You cannot fence in a railroad," she said. "Plus a fence is not a deterrent to anything because if a person wants to access the railroad tracks, they can."
There were 27 deaths on New Jersey Transit tracks last year, and with the accident involving the motorcyclist today the number this year stands at 19, said Ms. Bassett Hackett. And lore among engineers nationwide is that the numbers increase rapidly during holiday periods.
John Tolman, the assistant to the president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the national union for the train operators, said that the problem of death on the tracks is a national one. He said the union, the Federal Railway Agency and the railroads are currently two years into a study of how to best minister to the train crews who suffer this trauma.
"And the commuter rail line is the primary place for people to commit suicide, largely because there are more frequent trains traveling at high speeds to populated areas," he said.
Each incident leaves its own sad residue.
In Morristown, where Mr. Kelly walked onto the tracks to be struck by a train early Sunday morning, Mohamed Ramadan, owner of Bagel Brothers, said that he didn't know the reasons behind the suicide, but offered his own curbside sense of a pervasive depression among his customers because of the economy. A group that once seemed more focused, hurried and directed seemed now more aimless and tentative.
"I have noticed a lot of my customers that used to come in and grab a quick bite to eat are now staying for longer periods of time because they just don't have jobs to rush off to," he said.
A way down the tracks of the Morris and Essex line in Short Hills, when Richard Josephs, an unemployed banker, stepped in front of a train near the Short Hills station Sept. 29 after strangling his 7-year-old son, people assumed the stresses of the economy were to blame. Mr. Cook, the gas station attendant, was still mystified by such a tragedy "in this day and age when all you need to do is throw up your hands and say, 'Help,' " in order to get counseling and assistance.
The train station in Millington on the Somerset-Morris County border is the Millington Station Cafe, a coffee shop in a small, gray stone building whose eight windows are decorated with flower boxes sporting fuschia and white blooms. It was near the station on Sunday morning that Veronica Henderson, 53, a Basking Ridge resident, crouched down on the tracks in front of a New Jersey Transit train, according to Ms. Bassett Hackett.
Melissa Ferrera, 19, a waitress at the station cafe for the last three years, was visibly troubled by the incident and found herself wondering if Ms. Henderson had been among the so many anonymous faces she waited on. Everyone was shocked and concerned, she said, adding that even the train horns had a different sound that day.
"They seemed more melancholy," she said.

Despite amutual fund scandal, Bank of America reports a sharply higher profit for the quarter.

BYLINE:  By Riva D. Atlas 

 BODY:
BANK OF AMERICA, under a cloud for its role in a widening mutual fund trading scandal, reported a strong profit yesterday, helped by continuing demand for home loans.
 It also set aside $100 million to cover costs related to the investigation of the bank's fund business by the New York attorney general and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consumers have not pulled much money from the bank's mutual funds since the regulatory inquiry became public last month, although its chief financial officer, James H. Hance Jr., conceded yesterday that it might be too early to declare victory on this front. 
 The bank will probably experience a slowdown in mortgage lending in coming quarters, Mr. Hance said. But he is optimistic that a stronger economy will revive other businesses, like corporate lending. 
 "Our mortgage business will be reduced, but other things will take its place," he said in an interview yesterday.
 Bank of America's profit rose more than 30 percent in the third quarter from a year ago. Net income was $2.92 billion, or $1.92 a share, up from $2.24 billion, or $1.45 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results exceeded the estimates of stock analysts, who had anticipated $1.69 a share, according to Thomson First Call.
 The report sent the bank's stock up 76 cents yesterday, to close at $82.50 a share.
 Some of the improvement could be attributed to a decline of $125 million in its allowance for loan losses. The bank said that its nonperforming assets were at their lowest in three and a half years, an indication of improvement in the economy. 
 Bank of America also had large gains from selling securities and mortgages ahead of an expected rise in interest rates.
 Profits from mortgage banking rose 203 percent from a year earlier, but the bank and stock analysts cautioned that such gains would be unlikely in the future. Mortgage applications were down 50 percent in the third quarter from the previous months, Mr. Hance said.
 "The world just has to be prepared for them, and for other banks, to come back to earth," said Nancy A. Bush, an independent research analyst in Annandale, N.J. 
 The bank is hoping that as the economy strengthens, profits from investment banking and lending will revive and compensate for the mortgage slowdown. Investment banking revenue increased 32 percent in the latest quarter, as companies rushed to issue debt at low interest rates, Mr. Hance said. 
 But Bank of America has not experienced a strong revival in demand for large corporate loans. With rates coming off historic lows, "companies are still refinancing and paying off bank debt," instead of taking out new loans, Mr. Hance said.
 "There's a recovery out there somewhere, but it doesn't seem like it's visible in the fourth quarter or even the first quarter of 2004," said Ms. Bush, who added that investors had to brace themselves for "a couple of transitional quarters."
 The company's asset management division, which includes the mutual fund business, benefited from a stronger stock market. Assets rose 33 percent in equity funds and 17 percent in all types of investments. 
 Customers of thebank's mutual funds, known as Nations Funds, have held on since the attorney general's inquiry into mutual fund trading became public last month, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data.
 "I can't say I have seen much impact, if any," Mr. Adler said of the investigation.
 Bank of America said the $100 million it was setting aside would cover reimbursements to fund investors, fees for lawyers and a team of consultants hired to review the business, among other things. The reserve does not cover any potential settlement or fines, Mr. Hance said.
 The bank has said it will reimburse any losses to shareholders of its funds. It will also pay back any uncovered losses for investors in other funds whose shares were improperly traded through the bank by Canary Capital, a hedge fund that settled a New York suit accusing it of improper trading of fund shares.
 Mr. Hance remains optimistic about retaining customers. "Some institutions may be slower" to make a decision about their investments, he said. 
 "We're taking all the steps we can to correct the circumstances that gave rise to the problem and convince the customer that this is not how we do business."

Restoring a Landmark Hotel in Downtown Detroit

BYLINE:  By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The long-empty Book-Cadillac Hotel, which for half a century had been this city's leading place to stay, has been acquired by an arm of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation that specializes in restoring once-grand hotels in central cities and that sees a promising future both for its new acquisition and for parts of the surrounding downtown area. 
 The $146.8 million deal, which involves the extensive use of federal and state tax credits and other public funds, is the latest project by Historic Hospitality Investments, a company that began nine years ago as a way to offset Kimberly-Clark's corporate tax bill and has gradually evolved into an enterprise specializing in renovating landmark hotels. 
 Historic Hospitality purchases the historic-preservation tax credits that are often available to developers of older buildings, assembles the development team, and then oversees the projects from beginning to end. 
 The benefits are substantial, says Lynn Fournier, director of tax credit investments for Kimberly-Clark. "We believe cities are coming back and that there's long-term value in these assets," she said. "We also think this is a good opportunity for a socially responsible investment." 
 The company currently has six hotels either open or under development, all of which operate under various Marriott nameplates.
 The largest project to date is the $250 million renovation of two shuttered hotels in downtown St. Louis, the Statler and the Lennox. The two, across the street from each other on Washington Avenue, a former commercial street being redeveloped as a largely residential area, reopened this year as the Renaissance Grand Hotel. 
 In addition, the company owns two hotels in New Orleans and two in Houston. In New Orleans, it has the Renaissance Pere Marquette and the recently opened Renaissance Arts, which was carved out of an old furniture factory. In Houston, it owns a Courtyard and a Residence Inn that is being created out of the old Humble Oil headquarters building.
 The Book-Cadillac, while not the company's largest project, is one of its more ambitious, if only because of the complex financial deal it put together with the help of government agencies and the reality that the revitalization of downtown Detroit is still at a relatively early stage.
 A 33-story Beaux-Arts building at the corner of Washington Boulevard and Michigan Avenue, the Book-Cadillac was the tallest hotel in the world when it opened in 1924. The architect was Louis Kamper, an associate of Stanford White's who relocated to Detroit and became one of the leading architects in the city.
 The 1,000-plus room hotel, which included five floors of ballrooms, restaurants and shops, was named for the Book family, who built and operated it for many years, and Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, the French colonial governor who is generally considered the founder of Detroit. For the next 50 years, the Book was the leading hotel in the city. 
 "The Book was the place," says George Jackson, president of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, a nonprofit group that acts as a liaison between the city and private developers and was instrumental in setting up the current Book deal. "It was where presidents and movie stars stayed. Going to dinner there was a big event."
 The hotel, though, declined along with the rest of downtown starting in the 1960's and closed in 1984.
 Since then, the building has mainly just sat -- a boarded-up hulk at the southern end of Washington Boulevard, a blighted street just west of the old central business district that many older residents remember as a high-end shopping area. 
 Early in 2002, Detroit's mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, gave Mr. Jackson an ultimatum. "I told him he had until June 1 to find somebody who wanted to do something with the Book and if he couldn't do it, we were going to tear it down," the mayor said.
 Mr. Kilpatrick, 33, is notably unsentimental about the building. "I don't have fond memories of going to the Book," he said. "For most of the time I've been coming downtown, its looked the way it does now. The emotional connection I have to it is as a symbol of decay."
 Historic Hospitality, though, had already expressed interest in the building. It took a further 18 months to hammer out the financial details. 
 The financing package is notably complex. Historic Hospitality is putting up $21.5 million in equity. The rest -- about $125 million -- is a combination of loans from the downtown development authority, various state and federal tax credits, tax-free bonds and a small mortgage.
 Ground is to be broken by the end of the year and the project is expected to be finished in time for the 2006 Super Bowl, which will be held in Detroit that February. The architect is A. Epstein & Sons International of Chicago; Higgins Development Partners, also of Chicago, will handle construction.
 The refurbished hotel will have 483 rooms as well as meeting rooms and restaurants and will be known as the Renaissance Book-Cadillac Hotel. Historic Hospitality plans to redevelop the upper floors of the building into 76 high-end rental apartments. They will be the first new luxury apartments in downtown Detroit in many years. 
 "We are a brand that is about distinctive architecture and a sense of place," said Jurgen Giesbert, senior vice president of Marriott's Renaissance North America division. "The Book has those qualities. It is quintessential to downtown Detroit."
 The redone hotel, a few blocks from the Cobo Conference and Exhibition Center, Detroit's main convention complex, is expected to have a positive effect on the city's tourist and convention business. The downtown area currently has about 3,300 hotel rooms with more than a third of those -- about 1,300 rooms -- in one hotel, the massive Detroit Marriott Renaissance Center in the riverfront Renaissance Center complex. 
 "If you look at other cities the size of Detroit," said Bradley Van Dommelen, senior vice president of the Detroit Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau, "you usually find between 6,000 and 10,000 hotel rooms downtown. The lack of rooms within a mile of the convention center has been a drag on the convention business."
 Analysts generally are high on the project, despite the city's less-than-stellar occupancy figures and relatively low room rates. The year-to-date occupancy figure for the Detroit metropolitan area is 55.8 percent, down 2.3 percentage points from 2002, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate services company that monitors the national hotel market. The average room rate is $78. 
 Still, "there's a lot of good news for Detroit," said Melinda McKay, a Chicago-based senior vice president of Jones Lang LaSalle "They're experiencing a notable revitalization."
 The most visible signs of this activity are large civic projects. These include two new stadiums for the city's baseball and football teams that were completed in the last few years as well as an ambitious plan to redevelop the formerly industrial riverfront area into a recreational area modeled partly on Baltimore's successful Inner Harbor area.
 The city also recently announced a $20 million downtown streetscape improvement program intended to jump-start downtown development.
 In addition, several corporate relocations are buffing downtown's image. In the late 1990's, General Motors left its longtime headquarters on the city's northwest side and moved into the riverfront Renaissance Center complex. Since then, the company has spent about $500 million on improvements. 
 Earlier this year, the Compuware Corporation, a large software concern formerly based in the suburbs, moved into a new 1.3-million-square-foot building at the corner of Woodward and Monroe Avenues.
 "When we look at a building," Ms. Fournier of Kimberly-Clark said, "we also look at what's going on in the area. If Detroit wasn't doing all that it's doing to revitalize its downtown, I don't think we could justify either the time or the dollars for this project."

HEADLINE: The Secondhand Smoking Gun 

BYLINE:  By Rosemary Ellis; Rosemary Ellis is editorial director of Prevention magazine.

 BODY:
Six months into New York City's smoke-free ordinance, there has been a spate of criticism about the wisdom of sticking by such a ban. The most notable came in a roundabout swipe from none other than former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who declared during a trip to Ireland last month that Irish citizens should have the choice to smoke in public places. (Mr. Giuliani later tried to distance himself from his comments.)
 But if New York -- as well as other cities and municipalities -- is ever tempted to rescind its smoking ban, it should look at the goings-on in Helena, Mont. The citizens of Helena voted in June 2002 to ban smoking in all public buildings -- including restaurants, bars and casinos. Soon after, doctors at the local hospital noticed that heart-attack admissions were dropping. So they, in conjunction with the University of California, San Francisco, did a study to measure the potential short-term effects of a smoking ban. 
 Helena is a perfect place for such a study: relatively isolated, with enough people in the region (66,000) for a meaningful population sample, and only one cardiac-care hospital within a 60-mile radius. So it was easy to control the study sample and methodology: if you get a heart attack in Helena, there's only one place to go for treatment.
The study showed two trends. First, there was no change in heart attack rates for patients who lived outside city limits. But for city residents, the rates plummeted by 58 percent in only six months.
"We know from longer-term studies that the effects of secondhand smoke occur within minutes, and that long-term exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with a 30 percent increased risk in heart attack rates," says Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine who conducted the study's statistical analysis. "But it was quite stunning to document this large an effect so quickly."
It was also stunning to witness what happened next. The Montana State Legislature, under pressure from the Montana Tavern Association and tobacco lobbyists, rescinded the ban in December. The result: heart-attack rates bounced back up almost as quickly as they dropped.
The bottom line of Helena's plummeting, then soaring, heart attack rate is painfully obvious: secondhand smoke kills. Only 30 minutes of exposure to it causes platelets in the bloodstream to become stickier. When that happens, blood clots form more easily, which can block arteries and cause heart attacks.
Dr. Richard Sargent, one of the study's authors, points out that eight hours of working in a smoky bar is equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. In such an environment, other studies have shown, workers more than double their chances of developing cancer and asthma, and pregnant workers put themselves at risk for miscarriage and premature delivery.
All of which make Mr. Giuliani's comments particularly ill informed. In addition, despite the dire economic predictions that preceded it, the smoking ban in New York City does not appear to have drastically depressed business. From March to June, the city created 10,000 new restaurant and bar jobs, according to the Department of Labor. The state Department of Taxation and Finance's most recent report of alcohol and beer tax collections (which measures both on-premises consumption and retail sales) shows that revenues rose to $15.2 million this past August, from $14.4 million in August 2002. And although the tobacco lobby continues to finance a campaign claiming that New Yorkers are unhappy with the ban, a poll released earlier this month by Quinnipiac University reported that 59 percent of voters in the state favor prohibiting smoking in public places; another survey, commissioned in August by antismoking groups, found that 70 percent of New York City voters support it.
At a time when the city's budget is in tatters, smoking in public places also sets off an enormous domino effect in public-health spending by creating or worsening illnesses whose treatment costs are eventually shouldered by taxpayers. For all of these reasons, New Yorkers can't afford to be as easily defeated as the unfortunate citizens of Helena -- nor as easily manipulated by the tobacco lobby and the politicians who are in its pocket.

HEADLINE: Bush to Press Asians on Currency Rates 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush said Tuesday that he would press the leaders of China and Japan during his coming Asian trip to let the markets determine exchange rates for their currencies, taking the issue to the top level in the name of protecting American manufacturing jobs.
 With American unemployment high, politicians of both parties have been demanding that China let its currency rise against the dollar, saying that inexpensive Chinese exports have been growing at the expense of American manufacturing jobs for years. 
 The Bush administration picked up the cause late this summer after manufacturers and Republican lawmakers nationwide complained that what they called an undervalued Chinese currency was at the root of some of the 2.5 million jobs lost over the last two years. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow traveled to China and asked its leaders to stop pegging their currency to the dollar and instead let it float in the open market. But the Chinese refused. 
The Japanese are intervening and buying dollars whenever the yen threatens to gain too much strength against the dollar.
In remarks to Asian journalists at the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Bush said that he would raise the issue with President Hu Jintao of China and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan during the annual summit meeting of Asian leaders.
"I will remind them that this nation has a strong-dollar policy, and we expect the markets to reflect the true value of currency," he said. 
Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, later repeated at a White House briefing that Mr. Bush would be trying to impress upon these two leaders the importance of the currency issue.
But leading economists have warned that letting the Chinese currency float on the market could cause more problems than it solves. By keeping their own currencies low, experts say, China and Japan have helped finance the growing federal budget deficit with large purchases of Treasury securities. 
The White House has been pushed in part by Democratic lawmakers who introduced legislation in the summer that would impose import tariffs of up to 27 percent on Chinese products if the currency remained fixed. Like other critics, they contend that pegging the yuan amounts to currency manipulation. China keeps its currency at a fixed exchange rate of 8.3 yuan to the dollar, a rate that has remained constant since 1994. 
Leading Democratic senators, including Charles E. Schumer of New York, wrote to Mr. Bush on Tuesday saying they expected an annual report due on Wednesday to confirm that China was manipulating its currency by pegging it to the dollar and that they expected this finding to touch off immediate negotiations.
China has a trade surplus with the United States of more than $100 billion this year. Critics of Chinese policy say the yuan is now artificially undervalued by about 40 percent, which makes Chinese products even cheaper and American exports more expensive.

HEADLINE: Holding Our Noses 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I haven't written about Iraq lately because, frankly, it felt like shooting fish in a barrel.
 It was sporting to write columns opposing the war back in January, when the White House was conjuring enough Iraqi anthrax "to kill several million people," as well as hordes of cheering Iraqis casting flowers on our soldiers. These days, with that anthrax as elusive as Saddam himself, with the people we've liberated busy killing us, with the bill for Iraq coming in at $90,000 a minute -- well, criticizing the war just seems too easy, like aiming a bomb at Bambi. 
 So I won't do it. 
In any case, the real question that confronts us now is not whether invading Iraq was the height of hubris, but this: Given that we are there, how do we make the best of it? 
I'm afraid that too many in my dovish camp think that just because we shouldn't have invaded, we also shouldn't stay -- or at least we shouldn't help Mr. Bush pay the bill. Mr. Bush's $87 billion budget request for Iraq and Afghanistan is getting pummeled on Capitol Hill this week, partly because people are angry at being misled and patronized by this administration.
Granted, some elements of the budget (like much of our Iraq operation) seem too rooted in our own expectations. In northern Iraq, U.S. engineers reported that it would take $50 million to bring a cement factory in the area to Western standards. The U.S. general there, lacking that kind of money, found some Iraqis who got it going again for $80,000.
And people like those in my hometown of Yamhill, Ore., have trouble understanding why the administration wants to buy Iraqis new $50,000 garbage trucks. On my last visit, I was struck how Oregonians, seeing their local school programs slashed, resent having to subsidize Iraq. That resentment runs deep: the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows Americans opposing the Iraq budget request, 57 to 41 percent.
So my fear is that we will now compound our mistake of invading Iraq by refusing to pay for our occupation and then pulling out our troops prematurely. If Iraq continues to go badly, if Democrats continue to hammer Mr. Bush for his folly, if Karl Rove has nightmares of an election campaign fought against a backdrop of suicide bombings in Baghdad, then I'm afraid the White House may just declare victory and retreat. 
In that case, Iraq would last about 10 minutes before disintegrating into a coup d'etat or a civil war.
Couldn't happen, you say? We let Afghanistan fall apart after the victory over the Soviet-backed government in 1992. We let Somalia disintegrate after our pullout in 1993-94. And right now, incredibly, the administration is letting Afghanistan fall apart all over again.
If that happens in Iraq, American credibility will be devastated, Al Qaeda will have a new base for operations, and Iraqis will be even worse off than they were in the days of Saddam Hussein.
Hmm. Who knows? In that event, Saddam might return as the warlord of Tikrit.
How do we reduce the chance that Iraq will collapse? First, by holding our noses and passing the president's budget request for Iraq and Afghanistan. Iraqis I've interviewed are often suspicious of U.S. intentions ("You're planning to steal our oil!"), but they're willing to give us a chance if we can stop rapes and get factories open. Slashing that budget -- or turning it into a loan to be repaid with oil revenues -- would destroy the Iraqi economy and convince many wavering Iraqis that we are conquerors who are best dealt with by blowing us up.
We can also shore up Iraq by arranging an early transfer of sovereignty back to Iraqis, as Kofi Annan and others have suggested -- a move the administration initially sputtered about but now seems to accept. Sure, it may be only a symbolic gesture, but anyone who says symbols don't matter doesn't understand nationalism.
The greatest foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made over the last half-century has been its obliviousness to nationalism. Today as well, plenty of ordinary Iraqis would prefer to be misruled by Iraqis than ruled by Americans. 
Above all, to stave off catastrophe in Iraq, we must keep our troops there and provide security, for that is the glue that keeps Iraq together. I believe that President Bush was wrong to go into Iraq, but he's right about staying there.

HEADLINE: Pet Projects Flood Energy Bill Before Crucial Session Today 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
When a group of senior Republican senators gathered recently to promote their vision of an energy policy, they pushed a very junior party member, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, to the microphones first to discuss the benefits of a proposed natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the Lower 48.
 "It will be the largest project of its kind in the history of the country. Huge," said Ms. Murkowski, whose re-election prospects next year could turn on her ability to claim credit for winning federal aid for the proposed $20 billion 3,500-mile pipeline. 
 Ms. Murkowski is not alone among House and the Senate members who have personal stakes in the energy bill. The measure, which Republican leaders hope to break loose on Wednesday, is packed with pet projects, with total spending estimated by Taxpayers for Common Sense at $60 billion and growing. 
"It is just chockablock full of favors to the oil and gas industry," said David Alberswerth, who has been following the sections on public lands for the Wilderness Society.
The authors hope that individual projects and initiatives -- a reactor here, a coal plant there, a boost in the use of corn-based ethanol -- will help persuade lawmakers to vote for legislation that is encountering growing opposition. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, are scheduled to bring together the chief negotiators on Wednesday to try to iron out the sticking points.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, said on Tuesday that he had "warned the leaders in both the Senate and the House that they are precariously close to losing support on our side for energy legislation because of the reckless way with which they've negotiated the bill itself and for many of the provisions that may be included in the end."
But Mr. Daschle, a chief promoter of the plan to aid corn growers by increasing ethanol production, would not say whether he was willing to filibuster the measure if it had objectionable provisions along with the ethanol plan.
Broad measures like the energy bill can present difficult choices for lawmakers who have only an up-or-down vote on a final proposal that can include elements that they do not like coupled with one or two that are extremely dear to their hearts. Republican lawmakers and aides drawing up the plan have made no secret of their strategy to incorporate projects sought by lawmakers to build methodically a majority for the proposal and make certain that they can overcome any filibuster.
Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, a Republican considered a crucial vote on energy and environmental issues, has indicated that he would have a difficult time opposing the bill now that its authors have included an $800 million loan guarantee for a coal gasification plant to be built in an economically troubled part of his state. 
Strong backers of the energy plan are in position to advance their goals, as well. Senator Larry E. Craig, the Idaho Republican who is on the House-Senate conference committee that is writing the measure, is the chief proponent of a proposal to spend more than $1 billion in Idaho to build a nuclear reactor that could produce hydrogen, as well as electricity.
Representatives of interest groups combing through the measure say it would make available billions of dollars for other research and development and tax breaks for successful energy producers that appear to be ill timed.
"How can we afford these direct subsidies to these robust industries when we have record deficits?" asked Keith Ashdown, the vice president for policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense, who cited potential subsidies for the Alaska pipeline as particularly egregious. 
Ms. Murkowski and Senator Ted Stevens, another Alaska Republican, have made the pipeline subsidies a top requirement for their support of the bill, particularly when it appears that the authors will have to drop a plan for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, another priority of the Alaska lawmakers. But the pipeline has also become an obstacle in advancing the legislation. Though lawmakers have agreed to require a route that the Alaska lawmakers favor, House members and the White House have balked at a plan to provide the companies that build the line with tax credits if the price of natural gas falls below a certain level.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is the Senate leader of the energy talks, said on Tuesday that the tax breaks would not be in the measure, though it would offer loan guarantees to the pipeline builders. Critics have said the tax credits could cost taxpayers billions of dollars if the price of natural gas falls. 
Efforts to woo lawmakers with special provisions can backfire. In a push to win the backing of Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, Republicans writing the bill tried to satisfy his goal of restricting gas drilling on some public land along the eastern front of the Rockies. Mr. Baucus ended up objecting to the language, saying it fell far short of his expectations. 
"These provisions," a spokesman for Mr. Baucus said, "are almost worse than having nothing at all."

HEADLINE: In Japan, Bush Faces Tough Sell On Dollar 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Few political events in Japan generate as much attention as a visit from the president of the United States, and George W. Bush's two-day stay here starting on Friday should prove no exception.
 President Bush's primary goal will be to clarify Japan's commitment to sending troops and money to Iraq. Facing an election year in 2004, a growing chorus of angry American manufacturers and a growing trade deficit, President Bush may also put pressure on Japan to stop propping up the dollar by deliberately weakening the yen. 
 Unfortunately for American exporters, Mr. Bush is unlikely to win any tug of war over exchange rates with Japan. 
 Despite increasingly loud protests in the United States and Europe, Japanese authorities have been selling dollars to prevent the yen from strengthening too quickly. Nonetheless, the Japanese currency has risen more than 9 percent against the dollar since August, when fresh figures showed that the economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
 Yet Japan's recovery, like others in the past, is highly dependent on exports. A stronger yen makes Japanese goods more expensive overseas and cuts the profits exporters earn in dollars.
 American presidents, at least since Richard M. Nixon, have criticized Japan for relying too much on a weak currency and exports for growth. Several times, as when Mr. Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, American presidents have succeeded in persuading Japan to let the yen rise. But on the whole, policy makers here have stuck to their decades-old strategy, even though a stronger yen may actually help Japan's economy in the long run.
 "The psychological impact of foreign exchange rates is much bigger in Japan than in other countries, because in former days, we were much more dependent on exports," said Kosuke Nakahira, vice chairman of the Institute for International Economic Studies and vice minister for international affairs during the mid-1990's, when the yen rose to record highs.
 "It's partly an outdated psychology, but a very large amount of trade is done in U.S. dollars, so naturally Japanese exporters think of exchange rates much more than in the U.S."
 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has other reasons for shrugging off pressure from President Bush. His ruling Liberal Democratic Party faces national elections on Nov. 9, and a steep rise in the yen will set off alarm bells with voters. Foreign investors, who have been the biggest buyers of Japanese stocks this year, may also be scared off if a strong yen hurts growth.
 Mr. Koizumi has also pledged to end deflation in Japan by 2005. A stronger yen, though, may help deflation by bringing down the cost of imported products.
 Some analysts even suggest that Mr. Koizumi is politically shrewd for trying to weaken the yen now -- Japan has spent a record 13 trillion yen ($119 billion) buying dollars this year -- rather than in 2004, when Mr. Bush will have to face voters on the campaign trail. If Japan's strategy succeeds and a broader economic recovery takes hold, then Mr. Koizumi will be able to back off on exchange rates next year, giving Mr. Bush some political breathing room.
 Political survival aside, if Mr. Koizumi were to permit the yen to rise and the dollar to fall, this would do little to relieve the huge trade and budget deficits of the United States. Japan could import more American products, of course, but that would not halt the flood of cheap exports China is sending to the United States. Nor would it persuade America to import less oil from the Middle East. The fiscal deficit in the United States -- created in part by Mr. Bush's tax cuts -- is out of Mr. Koizumi's reach.
 But these factors should not let Japan off the hook, some economists say. Japan has for too long relied on exports to drive the economy rather than promoting consumer spending through deregulation, they say. An export-driven economy is fine for developing nations, they assert, but inappropriate for a mature, industrialized economy like Japan's. Japanese consumers would benefit from a stronger yen because imported goods would become cheaper.
 "The government always worries about producers, not consumers, even though Japan is now a major economy," said Akio Mikuni, a credit analyst and author of "Japan's Policy Trap: Dollars, Deflation and the Crisis of Japanese Finance" (Brookings Institution, 2002). "Japan's defense of a weak yen is like a kid who always makes excuses even though he has become an adult."
 By continually buying dollars to weaken the yen, the Japanese -- along with the Chinese and other exporting nations in Asia -- are even diminishing the power of United States monetary policy, some say. The Federal Reserve has been expanding the money supply to jump-start the economy and stave off deflation. But each time it does, Japan, China and other countries buy the dollars and park them in the bank rather than letting them nourish the American economy.
 "A stronger yen is quite damaging to the U.S. economy," said Peter Morici, a professor of business at the University of Maryland and a former chief economist at the International Trade Commission in Washington. "Bringing down the trade deficit makes all the difference between a jobless recovery and a full recovery."
 But for all the theater surrounding foreign exchange rates, political reality, not economic logic, will probably dominate Mr. Bush's meetings in Japan. Mr. Koizumi has been a faithful ally of America during his two and a half year tenure, and Mr. Bush is eager to win support for his plan to rebuild Iraq. To that end, Mr. Bush will not want to make waves for Mr. Koizumi, at least until after his party is returned to power next month.
 "Bush won't pressure Japan directly because they have to cooperate," said Hideki Naito, a foreign exchange analyst at MMS International in Tokyo. "There are elections in Japan and Bush wants to keep Koizumi in power." 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 16, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business yesterday about President Bush's plan to urge Japan to stop intervening in the currency markets misstated the recent Japanese action. The country has been buying dollars -- not selling them -- to weaken the yen. The article also misstated a word in a comment from Peter Morici, a professor of business at the University of Maryland. He said said a weaker yen, not a stronger one, was damaging to the American economy.

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
Fast Lane for President: 6 Nations, 6 Days, Safely

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
When George W. Bush arrives in Manila for a state visit on Saturday, there will be no time to luxuriate in Gen. Douglas MacArthur's old suite at the sumptuous Manila Hotel, the usual overnight spot for presidents.
 This visit will have no overnight. It lasts exactly eight hours, because the Secret Service will not permit Mr. Bush to stay past dinner in a country whose army officers are sometimes of dubious loyalty and where terrorist groups still strike with audacity. 
 But the Philippine government is not complaining. Indonesia gets the presidential presence for only three hours. It is all part of what one official calls "the trip from Al Qaeda hell." 
Even for a president who does not like to linger -- he once toured the square outside the Kremlin in 20 minutes -- this will be an extreme version of Mr. Bush's brand of high-speed tourism.
The visits, before and after a three-night stay in Bangkok for the annual economic summit meeting of Asian leaders, will reward two of Mr. Bush's most important allies at a time when terror groups still have a potent presence in Asia. The enforced haste shows how much Southeast Asia has changed from the region Mr. Bush's predecessors once traveled in so freely.
For 15 years, when American presidents visited Asia, it was to celebrate the region's dynamism and to marvel at the semiconductor factories and auto plants that sprang up like bamboo before the Asian economic crisis. 
But the politics of globalization, too Clinton-sounding to be a favorite subject in the Bush White House even before terrorism took center stage,
seems to be the furthest thing from Mr. Bush's mind.
Instead of factories, Mr. Bush is visiting Thai troops who recently returned from Afghanistan. 
When Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, briefed reporters about the trip on Tuesday, she described no new economic programs with Asian allies and never mentioned the trade deficits with China or a decade of stagnation in Japan. Mr. Bush, she said, was intent on putting "security at the heart" of the Asian talks.
"Economics and security are inextricably linked," she argued, citing what happened to tourism on Bali after last year's bombing, in which 200 people were killed.
The degree to which the security situation has deteriorated is evident to anyone who glances over the president's public schedule and compares it to how presidents have toured the same places in years past. 
In November 1996, President Clinton spent a leisurely few nights in the MacArthur Suite, with its commanding view of Corregidor, the site of the general's last stand in defending the Philippines. 
And in 1986, when Indonesia was under the iron rule of Suharto, President Reagan soaked in the sun on Bali, the resort island where Mr. Bush's three-hour meeting with President Megawati Sukarnoputri and Islamic leaders will take place.
The White House will not say for certain where exactly the meeting is taking place -- at a resort, a government guest house or near the airport. 
One senior official said the dispute with the Secret Service over going to Indonesia at all got so heated "that the whole thing had to end up in the Oval Office, with the president declaring that we are going."
All this has put Indonesia and the Philippines in the same heightened security category as Colombia, where the threat of attack by the drug lords forced the first President Bush to visit for only a day in 1990.
Thus Mr. Bush, not an ever-curious tourist, will see less than usual.
After a day and a half in California to raise campaign cash and embrace Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mr. Bush will hit six countries in six days. 
He arrives in Tokyo for what Ms. Rice today called "a layover" rather than a visit, though he is expected to eat at a restaurant with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. No doubt his host already knows what Mr. Bush told visitors today: He does not eat sushi. 
There are hints that Japan may contribute several billion dollars to rebuilding Iraq, but Ms. Rice said on Tuesday that the president is not going with his hand out. 
He would not have it out for long; he goes next to the Philippines to address a joint meeting of Congress there, the first president to do so since Dwight D. Eisenhower visited four decades ago. 
Then it is on to a state dinner at Malacanang Palace with President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who could receive a boost from a Bush visit.
He will be gone by sundown, off to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit talks and another state visit. He will sleep in Bangkok three nights, but that, too, worries security officials.
Two months ago, when Thai and American officials arrested Riduan Isamuddin, an Indonesian terror leader known as Hambali, he apparently disclosed plans to blow up two American-owned hotels in Bangkok during the meeting. 
The threat has been taken seriously, as have reports that shoulder-fired missiles may have been smuggled into Thailand. 
Hambali was the main link between Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah, the militant Islamic organization that wants to turn Indonesia, with the world's largest Muslim population, into an Islamic state. 
The number of his followers who remain at large is still a mystery. But they are the primary reason that Indonesia was initially scratched from the president's schedule, before some aides who consider bolstering President Megawati a top priority made their case.
"We need to show her support," one of the aides said. "We're just going to show her that support very quickly." 
When Mr. Bush leaves Thailand, he will spend the night in Singapore, dining with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and using it as a staging area for visiting Bali. 
Then it is on to Australia, which provided special forces for the early days of the Iraq war, and where Prime Minister John Howard has made the alliance with Washington a key element of his tenure. 
Past presidents have taken in the restaurants of Sydney or the wonders of the country. Not Mr. Bush: He cut the trip down to a visit to Canberra, a capital that is a bit like Ottawa but not quite as vibrant.
He will be there for just 21 hours, on his way to a day of fundraising in Honolulu, perhaps the only time he will make it to Hawaii between now and the election.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Propel Two Novelists Along the Road to Recognition 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
After Edward P. Jones lost his job last year, he hunkered down for months at his secondhand computer in an apartment cluttered with newspapers and discarded manuscripts. 
 He had never considered writing fiction full time before. Mr. Jones was the author of an acclaimed collection of short stories and the winner of a $50,000 literary prize, but he was also the son of an illiterate and impoverished mother. As a young man he lived briefly in a homeless shelter and learned to view a steady paycheck the same way that a drowning man might view a lifeline. 
 "To think about being a writer was to think that I had the whole world, and I really didn't, and I knew I didn't," said Mr. Jones, 53, who spent nearly two decades proofreading and summarizing news items for Tax Notes, a trade magazine, before he was laid off in January 2002. 
But he decided to dive into his first novel without much of a safety net. To his astonishment, his tale of a black slave owner, an aching and lyrical exploration of moral complexities, has become a literary sensation since its publication in August. Janet Maslin in The New York Times called that novel, "The Known World" (Amistad/HarperCollins), stunning. Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post hailed it as the best new American fiction to cross his desk in years.
On Wednesday his novel was selected as a finalist for the National Book Award for fiction.
"My goodness," said Mr. Jones, who was taken aback by the news. "My goodness." 
The rapturous reception to his novel has caught him entirely unprepared. When the first reviews appeared, he had no car, no cellphone and no fax machine to cope with the flurry of interview requests. Now he has a a driver to ferry him to literary events and a fax machine, all courtesy of his publisher. He has decided against buying a cellphone, fearing it could seem too pretentious. 
With his novel in its fifth printing, a national book tour will take Mr. Jones to the Barnes & Noble store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan Thursday night and to the Schermerhorn Row Gallery at South Street Seaport on Friday. 
On first meeting he seems shy and bookish, a plain-spoken black man with a salt-and-pepper beard and glasses that seem to dwarf much of his face. He describes himself as a melancholy soul who moved so often as a boy that he withdrew into himself, burrowing so deeply into his studies, his comic books and literature that for a while he lost the ability to make friends.
He grew up in Washington, in segregated neighborhoods and in hard times, experiences that friends and colleagues say have shaped his worldview and his writing. 
"He saw the world divided when he was very small into folks who didn't have jobs and folks who did," said Shirley Grossman, 81, a longtime colleague from Tax Notes and one of his best friends. "His feeling for the common man, instead of the guy who's gotten there, is very strong." 
His mother washed dishes and scrubbed floors as a maid after her husband left her, and she and her three children drifted from one place to another, moving more than 18 times before Mr. Jones graduated from Cardozo High School here. He was an English honors student who had to sign his mother's name to his report cards because she could not. 
A chance meeting with a Jesuit teacher who was riding a bicycle through Mr. Jones's neighborhood led him to the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. Several years later he met John Casey, the author of "Spartina," who pointed him to the University of Virginia, where he studied creative writing and received a master's degree in fine arts. 
In 1982, after bouts of unemployment, odd jobs and university teaching positions, he found the post as a proofreader at Tax Notes in Arlington, Va., where a steady income let him breathe easily for the first time in years. 
Later he received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, which allowed him to work part time while writing short stories. His collection, "Lost in the City," published by William Morrow & Company in 1992, was about black residents of Washington struggling to keep their lives and community together. It was a National Book Award finalist, and in 1994 Mr. Jones won the Lannan Literary Award; he tucked away its $50,000 prize for hard times.
Over the years he has remained somewhat solitary, somewhat eccentric and always careful about money. 
He never married and has no children. He spends much of his time alone in his Arlington apartment, writing, watching movies on video, taping his favorite television program ("Judge Judy") and reading from his enormous collection of novels and short stories.
Until recently, he said, he had never traveled west of Indiana, never had cable television and never surfed the Internet. He saw people using the Internet at the public library, but hesitated to try it himself. ("I never felt like I knew what buttons to push," he said.) 
What he has is an affinity for the past and a keen ear for the voices of ordinary black people, particularly Southerners who were swept up in the migration that carried so many people like his mother to big cities in the North. 
The stories in "Lost in the City" are set in the 1950's through the early 80's in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, where he grew up. "The Known World" is set in the 1800's. The thread that unites these books is a passion for overlooked people and places. 
"I was impressed sentence by sentence by sentence," said John Edgar Wideman, the novelist and professor of literature at the University of Massachusetts, who recommends "Lost in the City" to his students. 
"His particular background and experience is embodied in his work, but it's how he embodied it which is important," Mr. Wideman said of Mr. Jones. "He's a craftsman. He's an artist. I looked forward to him as a voice that would have something important to say about America." 
For his novel Mr. Jones populated an imaginary place called Manchester County, Va., which is 1840 had "2,191 slaves, 142 free Negroes, 939 whites, and 136 Indians, most of them Cherokee but with a sprinkling of Choctaw." Among them is Henry Townsend, a prominent black man, who dies and leaves his wife, Caldonia, 33 slaves. 
The story is based on an unsettling snippet of history that he discovered in college: some free black men owned slaves in the 1800's. Slowly over the last decade the characters took shape in his mind, particularly the figure of Townsend, a shoemaker who won his freedom and then bought his own people. 
Mr. Jones built this imaginary world in his head as he collected and summarized news about tax shelters, Social Security reform and estate taxes for Tax Notes. For 10 years he rarely wrote any of his novel, which was sometimes difficult to explain to his agent and editors. 
"I would say, 'I'm working it out in my head,' " he said. "People don't see that as writing. 
"But I can see the people and I can hear them," he said of his characters. "I would just go over and over and over it in my head. That's the most important thing, even before they have names." 
He planned to focus on people, not issues. But his characters inevitably explore the meaning of freedom in a society in which blacks and whites wrestle with the moral taint of slavery. 
Augustus Townsend, the protagonist's father and a free man, is sold back into slavery by white men who ridicule the notion of a free black man. John Skiffington, a white sheriff, fights for his own sense of humanity in a job that rewards cruelty, not kindness. William Robbins, a white slave master, loves his free black mistress more than he loves his white wife, but threatens to sell her into slavery to control her. 
There are also glimmers of beauty in this hard world. Elias, a runaway slave mutilated by his owner, carves a crooked wooden comb as a love offering for Celeste, a crippled slave who has never owned anything other than the food in her stomach and the clothes on her back. 
"It ain't much," Elias tells her. 
"It be the whole world," Celeste tells him. 
Mr. Jones completed the novel's first draft three months after he lost his job, spending a year living off his savings, two months' severance pay and six months of unemployment benefits. Early this year he received a comfortable advance for "The Known World" and a forthcoming collection of short stories.
He has not held a steady job for nearly two years and, for the first time in his life, he is not anxious about finding one. Mr. Jones still remembers the day his agent told him that he was getting a real advance for "The Known World" and the new collection of stories, so he could stop worrying about a consistent paycheck and begin focusing on being a writer. 
"It was then, I think," Mr. Jones said, "that I began to have just an inkling that I was worth something."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE PUBLIC MOOD; 
Taxpayers Are Restless On Billions in Aid for Iraq

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Wil LaVergne and Chad Cannon argue regularly about politics. But on Tuesday, over heaping plates of fish, shrimp and softshell crab at Poor Boy Lloyd's, a popular downtown lunch spot, the two men, co-workers at an air-conditioning service company, had a rare meeting of the minds. 
 Mr. LaVergne, a Republican, and Mr. Cannon, a Democrat, are strongly critical of President Bush's request for $87 billion to finance military and reconstruction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 "It might make me feel more comfortable if the money wasn't all supposed to come from us," said Mr. LaVergne, 32. "They've got all of that oil. I don't see why we can't use money from Iraq's oil reserves to pay for what needs to be done." 
Mr. Cannon and Shanon Courtade, a third co-worker sitting at the table, nodded in agreement.
"We need to support the troops," Mr. Cannon said. "And it'sthe Christian thing to do to repair the damage we caused there. But we could go and spend all that money rebuilding and then they just go and blow everything up again, because they don't have anything invested in it."
With the House and Senate expected to vote on the spending bill this week, the conditional support of the two men echoed sentiments voiced elsewhere around town and across the country.
Though the legislation is expected to pass both houses, many members of Congress, responding in part to constituents' complaints, backed amendments that would require Iraq to repay part of the reconstruction costs from future oil revenues. 
Senators John B. Breaux and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, both Democrats, supported one such amendment, though the Senate voted it down on Tuesday night.
Mr. Cannon said part of his discomfort with the large financial package stemmed from seeing so much need at home.
Louisiana, still feeling the effects of thousands of job losses over the past year, is facing projected state budget deficits. According to a variety of indicators, the state's public school system ranks near the bottom in the country in math and science proficiency. 
"So many people in our country are hurting, needing," said Mr. Cannon, 34. "I just hate to see so much money going to looking after other people, when we can't seem to take care of our own."
Not everyone shares his views. At Webb's Barbershop, Shan Charles, a salesman for Frito-Lay and a Navy reservist, responded to a barber's disapproving comment about the spending request with a quick retort.
Mr. Charles, 31, said $87 billion was "a drop in the bucket," adding: "Our troops are over there working hard, but everyone expects things to be fixed overnight. I'm not sure where exactly the money is going. But I bet there's a good reason for every single dollar." 
At Highland Coffees, just outside the gates of Louisiana State University, Dawson Bean, a minister with Campus Crusade for Christ, said he backed the bill mainly on moral grounds.
"We owe it to the Iraqis to restore a sense of justice," said Mr. Bean, who described himself as a conservative independent. 
As the vote on the spending bill nears, debates over its size and use are playing out across the country. At a town hall meeting this week in Spokane, Wash., Representative George Nethercutt, a Republican who supports the bill, fielded questions and comments on the aid package. 
Neil A. Beaver was one of few Democrats at the Spokane meeting. "The future of our country is in jeopardy," Mr. Beaver said. "Without a more detailed explanation, I can't support this kind of spending."
Glenn Bishop, an executive with the Boys and Girls Club in Spokane, said he supported reconstruction efforts, but added, "We've got to get financial support from other countries because we can't bear it by ourselves."
At Lulu's Cafe in San Antonio, Michael Behrens, the cook and general manager, argued that Americans were getting stuck "having to foot the bill" in Iraq. At a nearby table, Bill Sutton, from Orlando, Fla., and Paul Mott of Philadelphia, both sports marketing consultants, readily chimed in. 
"That $87 billion is about $86 billion more than I'm willing to give," said Mr. Sutton, 52.
Mr. Mott, 45, agreed. "I feel the same way," he said. "Not only do I not believe we have a plan for Iraq, but I don't believe there can be a plan."
Back at Poor Boy Lloyd's, the spirited conversation between the co-workers carried on throughout lunch. Though it felt good to vent, Mr. Cannon said, passage of the bill was probably "a done dealanyway."
As they prepared to head back to work, Mr. Courtade voiced a concern that had come up a couple of times during the back and forth, a frustrating sense that no amount of spending would ease the tensions in Iraq. 
"What's it going to fix?" he asked no one in particular. "We're probably going to end up back in there 10 years from now." 
"Shoot," added Mr. LaVergne, the only one of the three men who generally supports Bush administration policies. "As much of a mess as we're in, we'll probably still be there 10 years from now."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Connecting the dots from tax cuts for the wealthy to loss of benefits.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and a co-editor of The Journal of the European Economic Association. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
CONSERVATIVE and liberal political commentators alike have wondered why most Americans have enthusiastically supported two of the largest tax cuts in history even though most benefits will flow to upper-income families. Adding to the conundrum, in public opinion surveys Americans routinely express support for spending more on government programs like education, opposition to government budget deficits, and disappointment that the gap in income between rich and poor has widened -- all of which are in conflict with regressive tax cuts. 
 In the most extensive analysis yet available, Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Princeton University, gives a simple but persuasive explanation: "unenlightened self-interest." Middle- and lower-income Americans supported tax cuts they suspected went largely to the rich because they thought they, too, would benefit, if only by a small amount, and because they failed to connect the tax cuts to rising inequality, their future tax burden, or the availability of government services. 
 Professor Bartels analyzed a small battery of questions added to the National Election Survey, a poll of 1,500 people interviewed in the six weeks before the November 2002 election, and again in the month after the election. The survey turned up some remarkable results, which he reports in "Homer Gets a Tax Cut: Inequality and Public Policy in the American Mind." 
For example, most Americans will never have to pay the estate tax, yet 70 percent expressed support for eliminating it anyway. Support for eliminating the tax was nearly as great -- 66 percent -- among people who had strong reasons to favor keeping it: namely, those in families earning less than $50,000 a year who said that the increase in income inequality was a bad thing, that government policy contributed to differences in income, and that the rich pay less than they should in taxes. 
Changing the wording from "estate tax" to "death tax" only marginally increased support for eliminating the tax, so people were not fooled by the framing of the issue. 
Yet, Professor Bartels said, they were fooled. A separate survey sponsored by the Kaiser Foundation found that half of respondents thought "most families have to pay the federal estate tax when someone dies." Just a third gave the correct answer of "only a few families." (Only about 2 percent of estates are now subject to the tax.) 
Several polls have found that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were supported by a majority of the public, although, surprisingly, the tax cuts were not as popular as scrapping the estate tax. 
People who thought their own taxes were too high were much more likely to support the 2001 tax cut and to oppose the estate tax. Paradoxically, whether someone thought taxes on the rich were too low or too high was irrelevant to their position on tax cuts. Professor Bartels said a misconceived notion of self-interest explains these findings. 
Some have argued that Americans are not "demonstrating in the streets" over regressive tax cuts because they are indifferent to inequality. Yet the survey found that 74 percent of respondents recognized that the difference in incomes between rich and poor was larger than it was 20 years ago, and a majority of them considered this a "bad thing." Only one in 20 considered the rise in inequality a "good thing." 
Of course, views expressed in polls can differ from actual voter behavior. Recent election results, however, suggest that low-income people who hardly benefit from tax cuts that jeopardize government services still favor tax cuts.
Consider Alabama, which in September voted down a tax referendum championed by the state's Republican governor. Alabama's threshold for paying state taxes is the lowest in the country at just $4,600 for a family of four; taxes are highly regressive. The referendum would have raised the threshold to $17,000, increased the tax rate for higher earners, ended the state's full deductibility of federal income taxes, and expanded the sales tax. The revenue would have more than offset the state's record budget deficit, with the surplus earmarked for a reading program for elementary-school children, higher teacher salaries in at-risk schools, and college scholarships.
Lower-income families clearly would have benefited. Yet only 36 percent of voters in the bottom half of counties ranked by median household income supported the referendum, just slightly more than 32 percent in the top half. 
Professor Bartels, citing a 2003 Kaiser Foundation survey, points to "a good deal of ignorance and uncertainty about the workings of the tax system and the policy options under consideration." Sixty-one percent of respondents said they had not heard of President Bush's proposal to do away with the dividend tax. Even worse, most people said they paid more in federal income taxes than in Social Security and Medicare taxes, a confusion that has helped keep payroll tax cuts -- which would have stimulated job growth -- off the table. And only 29 percent of people thought high-income people would benefit most from Mr. Bush's proposal to speed up and make permanent the previously enacted tax cuts. 
Norbert Schwartz, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Michigan, said he thought the study provided "a powerful illustration of how the combination of low factual information and good political spin creates preferences that aren't in people's interest." 
Nonetheless, there is a limit to how much informing people can transform public opinion. Those who were better informed were much less likely than the uninformed to support the 2001 tax cut (although equal numbers of the most informed still supported and opposed it), but not less likely to support eliminating the estate tax. 
Providing information is also unlikely to increase support for budget discipline. In a survey experiment, my Princeton colleague Alan Blinder and I found that most people woefully underestimated the size of the federal deficit, although a majority considered it a serious problem. But when we told a different 500 people how big the deficit actually was, they were less inclined to say it was serious.
Larry Bartels concludes that "most Americans support tax cuts not because they are indifferent toeconomic inequality, but because they largely fail to connect inequality and public policy." In this sense, Homer Simpson had it backward when he said, "Just because I don't care doesn't mean that I don't understand."

HEADLINE: Bank of Canada Decides To Leave Rates Unchanged 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
Shrugging off calls from exporters and labor groups to put a brake on the soaring Canadian dollar, the Bank of Canada has for now shelved its policy of cutting interest rates to stimulate the domestic economy.
 The central bank said on Wednesday that it was leaving its key overnight interest rate unchanged at 2.75 percent in view of evidence of "gathering economic strength" in the United States and overseas. The bank cut the rate by a quarter percentage point at each of its two previous reviews, in July and September. 
 Canadian interest rates are well above the levels in the United States, where the federal funds rate is 1 percent. This gap has contributed to a 19 percent rise in the Canadian currency since the start of the year, damping Canadian export earnings and income from investments in the United States, which is by far Canada's biggest trading partner. According to Statistics Canada, the value of Canada's exports to the United States was 9.6 percent lower in August than a year earlier. The currency's surge has also eroded a recent advantage in labor costs north of the border. 
 The Canadian currency, known as the loonie after the loon depicted on the one-dollar coin, traded at 75.52 American cents on Wednesday.. The currency reached a nine-year high last week.
 Noting that 77,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost this year, Andrew Jackson, senior economist at the Canadian Labor Congress in Ottawa, said he was concerned that pressure on export-oriented manufacturers would slow the economy, as happened in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when the Canadian currency was also riding high.
 "With inflation under control and a strong economic recovery in the United States, the policy basis for having interest rates so far above United States levels escapes me," Mr. Jackson said.
 In an experience shared by many Canadian companies, the Haemacure Corporation of Montreal, which makes medical adhesives and other surgical devices, said last week in its earnings report that while revenue in the United States rose in American dollars in the three months to July 31, it declined when measured in Canadian currency.
 The Bank of Canada acknowledged in Wednesday's statement that foreign demand for Canadian goods and services "will be tempered by the higher value of the Canadian dollar." The bank said that it would closely monitor changes in the international economy and the exchange rates of major currencies. John Johnston, chief economist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto, said the statement "does suggest that the bank is prepared to cut rates going forward."
 But, he said, the benefits for Canadian exports from rising demand in the United States have tended to outweigh the costs of an appreciating currency. RBC Capital Markets projects that Canada's growth rate will accelerate from 2 percent this year, adjusted for inflation, to 3.5 percent in 2004, including a 5 percent rise in exports. Canada's economy grew 3.4 percent in 2002.
 John Murray, head of the Bank of Canada's international department, reminded a parliamentary committee in Ottawa last week that there was "an upside to a stronger exchange rate," in the form of lower costs for imported raw materials and machinery. Haemacure, the Montreal company, said that with most of its expenses and debt denominated in American dollars, the impact of the rising Canadian dollar was both positive and negative, with "the positive outweighing the negative."
 In an apparent reference to the slide of the American dollar against almost all major currencies, Mr. Murray, the central bank official, said that "fundamental and probably unavoidable forces" have played a large part in the Canadian currency's recent buoyancy.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rise, Backing Optimism 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Retail sales excluding autos rose for a fifth month in September and the August increase was bigger than first reported, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The gains supported estimates that the economy last quarter grew the most in four years. 
 Purchases increased 0.3 percent, to $244 billion, after a 1.2 percent rise in August, the report said. The Commerce Department had previously reported a 0.7 percent gain in August.
 Compared with September of last year, retail sales were up 7.5 percent, the largest 12-month gain since April 2000. Stronger demand is increasing orders to factories.
 The government uses retail sales, excluding autos and building materials, to help calculate its figures on the gross domestic product. Purchases of clothing and building materials led the September increase. 
 Including vehicles, sales fell 0.2 percent last month after a 1.2 percent jump. Economists had expected total retail sales to fall 0.1 percent last month, to $318.9 billion, after a 0.6 percent gain initially reported. Sales excluding automobiles had been expected to rise 0.4 percent.

HEADLINE: SMALL BUSINESS; 
Capital for CompaniesThat Aid Communities

BYLINE:  By ANNE FIELD 

 BODY:
As an experienced manager of call centers for a big financial information publisher in New York, Mark Wilson knew why turnover in the industry was so high: people tend to quit low-paying dead-end jobs as soon as something better comes along. A little extra investment in them might pay for itself by making them more productive, he reasoned.
 Like a lot of corporate managers with an entrepreneurial instinct, Mr. Wilson, 43, saw a business opportunity in what he perceived as a flaw in the way things were being done. Two years ago, he started Ryla Teleservices in Atlanta with a plan to pay employees of call centers a decent wage and offer them a clear path to advancement. "Iwanted to make sure they would feel respected and needed," he said. 
 But would such an undertaking make a profit? A lot of investors apparently had their doubts. A consultant hired by Mr. Wilson approached more than a dozen venture capital firms over four months about financing the start-up, and none showed interest. Then Mr. Wilson heard about SJF Ventures, a four-year-old venture capital firm in Durham, N.C., with a mandate to invest in companies that promise both a significant financial return and jobs for low-income people. Five months later, after reviewing his business plan and doing its own market research, the fund invested $700,000 in return for an equity stake. Today, Ryla Teleservices employs about 160 people, and Mr. Wilson says revenue, which totaled $4 million in the fiscal year that ended in July, could double this year.
 Whatever the state of the economy, small businesses are always scrambling to raise money. Mr. Wilson had the good fortune to stumble on a new source of financing, a rapidly growing breed of investment capital providers called community development venture capital funds. Almost unknown a decade ago, their numbers have grown to about 60 in 2002, up from 40 two years earlier, with about 20 more in formation, according to the Community Development Venture Capital Alliance in New York. Last year, they had $485 million under management, the alliance said. The funds receive their financing from government agencies, including a Treasury Department community development program started under President Bill Clinton, as well as banks, insurance companies and foundations.
 Unlike traditional venture capital funds, these newcomers generally shun high-technology start-ups, focusing instead on manufacturing and service companies that not only have a harder time finding money but are also more likely to employ low-income workers or be in poor neighborhoods. They also make smaller investments -- typically $200,000 to $750,000 -- than mainstream firms, which often make commitments in the millions of dollars.
 "Doing good and doing well at the same time is totally possible," said Lynn Gellermann, a partner with Adena Ventures in Athens, Ohio, which concentrates on businesses in central Appalachia. "We can make a difference and make money."
 For many of the recipients, the venture firms are a godsend. Drew Hannah, chief executive of Parker Guitars, a 12-year-old guitar manufacturer in Wilmington, Mass., for example, came up dry last year after two years of seeking venture capital from more than a dozen traditional firms. "They weren't interested," Mr. Hannah said. "We were too small, and we weren't in a sexy sector." Then he got together with the Boston Community Venture Fund, which was just five years old. It liked the fact that Parker provided jobs to people from low-income areas, and invested $100,000 in the company in two rounds of financing, the fund said. 
 That might be relatively small change, but while community development funds rarely make huge cash infusions, they often bring in other investors willing to put up considerably more. Boston Community helped Mr. Hannah attract a total of $2.3 million from nine other investors, both by example and by contacting potential participants. "We would have had a very difficult time raising that kind of money without them in the lead," he said.
 David Levine, the chief executive of Butterfly.net, a three-year-old company in Martinsburg, W.Va., that makes technology for multiplayer online games, had an even more lucrative relationship with a community development venture capital firm.
 First, he turned to traditional venture capitalists and raised $790,000, mostly from Walker Ventures, a firm in Glenwood, Md., that he had dealt with when he was running a previous business, to pay for coding, product development and salaries for 10 employees. After running through that money, Mr. Levine searched for more, approaching as many as 100 funds around the country, all to no avail. To make payroll, he borrowed from his father, who took out a $100,000 home equity loan, and accumulated $50,000 in credit card debt.
 Then, he heard about Adena Ventures. The fund liked the company's potential to fuel growth in the area and invested about $500,000 in 2002 as part of $1.5 million the company raised. "Believe me, there was no other source of financing in the country at that point," Mr. Levine said of the investors. With financing and marketing advice from Adena, he negotiated a marketing agreement with International Business Machines and doubled his payroll to 15. In September, he closed an even bigger financing package of $7 million with investments from Adena, Cisco Systems and several other sources. 
 In addition to advising the companies they invest in about a variety of things, including marketing, legal issues, hiring and stock-option plans, as mainstream firms do, some community development venture capital funds also offer consulting services to companies that they have not invested in. 
 Three years ago, for example, Pacific Community Ventures, a four-year-old fund in San Francisco, offered to give business advice to Rick Philpott, president of Moving Solutions, an industrial moving company in San Jose, Calif. Mr. Philpott, who had been in business since 1984, jumped at the offer. Pacific Community Ventures advised Moving Solutions to reduce expenses by renegotiating its lease and finding lower prices on staples like boxes, fuel and uniforms. The savings let him squeak by without layoffs, he said. On the firm's advice, he also hired a marketing specialist, who brought in enough new business to push revenues up to what he estimates will be $5 million this year. He also credits the venture firm with helping the company win a five-year, $5 million contract with Hewlett-Packard.
The granddaddy of the community development venture fund industry is the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation in London, Ky., created in 1968 as a community development corporation. Community development corporations, an outgrowth of Great Society legislation in the 1960's, were nonprofit organizations financed by the government that provided housing and social services in low-income neighborhoods. The founders of Kentucky Highlands, however, decided to move beyond those activities to introduce a fund to invest in and lend money to start-ups in eastern Kentucky.
 Other community development organizations followed and began making equity investments in the start-ups. In recent years, a new generation of equity-only limited partnerships joined the ranks of these community development venture capital firms, and now account for 3 in 10 of them.
 Just because the funds say they aim to do good does not mean their standards are lower than those of traditional venture firms. Companies seeking financing must submit business plans, as they would with a conventional fund, and must go through the same due-diligence process -- but the firms will look more closely at how many jobs they are expected to create and what kind of benefits, like health insurance, they plan to provide workers. 
 "That's one of our key metrics," said Rick Larson, managing director of SJF Ventures. "We need to see that employees can care for themselves and their families."

HEADLINE: Big Projects To Develop Natural Gas In Qatar 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE and HEATHER TIMMONS 

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell are expected to announce significant investments in separate natural gas projects in Qatar in the coming days, underscoring a vast and accelerating shift within the oil industry to capitalize on the growing demand for cleaner-burning fuels the world over, particularly in the United States.
 On Thursday, Exxon Mobil plans to sign an agreement with Qatar Petroleum to invest more than $10 billion to develop two new liquefied natural gas facilities in Qatar's prolific North Field, a person close to the negotiations said on Wednesday. Exxon Mobil owns a 30 percent stake in the project, called Qatargas II, and it would work on every aspect from producing the natural gas to building the so-called natural gas trains that would ship the gas after it is super-cooled into liquid form. 
 Most important, Exxon Mobil is expected to buy all the natural gas that would be produced once the project goes into operation in 2008, or about 2.8 billion cubic feet a day, for sale in the United States in a 25-year contract. That would translate to about 2.8 trillion British Thermal Units, or B.T.U.'s, the common measurement of the heating value of natural gas. In 2000, the United States consumed 22.8 trillion B.T.U.'s of natural gas. 
 Royal Dutch/Shell is expected to sign a $5 billion deal on Monday with Qatar's state-owned petroleum company to build one of the world's largest gas-to-liquid plants, which could use a relatively new technology to make cleaner-burning vehicle fuel from natural gas, people close to the deal said on Wednesday. Neither Exxon nor Shell would comment on the status of their negotiations with Qatar.
 Shell's investment would be the largest of any major oil company in gas-to-liquid, or G.T.L., fuel production. The technology produces an odorless, clear fuel from natural gas that works in diesel engines, but contains almost none of the pollutants that traditional fuels emit, like sulfur. The plant would also be built in Qatar's North Field and is expected to come online in 2009, producing 140,000 barrels of fuel a day.
 As industrialized countries struggle to reduce emissions, they are slaking their huge appetites for fuel with natural gas, which burns more cleanly than oil and coal. In the United States, demand for natural gas has rocketed as all the newest power plants have been designed to run on gas rather than other fossil fuels.
 But for much of this year, the American companies and consumers have had to grapple with the lowest supplies of natural gas in 25 years. Improved technology has permitted oil and gas companies to deplete gas reserves at a faster rate than before. At the same time, some large new reserves of gas in the United States remain off limits because of environmental protection efforts.
 Most industry experts expect domestic supplies of natural gas to remain tight for years to come. Crimped supplies have kept natural gas prices high most of this year, at or above $5 per million British thermal units. While that has pinched the economy, it has made expensive projects like those in Qatar economically feasible. And it has raised a host of questions about what dependence on foreign sources of gas would mean for the United States, given its overwhelming reliance on overseas sources of oil.
 Qatar, however, has been a staunch, politically stable ally of the United States. It has the world's third largest reserves of natural gas after Iran and Russia, and is negotiating with other foreign investors.
 Exxon Mobil already has other liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar that supply several countries. The South African company Sasol is constructing a 34,000-barrel-a-day G.T.L. plant in Qatar that is expected to come online in 2005. Together with ChevronTexaco, Sasol is negotiating with the government to build another 120,000-barrel-a-day G.T.L. plant.
 Gas-to-liquids technology is still new, but the move to reduce emissions could help advance the investments in Qatar, said Jamal Qureshi, an analyst with PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. 
 Analysts are also optimistic about G.T.L. plants because they are one way for producers to take advantage of so-called stranded natural gas fields, those too far from a pipeline to export economically.
 "The G.T.L. business is turning into a very viable operation," said Bruce Lanni, an analyst at A.G. Edwards.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 17, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business yesterday about natural gas projects in Qatar misstated a term of Exxon Mobil's investment in one project. The company is entitled to 30 percent of the gas, not all of it. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the amount of natural gas consumed by the United States in 2000. It was 22.8 trillion cubic feet, not British thermal units.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Slip After Some Earnings Reports Disappoint

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks declined slightly yesterday as third-quarter results from companies like General Motors failed to reassure some investors that profit growth in future quarters would meet estimates.
 Investors are "going to need an exceptional surprise to push the market higher," said Charles E. Stutenroth IV, who helps manage $25 billion at Fort Washington Investment Advisers in Cincinnati. "Investors are looking to see continued, sustainable growth." 
General Motors shares dropped after earnings from making cars and trucks plunged 91 percent. CarMax, the used-car retailer spun off from Circuit City Stores, declined after predicting that quarterly profits would fall short of forecasts. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.72 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,046.76. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 9.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 9,803.05. 
 The Nasdaq composite index lost 4.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,939.10. Intel limited losses in the index after it predicted that sales this quarter would increase as much as 22 percent.
 Five stocks declined for every three that advanced on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.47 billion shares changed hands, 11 percent above the three-month daily average.
 More than half the members of the S.&P. 500 will release results this week and next. I.B.M. and Apple Computer reported earnings after exchanges closed. Their shares showed little change in advance of the reports.
 Benchmark indexes bounced between gains and losses as some investors said that stocks already reflected the increase in third-quarter profits.
 "Good earnings have been so strongly anticipated that the market doesn't get the benefit," said Michael J. Vogelzang, who helps manage $3.9 billion as president and chief investment officer for Boston Advisers in Boston. "The market is going to find it tough to grind out a lot higher for now."
 Profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose 17.3 percent, on average, for S.&P. 500 companies, according to a Thomson Financial analyst poll. That was up from an estimate of 13.5 percent at the beginning of July. Profit will rise 22 percent this quarter, Thomson Financial said. The S.&P. 500 has jumped 19 percent this year.
 General Motors fell 42 cents, to $43.55. It reported third-quarter net income of $425 million, earning 19 times as much from its finance arm as from selling cars and trucks.
 CarMax declined $6.94, to $32.31. The company said that third-quarter earnings would be hurt as higher-than-expected wholesale used-car prices crimped profits and sales. Earnings will be 16 cents to 18 cents a share for the period ending Nov. 30, down from an earlier profit forecast of as much as 21 cents a share, it said.
 Rowan, which runs oil and natural gas rigs, lost $1.62, to close at $24.16. The company said third-quarter profit rose 14 percent, less than analysts' estimates, as Gulf of Mexico drilling and manufacturing and aviation results were less than expected.
 Computer-related stocks rose after Intel reported better-than-expected earnings. Intel rose 68 cents, to $31.76. 
 Shares of chip equipment manufacturers like Applied Materials and Novellus Systems advanced after an industry group said that global sales of equipment rose 5.7 percent in August, the first gain in five months. Applied Materials added 70 cents, to $21.60, and Novellus gained $1.12, to $38.54.
 SanDisk gained $3.21, to $78.65, after it said that third-quarter profit more than quadrupled. Sales doubled to $281.4 million.
 I.B.M. declined 16 cents, to $92.74. After the exchanges closed, it said that third-quarter profit increased to $1.79 billion, or $1.02 a share, matching the average estimate from Thomson First Call. Earnings were helped by acquisitions and a 17 percent increase in services revenue.
 Apple added 27 cents to close at $24.82.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
 Treasury bond prices moved lower yesterday, sending yields to five-week highs as retail data suggested that economic growth in the third quarter might have surpassed already lofty forecasts.
 The downturn for bonds began when a mild dip in September retail sales was accompanied by large upward revisions to August and July.
 The benchmark 10-year note declined 13/32, to a price of 98 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 4.40 percent from 4.35 percent on Tuesday. And the 30-year bond declined 16/32, to 101 9/32. Its yield rose to 5.29 percent from 5.25 percent.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 4-week bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.932
High Rate: 0.870
Coupon Yield: 0.889

HEADLINE: The High Cost Of Staying in Iraq 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Holding Our Noses," by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Oct. 15):
 It seems to me that Mr. Kristof is suggesting that we not only hold our noses, but that we also cover our eyes, ears and mouth so that we see, hear and speak of no evil that we are doing by staying in Iraq. 
 Mr. Kristof believes that not financing the occupation in Iraq "would destroy the Iraqi economy and convince many wavering Iraqis that we are conquerors who are best dealt with by blowing us up." But it is too late for that. It has already happened -- and will continue to happen as long as we stay in Iraq.
The mistrust and hate felt for Americans will not be changed by building electric plants and phone lines (although they are badly needed). If we get out of Iraq now, or if we get out of Iraq five years from now, the catastrophe that Mr. Kristof speaks of will certainly occur.
Iraq will disintegrate whenever we get out. The political and religious factions in that country will prevent anything else from occurring. We must get out now.

BYLINE:  By Jane Allande-Hession (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
 The state's unemployment rate fell last month for the second consecutive month, as nearly 6,000 new jobs were created. The New Jersey Department of Labor reported yesterday that the September jobless rate was 5.8 percent, down from 5.9 percent in August and 6.1 percent in July. 
The nationwide rate in September was 6.1 percent. The state labor department said 5,700 jobs were created last month, more than 90 percent of which were in the private sector, mostly in trade, transportation and utilities. But manufacturing employment remained unchanged. Peter Saharko, a spokesman for the New Jersey department, said that the state had gained 31,800 jobs so far this year, compared with a nationwide loss of more than 300,000 jobs.

Unheard Voices on Planning New Trade Center

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
THE faces staring up in horror that morning from the streets of Lower Manhattan were every color. So were the faces staring out from the "missing" fliers around the city. But the hands drawing the plans for the new World Trade Center are almost all white.
 What may have been lost in the transition are voices; voices that might have questioned basic assumptions about a program in which skyscraping commercial development is to accompany the memorial, cultural and open spaces; voices that might have asked whether a public domain under tight control is truly public. 
 "It does make a huge difference," said J. Max Bond Jr. of the architectural firm of Davis Brody Bond. "No one really took exception to the program, in a profound sense. If there had been a greater variety of people, someone would have questioned the program."
Studio Daniel Libeskind was chosen to plan the trade center site in a competition involving design teams that had been invited to participate by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. White men predominated among the teams, as they do in the architectural profession generally.
Mr. Bond, who is both black and an eminence grise in architectural circles, said he was not simply advocating a planning process that would have included more minority architects but one that would have included more participants of all kinds -- poets, philosophers and artists.
"The rush to get to a building almost inevitably set up a process that was exclusive and elitist," he said.
His colleague Richard H. Franklin, the managing principal at Davis Brody Bond, who worked 17 years in the trade center with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said a more inclusive process would not have taken any more time and "could have been much more engaging and much more healing."
Public space offers perhaps the clearest example of how a different process might have yielded different results. Many designs for the site called for gardens, shops, museums, restaurants and viewing platforms on high floors or at the top of buildings. But Mr. Bond said any space under strict scrutiny was not universally welcoming.
"It's always been difficult for young blacks, for young Hispanics, for anyone who looks aberrant to get access to the upper realms of Wall Street towers," he said. "For a city of immigrants, the public realm is more than ever now the street. If I'm a Dominican kid and my immigration papers are not quite right, I'll never go up there because I'll never dare show my fake ID.
"All these public spaces are going to be like shopping malls: privately controlled. You won't be able to wear a T-shirt that says, 'Down with Ashcroft' because that will be viewed as hostile or threatening."
Mr. Bond also questioned the premise of new skyscrapers. "There's a macho thing that keeps coming out: we should build a building that tall to show them," he said. "Not everyone shares that sensibility. It's a particularly male, Western sensibility.
"I'm not saying people of color are wiser. But women, people of color, gays, immigrants have all had to look at themselves. They have experienced the underside of society in a much more profound way.
"Architecture inevitably involves all the larger issues of society."
What frustrates Melvin L. Mitchell, who wrote "The Crisis of the African-American Architect: Conflicting Cultures of Architecture and (Black) Power" (Writers Advantage, 2003), is the failure to acknowledge this broader context.
"For black architects to be in on the World Trade Center, they've got to do it in conjunction with black political and cultural New York," Mr. Mitchell said. "They've got to make the case that they're the arm of a much bigger community that has to be involved in the economic and social development of Lower Manhattan."
THOUGH not often eulogized as such, the twin towers were regarded by some as beacons of diversity, in part because of the presence of so many small, port-related international businesses.
In his hometown of St. Louis, Mr. Franklin recalled thinking when he stepped into an elevator in an office building, "I'm the only one" -- that is, the only black person in the car.
He contrasted that with his first visit to the trade center in 1985, when he was being interviewed for a project management position at the Port Authority.
"In this elevator, it was like I was at the U.N.," he said. "There were black women. There were white women. There were Chinese. It was like, wow, where am I? Every country in the world was in that car."
Roberta Washington, an architect whose office is on West 125th Street, fondly recalled her trips to the trade center. She was supposed to have been there on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, at a meeting with Port Authority officials. (Her colleague, Jumaane Stewart, went instead and managed to escape as the first plane hit the tower.)
"It was a place that was part of my life even though I live in Harlem," Ms. Washington said. "It didn't belong just to star architects. Everyone should have the opportunity to contribute to what happens on that site."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Official Is Named President of New York Fed 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Timothy F. Geithner, an International Monetary Fund official with experience in financial crisis management, was named president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York yesterday.
 The job makes Mr. Geithner, 42, a crucial player in the formulation of interest rate policy in the United States and a point man for crisis management for the domestic and international financial systems. He is expected to join the Fed in the middle of next month. 
 On monetary policy, Mr. Geithner will be vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, where Federal Reserve policy makers decide whether to raise, lower or leave unchanged their benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate.
His bank is the operational arm for carrying out the Fed's monetary policy and also does the buying and selling of foreign currencies when the government intervenes in the foreign exchange market. The Fed is also a bank regulator.
But the most important job, in the view of many, is the president's role as a crisis manager. The bank "is kind of the eye on the market and has been critical in dealing with financial market problems when they arise," said E. Gerald Corrigan, a former president of the New York Fed and now a managing director at Goldman Sachs.
In this vein, the New York Fed was involved in efforts to reopen the bond market after the terrorist attack in September 2001 and at the center of the effort to avert the 1998 collapse of the giant hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, when that firm's trades threatened the smooth functioning of the bond market.
For this job, Mr. Geithner comes with experience gained during his tenure in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration under the Treasury Secretaries Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers. He was at Treasury during the emerging-markets crisis in 1997 and was under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs from 1998 to 2001. He played a significant role in the negotiation of assistance packages for South Korea and Brazil.
He worked on changes in what is called the international financial architecture in an effort to reduce the risk of financial crises. That work included helping to form the Financial Stability Forum, which brings together government officials, regulators and private individuals from around the world.
"The big role of the Fed president is crisis management and he has been baptized by fire," said C. Fred Bergsten, director for the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Mr. Geithner's appointment, which was made by the board of the New York Fed and approved by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, comes after a nine-month search and the dropping out of at least two leading candidates. He succeeds William J. McDonough, who was president from July 1993 until he stepped down in June. Jamie B. Stewart, the New York Fed's first vice president, was interim president of the bank.
"I'm honored to be selected for this post and to work with an institution that is central to domestic and global financial stability," Mr. Geithner said in a statement. He was not available for further comment, according to a spokesman for the New York Fed.
Peter Peterson, the chairman of the New York Fed's board, said, "I'm pleased Tim Geithner will be at the helm; he'll do a great job."
Mr. Geithner, Mr. Peterson added, "is admirably equipped to confront the unique domestic and international challenges that will face our financial system over the coming years."
In his current job at the I.M.F., Mr. Geithner is the director of the policy development and review department, which approves the fund's financial programs and works on its crisis management. At the Treasury, he was the first career civil servant to be appointed under secretary for international affairs. He joined the Treasury in 1988 and had several jobs, including assistant attache at the United States Embassy in Tokyo.
Mr. Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates from 1985 to 1988, after receiving an M.A. in international economics and East Asian studies from the John Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in 1985. He obtained his B.A. from Dartmouth College in 1983.

HEADLINE: CHINA IN SPACE: THE OUTLOOK; 
Milestone for China: Dragon Has Landed

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
The technology is vintage Kennedy and Khrushchev, the secrecy is reminiscent of the cold war and the popular reaction is a bit of a fizzle, but China's seemingly successful effort to put a man into orbit is a sign that it intends to become a peer of the United States.
 The goal may still be 50 years away, but the direction is clear. Technologically and militarily, China is determined to retrace the steps that made the United States the world's unmatched superpower. 
 Sending a man into orbit in a capsule only slightly modified from the Russian Soyuz seems almost quaint when Russia has all but abandoned its space program as uneconomical and the United States is debating the utility of manned space flight after the second explosion in its troubled shuttle program. 
But to listen to the addresses on Wednesday by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and the military chief, Jiang Zemin, is to be reminded of schoolteachers lauding the virtues of Latin. China will only become a great power, they said, if it can show that it grasps the roots of modern science and technology.
"The symbolic significance outweighs the strategic value of this mission," says Lei Yi, a historian at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "It is meant to show that China is arriving as a scientific and technological power."
The Shenzhou mission is part of a broader push for international recognition that also prompted China's prolonged and highly emotive campaigns to play host to the Olympics and join the World Trade Organization, which were also successful.
Unlike those efforts, though, putting a man into space gives China bragging rights to a scientific achievement that only two other nations have equaled. European countries and Japan have discussed manned space programs but never followed through. India has space ambitions but lags behind China in both rocket and satellite technology.
Catching up with the West has been a national obsession in China since the 19th century, when British cannons and light infantry demolished a hopelessly ill-equipped imperial army and later contributed to the collapse of the Qing Dynasty.
Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and now Mr. Jiang and Mr. Hu, a succession of Nationalist and Communist leaders who otherwise have little in common, all emphasized the urgency of acquiring or recreating the technological hardware that they see as essential to modern development and military security.
Shenzhou 5 is just the most recent in a string a technological achievements that have in fact made China a regional power, if still not yet a true peer of the United States. China has had nuclear weapons for nearly 40 years. It has had its own satellites in orbit since the early 1970's. It has intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach America's heartland.
Its main strategic focus is relatively modest, to eventually regain full sovereignty over Taiwan. China also seeks to maintain regional stability so that it can continue to develop its economy.
But in the longer term the military is seeking to project force beyond its shores and into the heavens. A big motivation for spending billions of dollars on manned space flight, Chinese scientists say, is to develop the ability to fight outside the Earth's atmosphere, which could be critical in the competition with the United States, especially if Washington deploys space-based missile defenses.
China's newly appointed leaders are themselves engineers and technology enthusiasts. Mr. Hu, trained as a hydrologist, looked like a physics student at a science fair as he wandered through the control center on Wednesday. The Shenzhou mission seems certain to prompt a fresh round of government investment in civilian and military technology.
But the leadership's efforts to mimic foreign technology have often been clumsy and incomplete, in part because officials reject Western politics and social norms -- the software -- as threatening to Communist rule.
Chinese science tends to be top-down, and the giant bureaucracy often stifles innovation. China has not yet developed a viable commercial aviation industry, for example. As with its space program, China's navy and air force still depend heavily on dated Russian technology.
Most important technology projects are treated as state secrets today, much as they were during the cold war. Even the most basic details of the manned space program, like the names of astronauts, were not disclosed until the launching took place. The merits of putting men into space is not discussed openly at all. The lack of publicity left many Chinese unprepared, and notably underwhelmed, by the event.
Though China now has the world's sixth-largest economy, some scientists reckon that it ranks far below that in technological sophistication. He Zuoxiu, a physicist at the Chinese Academy of Science,says that as a percentage of its overall economic output, China devotes far less to scientific research than the United States or Japan and often neglects its most pressing needs, like energy, to pursue vanity projects.
"People should not have the misperception that this launch makes us a scientific power," Mr. He said. "There are certain reasons for becoming one of the countries in outer space, but from a scientific standpoint there may well be more pressing areas that need investment."
But while the United States is fighting a global campaign against terrorism, China is posing a different challenge. It is taking pages from the American playbook, laboriously and expensively recreating the technology that it believes will sooner or later make it a first-world power.

HEADLINE: 2 in House Question Halliburton's Iraq Fuel Prices 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Two senior Democratic congressmen are questioning whether Halliburton is overcharging the United States government in the procurement of gasoline and other fuel for Iraq, which is now importing oil products to stave off shortages.
 In a letter sent yesterday to the White House Office of Management and Budget, the two lawmakers, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California and Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, contended that "Halliburton seems to be inflating gasoline prices at a great cost to American taxpayers." 
 "The overcharging by Halliburton is so extreme that one expert has privately called it 'highway robbery,' " the letter said.
According to the two lawmakers, Halliburton has charged the government $1.62 to $1.70 a gallon for gasoline that could be bought wholesale in the Persian Gulf region for about 71 cents and transported to Iraq for no more than 25 cents. The fuel was sold in Iraq for 4 cents to 15 cents a gallon, the letter said. 
A spokeswoman for Halliburton, Wendy Hall, declined to address the specific calculations that Mr. Dingell and Mr. Waxman used in their letter, saying that the company's KBR unit, which is working in Iraq, "continues to negotiate fair and competitive prices to provide fuel to the Iraqi people."
"We used a sound procurement process which has been approved by the government for procurement activities," Ms. Hall said in a statement sent by e-mail. "We awarded the fuel acquisition contract to the suppliers who could meet the requirements defined by our client." Halliburton's client is the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
The accusation is the latest to roil an already contentious Capitol Hill consideration of how the money to rebuild Iraq is being spent. President Bush has asked Congress to approve an $87 billion supplemental financing package for Iraq operations, and about $20.3 billion of that would go to reconstruction projects. Many Democrats and some Republicans have said that the reconstruction so far has been plagued by waste and noncompetitive contracting.
Halliburton in particular has been the focus of much criticism because its contract to make emergency repairs to Iraq's oil industry was awarded by the Pentagon without competition and the industry remains hobbled, mainly by sabotage and looting, months after the main fighting of the war was declared over.
A spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, Trent Duffy, said the Waxman-Dingell letter was under review. "We need to have a conversation with C.P.A. in Baghdad," Mr. Duffy said, referring to the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American-led civil administration in Iraq. "They're on a different time schedule, so we need a little more time."
Iraq, which has the third-largest oil reserves in the world, is producing at roughly half its prewar level of about 2.5 million barrels a day. Its refineries have been stymied by power failures, pipeline sabotage and the general degradation of the oil industry after more than a decade of United Nations sanctions. Starting in late April and at times during the summer, lines for gasoline clotted the streets of Iraq's biggest cities, especially Baghdad, and stoked widespread resentment among Iraqis already grappling with the breakdown of basic services.
As a result, the oil ministry and the coalition authority began importing gasoline and other fuel late in May from neighboring countries like Kuwait, Turkey and Jordan.
The extra $20.3 billion the Bush administration has asked for includes $2.1 billion for the Iraqi oil sector. A little less than half that would go to buying gasoline, cooking gas, kerosene and diesel fuel for Iraq, at a cost of about $4 million a day, Mr. Duffy has said previously. The rest of the money would go to repairing the industry.
At the heart of the Congressional Democrats' accusation is the difference between the wholesale price of gasoline in the Persian Gulf region and the price they calculated that Halliburton charged the Corps of Engineers for the gasoline it brought into Iraq.
Based on information that Mr. Waxman's office obtained from the Corps of Engineers, Halliburton received $304,486,577 to import 191,965,150 gallons of gasoline into Iraq as of Sept. 18. That would come to $1.59 a gallon on average, the letter said. Halliburton's contract calls for the government to cover costs and pay a profit margin of 2 percent to 7 percent, which would bring the price of gasoline to $1.62 to $1.70 a gallon.
According to the Congressional Research Service, the letter continued, the average wholesale price of benchmark Arab Gulf gasoline from April through September was about 71 cents a gallon. Industry experts who Mr. Waxman's office spoke to said it should cost no more than 25 cents a gallon for Halliburton to transport gasoline by tanker-trailers from neighboring countries to Baghdad. That would leave at least 66 cents a gallon unaccounted for, based on the Dingell-Waxman letter.
Iraqis pay the equivalent of 4 cents to 15 cents a gallon for gasoline, which means that American taxpayers are footing the bill for bringing oil into Iraq.
One answer for the disparity may be the cost of renting the trucks, or of paying drivers who are worried about entering a turbulent Iraq, said George Beranek, manager of market analysis at PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. Still, Mr. Beranek and other industry analysts said that the difference between the wholesale price and the price the letter says Halliburton charged was puzzling.
Mr. Waxman and some industry analysts also questioned why the Iraqi State Oil Marketing Organization did not take the lead role in obtaining the gasoline, given its long experience with importing and exporting oil and other petroleum products.
"The basic thing that Halliburton has to answer is why this high price," said Walid Khadduri, editor of the Middle East Economic Survey, a Cyprus weekly newsletter specializing in the oil business. "That's way above market price and they have to justify that."

HEADLINE: Seeing Windfall, Council Speaker Seeks Property Tax Cut for Elderly 

BYLINE:  By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
The City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, tossed a political knuckleball to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday, proposing that the city use $110 million in unexpected revenues to cut property taxes for elderly residents on fixed incomes.
 Mr. Miller described the windfall as "found money" from the last fiscal year that surfaced only recently as a result of tax audits. And he said it should be used to partly roll back the 18.5 percent property-tax increase imposed this year. Because applying the tax break to only one class of taxpayers would require legislative approval in Albany, other Council members raised the alternative possibility of granting it to all property owners. 
 Either way, the reduction would represent a small fraction of the $1.7 billion that the tax increase is expected to bring in annually for New York City, which is facing a projected budget gap of $2 billion next year. It was unclear how many homeowners would benefit and by how much, and the speaker had few details to offer.
What is more, Mr. Miller said his proposal hinged on the city's prevailing in its court battle with the state over a debt-refinancing plan that would add $500 million a year to the city's coffers. Without that legal victory, he suggested, the city's finances might not allow for a tax break.
"This all essentially assumes that the governor fails in his attempts to take $500 million away from the city," Mr. Miller said.
For all its caveats, the speaker's proposal had the effect of turning the tables on Mr. Bloomberg, who for months has been voicing his desire eventually to repeal the tax increases enacted this year.
While reaping the political benefits of talking frequently about tax cuts, the mayor has not signaled that he is ready to seek them; his budget director recently asked city agencies to find $300 million in new spending cuts.
Council members clearly relished seeing the mayor in the position of splashing cold water on a plan to reduce property taxes, as Mr. Bloomberg's spokesman, Jordan Barowitz, did in a written response to Mr. Miller's proposal.
"To look only at the revenue side of the budget equation is like listening to one hand clapping," Mr. Barowitz said, adding that Mr. Bloomberg was nevertheless "encouraged that the speaker shares the mayor's desire to reduce property taxes.
"As the fiscal year moves on, and we have a clearer picture of the city's finances and are better able to make realistic policy proposals, we look forward to having the Council's support on this matter."
Earlier in the day, before Mr. Miller made his announcement during a news conference at City Hall, Mr. Bloomberg sought to address a growing sentiment in some quarters that a brightening fiscal outlook should lead the city to loosen its budget belt. The mayor warned against acting too quickly.
"We are not going to put ourselves in a position of spending monies that we aren't reasonably sure are going to come in," he said. "Anybody that thinks our money problems are over is sadly mistaken."
Although Mr. Miller's announcement was somewhat low-key, coming at the end of a news conference on other legislative matters, his proposal generated a buzz in City Hall, largely because of the political freight it carried.
It came three weeks before the City Council elections and a few days after Mr. Bloomberg angered Council Democrats by endorsing Mr. Miller's Republican opponent. Council members said they believed that the mayor had pledged to support them in next month's election in return for their vote for his property tax increase.
The proposal also followed news that the city would receive at least $300 million more in taxes than was expected in the first quarter of the fiscal year, and that Wall Street securities firms were predicting record-breaking profits this year, meaning greater corporate- and income-tax revenue for the city.
Mr. Bloomberg also said yesterday that the city had struck a deal to collect $700 million in back rent for La Guardia and Kennedy Airports. The city had already factored that money into its budget, but the announcement eased any doubts that the cash would be collected.
Almost all the $110 million that forms the basis of the speaker's proposal came from audits of individual and corporate taxpayers during the last fiscal year, which ended in June. Because it was not budgeted, the money is available for other uses.
"We said all along that if the economy improved and tax collections are more than anticipated, we would consider rolling back a portion of the property tax increase," said David I. Weprin, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee. 
Councilman Tony Avella, a Queens Democrat who voted against the property tax increase, said he would like to see the $110 million surplus returned to the community, either by using it to reduce the tax or to restore services like library hours that were shortened and firehouses that have been closed.
Budget watchers counseled against using what Mr. Miller acknowledged was a one-shot infusion of revenue to enact a tax cut that would take $110 million out of the city's budget annually for years to come. "It's really important not to take a windfall and assume it will continue one year to the next," said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency.
Mr. Miller said he expected that the increased tax revenues and improved business climate now being predicted would provide enough money to pay for the tax cut, which he said would "send a message" that the city was committed to reducing the tax burden for New Yorkers.
"We need to move discussions away from budget cuts that will further curtail vital services," he said. "We have to first and foremost preserve vital services, as we have done. And secondly, we have to lookto return some money to the taxpayers that they deserve."

HEADLINE: Saudi Arabia's Big Leap 

BYLINE:  By Kenneth M. Pollack; Kenneth M. Pollack is director of research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and a former director for Persian Gulf affairs at the National Security Council.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia's announcement on Monday that within a year it will hold elections for municipal councils could be the first tremor in a slow-moving Middle Eastern earthquake. 
 First, some caveats. We don't have all the details yet and, as things often do in the Middle East, this might not live up to its advance billing. A year is a long time away. The initiative might get derailed. The elections may not be as fair and free as promised. We do not know if women will be allowed to vote. And it is only a baby step toward addressing vast structural flaws within the Saudi system. 
 But still, the Saudi announcement is potentially a very big deal, and the cynics should take note: more so than even the pluralist maelstrom in Iraq, moves toward democratization in Saudi Arabia could have ripples throughout the Middle East. 
In fact, because Saudi Arabia is the most conservative of the Arab states, Riyadh's decision to start a process of democratization, no matter how gradual, is already beginning to force many Arabs to rethink where the tides of Middle Eastern history are headed. As long as the Saudis keep moving down this path, no matter how sluggishly, it will be hard for the other countries of the region not to follow. The other governments will have no answer when their people ask why, if the Saudis can adopt more pluralistic political institutions, can't they as well?
What's more, such reforms are the only way to deal with the two major threats that the United States faces from the dysfunctional Saudi system. The first is that Saudi society has become an important contributor to violent terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. Osama bin Laden himself is Saudi, and he has found many of his recruits among his disaffected young countrymen. And, knowingly or not, many wealthy Saudis -- including, probably, members of the royal family -- have contributed to Islamic charities that were fronts for terrorist organizations. 
The second threat is that much of the anger and frustration that makes Saudi Arabia a fertile recruiting ground for Osama bin Laden have also made Saudi internal politics increasingly volatile, raising the specter of a violent upheaval. As long as Saudi oil production remains a linchpin of the global economy, we cannot afford an Islamic revolution there. Even if civil war or a fanatical new regime did not shut Saudi oil production altogether, either might result in a reversal of the high-production, low-price oil policy that the Saudi royals adhere to. This would set off recessions around the globe.
Both of these threats spring, at least in part, from a common source: more than any other Arab state, Saudi Arabia is in desperate need of comprehensive political, economic, social, legal and educational reform. The economy is faltering badly, which in turn has meant that the kingdom can no longer afford the profligate ways of the royal family or the cradle-to-grave social welfare system erected during the fat years of the 1970's and 80's. The Saudi educational system is useless, emphasizing the humanities and Islamic studies at the expense of science and mathematics. Because of its reliance on rote memorization, even college graduates have few marketable job skills. Saudi Arabia's decrepit legal system is distorted by xenophobic strictures, like laws limiting foreign investment, and is undermined by abuses by the royal family. 
The result is that unemployment probably exceeds 30 percent, and among males in their 20's -- the talent pool for terrorists and revolutionaries -- it is probably even higher. No job means no income, no dignity, probably no wife, no sons and no place in Saudi society. Many of these angry young men focus their wrath at the autocratic Saudi regime, for not addressing these problems and for giving them no legal method of redress, and at the United States, for supporting that regime.
The only way for the Saudis to get at these deep-seated problems is through modernization, and that process has to start with the political system. Until there is greater transparency, accountability and participation in the political process, Riyadh will not be able to deal with the corruption and inertia that have paralyzed the economy and society. And as long as the royals are seen as running the kingdom purely for their own benefit, those preaching violent change will find plenty of willing executioners. 
So what can the United States do to see that Monday's announcement actually leads to something significant? 
First, we should endorse it, but not trumpet it. Crown Prince Abdullah, the leading reformist in the kingdom, and his supporters need to know that America appreciates what they are trying to do. Likewise, the opponents of reform among the royal family and the bureaucracy need to understand that Washington will hold accountable anyone who impedes change. However, the United States can't be seen by the Saudi public as embracing the effort too tightly -- Saudi demagogues would no doubt make political hay by claiming that anything America favors must be bad for Saudi Arabia.
Second, we may need to hold the Saudis' feet to the fire. We must make sure that electoral progress continues and is not an excuse for backsliding in other areas: legal reform, foreign ownership of Saudi businesses, educational reform and others. Yet Americans should keep in mind that the pace of reform is likely to be slow (if only because everything is slow in the kingdom) and that this is actually good for us and for them. As F. Gregory Gause III, a Saudi expert at the University of Vermont, has pointed out, if we could magically create democracy in Saudi Arabia tomorrow, we would probably find Islamic fundamentalists elected by overwhelming margins. It will take years of political liberalization before enough moderate political leaders emerge to offer an alternative to the Islamists and the regime.
In addition, we should come up with measures that might remove other pressures on Riyadh. Crown Prince Abdullah and his supporters will be loath to push electoral reforms if they face other problems at home. We could start with quiet conversations between Bush administration officials and members of the Saudi government to get a better feel as to how we can help them. For example, one good reason (among many) for the United States to work more vigorously with the Israelis and Palestinians is that the Saudi population's anger over the Arab-Israeli standoff has made the Saudi leadership cautious of taking actions that they expect could be unpopular.
But above all, we have to stay focused on our long-term priorities: shutting down terrorist financing and recruitment, supporting the reconstruction of Iraq and pursuing Saudi internal reform. Too often, we have saddled the Saudis with a host of other demands, from financing our pet projects (like Bosnian reconstruction) to purchasing expensive American military equipment, to lobbying members of the United Nations Security Council on our behalf. The more we press the Saudis on unpopular secondary issues, the slower they will move on terrorism and reform. And in the end, those are the issues that really endanger American interests and lives.

In the Old Cities, Bitterness and Fleeting Joy

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THERE is bitterness in Chicago today, with no redemption for the ancient franchise on the North Side.
 Alas, there is no reprieve for the horrified Cubs fan with the long arms, who will be blamed forever when, really, it was the Cubs who failed and the Marlins who succeeded. 
 Sometime tonight -- undoubtedly very late tonight -- there will be sorrow in another old baseball city, and joy in a third.
After enduring 24 hours of anguish over a dreadfully botched game Tuesday night, Chicago was knocked off last night by the arriviste Florida Marlins, 9-6, as the Cubs were once again denied their first pennant since 1945. 
Now it is time for either Boston or New York to ache. One of these two old protagonists will advance to the World Series, of which the Yankees have won 26 since the Red Sox last won one.
It had to come back to Roger and Pedro. 
The last time they met, allegedly grown men fought on the field and in the bullpen. Nobody wants any more of this buffoonery, but the tensions and the dust-ups have made for compelling baseball in the ballparks and in front of television sets and radios. 
As a consequence of yesterday's 9-6 victory by the Red Sox at wind-swept Yankee Stadium, Pedro Martinez of Boston and Roger Clemens of New York -- formerly of Boston -- will pitch tonight in yet another resumption of the ancient morality play. 
Both league championship series have been a thousand times more compelling because of who these old teams were. The fans shared these histories as they huddled and shivered elbow to elbow in chilly ballparks yesterday. 
In war and peace, generations of fans have suffered (or, in the Yankees' case, generally celebrated). In boom and recession, fans have taken the Green Line to Fenway Park, built in 1912; the Red Line to Wrigley Field, opened in 1914; and the D or No. 4 trains to Yankee Stadium, which opened in 1923.
The Marlins, by contrast, play in a square pastel stadium blatantly tailored for football, reachable by automobile. In every way, the Marlins were outsiders in these glorious days of baseball destiny.
Much is made of football's hold on the weekend attention span of America at this time of year. But baseball has been holding its postseason carnival every day for two full weeks. The television ratings say that the nation has been paying attention.
Hunkering in the dugout yesterday with a thick gray sweatshirt hood over his head was Pedro Martinez. He will be pitching to win, but he also needs to repair his image, which was tarnished last Saturday when he fired pitches at the Yankees, gestured and threatened, then tossed the onrushing 72-year-old Yankee coach, Don Zimmer, to the turf.
The brawls in Boston last Saturday and the bitterness in Chicago toward the hapless fan who reached for a catchable foul ball Tuesday have touched off a sense that all of us take this stuff far too personally. 
Yesterday, the Yankees had the august Bob Sheppard make an announcement asking the fans to respect one another "no matter what colors they may be wearing" and asking them to "root hard, have fun -- and be safe." Sheppard's voice sounded like a command from on high. And when Trot Nixon hit the home run that clinched the victory, Boston fans stood and cheered, and nobody mugged them.
The old cities quaked with the plots and subplots. The fans know all about long failures in Boston and Chicago, things that happened before any of the current players were born. It is one thing to yammer on about the ancient jinxes that afflict these hallowed teams representing two of America's greatest cities. It is quite another to watch bad things happen to them in public. 
There was Nomar Garciaparra, the superb Boston shortstop, fumbling a soft grounder yesterday to bring about two unearned runs. Ultimately he had four hits and scored two runs to disrupt the obsession in Boston over his slump. 
Fans in Chicago were screaming about the fan who reached for the foul ball that was heading into the stands in the eighth inning Tuesday. Normally, I am all for the weird curses and hexes, but in this case, I want everybody to lay off the guy. He was merely a civilian, unprepared to have the ball, the game, perhaps the season and probably even history, looping directly toward him.
What was the excuse for Chicago's shortstop, Alex Gonzalez, who booted a potential double-play ball that led to an eight-run rally by the Marlins? Who told the bullpen to give up all those hits? Baseball has a weird way of turning around, inning by inning, day by day.
The Red Sox, facing elimination yesterday, turned it around at the looming fortress in the South Bronx, the House That Ruth Built. The Red Sox have been perceived as having a more toxic curse than the Cubs' for having dispensed Babe Ruth to the Yankees. None of this history had much impact on the scruffy athletes with shaven heads who perform for the Red Sox. The reality is that the Yankees and the Red Sox will meet for a record 26th time this season. Pedro and Roger, all over again. 
While Chicago wallows in grief today, there is no guarantee that Boston can avoid the same disillusionment. These long streaks of suffering did not happen totally by accident. Baseball is having a terrific run of suspense and mood swings. There were no promises of redemption for these venerable franchises.

HEADLINE: THEATER GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show. + means discounted tickets were at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights. ++ means discounted tickets were at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only.

Broadway

* "AVENUE Q." The inspired brainchild of the songwriters Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx, this canny toy chest of a musical takes its stylistic cues from "Sesame Street," from its cheery urban set to its singing puppets of assorted colors and dispositions. And in doing so it becomes the first mainstream musical since "Rent" to coo with such seductive directness to theatergoers on the fair side of 40 in their own language, in which irony is less a mind-set than a loosely worn style. Directed by Jason Moore, with a book by Jeff Whitty, the show applies the coaxing, learning-is-fun attitude of children's educational television to the R-rated situations of postcollegiate life in the big city. Featuring a pitch-perfect ensemble of live performers and oversize hand puppets, "Avenue Q" is to "Sesame Street" what Mel Brooks's "Producers" is to vintage Broadway musicals: a connoisseur's tribute to what it only seems to send up (2:10). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $91.25, with a limited number of $21.25 rush tickets by lottery at the theater at 5:30 p.m. for the evening show and at 11:30 a.m. for the matinee (Ben Brantley).

*++ "GYPSY." Playing a role that few people thought would ever fit her and shadowed by vultures predicting disaster, Bernadette Peters has delivered the surprise coup of many a Broadway season. This beloved eternal daughter of the American musical has taken on that genre's most daunting maternal role: Momma Rose, a part cast in bronze by Ethel Merman more than four decades ago. Directed by Sam Mendes, Ms. Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career. In bringing new sensuality and self-awareness to Rose, Ms. Peters breaks the Merman mold but without distorting the near-perfect shape of a show assembled by the magical team of Arthur Laurents, Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim. As a whole, Mr. Mendes's production may seem disappointingly status quo. But the brassy glories of the score and much of Jerome Robbins's original choreography are here to be savored as the stunning Ms. Peters casts new and haunting shadows on a familiar landscape. The fine supporting cast includes John Dossett and, in the title role, the coltish Tammy Blanchard (2:45). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $101.25, with a limited number of $25 student rush tickets available Monday through Thursday evenings (Brantley).

++ "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS." In the desperate, tourist-courting world of cultural appropriation on Broadway -- which has given us stillborn aberrations like "Saturday Night Fever" -- this bland revival of the 1982 musical does not rank as a major offender. It is directed with silky efficiency by Jerry Zaks. Howard Ashman's droll, cliche-bending lyrics and book -- about a florist's nerdy assistant who befriends a people-eating plant -- remain in place, as does Alan Menken's gleeful 1960's-pastiche score. There is also an array of personable, professional young talent, headed by Hunter Foster, Kerry Butler and Douglas Sills. Yet the show has been stripped of the urban grit and parodic wit of the downtown production of 21 years ago. The overall effect is, if not exactly pleasurable, then pleasant. As an exercise in recycling, the principal industry among Broadway producers now, this "Little Shop" suggests the conversion of sharp, shiny tin into something closer to Teflon (2:00). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $56 to $96 (Brantley).

*+ "TAKE ME OUT" (Tony winner for best play). Playing a socially challenged money manager named Mason Marzac, Denis O'Hare (Tony winner for best featured actor in a play) shines with the gloom-dispelling wattage that comes when a first-rate actor meets a role he was born to play. When Mason talks about baseball (yes, baseball) in Richard Greenberg's comic drama, directed with verve by Joe Mantello (Tony winner for best director), the show emanates the dewy, delirious passion of a "Boheme" for the ESPN set. This story of pride and prejudice in professional sports, seen at the Public Theater last fall, has been advantageously shaved and streamlined for its Broadway incarnation. But in tracing the impact of a godlike baseball player (the perfectly cast Daniel Sunjata) who declares his homosexuality, Mr. Greenberg winds up sacrificing fully developed characters and plotting to Ideas with a capital I. Those notorious shower scenes remain, just so you know. Yet it is Mr. Greenberg's infatuation with baseball, ecstatically channeled by Mr. O'Hare, that makes this a show to cheer about (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66 to $81 (Brantley).

Off Broadway

*+ "BECKETT/ALBEE." When Brian Murray and Marian Seldes get together in a play by Edward Albee, they seem to levitate like Astaire and Rogers. The easy elegance, the polished technique, the playfulness and the passion have been buffed to a high gloss in "Counting the Ways," Mr. Albee's blithely serious portrait of a marriage. Mr. Murray and Ms. Seldes perform a funny, deliberately stylized pas de deux that suggests a melding of Noel Coward and Samuel Beckett. In the show's first half, they take on Beckett himself in three short plays ("Not I," "A Piece of Monologue" and "Footfalls"). And it should be noted that they don't wear Beckett's tatters with quite the same assurance that they wear Albee's party clothes. But the evening offers a fascinating counterpoint of two playwrights of shared sensibility and contrasting styles (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $65, with a limited number of $20 student tickets available at the box office on the day of the performance (Brantley).

* "THE HARLEQUIN STUDIES." Bill Irwin's sweet, silly and sharp-witted anatomy of the clown figure from commedia dell'arte suggests that every comic working today should call the long-lived Harlequin "Papa." Mr. Irwin and a nimble ensemble of actors-cum-acrobats spring out of trunks, fall from the skies and are improbably packed into small suitcases, evoking everyone from Charlie Chaplin to Jim Carrey along the way. The show, which begins a season of Mr. Irwin's work from the Signature Theater Company, may not be the most accomplished work to date from its creator, the inspired silent clown of "The Regard of Flight" and "Fool Moon." But there is an endearing openness and generosity about the production, which features Rocco Sisto and Paxton Whitehead as well as five younger clowns-in-training. And in an anarchic and uncertain world, Mr. Irwin confidently locates a special, enduring kind of anarchy that pulls form out of chaos (1:15). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, (212) 244-7529. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Brantley).

+ "LIVING OUT." Lisa Loomer's play tries hard to apply the conventions of the 30-minute sitcom to a two-hour play with serious intentions. The situation is knotty, complicated and all too familiar. Ana Hernandez (Zilah Mendoza), a young Latina in Los Angeles, works as a nanny for Nancy Robin (Kathryn Meisle), a young Anglo lawyer. Social and emotional complications pile up. The time Ana spends with Nancy's daughter means she has scant time for her own son. Nancy starts to fear she knows less about her own child than Ana does. The two women are forced into a kind of intimacy, but class and nationality impose a still greater distance. Ms. Loomer has an eye for the topical, and an ear for laugh lines. The production, directed by Jo Bonney, is sleek and moves quickly. But when more depth is required, the writing fails and the direction falters (2:15). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, (212) 246-4422. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55, with a limited number of $10 student rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance (Margo Jefferson).

* "MATT AND BEN." A superior brand of Hollywood bashing, written and performed by two young actresses, Brenda Withers and Mindy Kaling, this deliciously spiteful comedy sends up the movies' naked emperors in general and Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in particular. The two actresses play the title characters on the very brink of their fame, but in this version of the story, "Good Will Hunting" wasn't written by Matt and Ben; it literally fell, a manuscript fully composed and wrapped in brown paper, from the ceiling in Ben's apartment. The play depicts the two guys as competitive knuckleheads: Ben (Ms. Withers) is the vacuous good-time guy, Matt the unbearably earnest do-right. As they debate whether to take their gift from the movie gods as their own, the play makes intermittent flashbacks to tell their history. It's as sophomoric a plot setup as can be, but the play succeeds because as writers and actors, Ms. Kaling and Ms. Withers have a fine deadpan sense of both the absurd and the vicious (1:30). P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. Mondays through Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m. Tickets: $25, Mondays through Thursdays; $30, Fridays and Saturdays; $18 tickets with student identification (Bruce Weber).

+ "THE NIGHT HERON." Deception, betrayal and assorted acts of violence are enlisted in the pursuit of poetry, of all things, in this new offering from the exciting young playwright Jez (Mojo) Butterworth. Set in a shack in the Cambridgeshire Fens, the play follows the self-sabotaging attempts of two unemployed gardeners (Chris Bauer and Clark Gregg) and an ex-convict (Mary McCann) to win a cash prize for best poem. At the same time, they are searching for rhyme and reason in a brutal, random universe. That their chances of succeeding are heartbreakingly slim doesn't keep them from being a very entertainingset of losers. Directed by Neil Pepe, the production is stronger on comic surface than tragic depths, and the play ultimately chokes on its own ambitions. But it offers a bracing testament to the strength and originality of Mr. Butterworth's theatrical imagination (2:20). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Brantley).

*+ "OMNIUM GATHERUM." This lively surreal satire, about a celebrity-studded dinner party given by a fluttery Martha Stewart-like hostess, turns out to be something more than a glib intellectual lampoon. Line by line, "Omnium" -- written by Theresa Rebeck and Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros -- doesn't provide much that's new. The weighter subjects under discussion, which range from American imperialism to the roots of terrorism, have surely been pondered by every thinking American since Sept. 11, 2001. But though it unfolds as a point-counterpoint debate, the play never feels merely schematic. Tragedy and triviality, ponderousness and pettiness are mixed into a salad so deliriously tossed that you can't separate the individual ingredients. The strength of the play, energetically staged by Will Frears, is in its sloppiness, a sense that orderly boundaries -- even between the living and the dead -- have been blurred into chaos. The endearingly manic Kristine Nielsen leads the vibrant cast (1:30). Variety Arts Theater, 110 Third Avenue, at 13th Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 (Brantley).

Last Chance

"THE DUTCH HEART OF MAN." You know this guy, right? That big lug with the killer's mitts and the little-boy-lost expression? He's been hanging around as long as actors have been wearing dirty T-shirts on stages and screens, always unaware of his own clumsy strength and searching for a good woman's love. This gentle giant shows up as a construction company employee named Dutch in Robert Glaudini's new play. Played by Salvatore Inzerillo, he talks to himself more than his predecessors did and has more foul-mouthed friends. Otherwise, he could slide right into a black-and-white movie of 50 or 60 years ago. This well-acted exercise in blue-collar deja vu, directed by Charles Goforth, is a production of the exciting Labyrinth Theater Company (1:30). Shiva Theater, Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7 p.m. Tickets: $25, with a limited number of $15 tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance (Brantley).

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Weekender Germantown, N.Y.

BYLINE:  By KATHRYN MATTHEWS 

 BODY:
THE charms of Germantown are not immediately apparent. A cluster of modest homes, auto-body shops and an imposing public school dot the brief stretch of Route 9G that runs through the center of the township. At the intersection of 9G and Main Street, three gas stations compete, evoking the feel of a strip mall more than a rural idyll.
 But wend west toward the Hudson River or east into the hills, and the landscape that emerges in Germantown -- about two hours north of Manhattan in the southwest corner of Columbia County -- is the one that inspired the 19th-century landscape artist Frederic Edwin Church to build his estate, Olana, a few miles up the road. 
 "Our view is the money shot that everyone talks about -- when the sun sets behind the Catskills, it creates a mystical backlighting that is impossible to experience elsewhere," said Michael Pierce, an architect based in Manhattan, who, with his wife, Elizabeth Dougherty, a freelance art director, lives part time in Germantown. "You can't get it in Rhinebeck, in towns beyond Hudson, or across the river in the Catskills." 
Mr. Pierce and Ms. Dougherty had not planned to buy a house in Germantown. But the sweeping backyard vistas of the Hudson and the Catskills from the house, which was built in 1890, lured them, and they bought it in 2001 as their third home.
Germantown, settled in 1710, was a farming community for most of its history. "When I was growing up, Germantown was known for their apple, pear and cherry trees," recalled Margarite Riter, 77, Germantown's historian. Few of the orchards remain. Today it is primarily a bedroom community, with many of its full-time residents commuting to government jobs in Albany, Kingston and Poughkeepsie.

The Scene
All over town, weekenders and full-time residents live side by side, with large private houses sometimes adjacent to trailer homes. Though there is not much social crossover, relations are generally friendly, and no one is putting on airs. "Everyone dresses the same," Mr. Pierce said of the low-maintenance dress code -- pullovers, khakis and rugged footwear.
Germantown's affluent weekenders -- among the residents whose comings and goings attract neighborly curiosity are Sonny Rollins, the jazz musician, and Pierre Levai, the director of the Marlborough Gallery -- tend to be reclusive. But even they are likely to venture into the Central Market on Main Street, which is also the center for town news and gossip.
Last year, Central's longtime owner, Lee Filiberti, went into partnership with Gary Capetta, a commercial real estate broker, and Nick Jones, a marketing and events specialist, who both patronized the store after buying their riverside weekend farmhouse in 1998. They have upgraded and expanded the store's inventory. It's like a "mini Balducci's," Mr. Pierce said.
For the most part, finding entertainment or dining out means leaving Germantown, which has no restaurants. There is plenty of music, theater and dance about 15 minutes away in Hudson or at the new performing arts center at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson.

Pros
Weekenders extol Germantown's relaxed style and low-key sensibility. "There's no pretension or hysteria here," said Susan Seidel, an art dealer from the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "If I wandered into Central Market with clumps of mud in my hair from gardening, nobody would look twice at me."
Residents have good access to the Hudson. There are two free public boat launching sites: Cheviot Park and the larger, more popular Anchorage in North Germantown. Fishing is allowed at both.
Outdoor enthusiasts find plenty to occupy them. Two state historic sites, the Moorish-style Olana and Clermont, once the home of the Livingston family, are open year-round and have trails for hiking and cross-country skiing. Hunter and Windham Mountains, with downhill skiing, are a half-hour drive away, and there is swimming at Lake Taghanic State Park, a 15-minute drive to the east.
Germantown's hill-and-dale terrain attracts cyclists, who loop around the pretty country roads. "It's almost a semiprofessional sport around here," Mr. Pierce said.

Cons
Two plants on the Hudson directly across from the town -- Glens Falls Lehigh Cement in Cementon and St. Lawrence Cement in Catskill -- break the otherwise ideal river view. Of concern to many Germantown residents is Glens Falls Lehigh's plan to expand operation up to 8,760 hours a year, which received final approval from the New York Environmental Conservation Department on Oct. 3. "This translates into 24 hours a day, 365 days a year," said Larry Osgood, vice president of the recently formed Germantown Neighbors Association.

The Real Estate Market
Property values have steadily increased about 8 to 10 percent a year since 1991, according to Ralph Delpozzo, owner of Ralph's Country Realty in Germantown. This year he expects a 20 percent jump from 2002, despite the slow economy. Properties that were priced at $200,000 and $400,000 a year ago are now 20 to 30 percent higher, he said.
Strong demand has limited the housing stock. There are 15 properties listed, with prices ranging from $147,000 to $1.5 million. They include 10 three-bedroom houses, with an average asking price of $315,000. What is available tends to sell in three to six months, said Patricia A. Hinkein, who owns an agency under her name in Germantown.
Though styles run the gamut, from farmhouses to contemporaries, most people seeking second homes hope to own an old house on several acres with stellar views. Riverfront properties, especially, are in high demand but short supply.
Increasingly, scarcity has caused more people to buy land for building. "There's been a real upsurge in new construction over the past two years," Ms. Hinkein said. "With few exceptions, Germantown zoning requires that lot sizes be at least one to two acres. However, most lots are much larger these days, reflecting a desire for privacy, particularly among existing second-home parcels and new construction."
Her listings includea 1,856-square-foot, three-bedroom village Victorian, circa 1900, on a third of an acre in the village center, for $170,000; a two-story, two-bedroom log contemporary on 3.6 acres with Catskills views, for $375,000; and a 3,600-square-foot, five-bedroom 1830 center-hall colonial on 3.5 acres, with a stream, for $500,000. Another is a 5,000-square-foot, six-bedroom 1755 stone house once owned by the Rockefellers. On six acres, it has two barns and country views and is next to a 144-acre bird sanctuary. It is offered at $1.2 million.

What's Next? Skyboxes?
 Seeing a show on Broadway can be exciting, glamorous or, frankly, boring, but it is rarely comfortable. Long lines, cramped seats and crowded restrooms are not what most people would expect with a $100 purchase, but that's the reality in most of Broadway's historic houses. 
 Last night, at the first preview of Richard Greenberg's "Violet Hour," the audience at the elegantly renovated Biltmore Theater could expect to sink into wide camel-colored chairs with high wood backs. Any latecomers stuck in the lobby wouldn't have to crane their necks to eavesdrop behind closed doors because they could watch the drama on video monitors on three different floors. 
At intermission, customers could walk down a wide aisle toward the spacious new restrooms below the orchestra level or the smaller ones on the upper level.
"From the very beginning, we wanted to give audiences a comfortable, hospitable experience," said Barry Grove, executive producer of the Manhattan Theater Club, which has taken over the Biltmore. "We don't want them to just come for the play. We also want them to enjoy the theater." With multiplexes offering La-Z-Boy-size seating and sports stadiums packed with corporate skyboxes, today's theatergoers expect more upscale amenities with their entertainment.
Some theater owners have adjusted with the times. At the Imperial, the Shubert Organization expanded the restrooms and upgraded the seats (still not as luxurious as those at the Biltmore) before last night's opening of "The Boy From Oz" (review, Page 1 of Weekend).
While it's unlikely that skyboxes will replace the cheap seats on Broadway, the new Biltmore does have an exclusive Patron's Lounge on the second floor, where donors of $1,500 or more receive free wine and coffee, not to mention access to their own private restrooms.
The Roundabout Theater Company's American Airlines Theater and the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center offer similar perks, but they cost more: $2,000 to enter the Beaumont's Sondra and Charles Gilman Jr. Patron's Room, or $1,750 for the privilege of drinking wine and munching on Oreos and Fig Newtons in the Roundabout's Nabisco Lounge.

'Taboo' Scramble
Is there a show doctor in the house? There is at the Plymouth Theater, where "Taboo" is scrambling to get ready for opening. Yesterday, eight days before the scheduled first previews, the producer, Rosie O'Donnell, has brought Jeff Calhoun, the Broadway choreographer ("Bells Are Ringing," "Annie Get Your Gun") and sometime director (the recent revival of "Big River," the 1994 revival of "Grease"), on board as a "choreographic consultant." Is this a sign of trouble for the $10 million musical? For now, no one's talking. "It speaks for itself," said John Barlow, the show's press representative.

Send In the Stars
" 'Inside the Actor's Studio' as a musical" is the way Glen Roven described "Singular Sensations," a weekly series of conversations with musical-theater greats that begins on Nov. 3 at the Village Theater. In a collection of weeklong runs, Mr. Roven, a veteran composer and musical director, will talk to stars including Carol Channing (Nov. 3 to 9), Elaine Paige (Dec. 8 to 14), Betty Buckley (Jan. 5 to 11), Mickey Rooney (Jan. 12 to 18) and Cy Coleman (Jan. 27 to Feb. 1), each of whom may occasionally interrupt the interview and break into song.
In other openings, Tony Randall's National Actor's Theater's next production will be "Right You Are," Pirandello's philosophical comedy (with an abbreviated title). Written four years before "Six Characters in Search of an Author," the play follows a mysterious family who move into town, inspiring speculation among the neighbors. Mr. Randall stars. Previews begin on Nov. 25 at the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University in Lower Manhattan.

Doll Gets a Chill
Randall L. Wreghitt, a producer of the ever-gestating Broadway production of "Paper Doll," has a problem. And it's not just the recent dropout of a valued investor, which forced the show to postpone its opening, scheduled for Dec. 8, for the second time. (The play was originally supposed to come to Broadway last spring.)
Currently, his most pressing problem is a small Off Broadway drama called "Frozen" at the MCC Theater that is threatening to steal away the valuable time of his star, Swoosie Kurtz. "Frozen," by Bryony Lavery, also starring Ms. Kurtz, starts rehearsals on Jan. 26 and begins previews one month later for a seven-week run. If Ms. Kurtz is to going to fit "Paper Doll" into her schedule before "Frozen," Mr. Wreghitt will have to raise some money fast.

Teary-Eyed Comics
And then the laughter stopped. After 23 years and more than 8,500 performances, the downtown comedy institution Chicago City Limits is calling it quits. Paul Zuckerman, an original cast member of the improv troupe and its artistic director, broke the news to the cast in a teary meeting last Friday.
"We were five months behind on rent, and Con Ed was threatening to discontinue service," Mr. Zuckerman said. "The hole just got bigger and bigger, and I couldn't dig anymore." Mr. Zuckerman blamed the economy, which since 9/11 has slowed group sales and the influx of cash from corporate entertainment. The last show is to be on Nov. 2.

Not All Is True
Two stars of the small screen, Erika Alexander ("Living Single") and Phylicia Rashad ("The Cosby Show"), are to appear in "The Story," Tracey Scott Wilson's new play about journalistic ethics (and the lack thereof), opening at the Public Theater on Dec. 10.

Small Courses, Heavy Hitters

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
TOM DIXON tossed his ball in the pond, the one by the statue of the giraffe. That's how frustrated Mr. Dixon, a former rodeo rider and long-haul trucker, was by his abysmal score of 40 in his morning's round of the Masters National Pro MiniGolf Championship. "If one of them doesn't work for me, it's history," he said. 
 Serious stuff, minigolf. At least at the Masters, being played on the greens of the 18-hole Hawaiian Rumble course on a stretch of Highway 17 just north of the resort town of Myrtle Beach, S.C. Don't confuse it with that other Masters in Augusta, Ga., a few hours' drive to the south. Actually, there's not much chance of that, since even a child knows the difference between golf and minigolf. The volcano is the first clue. 
 On any normal day, the 40-foot-tall faux Mauna Loa at the Hawaiian Rumble course belches smoke and, every 20 minutes, erupts with roaring pyrotechnics. Bob Detwiler, the gray-haired impresario of the United States Pro MiniGolf Association and, not coincidentally, owner of the Hawaiian Rumble and two other area courses on which the championship was played, said the eruptions might distract the players so "we turned it off." The volcano just smokes, sulking. 
Some 50 minigolfers from around the neighborhood -- and around the world -- have come here to play for a title that might make people unfamiliar with this world scratch their heads in bemusement. They are playing for a minipurse -- a $4,000 first prize -- tip money compared with the more than $1 million Mike Weir took home for winning Augusta's Masters earlier this year.
Still, winning this Masters is special. "Right here -- this is it," Mr. Dixon said. And it's about more than the money, Mr. Detwiler said. "We have a green jacket like they do at Augusta." Then he paused. "It's not a sports coat. It's a windbreaker, with gold lettering. It is green." 
For those who haven't played a round lately, it may come as a surprise, but miniature golf is anything but small these days. And what folks in this world tend to refer to as "big golf" has been struggling recently, with the number of rounds played dropping to 502.4 million last year from a peak of 518.4 million in 2000, according to the National Golf Foundation. New course development has fallen by nearly 50 percent in the same period.
But minigolf has boomed: Major tournaments make it onto morning television and minigolf organizations worldwide are making a credible run at getting their sport into the Olympics. Meanwhile, course-development companies are feeling flush. Harris Miniature Golf, a company that designs and builds courses, said that business has been strong even through an economy that has hammered other markets. "We've been steady for the last four or five years," said Sophia Disney, the company's marketing director, with as many as 50 new courses a year being built. 
Builders like Joe Rogari, vice president of Mini-Golf Inc., which can put one in for as little as $15,000, say business is up as much as 60 percent since 1997. "Sometimes when the economy is bad, it might help us a little bit," Mr. Rogari said, because "people are always looking for an inexpensive recreational activity." Minigolf, he noted, can be an alternative to that "Caribbean vacation or a cruise."
But the field is anything but peaceable. No fewer than three professional organizations run tournaments, and none has much use for the others. "We all have different goals and different objectives," said Paul Hemingway, head of the Professional Miniature Golf Association, a network for course owners. Joseph Aboid, commissioner of the Professional Putters Association, with courses that resemble putting greens, put it this way: "Putt-Putt is a game of skill, and miniature golf is a game of chance -- it doesn't take much skill to have a ball go into an alligator's mouth and come out on the other side."
That's a bit unfair, since Mr. Detwiler's offerings are pretty sophisticated compared with the wacky courses of yore. There are no windmills or seals standing between the players and the hole these days; just obstacles like a strategically placed stone that forces a bank shot, or the undulations of a course that can drop more than 30 feet from tee to hole. The kitsch hasn't been banished completely -- it's just been moved to the sidelines, as in the statues of zoo animals and the waterfalls at the Hawaiian Caverns course, also owned by Mr. Detwiler, or the dancing hippos that grace the Fantasia Gardens course at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. 
Though many "big" golfers still disparage the mini game, fans of the new short courses say they actually help improve their putting skills. That's what attracted John Asher, an avid golfer from Paris, Ky., who made this Masters his first tournament. "It's like they say: 'drive for show, putt for dough,' " he drawled.
Lane Helms, from Holden Beach, N.C., who drove 40 miles to join the tournament, agreed. "It's helped my regular golf game a lot," he insisted, standing under a Tiki hut near a giraffe statue. The owner of a garage-door company, Mr. Helms was making his fifth appearance at the mini Masters. "I guarantee" -- stretching out each syllable, pronouncing it gare-on-tee -- "it's just as competitive out here as in big golf." And besides, you can play a round in just 45 minutes. 
Elsewhere on the course, an 8-year-old sprite named Olivia Prokopva popped the golf ball along the green carpet with a surehandedness that seemed preternatural. She is a favorite in the minigolf world who has traveled from her home in the Czech Republic throughout Europe and the United States. A bona fide mini prodigy, she swept the juniors division of the United States Open in 2002 and 2003 and the Masters National Championship in 2002, and won third place over all in the women's division at the U.S. Open in 2003. "That little child is phenomenal," the tournament director, Bo Taylor, said.
Olivia wore greatness lightly, and sized up the shots with cool calculation, guided by an entourage that included her trainer; her father, Jan Honza Prokop; and her younger brother. Mr. Prokop brought over her scrapbook with newspaper clippings that show Olivia is a celebrity back home: score cards and tournament programs, photographs of her on the family's basement putting green, and with Czech entertainers and the nation's president, Vaclav Klaus. 
The European players approach the game with a fixedness of purpose that can unnerve the more happy-go-lucky Americans. Members of the Swedish team that has taken the world championships in Europe included the sunburned Hans Olofsson, from Stockholm. At Hawaiian Rumble, he carefully scanned each green, planning the shot and executing with near-mechanical precision. When he made a tough putt, like one that required banking the ball off the brick border of the green for a hole in one, he raised his putter into the air in quiet triumph, an all but inaudible "Yah" escaping his lips.
Karl Lakos, a tall, tough-looking Austrian, stared at the ball so hard that it was a little surprising it did not burst into flames. "They take their miniature golf truly, phenomenal serious," Mr. Taylor said.
Many of the American competitors, on the other hand, balance their competitive drive with a taste for the pleasures minigolf has to offer. In Myrtle Beach, those include the panorama of beachwear stores, tacky restaurants and billboards for strip clubs that line Highway 17. "This is what our boys are fighting for in Iraq," said Peter Gilchrist, who came in from Boothbay Harbor, Me., with his wife, Nancy. He was kidding, sort of. 
AT the end of the last round, Olivia was on the last hole and suddenly developed a killer case of the yips. The girl who sank a hole in one on the Hawaiian Caverns toughest green -- the one with three drops and an acute-angled left turn that only five other players have ever gotten in a single stroke -- took five strokes to sink a relatively straightforward putt. For a moment, she actually looked her age, pouting and fragile and very vulnerable. A lesser 8-year-old would have stormed off; actually, a lesser 8-year-old would have lost interest in the game after the first round. Her trainer stood by, chagrined. Her father, sitting on a bench across a pond, shouted encouragement, or maybe something else. And then he rested his forehead against his hands.
Meanwhile, Mr. Dixon played the ball off of a gentle rise at the left so that when the course doglegged to the right, the ball curved around and down toward the hole as though it were looking for it. He smiled; this ball wasn't going in any pond.
Still, he was having problems. In his previous competitive career on the rodeo circuit, Mr. Dixon said, he broke every bone in his body, including his neck -- twice -- while very large animals kicked him in the face, stepped on his back and, fairly regularly, threw him to the ground.
Now, with the skies over Myrtle Beach brooding with rain, his bones were aching. His doctor recommends he have an operation to relieve strain along his spine. But he would rather put it off. "I'm trying to stay away from surgery," Mr. Dixon said. "This is my season."
But not, in the end, his day. 
After 14 rounds, Mr. Dixon finished in 30th place, at 522 strokes for the total 252 holes, 75 strokes out of the money. Olivia did slightly better, with a total score of 511. That was good enough to take the juniors division, and to put her in 23rd place over all, 64 strokes behind the eventual winner, Danny McCaslin of Morrisville, N.C. Mr. McCaslin, who works as a waiter and bartender at an Olive Garden restaurant, triumphed over his nearest rival, Mr. Olofsson, by five strokes. It was Mr. McCaslin's second championship win -- he took first place at the U.S. Open in May. But he shrugged off any pretension about the title. All it meant, he said, was that he was the national champion -- "of something."
"You know," he added, "you've just got to keep it all in perspective."

No Price Bubble in Region's Housing, Study Concludes

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
It's not a bubble, so it won't burst.
 That, essentially, is the conclusion of an economic study of the current housing market in the New Jersey, New York and Connecticut region by two professors at Rutgers University. Using the home-price plunge of the late 80's for comparison, they have calculated that price increases for single-family homes in the region in the last five years have not been excessive. 
 The report, "Housing Bubble or Shelter -- Safe Haven?" states: "The regional housing market is not about to suffer a collapse. The bursting of the housing bubble in 1988 will remain a subject of history, not a predictor of our housing future." The study was written by James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, and Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at the Bloustein school. 
In the 1980's, Dr. Hughes said in an interview, "We did have an extraordinary ratcheting up of housing prices and then a very severe price setback during the '89-'92 recession."
Between 1983 and 1988, home prices in New Jersey rose by 109 percent, the report found. In Connecticut, they jumped by 120 percent. In New York, because of a stagnant economy upstate, the increase was a more modest 76 percent. Those increases far outpaced the national rate of 37 percent.
"They were not sustainable," Dr. Hughes said. And in the ensuing recession, they retreated 7.8 percent in New Jersey, 18 percent in Connecticut and 4.5 percent in New York.
It would take until 1998 in New Jersey and New York and 2000 in Connecticut for home prices to climb back to their 1988 peak. "What that suggests," Dr. Hughes said, "is that economic wild parties are followed by prolonged hangovers." Those calculations do not account for a 32 percent rise in inflation between 1988 and 1998, meaning that in real dollars, prices in 1998 remained 30 percent below their 1988 peak.
The study goes on to point out that price increases in the last five years have been far more modest than those during the five-year bubble of the 80's. In New Jersey, they increased by 52 percent between 1998 and 2002; in New York, by 53 percent, and in Connecticut by 44 percent. By comparison, housing prices across the nation increased by 38 percent in the same period.
So the current price gains were far less than those in the 1980's, the report found. And the gap between the three states and the nation was considerably smaller. "Therefore," Dr. Hughes said, "it's hard to make a case, at least on a statewide basis, that the price increases of the last five years have been excessive."
The study then addressed the factors that have supported the price rises of the last five years. "No. 1 is that by 1998," Dr. Hughes said, "the financial position of many households was bolstered by stock market gains, whether it was their 401(k)'s or even if they just owned mutual funds. Given that supposed financial security, people were willing to spend more on housing." 
At the same time, mortgage interest rates dropped from 8 percent in 2000 to 5.5 percent in 2003 -- a 45-year low. Then, in March 2000, the stock market plummeted. "And that made housing even more desirable," Dr. Hughes said. "It was seen as the safe port in the economic storm."
The report concludes: "All of the gains in housing-purchasing power as a result of interest-rate reductions in the current market probably have been made. So upward pressure on prices is bound to diminish."
